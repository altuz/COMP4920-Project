I'll try to be as vague as possible to avoid potential spoilers.\n\nPro:\n\nBeautiful\nImaginative\nBranching story paths\nSome moments of truly brilliant dialogue\n\nThe main 'con' that I have with the game is that a lot of the choices seem to give you some real freedom to choose your destiny, but the endgame is always the same. 'Go to the ____'. Okay; all of my other choices have been centered around fixing relationships and coming together, but the endgame has to be the same self-centered fairy tale despite everything I've done up to this point? I don't have the option to change anything, really. Relationships are repaired just for uncharacteristic (for the arc) behavior from Cinder.\n\nI really, really loved this game at first. I liked a lot of the options, and seeing a classic story from a different perspective. But in the end, it really seems like they're trying to force you into the same too-small glass slipper, and it doesn't feel good at all. Fixable, but branches should branch; not wrap back around to the exact same dialogue as if characters still hated you.", "timestamp_updated": 1506460881, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506460836, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35115441", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500659", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501561988, "steamid": "76561197969880352", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Based on the recommendations I was expecting something more like Long Live the Queen - a visual novel, but with RPG aspects and way more depth.\n\nNope, Cinders is just a visual novel, plain and simple.\n\nIt's a genre I'm not terribly interested in. But as far as it goes Cinders does have a fairly high production value: the music is good, the visuals are nice.\n\nThe core problem with it is that it's mostly a retelling of Cinderella. What little embelishments there are don't make up for that lack of originality. You already know the overall plot before it begins. And already knowing most of the story makes it very hard to care about anything that happens along the way.\n\nI'd say Cinders is worth the time if you're super into visual novels, but everyone else can move along.", "timestamp_updated": 1506033965, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506033965, "votes_down": 6}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 238, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 27, "total_reviews": 265}}
