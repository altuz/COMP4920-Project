It has wonderful art. I wish there were stuffed animals of the people, they\u2019re so damned cute. Its biggest sin is that it can feel reptitive, but I had a blast playing it in short spurts.\n\n\nYou play as the Ranger, who comes to a small town to help rescue children during their harsh winters. Over the course of 15 years, you can build relationships, rescue kids, and explore the dangerous wintry forest surrounding the town.\n\nThe game is a roguelike both in the procedurally-generated forest-dungeon and the fact that if you die, you have to restart from the beginning. Other than that, it\u2019s primarily a puzzle game, where you match and combine objects, conserve your Energy (ie, HP) and attempt to rescue all of the children each year \u2014 or at least enough to justify your continued employment. As you build relationships with the townspeople, you\u2019re gifted special items that buff you, sometimes at a price.\n\nOne of my favorite things about the game was that the NPCs and the Ranger themselves are also generated differently each time you play. Each NPC has a variety of skin- and hair-color options, as well as different names, that make the town seem vibrant and inclusive. The Ranger\u2019s appearance and gender are determined by how you play and the way you interact with the townspeople; I had fun creating all different looks. It\u2019s also the complete and utter opposite of this, which is amazing.\n\nThe writing itself was whimsical and sad, with a good sense of humor and was generally atmospheric and enjoyable.\n\nI initially started trying to save every child in the forest, but after only getting as far as year 7 after a ton of playthroughs I finally decided to play through til the end (and in terminal years, it\u2019s possible for the kids to die while you\u2019re out there, so doing a full playthrough where you save everyone must be ridiculously difficult). Once I decided to let children suffer for my benefit, it only took me two tries to get the full fifteen years.\n\nAs I said, the game can get repetitive. If you\u2019re the kind of person who likes to sit down for marathon gaming sessions like I do, this isn\u2019t really suited for that. But what it was great for was when I had 30 or 45 minutes at a time to kill. I\u2019d play right before bedtime and then by the next night I\u2019d be like, \u201cAlright, time to save some kids, let\u2019s do this.\u201d Which is all you could really ask for from a game like this, I think.\n\nOh \u2014 and I actually played this with the sound on! I thought the music and effects were nice and contributed to the atmosphere as well.\n\nAll of that said, the full retail price of $15.00 is insane. I got it for $5 during the Steam summer sales and that was an entirely fair price. I might even pay $9.99 for it, but $15 is ridiculous for the 11 hours of gameplay I got out of it.\n\nI also thought it was odd how long some of the loading screens were, especially in the town. I could see a long delay while it was loading the level, but I\u2019m not sure why simply going in and out of my house took as long as it did.\n\nFinally, I was a little disappointed we didn\u2019t get more worldbuilding. I specifically wanted to know more about the Ranger \u2014 why were they a Ranger? Why did they only have 15 years to live? \u2014 but more about the town would have been nice, too. I felt like the game teased a bigger world and then never followed up on the promise. The title juxtaposed with the Ranger\u2019s mysteriousness in particular implies that they\u2019re doing something extraordinary, but we never find out the details of it. I didn\u2019t want a novel, but some in-dialogue revelations would have been nice.\n\nOverall, though, this was a really nice game. Next time it goes on sale, definitely pick it up.", "timestamp_updated": 1496258728, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496258728, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 114, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 27, "total_reviews": 141}}
