Fun on a bun. Bun bun fun fun barrel with friends.\n\n\nPractice with the bots, and then invite your friends over to crush them until they catch up.\n\nOr spend time analyzing the game to take down your friends strategically:\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the human character is far more powerful than the monsters. The monsters have to run, hide, and perform various shenanigans. Without good strategy, the monsters get killed and the human character can get super far ahead at the beginning. But as a direct response to the human character getting ahead, the monsters become stronger. The balance shifts to the reverse; the monsters are now the powerful ones, and the human character now has to be more creative, and inevitably, they will succumb to the gradual loss of health that is the life of a rogue-liker. Now, a less powerful human player takes the wheel, and they will most likely get killed by the most powerful monster (the weakest human player), gradually balancing the game while leaning towards the more skilled players.\n\n\nThere are two things that are wrong with this. One is that there is exactly one strategy that works at a certain given time; you either run and hide, or charge relentlessly, and it has an obvious curve; the less powerful you are, the more sneaky you should be. No other strategy will lead you to success. \n\nAnother is that it isn't always the most powerful monster that kills the player; sometimes, like in other games, there are people who sneak in for the last hit without doing much of the damage at all. This means that the one that camps far away and sneaks in a blow when the player is at low health is the one that gets the reward.\n\n\nTherefore, in order to kill the human and become the human (which gives you the lead), you have to stay behind the lines of other monsters until the human is at low health, at which point you act according to your level of power; if you're powerful, charge right at them to get the last hit in, and if you're a lower level monster, shoot at them with everything you have while staying out of the line of fire.\n\nThe meta can be advanced from here, but this is all you need to invite your friends over and crush them until they catch up.\n\nMore meta - The killing blow is the killing blow, no matter how small. This means that quantity over quality is what you want for your monsters. Anything with damage-over-time effects will be more likely to get you human status.\n\nIt's also not a good idea to kill the human early on - there are still lots of other monsters; you'll be cannon fodder. Wait for someone else to take the bait and then reap.\n\nNow invite your friends over, so that you can crush them. Then you should make a lot of tables and graphs, and then invite your friends over, so that you can crush them.\n\n\nPoint and laugh at your family as they struggle helplessly to kill your ever-stronger player character.

The gameplay kicks butt and is incredibly fun, the monsters and traps are delightful, and you can clock hours of play on it.  One thing I really appretiated was the very balanced system. The most levels that your opponents get as a human, the stronger your monsters get, as you collect spendable Wrath points from each of their levels. This ensures that, if one player is especially dominating as the human, the weakest player is allowed to catch up by giving them the strongest monster advantage, without weakening the other players.  The most recent add-on of scrolls has also been incredibly good, allowing you to steal items from other players. Items like these ensure that even the strongest players are not 100% safe and means that there is always a chance at redemption. This is a great game!\n\nP.S.
