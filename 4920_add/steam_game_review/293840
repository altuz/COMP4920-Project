Yeah at the time of writing this review ive played one hour but during that one hour i have faught and won many a battle, and used many a power up. The pick ups are what really make this game shine, the randomness of getting a minigun or an auto cannon can greatly affect how the game will play out later, the chance of getting the pick up which will allow you to become your worshiped plane is a CotW players dream. Another brilliant feature is the linear map design, which focuses the fight into key areas, but also provide multiple storeys of combat for you to fight upon, yet is obviously more suited to those who have acuired the bomb pick up. \nAt a bargin of \u00a31.74 during the summer sale i saved 75% on this baby, which is even batter.\n\nAnother great feature is the fact that this game is pretty much my entire life in a game, I too spend coutless hours running about with my arms outstrecthed, making both plane and gun noises, running around with my cardboard plane on, and also jumping from worring hights. This has lead to me having to visit A&E on multiple occasions with fractures in my leg, i also ran in to a wall and fractured my cranium whilst aspiring to become a plane. But you see this is why this game is so adequate for people like me, i now no longer have to injure my self, i can merely play the game to get the release that i need, Which at the age of 43 and a half is quite difficult to achieve.\n\n I just cannot wait for the sequel to this, just imagine jet fighters, using lock on rockets and other advanced weaponry to take down other plane enthusiasts, you just can't get enough of it can you. By using the word cult in the title those cheeky chappies at north of earth were just foreshadowing the popularity of this, though there isnt manny of us that now play this, we are devout followers to the end.\n\n\n\n\nI love you cult of the wind.", "timestamp_updated": 1434846434, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434846434, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "15867961", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504669", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1431854368, "steamid": "76561198058473103", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I'm sure it's a great game, I just can't find out whether it is or not considering there is literally no one playing.", "timestamp_updated": 1431854463, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431854463, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "13179116", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509963", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1421141567, "steamid": "76561198070726128", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Seriously, someone get this game, play it with me right now.", "timestamp_updated": 1417433423, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417433423, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "11378174", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502926", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1418180251, "steamid": "76561198031230022", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game is very fun... for about 5 minutes.
