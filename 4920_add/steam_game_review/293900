Will re-evaluate when I get a larger monitor. Would had liked a gamepad sensitivity bar in the settings to try to improve this\n\nTLDR: Pivvot gets most of the way there only to drop the ball and failing to deliver a compelling product. \n\nPros:\n+Audiovisually interesting\n+Xbox 360 controller support as well as two button mouse system\n+Local Co-Op\n+Multiple modes : ~Journey mode which spawns you at checkpoints\n                               ~Endless Mode\n                               ~Endless Expert\n                               ~Berskerk\n+The game changes orientation, as well as color, and tone ocasionally giving some much needed feeling of diversity and forcing you to stay on your toes on which way to go next to stay alive\n\nCons:\n- Impossible to have good granular control over short distances\n- Xbox 360 pad ineffective for the fast and non granular movement of the ball making it useless\n- Xbox 360 pad condemning players to die because of control issues kills Local-Co Op\n- Because of those control issues most of the modes are pointless\n-Not enough audiovisual filters and effects, and not enough variety in obstacles, game becomes very samey\n-Game can cause some degree of motion sickness from all the rotation, especially when you die constantly\n-No timer to respawn, or fast respawn button through the mouse, have to go and push enter or go click a tiny button\n\nTHE CONTROLS UGH : Pivvot could had been awesome if they tweaked the controls so that a tiny dash on the controller or a tiny push on the mouse button would move your ball by just a little. But your mouse inevitably moves in fairly large janky bursts unless you are applying constant rotation in which case it becomes unnoticable. \n\nNeeded more of what made the game interesting : It would had been a lot more entertaining if the music and the visual effects improved, enriched or otherwise had something happen to them the better you did, its not the case here. I would work much harder to make my game feel more trippy and atmospheric. \n\nConclusion: If you play with the mouse only and really get used to the controller limitations and really are fast with your two button action it is possible to play this game as intended. It is servicable but really falls short of its own potential and becomes a candidate for library removal pending more reviews on better fast clicker games", "timestamp_updated": 1506059012, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494598538, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "31675358", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472443", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494465698, "steamid": "76561198041949592", "num_games_owned": 1112, "num_reviews": 482, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!\n\nThis is an idie game.\n\n\n\n[h1]Interface/Menu/Settings[/h1]\n\nThere is a volume slidebar available.\nThere is a sensitivty slidebar available.\nAlmost any resolution size is available.\nYou can play fullscreen or windowed mode.\n\n[h1]About the game.[/h1]\n\nWell this is a very simple game.
