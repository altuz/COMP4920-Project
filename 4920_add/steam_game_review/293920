Six male and six female romances to pursue. It's a life sim!\n\nSpirited Heart is not a game I can really reccommend. I am a particular fan of life management style dating sims like this game but the way this game goes about it is more frustrating than rewarding and that's a pretty major black mark as far as life sims go. \n\nIt does have some good things though! Having options as far as protagonists goes is always nice and customization options help you feel connected to the protagonist. While you're only really get to choose between three different female it does change the art and some of the dialogue so there is some distintion between them. There are also a good variety of romances available and a way to get a \"good\" ending without romance at all which is nice if you're more in to the personal development side of the game.\n\nAlas, all those good things have rather striking caveats. The customization options are basically superflorous and just provide a few points in different stats that are helpful but ultimately minor all things considered. No matter what backgrounds you had or what choices you picked you always end up in the same place, artist, pauper, or princess. Worse is that really you should pick that background that gives you the best legup on your potential mate or personal goal ending (which varies between the three selectable characters) but starting the game you have no clue what skills you'll need or where you can find your target romance. Sure there are a good number of romance options and they all are pretty distinct and cute but your ability to encounter them is random - AND they change locations, like one who initially worked on the farm might decide to go off and pursue art and you have to know that's what they'd do and then get the stats to be able to get in yourself to continue the relationship. This problem is made worse by the time limit and the fact that if your stats get too high you can get the personal ending and ruin your chance to get the romance ending so you can't get your stats too high!\n\nEven discounting the romances entirely the method of stat and money gain is very random too. Everytime you play a little dice game to determine how well you performed and... Well it just gets irritating. Playing this game ends up being clicking to do different jobs and randomly gaining a bonus of a penalty and then spending the money you made on vacations to reduce your exhaustion and depending on what sort of vacation gain a few more stats all while hoping for some interesting random event to occur to provide a brief reprieved from the monotony.\n\nI think there is a decent life sim and dating sim here but they really need to add some more random events to make the extremely random nature of the game more tolerable. It would be nice also if after meeting your romance in their initial and second location you could find them more reliable - perhaps using a stat requirement that needs to be passed in order to continue the romance. Or perhaps gifts? Just some ideas.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin in this game is the price. Twenty dollars is a lot for this. If it were five or even ten dollars I think things would be far more excuseable. I reccommend passing on this title.", "timestamp_updated": 1494201106, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494197390, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32739004", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512285", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498396717, "steamid": "76561198134676469", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Having played the original demo for this game when it first came out, I'd forgotten about this game over the years.

The jobs systems makes little more sense. And plot? What plot!\n\nBut, at the same time, I'm enjoying this game purely from a nostalgia point of view.

While it is brought to Steam by Winter Wolves, there are some indications on-line that it might have been produced by another company. Though, whether simply a previous name, or a company acquired in some way... I am unsure.\n\nThing is, it has some of the hallmarks of a Winter Wolves game, though not as polished. The game has a sort of stat management, and leads to a myriad of endings. There is likely an ending if you don't acquire anything else by the time you reach 30, but otherwise... well, there are a lot of options. Let's start with that you can play as a human, elf, or demon girl of 18. There are a number of romanceable NPCs for you to pursue. Two of each race and gender. For those not willing to do the math, that means [i]12[/i] options, 6 male, 6 female. You can woo them by first meeting them in a basic job, and then in a separate advanced job (some of the romance options double up in the basic jobs, and each meeting is a random event). After passing three meetings in each stage (successfully) , there are a pair of cutscenes afterwards that, if done correctly, means you become engaged. From there, you have to take time to talk to them, and maybe take them on trips before they propose.\n\nThere is a special event that happens shortly after you reach 22. The matron goddess of your race decides to visit you and gives you a task to gain a certain title. If you do acquire that title by the time you are 30, you succeed at the \"Goddess Ending\" for your race. Note that you can either find love, or fulfill your deity's request, not both.\n\nThis game is a bit of a time sink, but it is still fun.\n\nJust realized the city you play in is named Aravorn, which apparently might also be the name of a kingdom/continent/world...
