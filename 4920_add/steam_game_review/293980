Upon arriving you will discover that there's no easy way inside, but the old man apparently like his puzzles, and so you will have your chance to show how good you are at puzzles. There's only one thing that seems to be happening on this property and that is that you don't seem to be alone. There's something lurking around the corner that potentially threatens you, and everyone else. That something else is the start of Ragnorok, something that a certain beast, Fenrir, would love nothing more but to start.\n\nGraphically you can definitely tell that this isn't going to blow your mind away, but with the type of game this is, it doesn't have to necessarily do that. There are several different areas to explore in this game, and I have to say that there was definitely time and effort put into each piece of this game's layout. Sure there is a TON of backtracking to be done in this game, but I think most people won't mind too much.\n\nThe music in the game is haunting, and the voice acting was adequate for the game.\n\nThe controls in the game are really straight-forward you are going to be pointing a clicking to get through this game.\n\nAlright so lets get right down to it. This is one of the more difficult games I have come up against. There is a very good chance that you will spend a ton of time randomly trying to solve puzzles because the solution is not easily deciphered. I will tell you that a lot of the solutions are hidden in other areas, but it is a stretch to figure out what goes to what. Which reminds me, play this game with a notepad or something to right down the odd stuff that you find in the game, it might not be significant, but chances are it is, and if you forget to physically write down the information you might be kicking yourself later in the game. I did come up against one puzzle that I could not solve, and so I had to go to the walkthroughs to try to find it, thankfully someone had put the pieces together on how to solve this puzzle, and I was saved from spending hours on a puzzle that I had no idea what the solution could be. I did find one bug that I found interesting, and that was if you pull up the map and accidentally exit to the main menu, you cannot get back into your game, so word of advice, SAVE SAVE SAVE, oh and save. I know its a pain and it breaks the rhythm of the game, but you will be thankful for doing so if you accidentally get stuck.\n\nThe storyline was quite interesting with the Norse connection, and that there was a deeper meaning behind the whole utopia, but I did find it odd that I was to come in and also look for people that had disappeared with my handy video camera, and yet I never got to use the camera except for once, and it wasn't for the reason why I would have the camera in the first place. Speaking of cameras, well the views that you'll have in the game, I have a bit of advice for you, if you get motion sickness, you might not want to play this game with a mouse. The reason is that when you take the mouse to the sides of the screen your view jumps all over the place, which of course causes some serious disorientation. You can play with the keyboard, however, but I think to get the most out of this game you are going to have to use both the keyboard and the mouse. The keyboard you will use when just traveling around the areas. The mouse will be used to work the puzzles, when the camera is locked in place.\n\nSo I believe it is that time where I need to give this game a grade, and I have to say, as frustrating as the game was, and how ambiguous some of the solutions to the puzzle were, I would still be very willing to play future sequels of the game.

It's a point-and-click with node-to-node movement.  The setting is within an abandoned building, which is suitably creepy.  The graphics were decent, even when played on a larger screen.   The only thing that bothered me was the lack of transition videos when moving through doors.  You heard the sound of the door opening and closing, but the door never moved.  A couple of times, elevators doors opened to reveal a hallway, but the exit from the elevator took you directly into a room across the hall.

It is frustrating in places...not being able to walk through any door, just materialising on the other side...zooming in on objects that have no relevance to the game....but it is atmospheric.......a gloomy, decaying city within a  building with lots of detail. There are many puzzles within the game and you need a fair amount of patience with some of them, there was steam coming out of my ears at one point and I was close to quitting the game,  but regained my composure and resorted to a walkthrough ( to my utter shame it has to be said ) remember this comment  when you play the Tower of Hanoi puzzle!\nThere is no hint system in place which I personally found exasperating as it would have saved a lot of time wandering about wondering where to go to next.", "timestamp_updated": 1483888286, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1483888286, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "10067992", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413818", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495309084, "steamid": "76561198066625092", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "my game has sound with a black screen", "timestamp_updated": 1399695130, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1399695130, "votes_down": 39}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 4}}
