I could tell the story of Diane, a colonist who singlehandedly fended off a pack of maneating squirrels with her longsword, but got her ear bitten off for her trouble, or Princess, a raider turned negotiator for the colony, who had her spine shattered from a bullet from another colonist's mother... or of the time we had a pack of man-eating elephants come through during one of the worst cold snaps the colony had had (\"Damn, it's freezing, you can't see  10 feet in front of you because of the snow... was that one of the muffalo? ...

The Colonists[/b]\n\n\tEach colonist has a backstory, and a large set of skills (or lack thereof) as well as various traits (bonuses or negatives). Some are particularly gifted with certain skills and gain experience much faster than those without. You will inevitably begin filling specific jobs to colonists which are more suited towards them as a result, which is both satisfying and realistic. Your colonists must work together to produce food, shelter and goods to survive the harsh RimWorld. \nAll colonists have: Social relationships, which is similar to The Sims or Crusader Kings II, though without the hassle of maintaining them yourself. Abrasive (trait) colonists will tend to piss off others and occasionally get into social fights for example;  Basic needs such as food, rest, comfort, joy, beauty and space, all of which must be maintained by the colony products/facilities; Gear, which consists of the clothing they wear, armor and weapons; Health, which is my personal favorite. If your colonists go hunting and are mauled by a bear for example, there\u2019s a good chance they will lose a limb which you can then replace with a bionic limb, assuming you have the resources to do so. Amputation, organ harvesting, drug addiction and more are all part of the health system, and it is phenomenally done.\n\n[b]II. Colony Building/Design & Crafting[/b] \n\nOut of all the games I've played, few offer such an extensive crafting system (except maybe Factorio) as RimWorld. Your colonists will have to make everything they need in order to survive their harsh environment. Whether it be the shelters they build and live in, or the clothing they wear, or the types of foods they grow and eat, or the types of animals they raise and hunt. If you are in a biome filled with deer, odds are most of your clothing is going to be made out of deer hide. Your colonists will have to work tirelessly to produce all the goods you need in order to survive. \n\n[b]III. Random Disasters/Events[/b] \n\n\tThere are a great many random events which occur during any given moment of a game. Thunderstorms (wet and dry) may cause fires, blights which destroy your crops, eclipses which will kill your solar panels, solar flares to turn off all electronics, infestations of bugs, and more. There are also trade caravans from nearby factions, as well as enemy raiders to come harass and murder your poor colonists. To give you an excellent example of just how much these events can change the course of your game, I\u2019ll tell you now a story of one of my failed colonies:\nIn the Fall, my colonists have produced plenty of warm clothing and stockpiled a good amount of food. They\u2019re ready to get through the winter, no doubt. Then one beautiful crisp morning, a powerline overloads and begins a fire in my mostly wooden structure. I immediately wake up all the colonists and send them to fight the flames, but by the time they put it out, more than half the food has been burnt up. When the fire started, a colonist was in the room with the powerline and was burnt to a crisp. Already a man down, and it\u2019s not even winter. Then winter comes, and with it, a large raid.\n\nFending off the raiders isn\u2019t usually too bad, but this one was the largest yet. The raiders damage a good portion of the front of my colony, destroying doors, walls, heaters and other vital equipment as well as killing another colonist (who just happened to be my primary Doctor). My remaining 3 colonists are depressed from the deaths of their friends (and brother for one of them), and one finally snaps. He goes wandering around in a daze outside in the snow during a cold snap. Most of the food is gone by this point, and things are looking bad. Another of the colonists nearly bled to death, as the only remaining ones have very poor medical skills. We ran out of medicine last week, so you guessed it: infection. He dies from infection.\n The wanna-be doctor wandering around outside is eaten by a pack of hungry wolves. Just one colonist left, and most of the food is gone. He\u2019s going in and out of dazes, bodies of raiders and colonists are everywhere. Finally he runs out of food, and he does what he has to: he begins butchering the raider and colonist corpses for meat. Luckily they\u2019ve remained frozen outside and in the half-destroyed buildings. \nIn the end, it\u2019s in vain; During yet another dazed incident outside, he is attacked by a bear and loses a limb, bleeding out in the snow. And so ended a colony which would have otherwise been just fine for the whole winter. The events snowballed and snowballed until there was nothing left worth saving.\n\n[b]IV. A Whole World to Trade (Or Conquer)[/b]\n\n\tA more recent addition to the game is the ability to send out your own caravans to nearby settlements to trade goods. You can also attack them, and [i]be[/i] the horrible pirates that you probably hate by this point. \n\n[b][h1]The Wat?:[/h1][/b]\n[b]I. Normally I would list a bunch of odd choices for system design or bad interfaces or missing obvious features. Not on this game![/b]\n\n[b][h1]The Bad:[/h1][/b]\n[b]I. It's still in Early Access, and thus it is not yet complete. Your savegames may occasionally break due to this, so don't get attached to any of your colonies.\nII.
