It looked interesting enough, but when I saw it tagged as \"Horror\", I chalked it up to users just trolling. Right? See, it looked like a simple adventure game about a frog. So perhaps I forgot to wishlist it, but either way, the game faded from my priorities list. \n\nThis brings us to present day: I happened to see the game in my queue and had a flashback of realization. Since I've been on an adventure/platformer kick, and had the 2$ to spare, I bought it right then.\n\nThe game is great, honestly, and I'm mad at myself for never playing it until now. Gameplay is tight and fluid (haha, water pun...) as well as leaving you to puzzle things out alone. The title screen music hooked me when I booted up the game for the first time - it reminded me of the hauntingly beautiful music of [i]Dear Esther[/i], another masterpiece of a game. The hand-drawn art style is both charming, and later on, disturbing, to perfectly capture the alien feel of a flooded forest. \n\nPerhaps I've seen too much in playing many dak and psychological horror games, but the game didn't feel like a horror-adventure, but did leave one feeling a bit uneasy by the final depths of the underwater forest. Personally, I feel the tag \"Surreal\" does more to describe the feel of the game; and if that's a genre of game you enjoy, pick this game up. \n\nIt's also short, so it won't cut too much into working through your own Steam backlog (seriously..send help), plus a few challenging achievements will give you more time to be immersed in the unique world The Working Parts have created here.\n\nThe less you know going into it, the better.

What appears innocent at first glance quickly evolves into a brutal and unsettling game of survival as you control a frog trying to make its way to the bottom of a drowned forest.  The game is simple, and your only immediate goal is to catch air bubbles as you descend so you won't drown.  What becomes apparent however the further you go down, is that there are other frogs besides yourself fighting for air, as well as a twisted horde of parasitic creatures that prey on them.  \n\nInitially, you may want to help your fellow frogs catch air so they can ascend to the surface, but the parasites become more numerous the further down you go, so saving all of your friends becomes a tall order if you want to survive yourself.  It might even be easier to nudge some frogs into a parasite to save your own skin; watching in horror as they feed on and merge with your fellow frogs, taking on a sickening new form.  Whatever awaits at the bottom is your ultimate goal though, and making it there is what drives this journey, even if it costs a piece of your soul.", "timestamp_updated": 1502609635, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502602453, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34160580", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502377548, "steamid": "76561197965355629", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It was okay.
