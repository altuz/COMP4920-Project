It usually goes down to $5, and it's definitely not worth the full-price. Honestly, I bought it more as a joke and have referred to it, with friends, as the \"Scooby Doo/Looney Tunes Furry Simulator\" due to the fact that you can create your own anthropomorthic character, which you can dress up as ridiculous as you'd like. \n\nIt's geared towards a younger audience, obviously, but even as an adult I found myself enjoying myself as I played through it. It's not something I can immerse myself in, and the plot points in the \"story\" are a bit cliche/predictable, but if you're looking for something that you can just casually play then this might be a good place to start. And if you have kids, they're most likely to enjoy this the most! \n\nHowever, I'd have to take points away since there's less Scooby Doo and more Looney Tunes. Tbh I only bought this for ol' Scoob ol' buddy ol' pal. :/ (I mean, it was on sale but still).", "timestamp_updated": 1498364162, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498364162, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 19}}
