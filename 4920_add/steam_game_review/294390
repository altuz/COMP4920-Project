Visually, it's quite a nice looking low res. casual game, it's fully voiced, and even has a decent adventure/hidden object mix. And it's about one of my favorite subjects, ancient Egypt, to boot.\n\nWhy can't I recommend it then?\n\nEasy. The ending chapter isn't included. Apparently it was part of a Collector's Edition not available on Steam. Normally that's not much of a problem, but the store page here clearly shows content nowhere to be found in this game, and the main story introduced in the opening cutscene is hardly even referenced again, let alone fleshed out and wrapped up. At first I thought I somehow missed something despite all of the map's rooms stating they were cleared. The only way I was able to figure out where these missing scenes were was to search on Google, which I find very sloppy to have not been at least mentioned on the page. It doesn't help the non-CE ending is a sudden, out-of-nowhere black screen with a simple white lettered \"Game Over.\" No credit roll. No feeling it actually ended and you hadn't somehow managed to screw up a hidden object game. Very disappointing, especially since the rest the of the game is pretty great for the genre, despite its short length (1.5 hours, not rushed, listening to all the dialogue and enjoying the scenes) and a few quirks.\n\nPros:\n-Nice, but low resolution artwork\n-Pretty good atmosphere for a casual title\n-Fully voiced\n-Gameplay is a nice mix of adventure and hidden object, complete with standard hidden object search areas and a full inventory you carry room-to-room\n-Potentially had/has (perhaps in the Collector's Edition) an interesting brother versus brother story, quite fitting for an Egyptian setting considering the importance of Osiris and Set (two gods who were also feuding brothers) in their mythology\n\nCons:\n-Not the Collector's Edition and is missing content displayed on the store page\n-An hour and a half long\n-The main and most intriguing story is ignored after the opening cutscene, with sparse and minimal exceptions in the form of other characters vaguely mentioning a second, forgotten pharaoh \n-Few quirks, particularly in dialogue, such as misaligned text and oddly shifting the spelling of the name of and gender of the cat\n\nFor its current sale price of $1.25, sure, go for it. Full price? Probably not. You won't even realize you successfully completed the game and will be left wondering where some of the awesome looking store page scenes are.\n\nI honestly wish there was a neutral button on Steam, as I wouldn't necessarily say, \"Avoid this.\" Rather, be aware of how oddly it ends before you get there, and be aware some particularly interesting bits (the video shows you playing Senet, for example) are not included in this edition.\n\nStill, solid 3/5 for gameplay and the partial story it includes, plus the intelligent, interesting use of objects in scenes (and finding objects you'll actually need) and inclusion of some real ancient Egyptian mythology. It would've been an easy 4/5 (for the genre) if the non-CE ending wasn't so abrupt, and the store page only showed content actually in the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1400045834, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1400038925, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "24103609", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528320", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1467571694, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "num_games_owned": 2214, "num_reviews": 352, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I don't know why I often associated this game with another series but deep down, I knew it wasn't related. It was also time for me to play it and to stop letting it rot my backlog.\n\nHenry and Laura, with their two children Emily and Francis, are visiting their aunt Amy in Egypt. However, when Jynxie the cat escaped, the family finds itself trapped into a lost tomb, separated from each other and forced to find a way to reunite and bring together their findings to escape a deadly trap set by a Pharaoh that killed his own brother and cursed his memory.\n\nEscape The Lost Kingdom: The Forgotten Pharaoh is a casual adventure game, with hidden objects scenes and puzzles. Each member of the family has a special item: Francis has googles with glyph visions, showing him areas of interests, Emily has the Time Amulet, showing her the previous state of a room, Laura is holding the key to many enigmas thanks to Amy's diary and Henry is carrying with him tools (hammer, shower and crowbar). Each chapter is seen through Francis, Emily and the parents first, before the kids finding themselves and exploring their areas. In the end, the family is reunited for the final push: they're each carrying items needed (staff, torn painting, etc..).\n\nIndeed, some parts of the game can't be access unless you have Francis's Googles for example. Besides, each member is carrying items found in their part that will be useful at the end, when the inventories will fuse together. The puzzles are relatively easy, though you may need Amy's diary to find out clues. I had to resort to a walkthrough twice because I couldn't see what to do. And it wasn't because I didn't read Amy's diary. It was mainly because I couldn't understand well the meaning of the enigma.\n\nEscape the Lost Kingdom is clearly set in an early era of the genre, though it was transitioning, as it's not hidden objects scenes set as main gameplay. But when you clear a location, it's shown. The map is also an indication of that and isn't interactive at all.\n\nHowever, while the story is only about escaping and not about the Forgotten Pharaoh (everything is explained in the beginning  in other words and while you're expecting the main story to come back to that, apart one or two mentions by Emily, the Pharaoh is really forgotten), I would have expected a longer game. Even if you can choose who you'll play first when the whole family is splitted up (Emily, Henry and Laura, Francis), after that, the game is taking back the control: the kids will have to go through more trials than the parents as they found quickly the reunion point.\n\nBesides, it's not the graphics that will reconcile people with hidden objects games as they're kinda giving the feel of being outdated. While I appreciated the drawned cutscenes, Francis seemed really an angry child and Henry very serious, where the girls are smiling. And given the scenario, it's sad that you don't have any change in their expression. I would have appreciated Emily's rolling her eyes when saying that she's a big girl now.\n\nThe soundtrack is nice, like the voice actings. That's why it's just sad that the emotions aren't matching.\n\nThe feature that showed me how old the game is (and it's not even so old) is the mention of 3D glasses use. You can play the game with it. As I don't know where my old glasses are (from the middle of the '90, mind you), I couldn't try it.\n\nAnyway, should I recommend it? Yeah, even if I feel like the game is missing something: too short, not many use of the tools typical to each character, no real freedom of choice despite the beginning, what about the Forgotten Pharaoh and outdated graphics. But it's still an enjoyable moment to pass.\n\nHowever, buy it during a sale or in a bundle.

Which might have been fine if the story was completed by the time the game was over, but no. It starts out with a cutscene showing an epic battle between two ancient pharaohs and speaks about how the murdered one waits in his tomb for the right people. The game itself is about a family of four who gets lost in the temple raised for this pharaoh and about how they escape. That's it.

At the time of review, I have 1.4 hours on record and probably a full third of that time was actually me fighting with my display (note that if you have a 4k monitor, you may need to disable display scaling in order to have fullscreen cover the whole screen).\n\nThe other issue is that the plot falls flat on its face, with an abrupt ending that leaves the game wide open for sequels that I don't believe ever were made.  So essentially it was dissatisfying to finish and not feel like you're actually finished.  That said, the plot was formulaic enough that you can essentially fill in the blanks in your head and call it good.\n\nSo that said, it's barely squeaking by with a recommendation based solely on my enjoyment of the individual puzzles and not on the overall plot or playtime.  It is NOT worth full price with the short length of the game (barely a third of the length of other standard HO games).  But if you can get it on sale and don't mind a cliffhanger that will never be resolved, pick it up for a short, casual experience.", "timestamp_updated": 1433040781, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433040781, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "19779921", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1449254537, "steamid": "76561198074722431", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game was fun, kids were a little annoying and it was short, but I really enjoyed it all the same.", "timestamp_updated": 1450525274, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450525274, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "19552978", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1449517516, "steamid": "76561197979609703", "num_games_owned": 537, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It was short and cheap, which I liked.
