It's mainly inspired by Super Meat Boy and most levels really have the same difficulty as you had in Super Meat Boy. If you are an old-skool gamer like me you will have lots of fun with this challenging game. Instead of raging I'm mostly smiling. Why? Because hardcore platformers almost aren't produced (anymore). Super Meat Boy has been a while back now, and after completing that it was really time for some new hardcore platformer to make me frustrated and give me a real challenge.\n\nThe game has over 200 levels, each as frustrating as any and each level can be played in 3 different modes: normal, challenge and godmode. I am yet to figure out what godmode is, as I haven't unlocked that yet. Normal let's you play through the levels, well.. \"normally\", while challenge gives you even more of a challenge by limiting the dashes and jumps you can make per level. Besides that there's also one cookie in every level to collect to unlock (real-life!) recipes and there's hidden \"red cubes\" which you can collect to unlock a bonus world with hidden levels that give you even more of a challenge.\n\nThere's 4 different themed worlds, each with their own unique (challenging and frustrating!) boss and after you beat the last one you unlock another 4 new themed worlds, which are inspired on the levels from the first 4 worlds, again with entirely new unique bosses. You could see the other 4 worlds as the \"dark world\" from Super Meat Boy, so to speak.\n\nThe last 4 worlds will definitely give you the real challenge, and I've spent a couple of hours already trying to beat these. I am currently at 8 hours of playtime and only in world 5, so the game will give you atleast 20-25 hours of unique playtime, so it's really worth the money!\n\nAfter you beat everything you can collect yellow stars, by completing each level within the timelimit that the developers set for each level. These yellow stars can be spent in the \"arcade shop\" where you can buy about 10 unique minigames and where you can try to get into the highscores, which are shared online through Steam. The best times of each level can also be seen on online leaderboards. Then there's also a lot of achievements to collect, including hidden ones, so this will surely keep you busy for a while! :)\n\nThe graphics are also unique and stylish and the soundtrack is sweet and gets you pumped, although perhaps they could have used more varying tracks for different worlds.\n\nI would give this game a 9/10. I would say regularly update the game with new levels or perhaps add a level editor with the ability to share your levels and worlds online to make this a perfect game. I would also love to see more of the \"Fenix Box\" levels, which look very classic (I believe from early in-dev times).\n\nOther than that, retro hardcore platformer, surely recommended, especially for this price!

(I'm currently in the middle of World 5.)\n\nThere is a distinct lack of enemy variety. Predominantly, all you'll see are enemies that move back and forth in a straight line, or that jump in place, which is nearly the same thing. It isn't until you've completed around 80 levels that you'll see enemies with different movement patterns, and by that point I had already grown tired of the level design. Even many of those later levels apparently focus on the straight-line enemies.\n\nSimilarly, maneuvering Fenix often involves no more than button-mashing to take a straight line through openings in between the aforementioned enemies. In most cases, you'll either mash the jump button to ascend, or the dash button to move sideways. There are no precise wall kicks or nuanced, curved jumps, and Fenix's vertical speed feels rather slow. The idea of infinite jumps and air dashes sounded exciting, but ended up being more simplistic and repetitive than I expected.\n\nIf neither point fazes you, and you seek another precision platformer, I'd say there's a good chance you'll enjoy this, even if it didn't quite meet my personal expectations.

While Super Meat Boy has momentum-based movement, Fenix Rage controls more like Donkey Kong Country (in that you stop moving immediately when you let go of the analog stick. Side Note: I prefer movement like this, but that's just personal preference). What's unique about Fenix Rage is that the main character has infinite jumps and dashes that you can use whenever you want.\n\n\"But wait!\", you say. \"Doesn't that ruin the game?\"\n\nNot at all. The levels are designed around this over-powered movement style. In fact, you will die - a lot. That's okay, though because the respwan is *instant* (which is FANTASTIC). It feels less like you're dying repeatedly and more like you're just learning the level and playing it until you beat it. The levels are actually not *that* difficult (I found myself flying through level after level), but an optional cookie that you can get in each level ups the challenge dramatically. I found getting the cookies super-rewarding and loved the added gameplay this provided. \n\nThe art is charming and unique, the soundtrack rocks and is fun to listen to and the level design is great. The difficulty ramps up so gradually that near the end of the game you're doing straight-up ridiculous maneuvers to stay alive, but it never feels overwhelming. With over 200 levels - including arcade mode and secret warp zone levels - there's a lot of game here. \n\nEverything is not rainbows and unicorns, however. Some levels have enemies moving really fast in tight, confined spaces. Getting past these types of enemies felt more like luck than skill. The same goes for dashing through tiny 'one-block-high' holes in walls - that *always* felt like luck to me. Also, the little green squares (the main enemies in the game) are used *a lot*. Like, \"bordering-on-too-much a lot\". I honestly think they're used too much. I would have liked to have seen more variety in the gameplay. Different types of enemies, more patterns to evade and so on. With four Light worlds, four Dark worlds, a secret ninth world and warp zones there are a LOT of levels here. There's no reason to have a single mechanic (the dodging of square enemies) be used SO much. There are other mechanics in the game, though (I don't want to make it seem like that's all the game is). The variety of gameplay is good, but I would have liked to have seen more. \n\nTL;DR : Fenix Rage is a fast, frantic precision platformer that's a lot of fun. The controls feel fantastic. The level design is great except for a few places that feel 'cheap' (depending more on luck than skill). With tons of levels (over 200), exciting boss battles and lots of optional objectives, it's a game that you'll be playing for a while. An excellent game by Green Lava Studios and I look forward to whatever they're working on next. :)\n\nFinal Verdict: 8.5 out of 10", "timestamp_updated": 1412644240, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412644240, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "12276022", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501417", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1413409068, "steamid": "76561197965296444", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's nothing like Meatboy, but it does scratch the same itch and it's good fun.", "timestamp_updated": 1411911843, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411911843, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "29304702", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505204", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1486215936, "steamid": "76561198091484468", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Overall a very nice game.\nI love the speed you can reach & still being fully in control of the character, it simply feels great !\nI'll keep it brief if you enjoy good solo platform games you MUST have a look on this one.\nI'm honestly very surprised it isn't more popular yet.\nAnd hey you can fly like kirby & dash like Sonic in there, you can also learn how to cook good cookies !

Challenge mode limits the number of jumps and dashes you get to reach the end, and you'll get a red star. Are you a manifestation of pure, unbridled skill? Play Godmode like the god you are.\n\nAnother review I read described it as a Super Meat Boy + Flappy Bird + Sonic the Hedgehog hybrid.. which is pretty accurate. For what it's worth, I'd say it's less grotesque than Super Meat Boy, far less repetitive than Flappy Bird (what isn't), and far more responsive than Sonic.\n\nPerhaps my favorite design feature in this game is that you respawn instantly after dying. I mean INSTANTLY. In Super Meat Boy, there's about 1/3 second of delay after you die, but in Fenix Rage, it's literally a few milliseconds before you can move again. Did you screw up during the stage? Push one button and BOOM instant respawn. It's amazing.\n\nFrom a pure gameplay perspective, Fenix wins. He just feels... powerful. However, the game could be more polished in its ambiance. The music is okay, but not as memorable as it is in VVVVVV or Dustforce. Dustforce actually creates an amazing ambiance with lush backgrounds, although that might just be my personal aesthetic preference.\n\nLastly, this is just my personal gripe but none of these platformers ever has a real plot. They're always pretty half-baked, which is to be expected given the focus is on the gameplay, but still it would be nice to have say a choose your own adventure type deal with a good ending / bad ending / different levels depending on what you pick.

It's a very different experience, and I'd argue a better, albeit shorter one.\n\nThe visuals are extremely impressive; much more so than Super Meat Boy. Menus pop, animations are fluid, and the game overall looks fantastic. It was very nice to look at after playing so many games that opt to take the 16 bit graphics route, which I despise. The cutscenes look great too. Yes, there is a story, but I'm not entirely sure what it is. However, games like this are rarely about the story, so this is easily forgiven. \n\nThe game features many different things to do. The basic premise is to get from point A to point B, but there some twists to this. First, there is a cookie hidden in each level. If you find all of them in a world (20 levels, 20 cookies), you will unlock a cookie recipe. That's pretty neat. There are occasionally red boxes hidden in levels two; about 2 or 3 in a world. If you get to them in time, you'll unlock a level in a secret world, which automatically rewards you with a cookie if you complete it. There are also 3 different stars you can earn in each level. A yellow star can be earned for completing a level in a certain amount of time, a red star can be earned for completing a level by only using a certain number of dashes and jumps, and a blue star can be earned in a mode called \"God Mode.\" In God Mode, you'll be invincible, and have to touch all of the enemies on the screen (thereby killing them) in a time limit.\n\nYellow stars are decently hard to earn. I'm not really into speedrunning, so I only earned about 40 of them. However, yellow stars are also the most important. You can unlock minigames by spending yellow stars. Red stars and blue stars can't be used for anything, which is unfortunate, but not a huge deal. The minigames are... decent. If you're looking for a simple diversion when you're really, really bored, these will probably do. Otherwise, you'll probably only play them once.\n\nRed stars are the most fun to earn, in my opinion. Only being able to jump or dash a certain number of times adds a new challenge to the game. I had a good time earning all of them.\n\nI wasn't that excited about God Mode, though. I think I earned about 10 blue stars before I stopped wanting to earn any more. As said before, I'm not really into speedrunning, so the concept didn't really appeal to me very much in the first place, but they're also very hard; much, much harder to obtain than yellow stars. I've A+'d all of the light world (and many of the Dark World) levels in Super Meat Boy, but many of the levels in Fenix Rage are ridiculously hard to earn a blue star in. If you like to speedrun games, you'll probably like it more than I did, but it wasn't for me.\n\nThere are 10 worlds in total, with 20 levels in each. You can't earn stars in the secret world levels, so that leaves 180 levels that you can beat in 3 different ways. 4, if you count beating it normally. While I've only put about 13 hours into it, they were very enjoyable.
