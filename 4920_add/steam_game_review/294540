For me this game was a huge nostalgia-bomb, and even replaying it so many years later the charm I loved as a child is still here and strong. The characters and world are so charming, the art style is great and the gameplay is fun, even now as an adult.\nI highly recommend it for kids too. It still holds up really well today, and I'm sure any little kid playing it now would love it just as much as I did back in the day.", "timestamp_updated": 1493170938, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493170938, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 62, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 67}}
