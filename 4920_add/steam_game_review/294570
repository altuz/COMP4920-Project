All of their point and click adventures have great animation and large creative worlds to explore. You are Freddi Fish and your pal is Luther; your goal is to figure out why a sea monster is terrorizing coral cove park. You do this by pointing and clicking objects to solve puzzles and interact with characters until you gather enough information to solve the mystery.\n\nI find there's a lot more visual humor than verbal in this Freddi Fish game; a lot of the jokes are told through pictures and character actions than said outloud. The puzzles themselves in this game seem simpler than in previous Humongous Entertainment games, a lot more straigthforward A to B puzzles where you have a very obvious keyhole and your goal is to find a key. While for me this made the game slightly less engaging, i found it made this freddi fish to be the best to introduce the series with. While the puzzles are simple, the world is still quite complicated. There's a lot of fun and quirky characters to meet, all well voice acted and offer some sort of interaction towards helping you save the day.\n\nIf you ever want to show a friend a great old school point and click, this is a good starting point.", "timestamp_updated": 1502925679, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502519554, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34605982", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504075698, "steamid": "76561198073200821", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The twist will leave you speechless.", "timestamp_updated": 1504095399, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504095399, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 23, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 27}}
