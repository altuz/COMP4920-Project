It combines elements of three genres - action, RTS and RPG, which are not very well blended. It's just too much repetition, too many problems, not enough fun. All-in-all there's enough action and a few cool RPG elements, but there isn't any engaging or innovative gameplay. Feels like this game wasn't finished before release. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1123835641 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=955302041", "timestamp_updated": 1506425390, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506425390, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 25, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 29}}
