Because it's a time-traveling game.) In all seriousness, it is quite fun to play again after 15 years.\n\nIf you are a parent, I also recomend this game for your child. I can remember this being one of the first games I ever played, and it is by far the most memorable. There are a bunch of minigames, some with 50 levels. Even though the story is the same each time you replay the game, the gameplay is different and you have to do different things to progress. There is also always a ton of things to interact with in each setting. \n\nThis is a great game, but I would suggest to buy when it's on sale. This game was made in '97,  so if you haven't played it yet, you can wait a couple months to the winter/summer sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1506217951, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506217951, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 68, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 72}}
