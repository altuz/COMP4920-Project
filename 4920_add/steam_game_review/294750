What do i mean with fixed launchpads? As soon as you start either 1 of 3 difficulty levels you will see spawned launchpads in your missions the fact that i can't spawn tower how i want and where i want to position them is total b.s. e.g. scorchers, these towers were useless to me because each time i saw pad to spawn on game said there is no ROAD, lmao. Can't design your own \"maze\" like for example Defense grid or Sanctum. \n\nI had to do several restarts because of missed unit or built wrong tower just because there is no rewind button. 0 replay value unless you want to force yourself to collect 100% achievements aside from that play on easy and complete campaign. Annoying in game mission briefings that can't be disabled.\n\nWHAT happened to all towers that were in previous anomaly games? Huh? Why there are missing some? I wanted to experience same thing i did in other Anomaly games. Oh yes \"some\" hazard missions are astonishing you would think that if there is actual hazard mission that could benefit your play style, nope, you are completely wrong because all hazards are against you. Bombing missions always target your towers as well as you run out of energy to repair them and then enemy units get pass you. OH HOW FUN! If that is done then there is next hazard mission where lightning strikes down. That could benefit you here at least? OH no! haha, its even worse than it was with bombing hazard. As soon as lightning strikes it shuts down your towers and the thing is about lightning it only targets your spawned towers and if you have only 3 towers on field then it will be perma locked down. AMAZING!\n\nNot sure why but whenever i fast forward gameplay and there are several explosions i got FPS drops. HOW CAN I GET FPS DROPS WITH 1050TI? For real?\nI actually tortured myself to play all the way till the end and collect all 100% achievements. I'm so glad this is over.\n\nHere is the tip. If you want good tower defense game with actual replay value get DEFENSE GRID or SANCTUM instead.", "timestamp_updated": 1505490591, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505424671, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 16, "total_reviews": 50}}
