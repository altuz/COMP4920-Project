I like this game and i think it has a huge potential, so i don\u00b4t want to give a bad rating.  But there are two things which pis_*s*_es me off!!!!!\n\n1. This game crashes far too often with a stupid sound error. Sometimes you can play nearly one hour without crashes. Othertimes you can\u00b4t play for 5 minutes without a crash --> Why is this not patched yet?! Why selling a game which have so many performance problems? -->  WTF?! --> [So you are very thankfull that you have an auto save function, but the shortest auto save time is 5 minutes and thats often too long for this performance problems.......}\n\n2. I am enough addicted to the game that i can ignore some of these crashes, because i want to play it! But here is another problem. Sometimes after a crash you can\u00b4t restart the game without restarting the PC before......\n\nTHIS performance problems are far too much. Even for an experienced player like me. I don\u00b4t believe that beginners can really enjoy this game with these problems. This game is especially for beginners a little bit hard to learn and to understand how you controll everything (The game don\u00b4t explain everything). This game alone is already hard to learn/play for beginners. \n\n!!!!!!!!  I think this game with its current state is only for people who played this game already or for big sci-fi fans.  !!!!!!!!\n\nAnd the funny thing is, you need 5 minutes of gameplay time BEFORE you are able to write a review. And you can only get this time together if you restart the game multiple times, because the time for playing this game don\u00b4t count (and i played some hours). --> 100% sure that this is the reason why this game has so few reviews/ratings.", "timestamp_updated": 1506682281, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506681426, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 12}}
