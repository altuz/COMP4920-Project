With the addition of several cool characters, this game amps it right up from the original with improved mechanics, online multiplayer, and it also having a critical piece of the story which is connected between the 4 games. Definitely worth grabbing if you want to learn more about the story and/or add a great fighting game to the collection.\n\nEDIT: This game comes with a free soundtrack, so if you enjoy the music as much as I do, you'll enjoy having this on your phone/iPod/MP3", "timestamp_updated": 1504809039, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504790504, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 331, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 26, "total_reviews": 357}}
