Yes, it\u2019s a garbage truck simulator however what the heck do you do besides hauling garbage? So, I played the guessing game and my conclusion is not much \u2013 that is there\u2019s no real replay value. However, it turns out that there\u2019s plenty of things to do like hauling garbage with different types of garbage trucks (small / large / crane), manage your landfill with three vehicles being the crawler, truck and bulldozer and, of course playing the role of a garbage manager. So, to my surprise, it\u2019s a decent game however the user-inference and a game crippling bug can make you toss this game into the tip (excuse the pun).\n\nBecause there\u2019s no real ending to this, you can literally go on forever however I cannot think any good reason why you want to do that. I used the achievements as a baseline so once completed, I deemed the game as \u2018conquered\u2019. That said, the game\u2019s pacing is extremely slow with a bucket load of micro-management. I think what the developers was trying to aim is there\u2019s a lot more to it than just collecting / dumping rubbish \u2013 there\u2019s a whole network of systems to be concerned about.\n\nWhatever the case maybe, this game certainly tailored to the very niche market and granted, there\u2019s plenty of busy work to do (especially when you need to manage a number of trucks). Plenty of lost opportunity here however it\u2019s not a game to be totally written off as there\u2019s a lot of evidence of love poured into this game. However, because the game is now regarded as \u2018abandoned\u2019, meaning there won\u2019t be any more patches, it\u2019s a game that you need to take huge precautions to play it, especially that game breaking bug where the AI truck never returns to the depot.\n\nFull review here:\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/recycle/user-reviews/2200-12727648/\n\n5 / 10 (recommended - barely)", "timestamp_updated": 1494551176, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494551176, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 25, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 53, "total_reviews": 78}}
