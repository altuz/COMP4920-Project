If you like turn based strategy, get this game.  If you like just RTS, get this game.  If your a fan of JRPG & anime's special brand of personal stories wrapped up in the geopolitics of world war, get this game. \n\n This game has more depth crammed into it's pinky than most games get after 2 years of modders fixing them.  Just get this game on sale and promise yourself that you'll start it sometime in the next couple years.\n\nGreat story, some battles require multiple strateies and some are like puzzles.  Soldiers will die, new ones will take their place.  Some soldiers are sad, some are happy, and some are so GD happy you'll just watch them bleed out while everyone else just pretends they're too wrapped up in the battle to notice.  \n\nGreat upgrade tree and you can evern recover enemy weapons from the battlefield.

Additionally probably one of the only ww2 themed turn based anime shooters out there. Its one of those games that's not quite there though. Mechanically it's somewhat imbalanced and certain mechanics can prove infamously frustrating. In terms of the story it's a little too cliche, featuring bland easily identifiable lead and the sqauds very own tea pot pig mascot; that said though it's one of the only games i've played recently that touches on the holocaust (if only lightly).
