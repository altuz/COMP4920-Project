You speak to the developers on discord regarding issues and they ban you for being negative. They arent interested in your opinion nor you enjoying the game. You can post constructive criticism in the discord and they'll ban you but if someone comments about cancer or anything serious they wont touch them. \n\nThe game has been destroyed by the developers. \n\nHow can you buy a game, spend 100's of hours and they completely change the game, new map and new name. Doesn't that entitle me to a refund? I backed a game and they completely changed it due to people complaining they needed change. Change had to happen and all they did was introduce a new map and new name. Just like a company that went bankrupt. \n\nDont bother with your time, the game is riddled with bugs and if you comment on them they wont change them. \n\nI have so many friends that spent 4k hours into this game and they regret it so much because of how its turned out. \n\nIf you FELT like you should buy it. Let me put it this way, if you go onto the game and look at the servers, there are possibly 2 servers with nearly max pop. Fancy building a base... you cant, why cant you? Because theres fixed bases now and they are all taken so enjoy playing on a server with no one else on. \n\nDid i mention they rushed this 'new update' to live because they were losing players and they released 1/4 of the 'new map' and it sucks... hard. Do i need to say anymore? Oh... they listen to the small minority of the community who play PVE on the game and thats why the game is the way it is now and nothing is built for PVP. \n\nWell done daybreak on such an amazing game.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_updated": 1507069950, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505759946, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "35133989", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513439", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1493467062, "steamid": "76561198124232230", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "just survive? more like kill self", "timestamp_updated": 1506103114, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506103114, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35146175", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513705", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504547799, "steamid": "76561198224445800", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "FCK THIS GAME !!
