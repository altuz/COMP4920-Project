Today, I'm so incredibly frustrated I hardly want to play ever again, but begrudgingly will to finish achievements at a later point. I will begin with positives.\n\nI really like the art style, I like the cool environments, and the physics-related humor is (mostly) top-notch. I enjoy the collecting without really having to collect mechanics, and I (typically) like the puzzles. The voice acting is also very good.\n\nNow, the negatives.\n\nThis game is extremely buggy. I didn't have the same issues on my first playthrough of the game, but on the second, it was practically unplayable. I would fall through the floor of levels, I would glitch through walls, I would break the game so unbelieveably frequently that it really soured the gameplay. Also, with the puzzles being the way they are, there is so little room for error. If you make a mistake, even a small one, you have to re-do previous puzzling sections multiple times. \n\nThese two factors, in my second playthrough, worked together terribly. I would glitch to parts of a puzzle that I wasn't supposed to be in, and despite having the pieces would have to restart. This kind of tediousness was horrible for me.\n\nMy other main gripe is the use of a point of no return. I tried avoiding the point of no return at the end on my first playthrough, but somehow got stuck and ended up not being able to 100% the game, despite me being so close. This discouraged me so much, I didn't even finish.\n\nNow, on my second playthrough, I am rage quitting because at the second \"boss\" segment, the game refuses to give me the proper speed, so I am stuck in a loop of constantly dying. I have a hard time believing this is my PC's fault, because I didn't have this trouble the first time. So now, I can't even go back and complete the game like I wanted to.\n\nGosh I wanted to love this game, and the first time I played it I did! But after this, I don't think I have the heart to even finish it. If you want to spare yourself the heartache of wanting to love a game but ending up hating it, avoid this game. If you want a decent puzzle-platformer that you don't expect much out of, buy this on sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1491871236, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491871236, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 31, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 8, "total_reviews": 39}}
