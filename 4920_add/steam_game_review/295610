Your comrads are dead and you must find a way to send a distress signal and get off the planet.

The game itself is reminiscent of a watered down version of metroid where you have essentially an open world to explore and advancing is controlled by what powerups you have so far.  That said, there aren't that many powerups total and the enemy diversity is minimal.  There isn't anything which I would call a boss fight.\n\nI've seen that some complain about no map and no music.  I admit, music would've been nice but its absence does provide a certain tension that is condusive to the games atmosphere.  Having no map makes me think of those old games of yore (NES that is) where one had to draw one's own maps and keep track of where you were going.  From that perspective, I like the no map option.  It is a different kind of game design that stems from giving players value in a game by making it more difficult.\n\nSo finally, would I recommend this game?

Forget them, just make a bunch of humanoids monsters, give them different colours to give the impression there's a couple of them, and have them patrolling in a platform. -Later, you may add flying enemies, because shooting constantly moving enemies with a gun that can only fire straight is fun.\n-The music? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA there is no music at all in that game. The only noises you hear are the character's grunts, the gunshot, and the monsters' moans.\n-The main character?

They just walk, randomly cough a fireball at your face, and turns around. And that's not the worse thing, the worse thing is that, to avoid that fireball, you just duck.\n\nYes, that's the main problem with that game, each time you meet a zombie/mutant/whatever, you stop walking, you crouch, and you spam X until the monster is dead.\nUntil you understand that it's more interesting for you to ignore the small fry and just shoot the mooks, since they're the one dropping energy for your shield.\n\nAnd have I mentioned that the game is a maze, and that there is NO MAP?\nI said no map?

I really like this buy for five dollars.  \n\nIf you hear the \"Metroidvania\" tag and expect something along the lines of Super Metroid, Fusion, or such, you may be disappointed - the MV genre is the closest easy genre to throw at it, but this is something a little different.  It's less like a modern era Metroidvania throwback, and more like a Metroidvania era Amiga throwback.    \n\nCompared to what one expects from an indie MV style game, it's simpler in many ways, but with a little more push on narrative.  I'd really like to see what the fellow making this can do with a few more resources.   \n\nIt's stripped-down approach, while it may just be an artifact of the single-dev approach, is quite suiting to the game.  It comes across as slightly haunting, really.  It's like a really good indie record from the 80's - rather than being hindered by it's limitations, it has embraced them into part of the aesthetic, and made something better for it.  I think trying to make a game with the same sort of emotional resonance that is attempted in modern titles, within the confines of a vintage-styled 2D game, and to succeed on the level this game has is quite the accomplishment.  \n\nFrom a gameplay aspect, while I often like something in this genre with a more open and less linear map (Aquaria was one of my favorites in this regard) given the size of this game, and the slow speed of movement, I appreciated the \"looping\" nature of many of the paths you take - while it does create a slightly more linear experience, it removes a lot of the \"grind\" of making your way across repeated terrain.  Teleporters and shortcuts and other work-arounds wouldn't have worked as well with the feel of this game, really, and allowing the character to move through the environment faster would have ruined the feel and mood of the game.  \n\nReally, there's been an incredible balancing act in a lot of aspects of this game.   Every decision in it's creation seems to be quite deliberate. \n\nHonestly, I have a hard time not recommending this to anyone - the dollar and time cost are low enough to not feel like a waste even if you don't like it, and it's an intriguing game.  It doesn't quite hit every note it reaches for, but if you like 2D styled games, and games driven slightly more by story than action (without being action free) this is a good try.", "timestamp_updated": 1401593435, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1401593435, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "11315927", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499071", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405764358, "steamid": "76561198047636092", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is hardly even an hour and a half, no music, no enemy AI, no plot, no point, no map its just total garbage and super dull.", "timestamp_updated": 1405764819, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405764819, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "21543730", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496499", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1406023615, "steamid": "76561197995145662", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Do not waste your time and money on this.
