I suppose it's connected with the awesome preview and good rating (Very Positive 85%) \n\nFirst of all, the preview of the game is a lie. \"Stunning Detail of levels\" - there is nothing stunning. \"in-depth gameplay\", actually, the TD elements at this game are bare to bones; \"finely tuned balance of all levels and turrets\" - \"The balance is bad. See below for more info\".\n\nI don't like when people lie.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1139880749\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. There is only 8 towers. Each tower has 4 levels. When you upgrade a tower it gets x2 damage and small attack radius boost. Each tower gets Hellfire ability (which is the same for all towers except Tornado), which increased attack fire by 200% for 5 seconds. That's all. There is no buyable abilities, there is no tech tree for towers. There is nothing else except these 8 towers.\n\nThe balance of towers is bad. There is 1 overpowered tower, the Mortar, which has long range, high attack damage and splash. So, the tactic for all levels are simple. Place cheap tower, save money for Mortar, place mortar, upgrade mortar, when save money for the next mortar. Repeat until 30 wave is done. Add some lasers for air waves and some ice towers for better mortars' performance. All other towers has much lower DPS than mortar. I tried to pass 4th map on hard 10+ times to realise that.\n\nThis is the second huge flow of Defense Zone 2. There is a lack of information. You can see the damage and attack range of tower. You can't see attack speed, attack type, dps, splash, bounce count and etc. An it's really bad. There are tip in the game loading screen which says \"Build your defense depending on enemy units\". Ok I go to tower info and see, that this tower does extra damage to Light units. But what are light units at this game? I can't select enemies, I can't check their HP or type.... tt\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1139880724\n\nAs I said each tower has Hellfire ability. It should be interesting. But you need to manually use for each tower ( you need to select tower, and click at the button). At the end of the game you have 20+ tower and you are forced to click on towers and activate abilities. I played on Mac with touch pad and I was really tired to do these repetitive actions. TD is supposed to be about strategy and not about ability activation\n\nThe graphic is.... average. I think this game was originally designed for phones firstly. You can't visually discurn levels of towers. Level 2 of tower looks like Level 1. And it's bad feature. \n\nLet's talk about enemies. There are infantry, air forces, vehicles and tanks. And I had no idea which unit is stronger and which is weaker. You just start new wave and praying that you have enough damage to eliminate current wave.\n\nBosses in this game just a bigger tank with more health. I forgot to say. Enemies don't have any abilities at all. They just have health, move and die\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1139880333\n\nPros\n- 31 levels\n- Cheap game. There are discounts often\n- No bugs were found\n\nCons\n- A lack of diversity in towers\n- Average balance between towers. Some are overpowered. Some are useless\n- Lazy concept of waves. They are all the same. Start with infantry, then vehicles come, then tanks and mega tank as a boss in the end of game... \n- No information about game mechanics. You can't see health and type of enemies, you can't see attack speed and calculate DPS for your towers\n- Game requires a lot of clicks. Especially on hard, because you need to use Hellfire ability constantly (each tower has this ability)\n- Graphics are average with a lack of explanation about power of towers and enemies (you can't visually understand who is who)\n\n[h1]Resume[/h1]\n\nI think, I could be funny to play this game in 2012, but in the 2017 Defense Zone is too outdated. You can find better TD titles for the same price with deeper strategy elements, so I can't recommend it.", "timestamp_updated": 1506008417, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506005825, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 50}}
