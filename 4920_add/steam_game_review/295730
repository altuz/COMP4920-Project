I have known WIndybeard for a considerate amount of time now.\nWith that said, let's get on with the review.\nFirst of all, this hame is HARD. Really really hard. Even if you are a hardcore bullet hell fan, you will die. And die again. You will die at least 5 times. And what's not helping is that most of the time you don't even know what killed you because there were a lot of things at the same time on the screen, and all of those things are aiming at you. The game is colorful and hand-drawn. Every character has a personality, no matter their lifetime. That's what makes this game unique. And also the fact that you die over 534789534789 times.", "timestamp_updated": 1493700854, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493700854, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 41, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 50}}
