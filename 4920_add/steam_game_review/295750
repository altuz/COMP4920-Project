The height of any given jump is unpredictable. If you are in a safe spot, you can repeatedly perform the same jump until you get the height you want. If need to jump while running... well, you can just hope (and probably fail, then replay the level the exact same way and hope you get a better unpredictable jump height next time).\n\nSome other, more tolerable issues:\n- Same old \"unique surprise\" at the end\n- No gamepad support\n- Occasional glitches (stuck in a wall, physics launching characters unpredictably, stuck in a perpetual-death loop, etc.)\n- Meandering overworld maps without any real purpose/content, just meandering\n\n\nCompleted or Quit: Completed", "timestamp_updated": 1505344145, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505296323, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 127, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 31, "total_reviews": 158}}
