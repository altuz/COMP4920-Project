It was recorded before it was on Steam, but the info should still be pretty accurate.\n\nThe dungeoning features rock hard difficulty, fluid feeling controls, and simple graphics. This is one of my personal favorite rogue-like/lite games. I love how easy it is to get into, but difficult to master. I've already finished the game once, and currently working on game+.\n\nOverall it's a fun light romp, that could have you coming back for more.\n\nPositives:\n- Easy to understand mechanics\n- Fluid feeling controls\n- Will challenge the player\n- Multiple \"Game+\" for replay\n\nNegatives:\n- Might be too simple looking for some\n- Might be too hard for some\n- Could use more options and features", "timestamp_updated": 1399054314, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1399054314, "votes_down": 45}, {"recommendationid": "10034652", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 73, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583491", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1399375823, "steamid": "76561197975099817", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Reading the reviews which give this game a thumbs up, it seemed like it would be right up my alley.  Randomly generated dungeon?  Difficult but fair gameplay?  Inspiration from the 'Souls' series?  A liking to Legend of Dungeon?  Take my money!\n\nBut don't let any of these fool you.  What you get is an overpriced, bare-bones, sleep-inducing and repetitive game.  This really needs to be labeled as Early Access because there's nothing to this game for the price-tag.  I'm sure the developer has plenty more to add in the future but as of the time of this review, this game has nothing to keep you interested for more than 3 hours, max.\n\nThe dungeon itself is very uninspired.  The weapons all function exactly the same.  Every sword, every bow, every staff... exactly the same.  You cannot sell nor even DROP any of your weapons, so prepare to be battling with scrolling through your weapons the whole way through.  There's no armor drops, so zero customization there, and the stats are boring and should probably just automatically upgrade instead of making you pause the game, go into your menu, and add one point into a stat which doesn't make you feel any cooler, stronger, or tougher.\n\nThere is some enemy variety, but it takes way too long before you encounter the next new mob.  A lot of the mobs, especially early on, are too boring to fight.  Unless you think fighting a bunch of plants that can't move or attack is fun.\n\nThis game needs a lot more time to be fleshed out, and then it might be a decent amount of fun.

The combat and platforming feels like a less polished Spelunky, while the pace and \"learn from mistakes\" difficulty mirrors that of Dark Souls.\n\nThe Dungeoning is a pretty short game, consisting of only 3-4 tilesets over 16 floors of the dungeon.  A full run only takes about 60-90 minutes.\n\nEncounters with enemies are very similar to Dark Souls, in that enemies seen unfair and daunting until you learn their attack patterns. Mastering how to react to and counter enemies will let you breeze past them in subsequent play throughs.\n\nThe sword play is skillful and satisfying.  Bows, slingshots, and wands each provide different projectile trajectories making all 3 useful in different situations.  You will switch weapons very often depending on the dangers at hand.\n\nYou have a shield, but it is only effective against projectiles, and only in a small frontal arc.  Unfortunately this makes blocking much less effective than simply dodging.\n\nThere are no time limits, so much like Dark Souls you are free to slow down, take your time, and study each encounter before diving in.\n\nEvery run is a fresh start, as there is no meta-progression.  This works quite well for The Dungeoning.  Progression is satisfying because when you get farther than before you know it is because YOU as the player got better.\n\nPros:\n+Unforgiving but predictable enemy behaviors and attacks.\n+Nice pixel sprites that aren't too stlized.\n+Loot!

While I found each level to be a challenge, I was dissapointed to see no big bosses. So I look forward to that hopefully being implemented. Also, some sort of stats for wepons in item descriptions would be nice. Maybe even add some new characters with different starting stats and weapons like dark souls? I look forward to each new update and seeing what's added to this awesome game!", "timestamp_updated": 1413757655, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413757655, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 16, "total_reviews": 50}}
