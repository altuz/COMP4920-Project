If the whole game was just these levels, I would have so much fun with them.\n\nKeeping your extra coins when you finish a level. A small thing, but it still felt really good. The game rewarded me for taking my time with a level, exploring all the nooks and crannies, and finding all the hidden treasure. It also created hope that eventually I would get so many coins that I could skip a level entirely because I can already pay the next fee. If I ever did this, it would have been amazing.\n\nNow, the not so good things. \n\nEnemies That Take More Than One Hit. Now, I realize that eventually, there has to be an enemy that takes more than one hit, but this breaks the pacing of the game. Before you find an enemy, you're jumping around and racking up a huge combo, after you find the enemy the combo is over. Everytime I saw minotaur/ice warrior/lamia/wizard/turret head/thing that I couldn't kill in one hit I knew that the combo, which was the fun part, had ended. A nice work around for this would be if the higher a combo the player had, the more damage they deal. This would mean that the game rewards the player for working an Enemy That They Can't Kill In One Hit into their combo, instead of punishing them for finding it.\n\nTerrain That Looks Like The Background. This was something I kept finding, and everytime I did it was confusing. Normally, the background is dark and what you can walk on is bright. This game has dark background, bright terrain, and darkish other terrain that you cannot jump up through. This becomes such a hassle, trying to check where you can and can't go, in moments when I'm trying to hurry because lava death is flooding the level.\n\nLevels That Flood With Lava Death. These things were a massive cause of frustration, because of what these levels try to be. They are expansive, well put together that I would love to explore and collect all the coins, but they are on a timer. This means I cannot explore the level or I risk death, I cannot collect coins or I risk death, I cannot search for hidden treasure or I risk death, and I cannot blindly jump combo through the level just trying to finish it as fast as I can or I might not have enough coins by the end. One of two things needs to be removed from the rising levels, either the coin number or the timer. Having both turns the level into a stressful, memory game. The first run of a rising level, I told myself \"I am going to lose all my bonus coins.\" I knew that I would win eventually, but only when I had run the level so many times that I knew exactly which way to go and where enough coins were.\n\nSlippery, Slidey Shoes. This was a problem on two occasions, when I was pushing through a rising level, and when I was trying to avoid the next issue.\n\nTouch Damage. I know that touch damage is a staple in videogames, that enemies are not things I should be getting near. However, I mostly only have melee and there are some enemies that don't make sense to deal touch damage, like birds that are trapped in them sized cages. The other place this becomes a problem is with bosses, because bosses can suddenly change the size and shape of their hitbox. This doesn't feel like taking damage, this feels like being robbed of a health point.\n\nYou Cannot Use Magic After A Double Jump. This sounds minor, and it is, but the thunder magic is the only way to increase melee damage and reset jump combos. When I find an enemy with two health in a jump combo, I use the thunder magic to kill it and continue the combo, unless I need to double jump to get to it in which case the combo ends.\n\nThat's mostly it, there's a few more things. The water magic felt worthless because you had to stop moving, the jumping attack was so much better than the standing attack that the standing attack felt worthless, exploring downward didn't feel good because I couldn't see what was under me and would frequently take damage because of that. \n\nSo now, the final verdict, would I recommend this game?\nNO. Don't get me wrong, there's some great ideas here, the game looks nice, parts of the game feel great, but there's so many little things that just wear on the player until the game becomes unfun. I can enjoy games that are challenging, when you win then that victory felt earned, not given, but this isn't challenging. It's frustrating. If the game was challenging, the player, if they are skilled and focus, be able to beat a level on their first try. They probably won't, but the possibility should still be there. With this, there's so many death that just came from things I couldn't see, or because I got stuck on terrain when trying to jump up, or because I took damage when I turned around to attack a stationary enemy.

I think a timer system (one that ticks down per level and one that ticks up throughtout the game for speed runs) would be a much better system for this game. I beat it in about 2 hours. It's enjoyable enough, but the faults will keep me from returning to it. Don't let the first boss get you down -- difficulty wise, it should've been the final boss. The bosses would even be a ton of fun if not for the rediculous hit boxes. Between enemies having too large of a damaging hitbox and the protagonist having floaty controls, I died more times than was reasonable to what I feel is poor design. Level design, sound, and music are really great. The art style is pleasant and unique. Try to pick this game up in a sale if you're on the fence.

Zero button configuration and by extension being forced to use the D-Pad on an Xbox 360 controller.

The inability to move the camera below you when you need to descend, resulting in numerous blind jumps and making the already annoying enemy placement all the more grating when exploring. The game effectively only using two buttons on the controller yet insisting to employ down + X for special abilities, which is cumbersome for quickly moving about and simultaneously dispatching more durable enemies.

The main focus here is definitely the combat, but it's designed in a way that feels pretty platformer-y as well. Killing an enemy gives you your two jumps back (reminds me of Dustforce in a way) and chaining enemies together using these extra jumps nets you more coins per enemy. The goal of each stage is to make it to the end with a certain amount of coins in tow, and the further the game progresses, the higher this number goes, and the longer the stages get. The end result is, unfortuntaely, a difficulty curve based mainly around level length, though each new world gives you an extra heart so you can survive a bit longer. Health pickups are more than sufficient, and tend to be very useful, as avoiding damage in this game is no easy feat. I never found myself having trouble getting enough coins either, if I searched around the level a little bit I ended up having more than enough. Coins can carry into the next level, too, but are lost if you die - I can see this making for some interesting speedrunning strats, certainly.

If I face the player left then right camera repositions immediately regardless of whether I'm moving or not.\n- After you kill enemies coins don't always make their way to you which make the coin collection aspect in the air a pain.\n- Bumping on the sides of platforms ruin your jumps.\n- There's no option to exit the game in the menu.You either manually close the window or [Alt] + [F4].\n- Awkward controls, you have to press down and attack to use magic...why not use another button?\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI had too many problems with my small play through of this game and I can't really recommend as a result. I'm not saying it's a bad game but I'm not willing to put up the problems I encountered. Ended up requesting a refund as I found myself not enjoying the game at all.
