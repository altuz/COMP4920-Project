I did other things to wait, I wasn't going to sit there. And that's about it, completely anti-climactic. I decided to get any fun out of this, I was just going to end it planting the most pollution inducing and just cover the world with unlivable dirt.\n\nIt also seems to bug me that the music is the same throughout which gets annoying, especially from alllll the painful waiting. I guess at some point I was hoping it would change to a dark setting when you pollute the land enough but no it stays the same... which sounds weird in a world that looks really dangerous to live in.\n\nThe fact that I had to wait and do other things in order to win is a poor excuse of a game.
