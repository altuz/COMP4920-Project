The puzzles in it were enjoyable and a bit difficult but that only made it better. I didn't have to look up a guide to figure any out, so that was nice. What I did have to look up a guide for was what I had to do next towards the end. Usually that's a deal breaker for me, but it was fine with this game since most of it was actually really well designed. \n\nAs far as the gameplay, I generally hate games like this. I don't like walking around, running between rooms and overcoming traps and guards. However, the story was good and it drove me to continue and the mechanic of sneaking had a sense of fantasy realism. Basically no one is invisible (duh) but if they were the game portrayed how it would play out well enough. \n\nThe graphics were fitting. I don't like 2D anything unless it's one of my old favorites, but actually the art was a really good. The sounds were good and musical. I wish there was voice acting, but instead it's something like Don't Starve when conversation happens. The voice acting could have really upped the game's value. Nonetheless, it was well done the way it was done. \n\nSo I definitely recommend you purchase it even if it isn't up your alley (but at the $10 sale.) If it is up your alley, 15 dollars is better than acceptable. If you speak Arabic, I'd recommend it at $15 simply because it was so fun to read the names and know that you know the translations.

And this game has lots of stealth elements. But in a very unique way. First of all, you play one of the most interesting characters imaginable. Then the story is dark, nothing is like it seems at first. The setting is fantastic. I don't want to spoiler so that's about it. I just want to say, I've bought several games in the last time that I found more than disappointing. This little gem here is different. I've only just played somewhat over one hour, but already I have the feeling that I've become addicted in a certain way.

I didn't get far but I really wanted to see more.\n\nThe Neutral\nThe music works but doesn't have any tracks that stand out in my mind. It did it's job but not something I go out and buy independantly\n\nThe Bad\nMy first complaint is the lack of a decent tutorial or even a very visible prompt that pressing s is required to move in stealth. The game gives you an easy to see prompt for movement by popping up the movement keys, and pops A over a door which you see your character swipe at and open, indicating it's probably an attack as well (It is). However the game never tells you that you need to press and hold s in order to move stealthily, otherwise your character can move one step and then be attacked because for a stealth game where you will most of the time be moving at a stealth speed, stealth is NOT the default. This is a bad decision which leads to numerous problems. Further the actual stealth gameplay does not seem deep with some of the areas being too tiny to actually do anything. Throw in an autosave feature vs. a manual save combined with autosave and you will be redoing sections if you mess something up in another section and get to sit through the dialogue...again. The unskippable dialogue of people talking that occurs outside of cutscenes, in which the dialogue is skippable.\n\nOn top of this, I had the frustration of wanting to quit the game and hitting escape and realizing this did nothing. It wasn't until a frustrated 30 seconds later that I finally realized to open the menu, you need to hit return. ESC does nothing except skip cutscenes, I believe. This goes against gaming conventions and led to another annoyance added on top of the prior ones. It is within this menu that I finally discovered the section that tells you how to play. Also, I'm not sure if it actually tells you but I don't remember it telling me the difference but it does say you can poison people. What's the difference between poisoning them and a regular attack against them? I have no idea as I don't remember it saying.\n\nAs for the stelath mechanics themselves. It's essentially a move silently and don't get in their physical way and you'll be fine. There are no ways to really move guards from their positions other than your ridiculously loud default movement. It doesn't matter what surface you're walking on. If it's carpet or stone, stealth movement is silent, default is loud. There are no pots or other objects that you can hit or use to distract the guards. This game lacks depth, nuance, and good feel for the gameplay.", "timestamp_updated": 1478380153, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1478380153, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "26303006", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508176", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1477781247, "steamid": "76561198084660063", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The stealth mechanics are rudimentary and poor. There's a huge lack of options to progress through the environment. Your options for dispatching guards consists of a basic attack and well... That's about it. This means that stealth consists of slowly trailing guards from behind or charging recklessly at them to activate the same insta-kill attack. The environment is completely static despite an incredible amount of pots, pans and all other sorts of valuables being bolted down in the environment. Having at least a few contextual objects here and there that could be interacted with to alter the paths of the guards would at least have added the depth of a puddle to the game play. This inability to meddle with the game's script is particularly problematic. It makes the game move at a snail's pace and feel incredibly repetitive. Instead of stalking and preying, you are most often forced to sit and watch unskippable chat blurbs play themselves out again and again before the guards will disperse and you can start playing the game again. Why can't I break some pots, pans or vases or do something in order to break up these oft-repeated conversations? Being forced to sit through these unskippable scenes again and again is worsened by the large number of deaths you will endure due to cheap, trial and error game design. \n\nThe game design is extremely cheap, poorly designed and unfair to the player. The game loads each room to approx 1 second of a black screen (your screen is blank but the guards are still patroling and the game playing itself). This leads to countless cheap deaths where you are rushed and killed before you can even see the room you entered. This results in trial and error game play where you compensate for this by running blind in the direction away from the guards who previously killed you during this 1 second black screen. Furthermore guards are often placed right in front of doorways which is just bad stealth game design. The guard pattern is also static and never-changes which is probably a good thing considering these aforementioned issues. Haven't these guys played the original Metal Gear on the NES? For a 2D, top-down stealth game I would not expect these design issues in 2016. \n\nYes, the game has a unique and novel setting (which made me want to play it). But I cannot overlook that the game design is hugely flawed and not very exciting to play. It is aggravatingly cheap and slow.
