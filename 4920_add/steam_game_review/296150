I didnt play it much. The concept is not bad, your part of a team of zeroG footballers the idea seeming to be to pick up one of a couple of ball types and either score or attack a player with. As simple as the game is, it's controles are what REALLY let it down. your mouse only controles looking about as far as i can tell, while w and s control forward and backwards, a and d are turn left and right, but there is a turning circle meaning you turn more like your driving a forklift truck rather than a person, there is strafe but its unresponsive and slow.\n\nThis game needs some serious changes to be any good imo, the main one being the movement, its all just too slow, you cant quick dodge or side step and once airborn you never now whats gunna happen, you could go all the way to the other side of the sphere you play in, or you could just shoot off on  random axis for no given reason.\n\nThe graphics of the game are aso a little odd, the terrain looks decent though dated but the characters are glossy as hell, like they are wearing super shine spandex and the \"audience\" is a VERY bad bitmap.\n\nAll in all, I dont think this game is a bust, NASA need to really think about what ppl want in a game rather than trying to be inavitive, they just dont have the experiance for it.
