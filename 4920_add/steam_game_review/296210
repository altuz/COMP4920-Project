Sadly, but all this richness on the battlefield goes with considerable amount of bugs, and total insolvency of \"Brigade E5\" in all gameplay aspects except from shooting.\n\nE5 New Jagged Alliance was designed as an heir to Jagged Alliance 2, in the country where JA2 is still have one of the biggest fan bases in the world \u2013 in Russia. Another one country in that short list is Germany, and there was successful and almost successful alike gaming projects as well\u2026 But let\u2019s return there to the E5 title. In short, it is the first attempt of the amateur team of programmers to make \u201cour own JA2 with smart enemies and blondes\u201d. Surprisingly, they succeeded! No, they don\u2019t build a perfect starship which can take all humankind to the stars. And even while I\u2019m calling E5: New Jagged Union the game, in fact, it is a bad game. By all criteria, except one. Normally, when we see something like this, we call it \u201ca project\u201d at best, and turning away, because it is not worth neither our time, nor money. But the engine, created by Apeiron team, up to this moment remains the most prominent and complicated in the whole gaming industry. For comparison, the bits that we saw in the overall decent German game Jagged Alliance Back In Action, are that simple and rigid, so, for one, yeah, almost every 5-years-old can manage it, for two, it certainly gives not enough challenge for the adult connoisseurs of the genre.\n\nI can speak very long on that topic, sorry for taking your time there\u2026 Let\u2019s finish now.\n\nWhy you may buy E5 now? It is certainly not the best game in the list. Yet, if you are an enthusiast who played a lot in the Jagged Alliance and other similar titles, you know how little there was made of them. All the genre of tactical squad-based wargames is a very rare breed. Every approach there having at least a little of playability is worth something. If you have a thing for those games, but not familiar with the any of Apeiron games yet (there was 3: E5, 7.62, and Marauder), I suggest you to start from 7.62 or Marauder. They have more fair tutorials, to get the basics. Believe me, until you get the vibe, like how to move, how to use all the opulence of guns and other stuff (the difference between shooting from the hip and using the scope, for example) \u2013 you\u2019ll only see E5 as another low-time wannabe JA2-title. But if you will be knowing how to operate \u2013 you\u2019ll find out that that game is a hidden gem.\n\nOverall mark is 7/10 \u2013 all game components are vague, but the combat is so rich, that I can only ask for more.", "timestamp_updated": 1458044035, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447706861, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "12991255", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500470", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1429746963, "steamid": "76561198068709290", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "To adress the main complaint, Yes the tutorial sucks I'll admit I had a tough time figuring it out I'll be honest the game is not friendly to newcomers however when you get the hang of it with some patience it isnt all the bad and you might enjoy it.

But tons of bugs and poor implementation of some features makes this game inferior to more \"modern\" options such as the sequel 7.62 also available on Steam.\n\n\nI remember playing this game several years ago, just before I got my copy of 7.62 High Calibre. I really like some of the features that Brigade E5 included, such as SPM and the weapons selection and customization. But the game was plagued with a lot of bugs that would make you want to pull your hair out. And even after all of these years, a lack of patches or bug fixes will have the game leaving a sour taste in your mouth.\n\nIf you like this style of game but want some \"improvements\", I would suggest you get 7.62 High Calibre and install the Blue Sun Mod (BSM) which includes the unofficial patch. That game offers newer graphics and better stability (mostly), newer UI and improvements to previous features, new weapons and locations, and a ton of other stuff.\n\n\nSome of the biggest complaints that I have about Brigade E5:\n\n1) When leaving items in the bank vault, for some reason any stacked items disappear. For example, if I have 5 boxes of M882 ammunition in the vault, coming back to the vault after a day or so of game time will cause the stack of 5 boxes to magically turn into one box. This tested same with magazines, armor, weapons, anything that was stacked.\n\n2) Your weapons get dirty super-fast, to the point where it's simply retarded. For example, just moving from one map sector to another and your weapons can gather up 3-9% dirt. Even weapons that were stored in your backpack and have never been fired will still accumulate dirt rather fast. It's as if your characters are spending several hours a day intentionally crawling through mud and muck, and shoving dirt into their rucksacks for no good reason.\n\n3) The bank system itself seems flawed, as your money frequently \"gets stolen\" when the bank is robbed. Doesn't matter if you had $5,000 or $500,000 in the bank, every few days it seems a robbery makes all that cash go poof. So while the thought of earning interest is tempting, the risk of losing it all makes it useless.\n\n4) The lack of a centralized storage method means you'll often times be hauling tons of stuff to the opposite side of the map just to drop off equipment that you plan to save for future merc hires. And if you need to equip new gear for a specific mission, that still means a lot of walking. When combined with the above-mentioned vault bug, you're pretty much better off just selling everything you're not currently using and buying it when you do need it (if it's even available).\n\n5) Enemies tend to spawn in or glitch through terrain, sometimes placing them in locations where they can shoot you easily yet you can't seem to hit them at all. Or enemies that \"hide\" inside of terrain making it impossible to hit them, but they can drop out and shoot you in the nuts when they're good and ready.\n\n6) Hired mercs give absolutely zero warning when their contracts are about to end. You'll be marching down the road to your next mission objective when suddenly they say they're leaving, give you no time to extend their contract. At least in 7.62 HC the game will pause and a warning message pops up informing you that they'll be leaving in 24 hours, which gives you plenty of time to either extend their contract or at least drop them off in a location where they can be easily found later should you choose to rehire them.\n\n\nI guess I could actually keep going on and on with bugs, flawed game mechanics, etc. And that's likely because I am fairly biased towards 7.62 HC after having played it for a while. My general opinion is that Brigade E5 was a decent game at the time, and showed a lot of potential. If you're a fan of 7.62 High Calibre already, or just a fan of the Jagged Alliance games, you should play at least a few hours of Brigade E5 even if solely as a means of education and novelty.\n\nIn regards to my recommendation to play the game, I'll say yes it's worth playing, even if just to see for yourself.", "timestamp_updated": 1421046452, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421046452, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "18219760", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502417", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1443360599, "steamid": "76561198054939289", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "well this is a great game but it has some flaws and crashing issues. this is what jagged alliance back in action should have been like.... you get huge amounts of weapons, the ability to modify your weapons with bipods, sights and noob toobs etc.... if you can handle the stuttering and imperfections you will have a good time..... i got this with 7.62 but i want to finish this before i play 7.62", "timestamp_updated": 1443357932, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443357932, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "9995989", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476172", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1442424608, "steamid": "76561198078459451", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I know this game and i am suprised to see it in steam.
