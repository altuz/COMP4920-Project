Clutters the Library\n\nReview: This could be worse, the audio and visual presentation are on the okay side. You dump animals in a small pen and produce mini factories to transform their harvest into products that you sell from the truck. Everything is done from one screen and is a simple game of cooldowns, grinding, and the occasional clicking on a random event. On a tablet this would verge on the okay side of things, especially when this was first released. But it fails as a PC entertainment title and I am removing it from library for that reason.", "timestamp_updated": 1505710194, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494858326, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 59, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 20, "total_reviews": 79}}
