It starts slow and that combined with the obvious port from phone/tablet (low resolution, all input designed for touch not mouse) put me off at first. Decided to give it another try and here I am 4 hours later giving it a positive review. The end is in sight, so I suspect I'll get another ~3 hours max out of it. For the price I'm happy with it now. Overall, it is a nice peaceful little resource management / city builder.", "timestamp_updated": 1499600196, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499600196, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 206, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 51, "total_reviews": 257}}
