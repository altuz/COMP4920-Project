It's cheap, it's simple and it can be loads of fun in short bursts. It started out life as a browser game (which i was not there for) and it does sometimes show in terms of it's quality and design. Is the game bad? No. Is it flawed? Yes, in several ways. The gameplay is a mix between class-based shooters like TF2 and Deathmatch style shooters such as Quake or Unreal Tournament. The modes/maps are selected at a random vote at the end of matches and there's a little bit in the way of customization for your characters. It's a very fast game with plenty of dying and respawning in quick succession, which i personally feel would get boring after a little while. Not to mention even on a beast computer like mine, the game runs horribly often choppy and laggy, the awful netcode doesn't help either on 200 ping EU servers. But despite this, there is something satisfying about cloak stabbing people with a rad ninja sword. So i'm not really sure how to feel about the game. It's not crap, but it's not gold either.\n\nPROS\n+ Decent Graphics for a cheap game\n+ Gameplay is fluid and fast paced\n+ Each class feels unique\n+ Character Customization\n\nCONS\n- Feels like a browser game\n- Maps get old rather quickly\n- Bullet Sponge health\n- Feels very generic\n- POORLY OPTIMIZED\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nI personally  like  the game verry much. Is  this game my main game? No it isn't. Is  this game ONE OF my main games? Yes it is one of my  main games. do i recommend this game ? yes i do its  a verry fun game  to stream and a  verry fun game  to play with friends it  never  get  bored, ssometimes  you'll rage but isn't that in every game? anyways  have fun playing a game  you like and  enjoy the  games  you like but don't buy games if you're  not  sure it's a  good game. Your looking for a competitive  game? don't play thiss game  it  is not competitive. buy CSGO then\n\nThis was  my review  thank you for reading it \n\nhave  a  great day everyone !!", "timestamp_updated": 1506108429, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506108429, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34873072", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505279", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505084893, "steamid": "76561197978137699", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "No game balancing, matches are unevenly stacked and unless players are willing to change teams, it will remain stacked.
