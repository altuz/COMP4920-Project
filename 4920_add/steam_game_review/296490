They have an empty  slot that holds a gem, and the gem dictates what the tower does. The gems themselves don't have much pizzazz, only 9 in total and when placed in a tower they all look and behave very similarly except for color. Similar range, damage, etc. with some modifiers. (Slow, chaining, steals currency,...) The gimmick is that you can combine gems to mix their effects. They don't generate new effects (see the super cool Android game Myth Defense to see what that's like) but that makes them easier to understand, which can be good because the game has a lot going on at any given moment. \n\nResource management, tower placement, path shaping, are all there, but there's many small systems on top that make the game as a whole remarkably complex. The uses for gems are the biggest contributor - aside from using gems for towers and floor-based \"traps\" (alternate tower essentially) you can also use gems as bombs, permanently destroying them instead of slotting them into a tower. You can also bomb the UI icon for an upcoming wave of enemies to \"enrage\" the wave and make it more difficult, increasing the number of enemies and their health and armor. Additionally, each tower has a handful of AI settings as well to fine-tune your monster-killing apparatus.\n\nOutside of the moment-to-moment action, the game is most comparable to Dungeon Warfare due to (1) the ability to use modifiers to make the game intentionally harder so that you can get more XP from a stage, (2) having XP level the player up, and (3) having levels translate to skill points that you allot on various abilities before entering battle. The skills are more varied than DW though, and the penalties you can apply to yourself are in many cases more impactful. On top of this are a couple of interwoven systems of acquiring and leveling up collectible items that augment your game, something rarely seen in TD games and a welcome layer of complexity here. These systems make it so the strategy outside the game, before you even enter a stage, are a game unto themselves.\n\nAll in all easily worth $20 so a total steal at the usual $10 and a no-brainer when it's on sale.\n\nCompared to other pure TD games I've played on Steam, it sits alongside Defense Grid, Dungeon Warfare, Defender's Quest, Creeper World 3, and Super Sanctum TD as games that are more than worth their money.", "timestamp_updated": 1506599089, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506599089, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35093316", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505947146, "steamid": "76561198022907259", "num_games_owned": 421, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 11800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The best tower defense game.
