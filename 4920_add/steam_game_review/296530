My impression is this is a \"dungeon crawl (beyond incredibly) lite\" for mobile. \n\nIt is not for a hardcore RPGer. It is definitely not for a PC gamer who is expecting the depth (whether story or mechanics) that comes from real PC RPGs.\n\nIF I played games on my phone (and I dont- I'm VERY anti mobile game, esp those ported to PC - See thread \"i hope this is as good as it sounds\" for why), and IF I was looking for an RPG to while away some time on the train or whatever, It'd be ok for that.\n\nDefinitely not a \"suck away an entire weekend in dungeon crawling bliss\" game though.\n\nOk for starters, yeah. The textures are really uninspired basic texture packs as Gwion noticed and Angelo pointed out. You could probably find the exact same pack on the web for purchase with a few words on google.\n\nThe story is...Meh. Thats not really surprising. The dungeon crawl genre isnt known for its stories, but for its intricate dungeons full of monsters and traps.\n\nYes theres 2 NPCS Ive met so far, an \"innkeeper and a \"shop\". The story of why theyre there is beyond weak. And as far as I can tell, you cant buy or sell anything but arrows, rations, and fishing gear at the shop. Why even have a shop? Why not an arrow and rations vending machine?\n\nIt would have been served better to just have very little story, as Dungeon Master and LoG did. Just a \"a big evil dungeon and you have to defeat the big evil at the end of it\". That worked for the old games. \n\nBut in this one, your characters actually talk to each other sometimes. And the writing is bland and not really worth being there. The screenshots are misleading, as they show the charcaters talking to an NPC and each other. \n\nThe NPCs are dispensers, the writing of the charcater's speech sounds like it was written by a junior high schooler. NOT needed.\n\nThe thing that gets me more than anything is beyond a few screens of basic instruction (that any RPGer pretty much knows automatically) there is NO ingame helpfiles. NO tutorial, no nothing. And the ones you do get are impossible to look at once they're gone. \n\nSo you get basic self explanatory introduction (Minus what the \"gestures\" are - I still cant figure out how to strafe and it was only through experimentation that I figured out how to work them at all), and NOTHING about unique aspects of the game that you need to know.\n\nLike for instance in the character screen there is a yellow bar next to my health. Whats that? Experience? Fatigue? Food? No idea. Suppose Ive got to fiddle around with it till I figure it out.\n\nI'm all for not hand holding, but this game doesnt even tell you basic stuff you need to know.\n\nThat and theres no options screen. So I hope the resolution, graphics, keymap and sounds are to your liking. Cuz you CANT CHANGE THEM.\n\nThat might be OK for mobile, but on a PC it is an absolute necessity. Not everyone has the same configuration. Not everyone has hands that can use a keyboard to steer. (I have partial paralysis.) \n\nThe \"gestures\" are a good thing. I really like that as an alternate movement. But theres no tutorial of what to do to work them! It took an \"aha\" moment and 10 minutes of experimentation to figure out why my mouseclicks were spinning the PCs around.\n\nSo, in summary. This is a PC port of a mobile dungeon crawler. For mobile games that Ive seem, its pretty good. By the standards of the PC, no.\n\nGo play Legend of Grimrock or even the old Dungeon Master. If you like dungeon crawls and have an iWhatever, get this game on there. Then you can while away time in the waiting room or on the bus. \n\nBut I'd recommend actually playing real dungeon crawlers on the PC.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n\nUninspired, run of the mill mobile dungeon crawler with non unique textures. Will not in any way shape or form impress a PC RPGer, but its worth poking at a bit if its on sale for $2 and youre really really hard up for a dungeon crawler. Way overpriced here though.\n\nThe lack of any sort of re-readable helpfiles, and not giving basic information about the game's mechanics really sucks. That and THERE IS NO OPTION MENU. That might fly on mobile. Not here.\n\nIf you have an iThing and want a dungeon crawl to waste time while waiting for the bus or whatever, get it on there. Its ok by the standards of mobile. Not by the standards of the PC.", "timestamp_updated": 1399745116, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1399744972, "votes_down": 38}, {"recommendationid": "10066189", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 150, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598663", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1399677381, "steamid": "76561197983918013", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "So little is explained here.

The greatest difficulties are in simply controlling the party's movement - the keys are awkward and there is no mouse look.
