I'm honestly surprised it doesn't have more reviews. I play so many overly complex puzzle games where nothing ever makes sense or you have to stare at the screen for an hour just to progress further. Niko is not one of those games - it's extremely refreshing. I agree that puzzle mechanic is relatively simple but it's only because everything just makes perfect sense - it's so well put together! Many levels took my breath away with how clever and beautiful they were.\n\nOnly cons with the game were the jumping controls (I would mostly overjump or not jump far enough) and lack of frequent save points.\n\nOther than that, I highly recommend Niko to everyone. This game is also a great starting point for anyone who wishes to learn puzzle mechanic or become a better puzzle solver.", "timestamp_updated": 1496203634, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496203634, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31442347", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517603", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1493473989, "steamid": "76561198051304382", "num_games_owned": 468, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I bought [i]Niko: Through The Dream[/i] partially because of its art style, but more because it was being billed as a puzzle game.\n\nAs a work of minimalist art, [i]Niko: Through The Dream[/i] may well be among the top 10% of games on Steam (though I suppose that's not saying much with con-artists like Digital Homicide on the loose). As a puzzle game, however, Niko not only falls short of the mark, but it drops the arrows before even drawing back the bowstring.\n\nAs you'll note, I've only played 35 minutes of this game. Those 35 minutes were enough to tell me that the developer doesn't seem to know very much about puzzle design. Let me spoil the first three levels for you (apparently the developer's packed the game with a good 18 of them, so I should think this to be acceptable spoiler-wise).\n\nFirst, a few technical notes. Apparently, the resolution in the config tool is the resolution of the *window* containing the game, and the resolution in-game is the resolution the game runs at. Tabbing out doesn't pause the game (I think this is a quirk of Unreal), unlike Unity games. Apparently people have some trouble with save files, and there isn't a level select menu, but I'll be damned if I'm opening up the game again. One thing I will note is that it hasn't overheated my computer (unlike some 3D-, even a few 2D-games), so at least it's optimized reasonably well.\n\nAnyway, having gotten somewhat annoyed at the resolution fiasco that I had when I initially started up the game, I entered the first level. I immediately noted that the walking speed was very slow, and combined with the lack of a \"run\" button, this indeed is a \"walking simulator\". Slow walking in video games tends to annoy me, due to the fact that I only have so much time in my life, and putting a slow walk when you could up the walking speed is literally just wasting the player's time.\n\nBut puzzles. The first level contains two puzzles; the first one involves looking around the map to find four symbols, and their order. These symbols are etched onto four stones, each one having either one to four markers below it. However, each marker has a different orientation, but the orientation is irrelevant to the actual puzzle. Apparently the puzzle creator likes red herrings?\n\nHaving found these four symbols, I proceeded to four buttons that were in a row, in the corresponding order. But the annoying thing is that these four symbols were *just* far enough apart that I had to move the character to click each one. This annoyance could easily have been solved by putting the buttons closer together or by increasing the range of interaction of the character.\n\nThe second puzzle in the level is somewhat akin to a simplified Rubik's Cube. No real complaints here, actually\n\nBetween the second level's start and the puzzle, there is a really long path that you have to walk down at the snail's pace that you walk, for apparently no reason at all other than to pad out the game, just like how I'm adding irrelevant information to this particular sentence in the review just to pad it out. Not even [i]Flow Match[/i] (sorry, \"[i][b]Soko[/b][/i]\" Match) or Rolling Shapes did this!\n\nBut anyway, the second level's puzzle? A maze. Mazes are solvable in log-time, so I don't at all consider these puzzles. But it gets worse; you can actually circumvent this maze by just walking on the thin ledge around the maze, and get to the exit.\n\nSuppose, however that you do decide to enter the maze like I did. You can't reach the exit that easily, because the gamedev put in what can best be described as \"slot machines\" in the maze with spinning wheels with symbols on them. You have to input the symbols into the machine by stopping each wheel when the correct symbol lines up with the small circle on each one.\n\nI say \"correct\" because each slot machine requires a different combination of symbols. Which is fed to you right on the adjacent wall.\n\nSo in short, this isn't even a puzzle. It's literally a skill test considering the speed at which the wheels spin. And you have to do this with three different machines, in sequence.\n\nAnd when you do exit the maze and see the level exit, you might just walk towards it... and fall to your doom because you didn't think to jump over that tiny little gap. So you have to do the whole level all over again. Something tells me this game wasn't playtested.\n\nThe third level involves lots of water and resurfacing for air. The only thing I would call a puzzle in this level is underwater, really large, and easy, and is made much more annoying by the fact that you have to keep resurfacing for air halfway through solving. Then after this, there's a section where you have to pull four levers and spin a wheel three times all without resurfacing, because the first lever raises the water level to remove the air in the chamber. You can't un-pull the first lever after it's pulled, dying from lack of air just restarts you a long way away, and the fact that you can't even descend directly downwards in a narrow passage makes it seem like there's not enough time to get to the wheel to turn it three times. This is where I gave up, as there was no feedback of \"you can't un-pull this lever\" when I tried it (making me think I hadn't aligned the reticle correctly).\n\nWith regards to art, I do like the minimalist surrealist style (though it doesn't appeal to me quite as much as, say, [i]Lemma (demo)[/i] or [i]Mind: Path to Thalamus[/i]). There are drawings on some walls that seem to reveal some sort of a narrative about a child growing up and falling off a cliff, but given that I gave up during the third level, I honestly can't say more about this.\n\nI'm a staunch believer in gameplay before aesthetics, and this sort of game is why. Nobody is going to care about your game's narrative if they give up playing because the gameplay is too annoying. Get the gameplay right first, THEN you can think about making your game pretty!\n\nIn short, a very much un-playtested piece of art masquerading as a puzzle game. For the price of 7 GBP? Not worth it at all; I would hesitate to even play this for free. While this game is no Flow Match or Rolling Shapes and doesn't deserve a place in my \"POS\" category, you will get much, MUCH more enjoyment for the same price from Linelight, another minimalist puzzler with abstract narrative, instead.", "timestamp_updated": 1495809859, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493479070, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "31469980", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501091", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1493480891, "steamid": "76561198361071651", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Puzzle game, with amazing atmospheres and smart puzzling ideas, but very weak mechanic, and poor game play.", "timestamp_updated": 1493577314, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493577314, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "31429223", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500787", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1493431214, "steamid": "76561198042294407", "num_games_owned": 576, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "1.
