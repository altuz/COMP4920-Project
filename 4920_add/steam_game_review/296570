Game never ceases to offer a challenge.\n+ Story. It is cool and very original at parts.\n+ Play value, even tho' most of it relies on backtracking and combat, it still feels satisfying in that area.\n+ Balance. Even when you think game is being unfair to you many times, sooner youll understand it is your fault.\n+ Old school, hardcore rpg satisfaction.\n+ Has very affordable price considering the content.\n+ Gfx and sfx does its job. Could have been better for sure, but it doesnt lack.\n\nCons:\n- It might be too confusing or hard for newcomers.\n- Since its long, it could be tiresome to return to it if you gave a break for a long time.\n- Might be considered too grindy at parts.\n\n7/10 If you are an oldschool/hard/hardcore rpg game fan (im talking about amiga-commodore era), dont miss that one. Otherwise, be ready to get punished a lot and grind a lot. If grinding or a hard rpg game is not for you, escape. I loved the game and im on the watch for the developer.

Something that doesn't quite feel like a dungeon crawler, and with a good compliment of party members. This game is affordable and easily fits that bill. \n\nThis is an old-school RPG. Your hand is not going to get held. Battles are not grind-y, and are not easy to win. You cannot merely click through to defeat an enemy. Some battles (not boss battles!) can take upwards of 5 to 10 minutes to resolve. You may die often in the game due to ignorance, or not recognizing another way to solve a situation. There are puzzles that are not always easy.\n\nIts extremely enjoyable to find a real party-based RPG, having felt like there's been an abject lack of them available. You get one default jack-of-all-trades hero who is not very good, but the rest of the party options are really fun - Soldier, Barbarian, Bard, Archane Warrior, Cleric, Summoner, Thief,  Paladin and Sorcerer (maybe I forgot one?) are available to use, and each has a totally separate list of abilities.\n\nAllegedly I am about 1/4 of the way through the game and am about 15-20hrs in. Its extremely enjoyable to visit an old-school RPG world. The story is very basic, and is not going to engross you, but some characters and situations manage to entrhall you. The world created is quite detailed, and fun to be involved in, though.\n\nIf you're looking for something that feels old school, this is absolutely worth the $9.99 - $19.99 that you'll pay based on sale or regular price.

This is an amazing gem of a game. The music is absolutely gorgeous, the graphics are beautiful with their own charm, and the game play is really nice and addictive too. I love the transition from top-down during exploration mode to first person turn-based during combat mode. The combat reminds me of games like Ancients 1 and 2, and other games like that from back in the day. The setting is so non-D&D/non-Tolkien that it pulls me in and satisfies me in ways that other fantasy games that rely too heavily on the Tolkienesque tropes fail to do. All in all, this game is great for those late nights when you wish to relax but still be challenged in a non-twitch fps way.

This means you need both hands at the keyboard. No, there is no \"auto run\" option in the settings.\n- Also, to rest you need (to buy or gather) food - a concept that has vanished from RPGs many years ago because it does not add anything valuable to gameplay.\n- At nighttime you need torches or magic, or your screen is going to be pretty dark, which again impacts ease of play for me.\n\nMaybe there are strategies to avoid all this impacting gameplay too much, but it demotivated me enough to keep playing.", "timestamp_updated": 1505191355, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505191355, "votes_down": 21}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 313, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 72, "total_reviews": 385}}
