The rules are way too over-engineered with multiple phases for each player on each turn including complex mathematical equations based off of different pools of cards which distributes tokens... im telling you... way too complicated... the art is okay but you cant see barely any of it, and forget about reading text, that is unless you zoom on each card one by one. None of the mechanics are very intuitive but I also found that the game was not very good at teaching the control interface either and found myself just kind of mashing at things more than once.", "timestamp_updated": 1505113060, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505028667, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 14, "total_reviews": 25}}
