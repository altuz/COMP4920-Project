Reminds me of the Donkey Kong games which also had carts on rails and stuff like that.\n\nYou change the destination of the jelly (it\u2019s not a pudding dammit!) protagonist by manipulating the tracks. You can activate special abilities to neutralize monsters. You have to get the jelly to the end.\n\nIt\u2019s fun and easy to get the hang of. It becomes more challenging and complex. It helps to out your actions.\n\nProbably worth the $6.99 full price.\n\nClick [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SatanovichZ1/videos]here[/url] for more let\u2019s play videos =)", "timestamp_updated": 1404964623, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403938284, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "11196818", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499667", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405049866, "steamid": "76561198066999674", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fun and simple game.
