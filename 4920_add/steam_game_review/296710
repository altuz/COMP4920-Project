I hope you're happy with yourselves.\n\nBut anyways yeah, intense survival horror game here, I definitely recommend if you're looking for something to scare you so bad that your heart flutters kick in.

I think one thing that contributes to that is the kind of steep price tag.  $17.99 is a bit pricey for the content.  Don't get me wrong, the game is a lot of fun and definitely is a title that any horror fan should experience.  However, I still feel the price tag is a bit too high for what the game offers.  I do hope that the developers add a multiplayer aspect to the game.  Two (or more) survivors trying to outwit the monster and escape sounds like a really fun experience.  Also, a mode where a person controls the monster instead of the AI might work out well.  Team Junkfish, you really have a gem with Monstrum.  Please, don't neglect it for your future projects.", "timestamp_updated": 1506072602, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506072602, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 475, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 49, "total_reviews": 524}}
