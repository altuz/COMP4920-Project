Its sprites and animations aren't terrible, and have a bit of elegance to them but the controlling of the game itself and the layout of its levels feels like a very poor Flash game. I appreciate what setting and tone the creators were trying to go for, but with shoddy controls and mostly boring platforming and combat, it's simply not fun to play.", "timestamp_updated": 1500106446, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500106446, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 16, "total_reviews": 55}}
