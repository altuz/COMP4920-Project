Check.\n-Customizable mechs? Check.\n-Cool art style?

You literally go into a game, pick 3 tanks you want to use, then jump into a match  and jump around using your assorted weapons and attachments to kill your opponent.\n\nPros:\n1)  I haven't encountered any crashes or gameplay detracting bugs, which is really impressive for an early release title, especially having played it on a shitty Mac laptop as well as my gaming PC.\n\n2) I managed to get into a game with the devs, and they were really transparent and appreciative of feedback.  \n\n3) The combat FEELS impactful (with a caveat I'll mention below).   When you launch mega rockets, or spark rockets, or spam the lightning bolt gun, the sounds and visuals are really satisfying when you hit.\n\n4) The turrets - There's things besides the enemies that are hazardous to your health in an active way.  It kinda makes it feel like the level itself is a 3rd side in the fight.\n\n5) The level size is great for the sizes of the team you'd expect.  They don't feel oppressively large, even if you're fighting 1v1 in the heaviest, slowest tank you can make.\n\nCons:\n1) This is the caveat to the impactful combat pro above: The photon shotgun doesn't feel like a shotgun at all.  It feels and sounds like I'm flinging pink confetti at my opponent with gravel mixed in.  Also the fact that the damage falloff goes from 100% to 0% after a very short distance instead of a gradual falloff (100% at the first range increment, 50% in the second, 20% in the third, for example)  makes the weapon nigh unusable, given the energy limitations of the game.  If this were any less severe I'd attribute it to 'balancing issues', and 'early release'.\n\n2) Early release means weapon balance is still being tweaked, but this is something that could be best solved by having more players.  \n\nVerdict:\nPlay this game, and get your friends to play it too!\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1457571710, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457571710, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "21722113", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493456", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1458361618, "steamid": "76561197970763331", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "This game has pretty good intense MP action.
