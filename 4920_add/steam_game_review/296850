AGD interactive and Infamous adventures have done a great job in preserving these games and giving them a little twist.  Al Emmo keeps with the spirit of these old games. Adventure, Puzzles with a quirky sense of humor. It is an original game that will keep you entertained.  Adventure games from this era keep you really engaged.  Talk to everyone, click on everthing and think outside the box. Unlike todays action games it is not a series of quick mouse clicks and constant explosions. Focus is on charater development and story. Goal is to immerse yourself into the game and get to know the characters.

The developer has apparently made several improvements since its initial release.\n\nAl Emmo is a true, classic-style adventure game with challenging puzzles and hotspots to explore in every scene. The music and sound effects are especially nice. There are all kinds of unique narrator responses, which makes trying all kinds of silly actions all the more fun.\n\nThe interface is very clear with labeled hotspots and easy to use controls. Double-clicking to run is also a welcome option.\n\nThis game is a great value and will keep you busy and entertained for many hours. At this price you can hardly go wrong.\n\nSome people in the reviews have complained about the risque humor. Well, I liked it. Maybe I'm immature, but I did laugh when the train station employee said, \"I don't have any other services to offer. And I do have a wife\" after I offered him money. It's a silly, fun game, people.

Its weaknesses are dwarfed by its strenghts however and it is a very recommendable experience that the developper should be proud to stand by.\n\nAl Emmo & Dutchman mine is basically an indie leisure suit larry made in AGS (Adventure Game Studio Engine), it has less fan service, and it is set in an anachronistic world ( a la monkey island) with a western flavor. The voice acting is really AAA grade, the art is for the scenery is excellent but has scaling issues due to the engine and is full of sprites rather than smooth on higher resolutions. The musical score is underwhelming and more often than not absent, instead replaced by scenery noises and a few notes here and there. The light heartedness and excellent sense of humor, especially the dichotomy between the narrator and the protagonist, really helps carry this title forward, and by the time those elements start to wear out their novelty you may find that the main protagonist has grown on you despite all his flaws. Puzzle difficulty is about average, with everything being mostly logical, but I did use a walkthrough to spare myself frustration. I advise trying the Universal Hint System (UHS) instead. I found the 3D rendered characters clashed somewhat with the 2D environments and would hope that if sequels are considered this be adressed.\n\nI learned while reading reviews that this developper was responsible for remaking King`s Quest 1-3 and Quest for Glory 2 in Adventure Game Studio Engine. I remember seeing those remakes made to be played in what seemed like a King Quest V engine and they looked great, so it is good to see that they ventured into their own series after the experience they got from remaking other`s games.

The story lacks the weight that would drive a more serious plot; there's no underlying urgency or driving force. As a result, I felt like I could stop at any time.\n\nWith that said, I enjoyed the humor and the story quite a bit, more than enough to see the game through to the end. I also enjoyed the growth of the protagonist from a shallow and pitiable (but likable) character into a much stronger and more complex individual.\n\nThere are also other things I liked about the game. The puzzles are solid, challenging and enjoyable. The artwork is simply stunning. The supporting characters are fun and interesting. The music, while not particularly memorable, complemented the settings perfectly.\n\nOverall, the only element I felt that had weakness was the story. Al Emmo would have benefited from having a darker undertone clearly woven into the story right from the beginning. This element would have contrasted the humor and ultimately strengthened it.
