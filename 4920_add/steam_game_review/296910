It's fun for a few minutes at a time, but eventually grinds on your nerves with it's lack of overall polish. It's sprites and tiles are as drab and boring as it's forgetful grating chiptunes soundtrack; it simply lacks polish that other games in it's genre offer. What 8BitBoy does have going for it is it's skillfully executed level design which simply keeps the game together as a whole. Overall, you're getting all the polish in the game that the dollar you payed with offers.\n\nThere were things I both liked and disliked about 8BitBoy that you should take into consideration before buying:\n\n+ Collecting 100 coins gives you a roulette that cycles through all the powerups in the game. You can hold this item and use it when desired, similar to holding an item in \"Super Mario World\".\n+ Branching paths in the level design often reveal hidden secrets which reward you for exploration, some of which allow you to \u201cwarp\u201d to other worlds, skipping entire parts of the game.\n+ Can jump on enemies to kill them!\n\n- Powerups consist of a fireball, or fireball, or another fireball.\n- Has a single cutscene that's shown before the start of a new game; albeit, not animated and is told via a wall-of-text in slides.\n- Has a tutorial that's you're forced to play.\n- Pausing the game forces awkward navigation. Instead of navigating up and down with arrow keys or joysticks, you must navigate manually moving the mouse cursor to select the option you want, regardless of using a mouse.\n- You lose ALL your powerups you've carefully been saving if you take a single hit, or die.\n- A lot of the game's level design is made up of non-modular tiles which stack on top of one another, it takes away from the game's overall level of polish. Some levels do sport modular tiles, like ground tiles; however, others such as dungeons simply don't and are mostly made up of spammed tile placement.\n- Enemies are mostly re-used and lack diversity.", "timestamp_updated": 1501895522, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501865030, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33651329", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489055", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1454815714, "steamid": "76561198153867351", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Just go play a Mario game.
