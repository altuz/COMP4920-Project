Then another 50 hours working out those systems and starting to actually game the game.\n\nNow I'm getting more value out of the thing by actually planning, in detail, my expeditions before I run them. This approach reveals the sheer genius behind the game design and exquisite balancing. \n\nFor each expedition, you're trying to work out a sweet spot between (a) your choice of three characters (from a menagerie of 24 total), (b) your expedition pathway - five expeditions per game, selected from 14 expedition locations, (c) your character upgrade pathways; (d) your campfire chats; (e) your approach to encounters - aggressive? devious? friendly\"; (f) the items you are intending to prioritise getting, and what bonuses to pull off them; (g) your town-building options (research pathway and entourage). \n\nSorting out the interactions among all of these interrelated systems is loads of fun. You always have to make some compromises, you can never quite cover all the skill bases you'd like. Basically you're trying to set up a snowball of resources that continues to build throughout the game... sometimes the snowball grows way faster than you imagined it, other times it seems to just run flat. \n\nThe joy of discovering an unusual approach to all of the above - it's just immensely rewarding. I only just managed to finally get a score of over 10,000 - which is sort of the ultimate accomplishment in the game. Now I find out reading on the forums that scores of over 17,000 are possible - so clearly I still have a long way to go building a better snowball! \n\nAside from the strategising, the game is wonderfully atmospheric. The cartoon graphics have grown on me a lot, they are full of personality and I can only congratulate the character designers (text and graphics) for creating 24 highly evocative mini-characters with just a few strokes of the pen, and a few sentences of text.\n\nAny cons? Not many... I have encountered some glitches, and the game crashes on me about one session out of 20. Some of the encounters are a bit too vague and could use some more imaginative drafting. That's all I can think of!\n\nI can only recommend this game in the highest of terms for anybody who enjoys strategy, puzzles, and adventure games, and who appreciates a game that can be played quickly, but can also be meticulously planned for a deeper experience. \n\nOh, and you have to be happy with randomness! If RNG makes you aggro, seek elsewhere.
