(Necropolis Zombie Joke)\n\nI must have spend my youth on 3 games\n- Diablo II, Age of Empires and Heroes of Might & Magic. \nI was so excited as to what the HD would bring, however this is only the vanilla version of the game, and a lot of content is missing. \nYou can get it here though: [Spoiler] Get it on GoG.com instead. [/Spoiler]\n\n[h1] Thumbs Up\t[/h1]\nYou veterans don't care about the HD because \"hey, we grew up with the pixies\" (Conflux joke) and it's still one of the best games in my opinion. \nThe upgraded graphic is still a nice touch; however it's like putting make-up on a pretty girl, not the biggest change, and you might not even look further than her chest.\n\nMultiplayer is actually good and easy to play among steam-friends. \nHowever playing multiplayer against strangers often leads to people quitting during the first few minutes, if the map isn't in their favor. \n\nYou have all the creatures, spells, and buildings like in the old days, except Conflux is missing. - The whole diversity in skills and stats which still makes this game one of the best strategy games in history. \n7 campaign scenarios, around 50 skirmish maps, a local multiplayer mode and a map editor.\n\nYou can play in windowed mode - good for watching movies while waiting for your opponent. \n\n[h1] Thumbs Down\t[/h1]\nThis is not the complete expansion, meaning you don't have the Armageddon's Blade & The Shadow of Death expansions. \nNo Conflux, which is really needed against an op Necropolis player. \n\nIt's cheaper to buy this game on GoG and you even get the expansions there. \n\nYou can't revisit places by space-bar, you have to run back and forth and loose movement. Often not a big deal, but can determine a win or loss.\n\nApparently you can't install or create mods for this game on steam - I don't care much for it, but a lot negative reviews include this.\n\nYou can't change the difficulty in the campaigns, so it was really easy to beat, since I've done it before in the past #no_life.\n\n[h1] Closing Comments\t[/h1]\nStill one of my favourite games, but it's really not worth buying it here on steam, when you can't have a thousand half-naked pixies. \n\nHow to beat 10 games on each difficulty easily. \n[spoiler] You have to beat 10 games on each difficulty, which can be done quick -\nSince the game auto-saves, you can just reload your auto-save and beat the same game in \"1 turn\", it will count.\n\nI read that cheat-codes work for achievements in normal games, but not in the campaigns - but I haven't confirmed that.\t[/spoiler]", "timestamp_updated": 1505168536, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505078589, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "35315984", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498218", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505585981, "steamid": "76561198348396963", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The Game Dont Start.", "timestamp_updated": 1506727989, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506727989, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34873696", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498812", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503856883, "steamid": "76561198354058198", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I like the game, however GOG supports the expansions, including conflux town and many neutral characters.", "timestamp_updated": 1505088708, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505088708, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 744, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 13, "total_negative": 469, "total_reviews": 1213}}
