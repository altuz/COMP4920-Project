Pacing is very well done, introducing something new almost every map, however most things won't see the light of day very often, which is kind of a shame.\n\nThe element of cloning / messing with humanoid DNA is surprisingly well done and easy to figure out, but hard on decision making early game. Sadly the majority of the time you'll stick with the same setup, and once you get a certain DNA type, you're steamrolling over everything, so that might have been a bit over the top.\n\nMusic and sound effects are splendid. Fits the overall theme and general feel of the game and doesn't tire very easily. I suspect that if you're a grinding kind of person, it might get old a bit but overall it's very nicely implemented.\n\nThe graphics are plain yet functional. Enemy design is amazing, and general aesthetics are pleasant to the eyes. No sharp contrasts, little pieces of decor left and right, very fun :)\n\n\nSadly like almost everything, there are some downsides to this awesome title as well.\n- Some DNA unlocks are vastly overpowered even from the getgo. There are a few that are just gamebreaking and they even joke about removing the one that has the biggest impact.\n- There's a giant friggin laser that pierces and has tons of potential, yet you cannot rotate it. This is such a shame.\n- The game is very very short overall. With some tactical insight you won't have much problems clearing each mission, and \"very hard\" isn't really very hard. Hard isn't excessively hard either.\n\nOverall it's in the very positive for me. A fun little break from other things with a light yet sensible story about a day in the life of a robot employee. (sadly the ending sort of wrecked the whole feel about \"no these are my humans and you won't touch them dammit\" and in my personal perspective that's a shame, but i see the design choice)\n\nGenerally for people that are madly in love with tower defense / general strategy but this one is surprisingly \"entry level\" if that was ever a classification, so if you're new to the genre, this is absolutely for you :) It's somewhere between 4-8 hours in length depending how well you perform, so sadly nothing excessive, but worth the asking price. \n\nGreat game, well executed, solid works. 8/10", "timestamp_updated": 1500783666, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500783563, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 40}}
