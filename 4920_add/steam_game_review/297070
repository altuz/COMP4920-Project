Curiosity got the best of me and I bought the second part just to see how the story progresses. \n\nThis time navigating around the game world is so clumsy and terrible it's practically impossible to find your way around the game world. When you hover a cursor over a medieval village scene half of the screen says \"exit\". There are actually several different exits, though, but how are you supposed to tell them apart when the open scenery looks like you could go anywhere?\n\nSolving the puzzles is awkward. Half of the time I knew exactly what I was supposed to do, but I wasn't clicking stuff in the right order. Or at the right time. Or I didn't quite find the right spot to click. Sometimes the protagonist clearly said that he can't do this or that, but sometimes he didn't. So I just fiddled around and hoped for the best, basically. Gotta give this a thumbs down, even though I like the atmosphere and the fact that the protagonist is a bit of a d1ckhead.\n\nOh, and the game is buggy. Better save often or you might lose an item and get stuck in a loop when a cutscene glitches.", "timestamp_updated": 1446490254, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446489141, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "24441822", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515150", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1469104293, "steamid": "76561198099216008", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I wish I had a different rating system than Yes/No... But don't we all?\nI really liked Book 1, in spite of all its shortcomings, as you can see in my review of it. Most of what I loved about Book 1 is sadly absent from Book 2.\n\nTHE COOL:\n+ Improved graphics, a lot!\n+ Music and atmosphere are wonderful, dark, creepy, but not too overdone.\n+ Nicolas is still a bada** snarky a**hole. His blessing of his meal is absolutely priceless.\n+ Some puzzles are ok, interesting story.\n+ Voice acting is ok, depending on the language.\n\nTHE BAD:\n- WHY NO MORE LATIN AUDIO????? I had to settle for Italian!\n- No more nerdy historical references.\n- The English translation lacks accuracy (my Italian is less than basic, and even I noticed). I know word games are tough (\"Dominicani... Domini cani\"), but at least it should be clear in the translation/subtitle that it was an insult, or it seems like Nicolas got pi**ed over nothing.\n- From Part 7, subtitles decided to disappear, and nothing I did brought them back. I had to switch the audio to English.\n- Walking around can be excruciating because of the controls.\n\nTHE AWFUL:\n= Sometimes, when you don't do things in the order that the game \"expects\" you to do, the next step never gets triggered, even if you already did absolutely everything you were supposed to do. Then you have to go back to a previous save.\n= Some of the puzzles are the single most effing annoying thing I played in a long time. There is a difference between challenging (making you think, or demanding manual skill) and just plain annoying to make it last longer. Here is a spoiler that I won't even block:\nAt some point, you're going up a mountain with paths that work like a spiral-shaped maze. You need to find 15 stones scattered around. The maze is very long winding up and down, the priest walks at snail pace, gets stuck often, making you have to go back and forth numerous times, making this \"challenge\" a snooze fest. And that's not all. If you don't find the stones in a certain order, the game glitches, some disappear from your inventory (even though they were there before), and you have to start over from a previous save.\n= Your character randomly recites your undone objective every time you change scene. At first, this is ok. However, near the end, this starts repeating more and more often, until it's every few seconds, which became insanely annoying. There is no way of avoiding this.\n= In the same spirit, some of the NPC recite stuff that, at first, adds to the realism, but when it repeats every couple of seconds while you're examining things or whatever, it gets extremely annoying, and there is no way of skipping it.\n\nAt this point, as I was still playing probably because I'm too obsessive to leave a game unfinished, Corona yelling \"I must get out of this damned place\" and \"I'm tired of listening to such stupidity\" was so meta I just had to laugh.\n\nI was sad about not enjoying this game, because I was really looking forward to it. I certainly did enjoy parts of it, when I could get past the annoying text repeats and the annoyance of some of the puzzles, the story was cool. But in general, the only thing that improved from Book 1 was graphics quality... and the rest either stayed the same or worsened.
