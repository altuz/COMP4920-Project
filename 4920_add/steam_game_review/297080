The game mechanics work and it's pick up and play, the space environment sets this game apart from other airplane landing games and it works. It has some bugs and I have a few minor quibbles with the gameplay, but it's worth the purchase.\n\n[h1]PROS: [/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*] [b]Fun and absorbing.[/b] The game sucks you in as you try and move ships from one wormhole to the other. You have to compensate for inertia, asteroids and even other ships, all while doing it as fast as possible.\n    [*] [b]The devs didn't reinvent the wheel[/b], they just made it cooler. You're going to be familiar with the game concepts almost immediately and that's a good thing. Sometimes you just want gameplay mechanics to be tried and true and in this case they are. The difference now is that the mechanics incorporate the realities of space flight instead of terrestrial flight. It's a clever twist on a theme that we know works.\n    [*] [b]Station Building.[/b] In gameplay terms it's sort of like having to land the airplane while building new parts of the airport at the same time. It adds some tension to the game and makes it far more interesting than your average control tower game. It adds a whole new tactical element to the game because there are potential upgrades if you pass a level, which in turn might make the next level easier.\n    [*] [b]Responsive Devs.[/b] This isn't really why the game is fun [i]per se[/i] but I mention it because this is an indie game and it has some bugs. The steam forum page has a bugs sticky and they listen to the bug reports and send out game patches. They also included a bug reporter within the game so all you have to do is copy-paste the text in the forum to let them know what went wrong.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*] [b]You can't remove stations.[/b] I don't understand why this can't be implemented. It seems so basic to be able to click on one and delete it or sell it for some of your money back.\n    [*] [b]It's Buggy.[/b] I've experienced crashes to desktop, my right mouse button not working, and a misalignment of text vs where you actually click. I reported all these things to the developer and they've been able to send out a patch within a day that solved a number of my problems. I still get some bugs, but the response rate from the devs is great.", "timestamp_updated": 1443463272, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443401677, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "18209633", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479839", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1443302858, "steamid": "76561197970615726", "num_games_owned": 540, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Take a little getting used to be surprisingly addictive.
