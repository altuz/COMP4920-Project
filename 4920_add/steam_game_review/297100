About a month later, they updated. Since I could finally play with my gamepad, I decided to try it. About four missions in, the game suffers from an obnoxious turret scene which was not balanced or fun and terrible out of place in a dog-fighting game. BUT....\n\n-As many people pointed out, the music isn't terrible. I actually enjoyed it and didn't really notice a lack of variety. I was busy blasting fools with laser guns.\n\n-Many people complain about the voice-acting. Why? It is terrible, but it is also kind of funny (as in, so bad it is almost good). I am disappointed because it seems like a little more effort on the parts of the voice-actors could have improved everything, but really, the cheesy one-liners the characters deliver are sort of better when they aren't delivered seriously.\n\n-Bad/Linear Plot- The missions and overall story line are not very strong. Each mission is fairly short and I'm not really seeing much continuity seven missions in. But I got to shoot things in space in almost every mission and they were kind enough to add either amusing moments or serious ones to make me feel like there was a reason for shooting things in space.\n\n-My only real complaint is slow turning. The controls on the gamepad are fine (except for the right joystick controlling throttle in some unexplained way?) but the turning speed for some of these ships is monstrous. Every time I do a 180 manuever or just try a regular turn with the left joystick it seems like my ship and the screen is stuck in mud. It isn't lag, just slow turning. Weird. Not game-breaking though.\n\n-Super stupid turret mission. Hated it. I quit playing for 6 months after failing that so many times.\n\nOverall, this is an amusing game with good visuals. It should probably be bought on sale. But keep in mind (I think most of the negative views failed to remember this) its regular price is $4. This isn't a game that gets featured in Gaming Weekly. It's a bargain bin game made by a small group of artists and developers. They took the time to TRY and build something epic. They failed (it's good, but not epic). Instead of trying to scam us out of 20 bucks like some other steam 'developers', they put down a fair price and occasionally have sales. That's decent and you can't ask for a better bargain.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1442461938, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442461938, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "10540866", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 55, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558453", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403264795, "steamid": "76561198032161980", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "If you don't want to read this I also made a video\n\nhttp://youtu.be/NkhhqjML0oI\n\nWas really surprised by the introduction cinematic. I don\u2019t don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t just use that for their trailer. I think that Disney might want their Star Destroyers back though\n\nSo what do you do in this game? You fly around from one waypoint to another Engaging enemies. Appears to be completely scripted Nothing spectacular or particularly original But blowing stuff up can be satisfying.\n\nGameplay pretty much what you would expect Feels kind of like Freelancer. Not that I played that game a lot. But controlling the game is very simple\n\nIt\u2019s not really hard. There seems to be an auto aim when you bring your reticle close enough to the target. This may not be so much the case in harder difficulties. It\u2019s one of those space combat games which tell where to shoot to hit the enemy. Theres a tutorial which will give you an overview of gameplay. You unlock weapons after each mission\n\nThere seems to be some story elements. Something about finding a derelict spacecraft in the first mission. In a bit of a twist. The second mission was actually a race. Which had you attempting to fly through a series of burning circles faster than your opponent. Third mission was an \u2018escort\u2019. Half way through there was a weird ill fitting cutscene. After which I found myself in control of a turret. Not sure how I got there.\n\nThe dialogue is not that bad. First time I heard the scientist dude speak I laughed. One part early on was unintentionally amusing. Your wingman is tragically destroyed. After she flies straight to her death and is obliterated by an explosion. The main character still stops calls out are you okay? are you there or something to that effect. Thing tends to be a bit disjointed. But the voice acting is not always that bad. Theres lots of cheesy jokes which are sometimes actually funny. I found it doesn\u2019t get to the point where it\u2019s annoying.\n\nYou can select different, ships and loadouts between missions. Menu was kind of weird kept taking me back to the previous menu while I attempted to browse items. Graphics seem good enough. Models weren\u2019t very detailed. Beams from large ships looked kind of lame. Space environment and effects look nice. Asteroids will actually break up into pieces if you shoot them. Character portraits look okay.\n\nSounds okay. Lot\u2019s of nice sci-fi ambient music and decent upbeat music in the menu and cinematics. Pretty much typical sort of shooting sounds and stuff. The menu has some of the same sounds from the original X-Com. Which i thought was cool.\n\nMy verdict\nThe game is not completely broken or annoying to play. You might find it fun. I\u2019d it\u2019s worth the price of $4. But maybe you should just get Freelancer instead? Or pay $5 to get into the Arena Commander alpha.\n\nThe most frustrating thing about this game for me in the end actually was that I couldn't run it in windowed mode. Even after trying to force it with third party programs. So I coudln't record it with FFsplit to do a video review. In fact you can't change the resolution at all.\n\nClick [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SatanovichZ1/videos]here[/url] for more let\u2019s play videos =)", "timestamp_updated": 1404964499, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403218126, "votes_down": 24}, {"recommendationid": "24813557", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542751", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1492905477, "steamid": "76561198057569693", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I consider myself a flight/space sim enthusiast.

The enemy AI is not good. It will either fly around aimlessly, or swarm you when it has other objectives. The male voice actor is horrendus, and the female voice is terrible text-to-speech.  The controls are worse than both of those.  I tried to play this with the mouse/keyboard controls, using a Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas, and a Logitech gamepad... none are usable, and they're all flawed in seperate ways.

What do you expect for \u20ac3,99? The next block buster Space Combat Shooter? Anyway, here's my, positive, review:\n\nBeyond Space is one of those few games that actually suprised me in a very pleasant way. After seeing it on Steam and buying it during a promotion, I booted it up and expected, well, just one of those casual space games.\nBut, oh boy, Beyond Space had me there.\n\nFirst, the art style (Graphics and the way things are presented on the screen) is just warm and nice to the eye. You instantly get the feeling that this game has been designed by people who have their own idea of a Space Combat Game. Which is kind of refreshing.\nThe ship models and basically all the other 3D thingies.., they're very rich and beautiful. This is also one of the few games with ships in the hangar that make me wonder: \"Hmm, which one do I like more? They all look so cool!\"\nThe sound and speech in this game are well done and really add to the story. For instance; the music in this game and the intro itself. Oh my, wow, just wonderful to listen to and to watch.\nThe controls are not that many, but respond just the way you would expect. fast and precise. I play this game with a game pad (Not the so much proclaimed X-Box Controller, But a genuine Windows PC Gamepad of a leading brand. X-Box Controllers where never meant to be used with Windows PC's. Do some historical research if you want to learn more about this topic), because I didn't like to play it with the keyboard/mouse and the X-52 Pro is a bit overkill for this game. (That's what I'm thinking anyway)\n\nSo far the only thing I didn't really understand, or kind of dislike, is the way missions are presented. At this moment, I've flown about 20 missions, all are just presented as a single, stand alone, map/level/mission. There's for some reason not really a feeling of \"connection\" between the seperate missions. As is with the games of \"Eterium\"/\"Free Space\" for instance. Maybe that's because you never really return to a flight deck or something similar. The mission just ends/fades out.\n\nBut, beside of that, Beyond Space is a very well made and welcome addition to any would be space fighter jockey.\nYou like Space Combat?

The trailer promised some huge space battles where you're one fighter among many other fighters among the huge starships pounding at each other. Yet it's seriously underdelivered. The missions seem to be completely disjointed with no progression. One mission you're playing scout for your space navy, then next mission you're a mercenary flying for some unknown benefactor, then next mission you're flying an obstacle course time trial! And yes, it's the same guy \"Max Walker\".  They even threw in a turret defense mission! \n\nThe writing is almost... high school bad. \"Hal\" was so idiotic it's basically the straight man for any sort of bad joke, taking things too literally. That Irish / Scottish accent is just ARGH! And why is he like in command of the fleet or something? He's basically the primary guy Walker talk to... not only fleet control, but scout report, jump gate control, and more. \n\nThe game is also notorious for \"giving\" you new weapons, but made it impossible to mount them. The scroll menus for the weapons and components (primary, secondary, shield, and booster) are IMPOSSIBLE to scroll. They require dragging with the mouse, and even then it's nearly impossible. Furthermore, once you did select it, you have to click an additional button to SELECT this weapon or component or else your scrolling were in vain. \n\nOnce in the cockpit, the visuals are good, but the controls are just... ARGH. None of the ships seem to turn fast enough, and enemy ships seem to be able to turn within its own length. And what's the point of rolling the ship port or starboard? Yet there are two buttons dedicated to that. They don't seem to actually evade anything. \n\nBack to the enemy's ridiculous turn rate. You chase down this enemy and you're right behind him, and a few seconds later, the enemy ship had managed to turn 120 degrees and flew past you WITHOUT slowing down. And what's worse, this happens from the smallest light fighters to even corvettes / gunboats that are much larger than fighters. And in this universe, corvettes have afterburners (WTF?!) and can pull away from you, even on full afterburners. \n\nThe weapons don't feel much different. Primary weapons are infinite ammo, being energy based. Any improvements are minor (like slightly higher firing rate, or trade firing rate for damage, and so on). The \"secondary\" weapons are either heavy guns or missiles, but with limited ammo that has no replenishment within mission... once you're out, you're out, period, and had to rely on guns only. \n\nThe weapons controls are also weird. With only two buttons, you'd think they'd just do one button for primary and one button for secondary, but no. It's one button to shoot, and one button to switch weapons. That's right, you can't shoot both guns together. ARGH! No \"all guns\" alpha strike! \n\nWhich brings me to my main complaint: the bosses. There are a couple boss fights in this game, where you need to take down a supership, that's heads and tails better than yours, but may also be escorted. The bosses are usually corvettes of some sort... but they are hardly slow moving. No, they are as fast, if not occasionally faster than you, and they have 360 tracking turrets so deadspots where you can't get hit are almost impossible to find (hint: try the \"bottom\")  They also launch missiles (sometimes) and may be escorted by fighters (sometimes). And you need to kill them by wearing them down... and yes, they can be shielded too.  So what usually happens is they keep lobbing missiles and turret shots at you, while you try to shoot them to wear down their shields so you can bust them with heavy weapons, but due to the bad turning radius of your own ship (and their cheating ships) you end up using all your heavy weapons to no appreciable effect, or got it half dead, then you got chewed to pieces when you try regular strafing runs. The bosses are just TOO HARD, too maneuverable. \n\nSound is not too bad, dialog is professionally recorded, and I'm sure the voice actors did what they could. But it's not a good script. Have to say though, visuals are gorgeous on 1680x1050, and didn't have to much with the resolution much. Just make sure your gamepad is connected and ready BEFORE you start the game, or else the game won't see it. period. \n\nAll in all, bad bosses, bad humor, missions that really make no sense, and so on, made this game ibarely tolerable, and you should instead pay for the classic Freespace 2 or even Descent: Freespace for about the same price and enjoy that instead.", "timestamp_updated": 1426669177, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426669177, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "10884725", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507157", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403903563, "steamid": "76561198027746721", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game's a bad mobile port, and it plays very much like a mobile port.

The truth is that I love space shooters -- ever since I was a kid.  With the price down to $4.00 and a recent update that fixed the controls (the biggest complaint among many early reviewers), I decided to go for it.  \n\nWell, it turns out that I was happily surprised by this game.  Foremost, I love the graphics and the space shots of this game.  The initial cutscene was just awesome.  I also enjoyed blowing up the bad ships since it has such cool explosions.  There really is a lot of eye candy in this game.\n\nThe controls have definitely been fixed and you can mostly use a gamepad (I'm using a wireless Xbox 360 controller).  It still needs some polishing (i.e. the tutorial still requires you have a keyboard even though you're using a gamepad) but I had no crashes and almost everything played well.  One time the maneuverability of my space ship slowed down and I couldn't tell whether it was intentional or a glitch.\n\nI found the level of difficulty not too hard or too easy.  I would say it plays more like an arcade game and less of a simulation (I hate complicated space simulations).  Nonetheless, it was definitely enjoyable so far and I didn't find it repetitive.\n\nI look forward in playing this game some more and I'm definitely hooked.  Therefore, if you were initially disappointed by the early reviews, I say give this game a shot since you might be pleasantly surprised as I was.\n\nAgain, it needs some tweaking and polishing, but overall I'm really enjoying the game.  It is definitely worth the price and then some!\n\n4 out 5 stars!", "timestamp_updated": 1404105867, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404105867, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "15199759", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1467761779, "steamid": "76561198105093558", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a very simplistic space fighter game with a linear story.

Interested? Continue reading below.\n\nThe starting intro animations are nicely made and you get hyped and want to play. But sadly the controlls are so  horrible that it is so hard to  hit anything. (I worked out the aim by moving up and down and shoot like freaking pirate.) The difficulty is unbalanced and hard on some missions.\n\nThe story for the game is ok but nothing special that havent been made before. Music ingame is quite nice to listen to and sfx are doing what they should. \n\nSomething that annoys me wich shuldnt is the ingame talking scenes with some avatars moving lips horrible. they are so badly animated i wonder where they did get the video animations from. I expected more after the intro, sorry but you will notice. I would preferable only have the avatars and the speech. The speech is ok, but the story can be a bit silly in some scenes.\n\nIts a converted game from pads or at least it feels like it. You will notice this mostly when you are in the hangar. Draging your mouse up and down dont work well when choosing your weapons or upgrades for your ship. Wich is so anoying that your probarly wont change them.\n\nThe game is not super bad and it can be enjoyable in short bursts. But dont expect a AA title. Recomended or not its up to you as a buyer to decide? Will you enjoy a game with horrible controlls where controlls is what makes up for the gametype? Go for it buy it. Or if you are like me who enjoys a budget game now and then. Buy it on SALE!.\n\nScore\nGFx 6-10 / SFx 4-10 / Music 8-10 / Gameplay 3-10 / Story 4-10", "timestamp_updated": 1448242970, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448242827, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "10595266", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498583", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403322847, "steamid": "76561198043898617", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Don't waste your time/money.
