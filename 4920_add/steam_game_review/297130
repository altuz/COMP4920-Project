This'll hopefully be good feedback for the devs, if they decide to read this.\n\n----\n\nThe game starts you out with a couple of bossfights. Edit: Actually, the entire game is only boss fights.\n\nThat's not really a problem (though is something they could've improved upon). Here's the real problem.\n\nThe first one is somewhat manageable, but the next two definitely feel like they were designed for people who've somehow already mastered the system after only one battle - or in other words, the devs who are already very used to the controls and timing.\n\nEverything is a one-hit-kill apparently, so you might find yourself restarting constantly a few times just trying to figure out not how to get smashed by the cube boss.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential - as the graphics and sounds are all fairly good. The graphics and animation are the reason I bought the game.\n\nEdit: After looking at the community guide and seeing what more bosses are like, yeah, there's a huge amount of lost potential here. A lot of the graphics and animation are really amazing. On top of that, a lot of the bosses look very creative.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay just doesn't check out.\n\n----\n\nBefore people go on about how I'm just a bad gamer who dislikes hard games, that assumption is wrong.\n\nThis game would have definitely been more well received...\n\n1. If it wasn't just boss fights, and there were actual creative Zelda-like normal enemies and areas to explore.\n\nYou know what makes me sad about Fez? It has [b]zero[/b] enemies and bosses. If that game had actual combat, it surely would've been something amazing, just like Super Paper Mario.\n\n2. If the game actually had a difficulty curve, instead of dropping you into what feels like endgame bosses.\n\nImagine if the first area were more forgiving and you at least had 3 hearts or whatever. The second and third cube bosses had weaker versions, while the ones you encounter here are the endgame hyper versions.\n\nThe game would've been overall more playable, and people would only be dropping out (if at all) near the endgame instead of the very start of your game.\n\nInstead of a playerbase of only people who put up with that stuff or really like a challenge, you could have a playerbase of pretty much any gamer.\n\n----\n\nAfter looking around on the community hub, I also came across that quick kills guide, which kind of immediately trivializes many bosses by showing you a way to beat many of them without the boss being able to get much of its attacks in.\n\nHonestly, it would've been better to throw these bosses in a more Zelda-like game with a little bit of back-and-forth, where you're going to have to actually survive the boss's mechanics for a bit, but you're also not a one hit kill.\n\nPerhaps that's the reason Link's arrows don't just instantly kill bosses for shooting them in the eye.\n\nOh, and I'm not kidding at all about making it [strike]easier[/strike] not an instant-kill game. It's actually very important.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZH2wGpEZVgE\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oi0sz_aXiGU\n\nI guess I can't imagine enemies like that eyeball cube not being an instant-kill, but perhaps the sequence where he \"rapidly moves towards your direction to crush you instantly\" could simply be one of his attacks, instead of what he does all the time, where he's otherwise normally slow and more manageable.\n\nIn the mean time, the cube would have more than just one health, so you wouldn't be able to cheese the boss from the start, and will actually have to fight it even if you look up a guide.\n\nA simple change like that also allows the laser attack to remain as an instant kill too.\n\nOverall, it'd feel much more like an actual boss fight that way.\n\n----\n\nI'm definitely looking forward to anything the devs of this game might make in the future, if they learn from the flaws of this game and improve upon them.\n\nIf I have to be really nitpicky, I think the magnet arrow thing is a little awkward or strange to use, and that they should try slightly different mechanics for the weapon. Perhaps I only had a problem with it because retrieving the arrow forces you to stand completely still, in a game where you should be constantly moving, so I can't do what I intuitively want to do, and retrieve it while walking.\n\nThat on its own isn't a big issue though. Perhaps it wouldn't have even been a problem if there were a difficulty curve that teaches you to deal with it being this way.\n\n----\n\nI understand that the devs like the difficulty of Dark Souls and the idea of challenging gameplay.\n\nBut I think that could've been retained by pushing it into the endgame.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm tempted to compare this game to the likes of literally any other 2D game, rather than 3D game.\n\nMaybe it just didn't feel fun to actually try and solve bosses beyond the slime boss. I had fun fighting the slime boss, because it felt manageable and I was able to learn how to beat it blindly.\n\nAs soon as I got to the eyecube and brainfreeze, this feeling was lost. Maybe it's because the slime boss actually had pseudo-health, so I thought I was actually damaging it when I wasn't. The heart of the slime boss kind of came out of nowhere for me, but I understood that that's what I was supposed to do immediately.\n\nI also had a good idea of what to do against eyecube and brainfreeze, but against them it felt a lot more difficult to actually properly land a hit on them, or to even retrieve your arrow after you lose it.\n\nIt was with those two bosses that I could tell that trying to land the hit on them would be stupidly difficult and require crazy timing. (Until I saw the quick kills guide that is).\n\nCompared to... I Wanna By The Boshy... it just didn't seem like it'd be as fun to actually overcome those walls.\n\nI played IWBTB all the way to the Kirby levels where your screen is constantly flipping, which I only dropped out of halfway in after getting tired by the screenflip mechanic.\n\nIn IWBTB, it was at least fun enough for me to overcome the rooms involved and progress.\n\nIf I had to say why, perhaps it's because there's a much more instantaneous respawn. I forget how close you respawn to where you die in that game, but I do remember it being very instant and quick to get back to where you go.\n\nThat kind of thing helps balance out a difficult game, as you at least get to keep going at it constantly. I've ran TF2 servers where a lot of instant-kill happens, and I always couple it with instant respawn to make up for that. Respawn times just aren't fun in an instant-kill environment.\n\nSo yeah, it was a little annoying having to wait for that very small few seconds or so to run all the way from spawn back to the boss I was trying to figure out.\n\nEdit: And it looks like my intuition isn't wrong here. Other people have complained about it too. Maybe it's a good thing Momodora put checkpoints right outside of boss rooms?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/297130/discussions/0/618458030655379691/\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/297130/discussions/0/358415738187079977/\n\nThe thing you want to capture is the frantic feeling of hitting a boss with difficult timing while dodging it, not so much being dropped out of the fight quickly for every little mistake or thing you need to learn.\n\n----\n\nBy the way. Mouse support?\n\nGood thing I just happened to buy a controller last week. But really.

You'll find both of these to be true with any game, not just this one. Games bug out. It happens. When it happens repeatedly, submit a bug report, email the company, talk to Customer Support if you're brave enough, but unless the game is something as dysfunctional as Journey of the Light or Soda Drinker Pro, don't go leaving poor reviews and hating on the developers because you found a bug or a glitch. Now, on to the next topic. Difficulty. YES, this is a difficult game. There's not really a counter argument to that other than that's the way it was designed. It's intended to be difficult, and executed quite well. Would I recommend this game to a friend? Depends on the friend.
