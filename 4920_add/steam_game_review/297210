Originally made for phones and the browser FAMAZE was a really fun little rogue-like that was perfect if you only had 5  minutes or so. The goal of FAMAZE is to find a key and to get to the end of the dungeon. In most rogue-likes, when you move, the monsters move too but in FAMAZE most monsters are stationary. They just block your way. Attacking monsters causes you and your foe to lose 1hitpoint. In order to stay alive you need potions that refill your life. The catch however is that you only have 2 inventory slots. This mechanic leads to alot of strategic thinking. FAMAZE also has a rather interesting lightning mechanic. If the light touches an enemy it turns into an healing item. This is an easy way of defeating your foes. So FAMAZE is a fun little rogue-like that is perfect to play while downloading a huge game or so ;D. If you want a strategic rogue-like that is really complex look somewhere else(ToME is perfect if you're looking for that;D) Simple but fun!", "timestamp_updated": 1414948266, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414948266, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "10264258", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508550", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1399475207, "steamid": "76561198006309036", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I got the game for $2.49, and I was fine paying that for this.

Given this, I am willing to recommend this game for the few hours that it may be enjoyable. The business tactics for this release on Steam may have been gritty, but at least it concludes well (other than the people who bought this game on relase, in the groupees bundle, or was gifted this by that person on your friends list that hates you).  I am satisfied now, 5/10.\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW: http://i.imgur.com/Ii1Fy82.png\nQuick answer: do not buy this. \nIt is a minimalistic maze roguelike, which sounds like a pretty good idea, but ends up lacking in so many areas:\n\n+ The hard difficulty is challenging\n+ It is a good \"I have nothing to do\" game\n+ Traps, units, and items are decently balanced\n+ Decent soundtrack\n\n= Minimalistic\n= It is fun for the first few hours  \n= It is indeed roguelike by every means\n= Uses their own assets, but they have also sold them, so the game ends up looking generic.\n\n- Repetitive\n- Lacks options. How so? No options at all. Also, it has no key rebindings.\n- It is nearly impossible to lose on the easier of the two difficulties and requires a lot of time and luck to get through the harder difficulty\n- One mistake on hard can easily make you restart the entire maze\n- Way overpriced for what it is [strike]and can currently be played for free (w/ ads, etc.) at http://jayisgames.com/games/famaze/ [/strike] (Currently this game has NO differences from the free version other than slightly larger display and no distractions around the screen.)\n- Edit: http://www.agame.com/game/famaze\n- Too simplistic\n- It is basically a glorified maze with roguelike elements that turns into more of a perfectionist puzzle than a roguelike.\n\nIn conclusion, it is in your best interest to stay away from this game. If you are really interested in a luck based challenge, a strategy intensive puzzle game, or an extremely easy roguelike with RPG as minimal as the style, than this game can be decent. Overall, it is lacking so much to be justified as anything over $1  or your equivalent of nearly free. While I personally like the minimalistic style this game chose to go, I do not feel like it offers much in comparison to other roguelikes of the same price.", "timestamp_updated": 1410486077, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "17", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1399326895, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "10030305", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495551", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1399790585, "steamid": "76561197993930568", "num_games_owned": 4439, "num_reviews": 350, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "UPDATE: Game was bundled in groupees bundle on 14 May, a mere 9 days after release. I don't feel glad I supported this by buying it on initial release on steam. I feel like I've been kicked in the teeth by Oryx. \n\n------------------------------------------\nI really want to mark this neutral- half way between recommend yes and recommend no.\n\nFirst of all, this game apparently used to be free on the web at the official web site, but now it links to steam instead when you click to play. The game is available here though:\n\nhttp://jayisgames.com/games/famaze/\n\n...and playing it will give you the best idea of what it's like.\n\nThe good parts are that this is a charming, simple game with pixel art sprites, nice chiptune style music and a polished feel.\n\nThe bad parts are the complete lack of options which means you have to play in a window approximately the height of your desktop (at least on my 1920x1080) and a third of the width. You can't redefine the keys, which is unforgivable. For the record keys are cursor up left down right, 1 and 2 to use objects, m for map, space for pickup, q to quit and esc to cancel.\n\nIt's also a bit weird that Oryx are using their own sprite set which has been sold to a lot of developers, making their own game look generic in the graphics department. It's also a bit disappointing that this, unlike the other games using the sprites, isn't a true roguelike because you're not moving freely about on a 2d grid with monsters chasing you and so on.
