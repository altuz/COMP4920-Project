However I have to say that I don't recommend this at $10, let alone $20, given the limited amount of content here.  This game could turn into something very interesting given the addition of multiplayer.  10 missions and skirmish isn't going to keep my interest very long at all.  Especially given that the forces are a couple types of infantry, and light/med/heavy tanks.  All missions are \"hold objective zone\".  Let me put it this way, I've won the first three games I've played in 4 turns, because I rush the flags and sit on them.  \n\nWave this one off, and circle back when they've finished the content.

The AI will stubbornly keep half of it's force on the other side of the map whilst you decimate the other half with your whole army. It also fails to identify threats and will spend time shooting at weak unthreatening units whilst your powerful units are decimating theirs.\n\nUnfortunately there is a lot to like about this game but because singleplayer is the only option and the AI is so predictable it fails to deliver what it could.

Just give me my forces and start the battle! This game is one of those perfect games for just sitting with a coffee or beer and pretzles and just enjoying a nice quick battle or two or three.  In an hour you can see the tutorials, play a couple skirmishes, and be right up to speed on how to play. I can see the love that went into the conversion of a table top game into a blast of a computer game. I have never played an actual table top game, but I have always enjoyed playing computer versions of them. This game is just pure fun. It rewarding to see your good decisions pay off as you command your units to do your bidding. I hope this team makes more games of this quality. As always there is room for improvement and this title could certainly stand to have some single scenarios beyond the campaign to play out, although the skirmish mode is a terrific replayable bit of fun!

Together with the games other unusual rules,  it feels like it's more faithful to the challenges a real battle field commander would face, and it gives you a unique wargaming experience.\n* At least for the parts of the game that are well polished,  the production values seem outstandingly good for an indie developer.\n*  No significant bugs at all  (At least not for me, Im on Win 8.1)\n* Nice music and good ingame sounds (could do with more variation though)\n\nNeutral:\n* The UI is ok but far from excellent.  Took me about an hour to learn the controls, unlike say Armageddon 4000 where I was up and running in 3 mins.  Less than optimal use of small fonts, have to sit quite close to the screen to read the full unit info.\n\nCons:\n* Not many units or scenarios\n* Very little in the way of unit & weapon description. Some unit types stuck with bland generic names like \"Conscript heave weapons\".\n* Poor story, both  plot wise and in delivery.   (In fairness I may be biased here, as am not the sort to like a story where the capitalists seem to be the good guys and the traditional / religious side seem to relatively oppressive)\n\nIn summary,  great value while on the half price launch sale, and even at full price it would be good value for wargamers wanting something different,  especially if they don't mind a lack of good story and a lack of unit / scenario variety.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1422792743, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422792743, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "20985093", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503739", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1454727202, "steamid": "76561198020043443", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is so badly done steam should not only remove it from sales but ban the developers from ever using steam.\n\nGraphics: look like they were made by a preschool class. The terrain, lighting and visual effects use a dark tone which not only hurts the feel of the game but makes it difficult to select units.\n\nSound: You would think the developers would spend the time they saved on graphics, maps and unit design to make some great sounds; but this was not the case. The music is one basic song that loops over and over, the weapons sound like a cheap modern weapons fx pack the developers bought somewhere \n\nGameplay: The gameplay has promsie but the rush job the developers did on the piece kill it.

I attacked a group of enemy infantry, first wiht tanks then 2 more tiems with infantry and only did maybe 5 casualties anong all teh attacks. The next round that same enemy infantry attacked my tanks with machien guns (well that is what the sound effect was) and destroyed 2 tanks\n\nUnit selection: There are two factions each has maybe 5 total units to choose from. Not sure who thought that was a high eneough number but that person should be fired \n\nThis game is really that bad, not sure how it made greenlight. Stay away from this game.
