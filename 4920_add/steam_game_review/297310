Someday, in several more years it may be worth $10.  It is not worth that now.\n\nEvery year or so I boot it up and see what they've added, and while they have come a long way --- the game still plays horribly.  \n\nIt aims to capture the magic of the AKI games (No Mercy, WCW/NWO Revenge, etc.) of the past, but it isn't anywhere near it yet.  It plays so sluggish that it only resembles these games in screenshots.  Actual gameplay is painful and unresponsive.  \n\nVerdict:  don't buy.", "timestamp_updated": 1504975794, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504975794, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 60, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 32, "total_reviews": 92}}
