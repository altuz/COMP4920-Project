Seemingly a metaphorical game of light versus dark, with no gray areas. You play as a small blob of light, and it\u2019s that blob that the player controls with the mouse.\n\nBut you don\u2019t play against the forces of darkness unassisted. Nor will you stay a small blob. As you travel through what is apparently an underwater world, you come across stationary small blobs, and close proximity causes you both to merge, increasing your size. You will also encounter fish-looking characters: bright ones will join you, dark ones will attack you and your \u201cswarm\u201d. Perhaps you can sneak past the dark ones, or attract some away, keeping battles small and manageable. But there seem to be some larger dark creatures that cannot be defeated, and your swarm cannot protect you against them for long\u2026.\n\n\u201cHero of Many\u201d seems simple, and to some degree it is. But you are given almost no instructions, which adds to the game\u2019s complexity. The world you inhabit is large, with many small and intertwining passages. Lights go on along the edges to show where you\u2019ve been, and large crystals act as highly visible save points. The goal is to advance to a sort of \u201cdrain\u201d, leading to the next level, with as many swarm members as possible.\n\nOthers things will be encountered in the game. As your swarm progress in the game it will encounter food, dangerous plants (or not, how to tell?) and large swarms of dark enemies. Also, they will constantly lose small bits of light, weakening steadily. Individual swarm members aren\u2019t smart, and will easily get separated or lost from the main swarm. The larger the swarm, the harder to lead or control, and the more likely lost to the dangers they will encounter. But, the greater the protection offered by larger swarms.\n\n\u201cHero of Many\u201d is a surprisingly endearing game, and rapidly develops a sense of personality. The swarm is so dedicated to providing protection that the desire to return that protection is very strong. The save point are logical and reasonable, and I can only imagine that further levels become more challenging and interesting. At this low (discount) price, I would give \u201cHero of Many\u201d my strongest recommendation.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_updated": 1442701231, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442701182, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "12114228", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508517", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1428252459, "steamid": "76561198047332997", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "A very nice, relaxing game, thats full of art, great music, and an intresting story to go along with it.

And I probably I would have done it if I hadn't found some empathy for this little czech studio...\n\nThe game starts great. Nice visuals, great atmosphere and fantastic, FANTASTIC music. The gameplay is simple but quite entertaining. But soon the first flaws will surface:\n[list]\n[*]You outrun the screen. Yes, the bane of old side-scrollers has returned. Often the camera is just not fast enought to follow you properly and then you basically can't see where you are going. Run into a mine and say goodbye to your beloved swarm.\n[*]Unskippable cutscenes! How is this still a thing?! No, I really don't need to see the same animation for the 20th time after loading the checkpoint, goddammit!\n[*]The game barely explains anything. For example, I've finished it and still I'm not sure what those energy orbs were useful for.\n[*]In a game where everything around you is glowing white it's not a good idea to make the mouse cursor a tiny white circle. I was constantly losing track of it, having to pause the game to actually find the cursor.\n[*]Hero of too many levels - yes, the game is too long. Game with such a simple gameplay gets repetitive fast and it doesn't introduce enough new mechanics or environments to keep it fresh.\n[/list]\n\nAnd then came level 17 - saving the Red queen. I still have no idea how to finish the level properly. You're supposed to go through a tunnel, pass some obstacles and finally reach the queen but the tunnel is blocked at the end and I've never found a way to open it. After many attempts I gave up and checked the only available walkthrough on YouTube.\nThe youtuber did something I would have never thought of - he ignored the tunnel and using a weird trick he got into a different tunnel that seemed to be inaccessible. He went through, ignored the queen and went straight to the exit and somehow succeeded. And yes, this is the only way that seems to be working. What stupid design is that?\n\nFrom now on the game went into a \"wtf am I supposed to do\" mode. I'm not going to talk about every flawed level so let's just mention the final bosses (spoilers ahead).\nThe dragon boss seems to be pretty straightforward, the problem is there is no indication you actually damage him. I was circling around him like crazy not sure if there is an end to it because I had no idea if I'm actually hitting him (thankfully I was, he just had a ton of hitpoints).\nThe final boss is actually even worse. I've beaten him on my fourth attempt yet I have no idea how did I do that. He just started dying around the lanterns even he was ok around them a minute before... I don't know... I was pretty annoyed by the game by then so I was glad it was over.\n\nOverall: It's a decent game with some major design flaws, especially in the last third.
