As you progress through the levels the speed increases so you will need machine-like reflexes to keep up... or just use the handy space bar to termporarily slow down time.\n\nEvery time you die it's because you made a mistake, nothing cheap about it.\n\nGraphics are minimal but provide the perfect feel. You can even toggle a CRT mode along with different levels of glow in the options, to make it look even more authentic.\n\nAnd the music... oh man. Pefect 80s synth sound that is 100% matched to the game's levels and keeps you pumped. It's almost worth a recommendation just for that.\n\nThe game is split up in smaller level segments so you can play in somewhat brief burts, but also has an endless mode that is just that: you keep playing as long as your reflexes allow you to.\n\nIf you like old-style arcade games, or, more to the point, modern recreations of these like the excellent Bit.Trip series, you will also love Trace Vector.", "timestamp_updated": 1425075998, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425075998, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "11806816", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506600", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1408652372, "steamid": "76561197996566350", "num_games_owned": 707, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "HOLY CRAP THE MUSIC RULES\n\nAlso: Vector graphics +++ Woot", "timestamp_updated": 1408628946, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1408628946, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "11839563", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503749", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1411226377, "steamid": "76561198004155961", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have just started to play and i already love it. \nThe graphics, the music, it's all made really nicely.\nSimilar in idea to other game i love Super Hexagon, it goes beyond the static gameplay and make it moving.\n\nIt could use some more hardcore settings (ie. difficulty levels, no preview mode, random mode etc).\nOverall it's a really fun game I recommend to my gamer friends.", "timestamp_updated": 1408835247, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1408835247, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "19320348", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503084", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1486841855, "steamid": "76561198013079187", "num_games_owned": 716, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A trifle of a game, but at the price they're asking well worth it.
