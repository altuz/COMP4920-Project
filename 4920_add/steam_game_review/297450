It's two games in one, a hoarde survival and a plane flying game. The higher you score in survival, the more weapons you unlock. In survival, you'll fight wave after wave of zombies (that I guess parachute their way in) some that can be destroyed quite easily, others that take loads of damage and some that even after they have not legs, arms, or head can still damage you! Then there are those pesky buggers that clip through the floor and some are even dogs! Yes folks, who knows how they are getting onboard, but who cares, they're after you!\n\nThe flying mode is quirky, yet hillarious at the same time. You are now in control of the plane and must shake off those pesky zombies from destroying parts of your plane. This is quite simple to do, fly it into the ocean! There are 3 skins of planes to choose from as well so you can enjoy crashing all of them. \n\nThe animations are bad, it runs at a solid 60 frames per second, there's no lag, the graphics are sub-par. It's stupid, it's ugly, there's nothing to do, and it's overpriced by $15.

But not Zombies done like before these zombies can keep going without limbs but also they can go without a head. Causing the issue of making all zombie feel bullet sponges and taking the sensation of mowing down zombies through \"skill\" in case makes the game feel like how quickly can you press the shoot button.\nThe game offers 3 characters straight off (with at least one hidden behind DLC?? yeah day one dlc??) but there is no different between the characters and gun unlocking is done during each game based upon how many points you get. Again taking out any decision making for the gamer again as you cant even pick character progression in anyway.\nThe guns feel floating, the zombies don't react well to being shot meaning loss of immersion again.\n2 levels, 2 game types, all the same as not much can is done with the level design, progression is only learboard based.\n\n2nd game is based around flying a plane as you spin it to shake off the Zombies, but as zombie can stay attached when upside down it just seems to boil down to spin around as much as possible and hope again.\n\nALL MISS not even worth keeping on an eye on, move on people.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zS9Yfl8ibvs", "timestamp_updated": 1459090335, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "6", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459090335, "votes_down": 42}, {"recommendationid": "22117174", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 66, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538628", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1459199428, "steamid": "76561197998470298", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 7, "review": "Not worth $19.

You and endless hordes of undead ridiculous looking assets will glitch and awkwardly maneuver about in a war of comic utter failure!  Fight inside the plane!  Fight on top of plane!  Even take control of the plane!  Weeeeee!  \n\nSee my First Play and Review video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=142KpSqlbuE\n\nI think the developers behind this game have been studying the same \"How To Make A Steam Game And Get Rich in 30 Days\" training courses as the infamous Digital Homicide developers behind the Slaughtering Grounds.  And all their hard work shows when you play this masterful game... masterfully awful!  Awful controls, Morbid awful mechanics, and God awful physics make this game qualify for one of the best ways to waste your money this year!  \n\nYou'll swear this game is a joke.  Like you'll be hoping that at anytime as you awkwardly fumble around with this catastrophe and fight horrid controls that a screen will pop up and say \"Just Kidding!\" and then start an actual decent game...   But no!  This is real people.  This is really a game that's asking nearly $20, and that's just for the base game!   They already have add on content available on launch day that will serve only to increase the amount of refund dollars Steam has to issue for as long as this game is available here.  \n\nYou can choose which ridiculous hero you want to control from three when you first start the game should you choose to battle the zombies.  Imagine the Slaughtering Grounds in (or on top of) a plane speeding through the air.  But this game has an added perk in which you can also choose from the main menu to control the plane to either try and shake off zombies as you fly.. or just fly in a free fly mode admiring all the puffy clouds popping in the sky instantly like popcorn all around you!  Yay!\n\nWhile this game is slightly better then the Slaughtering Grounds I compared it to, this game looks like something Digital Homicide would release.  Knowing this is the first product by Shangri-La Game Studios offers some level of hope.  This is their start, right?  Everybody has to start \"somewhere\", and they can only improve from here!  While I gave this game an 8% score, I look at these developers with confidence and hope that their next game scores at least a 20%.
