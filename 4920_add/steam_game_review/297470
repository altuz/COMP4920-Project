It has farming, fishing, a pretty good and balanced crafting system. It's a work in progress and I'm excited to see what's coming. Constructing camps, villages, and towns is also a great system and there's many ways to do it. Considering the fact that only one person works on the game for the most part is amazing, and they've done such a great job.\n\nThe community is fantastic and the other players are always willing and almost always available to help.
