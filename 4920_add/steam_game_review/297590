At it's core, it is really a difficult puzzler game with side quests..\n\nA young child about 7 will enjoy this game, but so will adults. Due to the difficulty of the puzzles, some of them are quite challenging. Each puzzle level has 3 main goals. Usually one consists of eating all the cake on each level, where the other 2 are usually random, and include beating level in time limit, do not kill enemies, do not use certain powers, etc...\n\nThe monsters that join you look cute in the game, but in actuality, each has a unique ability that can get you thru most mazes and puzzles. Advanced strategies require the main character to equip specific costumes to pass levels.\n\nRecommended for all ages of games for difficulty of puzzles and funny storyline and whimsical graphics.", "timestamp_updated": 1477555499, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477555499, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "13108120", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514289", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1417147122, "steamid": "76561198042194491", "num_games_owned": 699, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "A fantastic puzzler with great music, art, writing, ... (the list goes on). I was a apprehensive with purchasing this as I feared the game may have been too childish, but this is not the case.\n\nThe puzzles definitely get fairly complex. I've only played up to the third world so far, and nothing has been all that challenging, but if the pace continues, the fourth world is going to have some wonderfully difficult challenges. Don't expect something to twist your mind like a puzzle from Braid or FEZ might. The puzzles here rely on the teamwork mechanic. You must control up to four different characters, switching between them, one at a time, and orchestrate their movements in order to progress.\n\nThe RPG-esque elements add fun content to the game (which could stand on its own without them). There are always sidequests to complete and new ones pop-up frequently, at least once you complete a world. The secrets aren't that well hidden, which is a little frustrating, but some have been tricky enough to make up for it.\n\nThe game definitely has a unique charm. The monsters all have quite different personalities and add a nice flavor to the game. The humor just makes me smile.\n\nDon't go into this game expecting be lost on a puzzle for hours, as none of them are THAT difficult. They will make you think in a different way than you're used to, which is what puzzle games really should do, in my opinion.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_updated": 1417108963, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417108963, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "17953682", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514442", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1439677981, "steamid": "76561198121771009", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "[h1]Monsters [i]Started to[/i] Eat My Birthday Cake[/h1]\n\nI discovered this game because Disasterpeace composed the soundtrack and I adore Disasterpeace. Anything he works on I look into. I added this game to wishlist and waited for a sale... I can't remember if I bought it on sale or got impatient and purchased regardless, but after playing through it I think it is worth the price they ask!\n\nThis game follows the adventures of Niko, a young boy whose particular birthday becomes the second worst birthday ever, thanks to the Monsters that--you guessed it--Ate [His] Birthday Cake, although I feel like that's not entirely true, as the premise of the game has you trekking across worlds acquiring discarded slices of the cake itself. Admittedly though, \"Monsters Took My Birthday Cake and Strew it Across the Island for Little Apparent Reason\" doesn't quite have a ring to it...\n\nAlong the journey, Niko makes friends with a cast of eclectic and quirky characters, each of which has a special ability that helps the player to solve puzzles and progress through the levels. The levels are accessible through a \"road-map\" with each stage being a separate bump in the road (think Super Mario Brothers 3). Even the cutscenes are replayable by entering their \"stage\".\nEach level contains multiple objectives which reward you with a star for each mission completed. This means that there is incentive to replay levels and beat the target time, or find the hidden treasures, etc. The treasures can be traded and compiled with the townsfolk to complete side quests and unlock costumes for Niko. These costumes are vital, as some costumes give Niko new abilities  that allow access into parts of the levels that are otherwise unreachable. \n\nAll in all, this is a very enjoyable game! It challenges your mind and coordination without being unreasonable, and provides a lot of laughs. The humor can be a bit childish sometimes, but it's the youthful demeanor that makes this game what it is. I have played it on Android and on PC, and I prefer PC. Touch controls just never appealed to me as much as the precision of a keyboard.\n\nAnd then I bought [url=http://music.disasterpeace.com/album/monsters-ate-my-birthday-cake-ost]the soundtrack.[/url]", "timestamp_updated": 1441787033, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441787033, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "25557381", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1474672735, "steamid": "76561198138408243", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Fun game, cute design and hilarious dialogues!\n\nMonsters ate my birthday cake is packed with fluffy, cheeky and loveable monsters.\nWhile trying to solve quests, eat cake and save your village you get to know different monsters and their abilities AND you collect fancy monster outfits1!!\nAnd the best thing is: IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY!\n\nPROS: everything but...

Yes. Is it fun? Eh...\n\nTruth be told, I'm not sure how epic the story gets because I am still crawling through the first world. The gameplay is clever, but it feels a bit mechanical. You'll have to replay a tricky level to get the timing right, to find the simple solutions that tend to hide in plain sight. If you want all the in-game achievements, you're replaying some of these levels a few times each. The world feels small, because it's a series of short levels to puzzle through in 2 minutes or less. After a few mini-levels in a row, you'll gain a small tidbit of story to move forward with. \n\nThis game seems to hinge on whether you enjoy the gameplay or not. I'm not a huge fan of it. I prefer my puzzlers to be a bit faster, spontaneous and unpredictable. There's not a lot of surprise here. You either make the right turns or you don't. If you do, awesome, time for the next similar level. If you don't, try again. Rinse, repeat.\n\nThe design is clever, and the characters are cute. But they feel a bit flat, with minimal dialogue and few defining characteristics. The story seems to unravel a bit slowly (what little story there is). I give them credit for including a story, but I'd love more of it. There is good humor in this title, but other reviewers seem to find it funnier than I did. (Some of the characters communicate with emoticons, to give you an idea.)\n\nI've picked this one up multiple times to try and get engaged, but no dice. By no means is it a bad game, or a waste of money. I'm just a bit disinterested so I feel like I could've spent the few dollars on a more addictive puzzler.
