It's a brilliant premise and foundation with some flawed balance issues and in the later levels seemingly lazy execution. I was in love with it for the first half and felt a bit underwhelmed by the end. Overall I would highly recommend the game if it can address some of those issues, which seem manageable in updates.\n\nPROS:\n-Smart battery system, a limiting mechanic heartwarmingly motivated by multiple sclerosis as said in the credits\n-Feels like games you love - wonderful setting.\n-First retro game since Shovel Knight that I've genuinely loved.\n-Music (FantomenK is an awesome artist and delivers a fantastic soundtrack)\n-Humor is spot on and the plot is even historically relevant / educational\n-Dialogue is phenomenal\n-Great aesthetics (references galore, Gameboy colors, vision dimming, 80s pop-culture references)\n-Difficulty of first level is great (in contrast to the other reviewer)\n-Controls generally responsive\n-You can tell the creators love retro games and put a lot of thought into the details.\n\n\nCONS:\n-Balance - if you try to get batteries, you become overpowered and the difficulty becomes completely trivial. The battery mechanic falls apart fairly quickly. At the beginning the brilliance of the mechanic lies in the tradeoffs it forces. But once you pick up a few batteries you don't need to make those choices anymore.\n-Stats - the stat increases are extreme. A few points in HP or attack will double and triple both stats. That reinforces the difficulty because with no batteries, you will get destroyed, and with just a few, you will be unstoppable. A system where stat increases are incremental would be better balanced.\n-Level design - the design of levels shifts from clever to relatively tedious in the end. Enemy placements are usually completely in one's path and don't require much strategy to address. Some of the later levels are very short. It appears there is a decrease in the thought and care put into later levels.\n-Hand-holding - the game feels like it's being played with training wheels. The game's difficulty decreases by the sheer lack of confidence it places in the player. Every turn seems rife with tutorials or reminders to go and get batteries. The water level is laden with extra health tanks to offset damage taken from the water, after telling you to get batteries for your armor so you won't take damage. \n-Battery locations - some of the early batteries are challenging and involve platforming (like the mountain level). The later batteries are mostly in your path or in plain view, making picking them up feel like a chore rather than accomplishment.\n-Boss rush - the majority of it is trivial, and then the revision of the last form of the last boss feels cheap and luck-based. \n-It's Delancey, not Delancy.

I haven't gleaned this much satisfaction from platforming in a while -- the design exceeds triple-A NES standards -- and the added mechanics are not just for show.
