There are cards that change the rules at any time, which could help with timing in respawning, timing for your projectile weapon, or the amount of points possible, or the very game themselves.\n\nThe rule is simple - get as much points as possible, but how you get those points (and how much) depends entirely on the rules randomized every 30 seconds (or presented by a fellow player)\n\nBut at one point during the game, you have an \"OVERRULED\" card which negates any card presented on the table, so it's a game of juggling not only the platforming and combat, but the very rules and scoring themselves.\n\nPlay according to your skill set, or hinder your opponents on their best skill set.

Basically you get things like collect coins, deathmatch, king of the hill and capture the flag, none of these are terribley exciting.\n\nIt is worth noting that it is still in open Beta.
