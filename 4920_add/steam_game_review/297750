I'm a long time CC fan and I must say Gateway to Caen is now one of my favorites. If you're a CC fan don't hesitate to spend whatever the price, well worth it! Playing as the English is particularly challenging with the Germans fielding Tigers and Panthers! Not to mentioned basically ALL of their infranty squads get at least one MG34. You only have a few weapons that can take out them Tigers and Panthers, Churchill MKIII's with the 6 pounders, the 6 or 17 pounder AT guns, M10s, Fireflys and PIATS...yep PIATS lol. I did get in a few lucky side and rear shots with a few Shermans too but just forget about hurting a Panther with a frontal from anything less than the 6 pounder. Also, mortars really work now lol, VERY useful...and madening when you are on the receiving end. A few other tips, ALWAYS set a time limit, I use 30mins, this keeps the AI from just forever camping. Also, be sure to turn OFF 'act on initative' for yourself but leave on for the opponent, I suspect this helps cut down on camping as well. All in all just another great game in the CC family, quite possibly one of my favorites now.

Well, umm... except this one. The original ones were both original, grafically ok, realistic, thrilling and big replay potential. I do not think it is quite a must to come with new ideas or even do revolution changes in a title, which works perfectly. \nBUT: GtC does not bring anything new after those looooong years (of course apart from better resolution). Well it probably does, but I cannot recall anything, so basically nothing really improving worth mentiong. What is the worst: if the CC had any flaws, then it was the AI - sometimes. Now the AI \"went full retard\", especially tanks. Immediatelly forget building any tank squads, because your tanks are programmed to take the worst path, turn turrets in meaningless directions, always ready to take 2+ shots before acquring aim... Spotted hidden lone enemy PzIV inside a garden and have 3 Sherms available? Well, then you have a fair chance to disable it if you coordinate the 3way attack well, but be prepared to exchange 2 out of your 3 tanks against that one. And I am talking PzIV, not Tiger neither any other german cat.\nAnother pain is the identification of low and high ground. Sounds familiar from the past? On some maps with virtually open terrain you just don\u00b4t know why your AVs cannot shoot visible enemy units accross that field. Oops, the LOS is broken in the middle, so probably a terrain wave or something, but nothing that would indicate so.\nIn short: I dont\u00b4t care GtC brings notning new at all. What bothers me, it completely ignores old well known problems, and not only focuses to fix them but makes them even worse! THIS ALL FOR A PRICE OF A NEW GAME!\nIf you are a CC fan, buy this game in case:\n- if it ever goes under EUR 10,- (well it is 50% sale today and it is still 18,49, so wait some 10 years, LOL) and\n- if you are not becoming frustrated easily\nPity :(", "timestamp_updated": 1498245642, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498245642, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "31618019", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501497", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498184083, "steamid": "76561197996183622", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Always fun, but way overpriced!\n\nI bought it anyways...", "timestamp_updated": 1494214948, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494214948, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33096347", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491869", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499480461, "steamid": "76561198201640173", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of my favorite games ever!
