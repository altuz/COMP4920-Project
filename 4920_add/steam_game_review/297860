Hell yes it's fun, but get the console version instead of this crappy pc version. I don't care about 30 fps lock on this game since imo it doesn't impact that much, but the randomly corrupted savefile killed my love for the game, As i saw in guides & forum of it.\n\nOr if you don't want to waste your money for it, get Blur somewhere.
