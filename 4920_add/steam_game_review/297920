Manage your colony on alien planets and cater to your crew's needs while at the whim of corporate headquarter's greed.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]: The return of a classic! Manage power and oxygen levels in your base as you expand it with a series of domes and corridors in which to place sleeping quarters, health and hygiene pods, maintenance equipment, feeding stations and a large variety of entertainment facilities. Outside your base, you must construct and man various farming and mining stations for resources you will then sell or make use of to continue to expand. The fun, and challenge, are in the characters: you get a wacky assortment of crew members, each with their own personality quirks and expertise, and you'll need to maintain their needs, motivation and relationship to one another, lest they lose productivity or go straight out crazy. The campaign is a great set of challenges where you must achieve specific goals of increasing difficulty on different planets, facing the alien fauna and environment while bending to Blackwater Industries' goals and profit  deadlines. The larger your colony gets, the harder it is to keep a delicate balance of work and pleasure with your crew members while keeping your colony at peak efficiency. It's not the \"Sims in Space\" some people claim it to be, but fun nevertheless!\n\n[b]Cons[/b]: The humor in the game, while charming at first, quickly gets put aside as the game focuses more and more about timing the various tasks you give your colonists, and less about the actual building of your colony. The clock that determines your crew members' work and leasure time is constantly cancelling tasks you're giving them: just as you decide to send someone to sleep, eat or do anything, your order gets overriden before they even reach their desired location because their shift starts or ends, which is very irritating when trying to time the actions of more and more crew members. Some of the controls are annoying, such as needing to unselect a character before selecting another one, or accidentally giving them a job when you were just trying to get them to a location. The freeplay option gets repetitive quickly, as having access to every items without a clear set of goals makes building your base less interesting.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 - Next on your list!\n\nI was glad to see this gem pop up on Steam! While graphics and animations show their age, it's just as good now as it was back then. If you enjoy a tycoon game of medium depth with a time management-focused challenge, I strongly recommend it!\n\n[quote][b]P.S.[/b]: The Steam Workshop is a total disappointment. While there's a mere few exceptions, most are bogus Mods created just to get the \"Publish a mission to the workshop\" achievement, the rest are huge fields of crop/minerals specifically designed for the various \"Harvest X amount\" achievements. Such lazy Mods are why so many games usually disable achievements when Mods are enabled.[/quote]\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n[i][b]This was just my opinion.[/b]\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CJsOpinions/]reviews[/url].[/i]", "timestamp_updated": 1499113370, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498449462, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31955189", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458528", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495729240, "steamid": "76561198037614587", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "well i dont know what to say, i really want to like this game but its more about mini managing all of the peoples quirks than it is about building a colony. the maps are very small so building is limited even in sandbox mode. there are numerous objects on maps that cannot be removed (maybe by bombs in free mode ?) forcing you to make odd looking and crappy base layouts in most cases. \nalot of the quests are just kind of gimmicky, in a previous scenario you will unlock items for the quest, yet the very next quest acts like you never used them before just to make certain quests \"seem\" harder. although there is an option to download user made content so thats a plus. \ni got through most of the campaign but now i play it for about ten minutes and get fed up with all the micro managing of peoples bad hair days. the ai is horrible, people will be in the red for certain items green for others, pass right by an object that will fill red requirements to walk half way across base to fill an already green bar.\n then people not even near each other that barely have any interaction what so ever get hostile with each other, forcing you to make certain characters talk to each other over and over. which could be alot more fun if you actually got to choose people for each mission instead of what ever the game throws at ya. then at least if everyone was fighting i could say welp i picked the wrong people for this mission..... and try different people out. but nope lol.\ntheres no camera controls what so ever so certain buildings will get in the way of objects that you need to click or when deleting another object will delete the one in front of it. lol...... i honestly cant even believe this was released in this state even for its time lol.\n\nthis is more like \"the sims\" in space  thing than it is a city builder .... so if your looking for a city builder to fill some void, id look else where, if you are looking for some kind of personality disorder simulation management game....THIS IS IT!\n", "timestamp_updated": 1495730489, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495730489, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "32678671", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512393", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498777354, "steamid": "76561198025376643", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Described in its original release day on CD/DVD as \"Sims in Space\"...

Seriously though, this pretty much is the sims in space. ALthough with more focused goals to which you must manage your charges towards.

SO I'll just bounce to the summary..ahem...\n\nTHe game holds up well and while the interface is somewhat confusing and unhelpful, it's really not a bad little game.
