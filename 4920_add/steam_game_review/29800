Caster has the bare bones of a good game: nice powers, an engaging storyline, an engrossing world... the problem is that all of these are incomplete. The powers are not balanced or tuned to the levels. The storyline lacks writing. You only get claustrophobic glimpses of the world, with very little indication that there's more in the distance.\n\nWhat's sad is that this clearly could have been a very, very good game. The devs have all these mechanics down pat that other studios which excel at polishing and shipping fail at. Still, if you're like me, you'll feel like you've paid $2 for a tech demo."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501128363, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33823760", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006236281", "num_reviews": 22, "last_played": 1496685765, "num_games_owned": 1201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 286}, "timestamp_updated": 1501128363, "received_for_free": false, "review": "At first it was weird, but once you know how to play (and what to upgrade first) its fun."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500197914, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33580732", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198108301145", "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1499844874, "num_games_owned": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 219}, "timestamp_updated": 1500197914, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Enjoyable and very cheap"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502914404, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34283342", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198012215803", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1502913963, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1422}, "timestamp_updated": 1502914404, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is so much fun.
