He played it at work after hours with his coworkers, and I loved watching him play skirmishes at home. Eventually, he let me take a stab at it, and I quickly fell in love. Even though this game came out in 1997, it still brings a level of fun and strategy that isn't seen in many games that came after it. I still come back to it every once in a while, though not nearly as often as I used to, and relive the fun of crushing the filthy Core with endless waves of Flash tanks and Brawler planes. In recent times, my dad has stopped playing, and my younger brother never had as much fun with it as I did, but I still like to play a few matches here and there. I'm a purist when it comes to this game, and the most additional content I've installed has been the 3.1c patch and final 6 official Cavedog units. Sadly, this game takes a bit of work to get running smoothly on Windows 10, but it is WELL worth the effort.

Moving right along total annihilation is a retro RTS game from 97. It was markedly different from its contemplates (starcraft, dark reign and KKnD among others) offering an exciting take on the genre, and now it has finaly made it to steam. This is the original game and it shows, the graphics are rough as guts, it takes a bit of finagling to get working and the AI is still idiotic but \"Is it still fun\"tm?? Yeah, it's janky and unstreamlined compared to a modern RTS but it's still fun as heck.\n\nGood\n-The music is one of the best game soundtracks ever\n-gameplay still holds up (ish)\n-a massive number of units, huge strategic choice\n-seen thru rose colored glasses the graphics have a kind of charm\n-cool stuff, crazy artillery and nukes and mechs and all sorts of stuff!\n\nBad\n-game has been ravaged by time\n-both the commander and the unit ai have dumb moments\n-game balance is a bit off\n\nFor people like me who have been nostalgically waiting for TA to hit steam getting this is a no brainer but for a newer RTS fan perhaps invest your money in a newer game (maybe try supreme commander 1, TA's spiritual successor) and if you then want to experience a little slice of RTS history TA is still very playable and very much worth a few bucks. 3.5/5 and recommended", "timestamp_updated": 1504312171, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504231592, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34025119", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512626", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501880390, "steamid": "76561197994631916", "num_games_owned": 742, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "I have countless hours on this game.
