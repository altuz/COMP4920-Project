It's hard to fail at that but then it won't be anything revolutionary.   The most significant difference is that the map is a bit more like MOO3 with choke points - requiring more strategic selection of systems.  That's an upgrade.  \n\nThe style and artwork of the game is great.  \n\nThe game is much better balanced than MOO2 - but still stays true to the nature of each race (making some very OP - *cough* Elerian *cough*).  It's for the better IMO.  Where balance fails is with the fast pace of science (then you're greeted with science points contributing to nothing but score once completing the tree) and the slow pace of population growth.  Fortunately these can be tweeked in settings.  Set growth to fast and tech to very slow.\n\nThe biggest and most significant negative is how brain dead the AI is.  It is by far the most predictable and utterly ineffective AI I have come across.   It's at least better than the impossibly brutal AI of MOO3.. \n\nIn the end it's good enough to be the MOO game to play for the modern gamer.  MOO2 is still amazing and you should play it but MOO CTS will probably get much more play time.   Definitely worth a buy if you like turn based strategery.", "timestamp_updated": 1504662188, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504662076, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "35388531", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505148", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506485388, "steamid": "76561198045773596", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So being an old school gamer I looked foward to seeing this Remake of the original.
