I certainly was not disappointed after playing this game.\n\nI think I may have seen a couple reviews saying Far Cry 4 is just a fresh coat of paint slapped onto the last installment, and I can see why they might think that. But after briefly testing out Primal I can say that I'm glad they did do a sort of revamp on the last game instead of taking it in a different direction; amazing gameplay. A badass main character. A horrible yet extremely likeable and charismatic bad-guy. They took all of the great things from their most popular game and put it into this one, and they set it in a new, beautiful location - The Himalayas. What's not to like?\n\nThat's not to say they didn't add new aspects to it. There's certainly a lot more to do, with a lot of mini-game-type aspects that riddle the map. Something else I noticed is there's a lot more decision-making possibilities than in the last game. A big part of the story is restoring the civilization of Kyrat to its non-totalitarian lifestyle - as to whether you restore it to its simple ways or push it in a 'competetive world power' direction, that's up to you.\n\nWhether you like Ubisoft or not, they do a great job with graphics and creating breathtaking and immersive environments, and in that regard you won't find this game wanting.
