It is a great runescape-esque mmo with tons of quests and tons of skills to level.\n\nIt is fun to run around, trade with players, and find people to raid harder dungeons with. The only issue is that this game has virtually no playerbase.\n\nMy first day back I met someone who crafted me some gear and ran around with me for a bit, but after that there was nothing. With less than 100 people playing a day it isn't as good of an experience as it could be. If this game was revamped and could gain a surge in players, then it would be a great time.\n\nAs of now I've been enjoying leveling skills and completing quests by myself and with the few players that do play, but will probably stop playing soon (again). \n\nOverall a fun game if you enjoy some aspects of runescape, but with more easy to handle mechanics. A lack of players makes it undesirable as an mmo to play these days though, which leads to a downwards spiral of even less players.", "timestamp_updated": 1485856180, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485856180, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29642225", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499821", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1493260054, "steamid": "76561198359527183", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Game aint bad for a runescape clone", "timestamp_updated": 1486011979, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486011979, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29932192", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495787", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495571865, "steamid": "76561198271953567", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Nice simple game.
