By the time I got around to it, the game went free-to-play, and now you have no excuse not to play it.\n\nThe sci-fi premise here was a good one; without spoiling too much, a handful of AI's on a distant research station have a mission to run simulations to determine the habitability of a planet for human settlers.  Each AI has their own idea of how things will work best, and you get to experience each simulation through the course of the game.  A handful of intriguing twists are definitely what make this game worth the playthrough.\n\nThe visuals range from beautiful, to awesome, to ridiculous, to near-seizure-inducing.  The characters are interestingly designed and their simulations are fantastically imagined.  The research facility and simulations provide interesting contrast with the surrounding barren landscape under the quiet vacuum of a beautfiul starscape.  The battle sequences can be a bit much, at times producing effects fully intended to make them basically unplayable for a brief period.\n\nDown to the gameplay, which was actually a lot of fun.  A pretty sizeable chunk of the game is presented in sidescrolling, platforming 2D.  You jump, shoot lazers, pick away at the story, and power up for your confrontations present in each simulation.  Those confrontations are frenetic turn-based RPG battles.  I must admit that even after completing the game, some mechanisms of those battles remain a mystery to me.  The battle display is a tad overwhelming, Information all over, attacks and effects constantly firing seemingly without reason, handful of minigames just doing their thing all at the same time.  There were a lot of neat design choices made here to make the battles seem very intense, while they really just boil down to most of the usual RPG elements served with great speeeed and clutter.\n\nThe soundtrack has some really cool jams.  While shuffling across the surface of the planet at night, I found myself just a little disappointed if I didn't allow the groovy bass parts to get heard before getting back into the station.  Each simulation has its own own sound that fits the AI's prodcued situation.\n\nAbove all the gameplay and art, If you can dig a good sci-fi, get this thing and enjoy yourself.", "timestamp_updated": 1498193747, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498193747, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 115, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 119}}
