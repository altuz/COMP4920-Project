Then one day I logged on to find CRF. I'm like WTF is this. So I stop playing becasue I was so mad that I had just lost all of my progress. Then a few months ago I decided ti play RCF. I found out it was on steam,  so I downloaded it on steam. In RC2 I could get 120 FPS on high graphics with 12 to 53 ping. Now I get 40 FPS on low graphics and 120 to 350 ping. So that's why I don't play the RC series anymore because they ruiened it as soon as RCF came out. So Devs if you read this maybe you should take RC2 out of the back of your computer storage and put it back up so the people who liked it can play it. Also in the browser version of RC2 there was no chance of crashing unless your browser. Now in RCF I can maybe get one match in before it crashes. So all in all I think that they should relaunch RC2 as a standalone game. I didn't sit hear for 30 min of my Monday morning just so this could be reveiwed then forgotten. So take this into consideration I'm sure many people will agree.", "timestamp_updated": 1487610534, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487610534, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "30155604", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515635", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1463591782, "steamid": "76561198026157856", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "pay to win, small maps, cant damage enemies in their \"base\" areas, which are huge. free weapons do no damage, pay to win weapons kill at one shot. do yourself a favor, avoid this game", "timestamp_updated": 1487988548, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487988548, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "16760675", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499851", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506110760, "steamid": "76561198198937133", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I really have enjoyed this game. all the game modes are fun and test the skills of the players!

Sometimes game crashes randomly while trying to start it. Sometimes I'm stuck on the main menu and all the buttons disappear except the exit button. Frustrating at first.

Well, I have over 100 hours of play time, so trust me when I say I know what I'm talking about with this game. Everything about this game is just completely retarde.d. There are lots of hackers in every server (which there aren't even many). People votekick you even when you didn't do anything at all sometimes, just because there is nothing to prevent people from doing that. And it runs absolutely terribly, not like a real FPS should. The spawn killing prevention in the game is broken. Sometimes you try to kill someone, but spawn protection applies when it really shouldn't, and often people do spawn kill but then the spawn kill prevention doesn't even work. And you need to use up a lot of actual money to be at all good at this game. The game is also filled with bugs. I do not recommend this game to anyone. Just getting this game for free is too much to pay. Though it's basically not even free because of all the needed in game purchases. This game is just horrible. And probably the worst part of all is that the developers do literally nothing to solve any of the many problems in this horrible game. They fix no bugs, ban no hackers, don't improve their game in any ways. All they do is create new overpowered weapons that you need to buy or else you will get destroyed so that they make more money. Not to mention the fact that I have been temporarily banned from the game twice now when I did LITERALLY NOTHING AT ALL! I just launched the sh.itty game to play more of it (though I really don't understand why I continue to play it considering how bad it is) and I was temporarily banned. The same thing happened a while later after I was able to play again.
