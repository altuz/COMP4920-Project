There seems to be no in-game way to exit the game (e.g. Esc, Pause/Break), so I alt-tabbed to another program in order to kill the game from the taskbar. I gave the game another shot. The second time, the character actually moved to the door of the house before the scene changed, but again he was fascinated with the ceiling.
