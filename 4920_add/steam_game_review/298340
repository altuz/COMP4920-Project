Some examples: \n\n-the first level of the Redox League have infinite lap loop bug. All you can do is hit escape and surrender on this level (you will lose points). The league is still beatable but it does increase the difficulty a bit because you don't get any points from this round while enemies does,\n-you can't finish the game because the last boss battle (Shadow) never loads,\n-almost half of the achievements are broken. some of them just don't work and rest of them are counted wrong. There is achievement for obtaining 500k money. I definitely reached over 500k but on the achievement site it does say I have just 400k.\n\nLets go to the PROS and CONS.\n\nPROS:\n+good gameplay similiar to Wipeout,\n+pretty good graphics and does work on slower machines,\n+low price and frequently on sale,\n+awesome music (atleast for my taste),\n+online multiplayer,\n+DUKE NUKEM as one of the BOSS characters!\n\nCONS:\n-broken achievements (examples above),\n-alot of bugs (examples above),\n-steering is pretty weird sometimes it does randomly move your machine a little into left/right,\n-DUKE NUKEM was too easy... Come on guys!\n\n\nSo the game itself isn't bad and I would vote it 7+/10 but at the current state I will rate it BROKEN/10! The last patch was there around 3 years ago so I guess it will be never fixed.", "timestamp_updated": 1494841830, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494838774, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32690004", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507505", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500597264, "steamid": "76561198140572309", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A quick track and must keep focus, turns are sharp but a great game.", "timestamp_updated": 1498238278, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498238278, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32355206", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498886572, "steamid": "76561198348336520", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "No fun at all.", "timestamp_updated": 1497227759, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497227759, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "32703167", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496042", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405713910, "steamid": "76561198048001113", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "poor quality, bad developed, got bored real fast.", "timestamp_updated": 1498261948, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498261948, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 31, "total_reviews": 65}}
