By that, I mean that most tower defense games have the fast-attacking tower, the slow-firing AoE tower, the speed-decreasing tower, etc., and the towers are very one-note and samey to all other tower defense games' towers.. In Immortal Defense, however, the towers attack in different literal patterns, sometimes apply different status effects, and all seem to have some use, depending on the map layout.\n\nIn my original review, I mentioned that there were a limited number of each type of tower you can place per level, and that you sometimes get more of the same tower, but there was no way to know if you would get them at all. The developer has been attentive and responded, informing me that most of the towers, upon getting a bunch of kills, will spawn new towers of the same type(s) getting bunches of kills, which you can then place. Also, this information is technically available in and in-game tutorial/information section, but that section was something like 15-19 pages long, somewhat buried and not pointed out as well as it should be. \n\nI think it should have at least been mentioned in one of the early levels quite clearly, since this can be a [i]crucial[/i] strategy for certain players, depending on play-style. I turned many losses and poor victories into very big successes.\n\nTower defense games often give the player something to do since the towers do much of the work. In Sanctum 2, your towers do their thing while you run about in first person, shooting at enemies inside and outside your maze. In Deathtrap, you're killing enemies Diablo-style (action RPG) while your towers do their thing. Unless you build the [i]perfect[/i] maze and/or tower placement, or have incredibly good skills, you won't succeed with only towers or only attacking yourself, but each technique is very good and useful from the beginning of each level to the end. \n\nTo continue that line of thought into less \"hybridized\" tower defense games, you're kept busy in those by upgrading your towers and placing others, keeping the strategy element going strong, often with \"waves\" of enemies with a few seconds in between to give you a breather. There is no breather on each level of Immortal Defense, upgrades are so costly that earning enough cash to buy them was rare for me, and the player interaction after hitting start, for me, solely consists of moving my mouse around pointing at enemies, and firing charged shots on occasion.\n\nThis would be alright, except that enemies' health increases the longer you go in the level, which in my opinion, is a no-no in tower defense games. Why? Imagine you're playing a tower defense where there are very specific enemy types which, at the beginning, you know how much time/how many hits it takes to kill them. If one leaks through, you can quickly go \"Oh, I need one archer tower,\" and place it, or whatever would kill it in time. In Immortal Defense, I'm pulling a number out of the air, but an enemy might have 100HP at the start of the level, but by the last minute, it has thousands of health. You lose the ability to easily gauge how easy/hard each enemy is to kill, which is the kiss of death for dealing with leaks, and this game [i]encourages[/i] you to get as close to leaking as possible.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, in each level, you keep the best cash you had from the previous level, with a modifier based on how many enemies got through. That means that if you build a really good defense, you are losing out on your money for the next level, decreasing your odds of winning and getting better money. So the idea to play the game the \"best\" way is to build the bare minimum you need to succeed, and hope it's enough. \n\nBy the time an enemy leaks through, chances are it's too late to stop it, because it's late-game and you have no quick way of finding out how many hits of the shots from your cursor will kill it, or if you have time to place a new tower near the end and upgrade it, and then there's that hesitation of wondering how much money it's going to cost you to upgrade it enough to kill the baddie, and [i]then[/i] wonder if you spent too much money doing that and if it will make this attempt at the level completely wasted because you spent more money than you did the time before.\n\nThis adds a level of hesitation for me that a game of this pacing simply does not accomodate, and removes that euphoric feeling of knowing you hit the sweet spot on the towers you need, watching for a little while as your towers lay waste to incoming baddies. Instead, I found myself sitting there initially nervous, wondering if my defense was enough, giving me less enjoyment.\n\nHowever, I eventually stopped worrying and just felt bored, shift+tabbing to watch YouTube and talking with a family member in another room while the game played itself. I'd come back, see if I had success or failure, and if the latter, I would just do the same tower setup, pay for one more upgrade, hit start, and walk off again to come back in a few minutes and see how things went, because the cursor shots (player interaction) were so meaningless in my experience after the first couple of levels, even when charged.\n\nAlthough I ended up with a more positive outlook on the game than I did when I initially reviewed it, and I played through to completion of the first of six campaigns this time around, my experience was not a fun one, because I was barely playing the game, with my level of player involvement genuinely being less than a clicker game upon hitting the start button each time.", "timestamp_updated": 1501345797, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "16", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500355926, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33720396", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495191", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500727441, "steamid": "76561198158352871", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I think this is the first game I reviewed or something.

A story more compelling than it has any right to be, interesting worldcraft, engrossing (and sometimes distracting) visuals, this game oozes care in its construction. \n\nAnd when it comes to the \"is it fun\" argument, simply a resounding yes. Excellent mechanics for a tower defense, with enough truly new and novel approaches that the same old tower defense techniques won't work just like you're used to. Add in a broad difficulty slider, new achievements, and some secrets, and there's enough game here to keep you interested for a long time. \n\nI've really liked this game for a long time, and this version is truly excellent.
