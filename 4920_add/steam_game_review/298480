Set a ship for manual control and it slips back into automatic mode for no apparent reason. Send a bunch of ships in one direction, they detect a target that they shouldn't go after (e.g. destroyers vs battleship) and they steam straight for it even if you command otherwise. Plays ok to get you through the Steam 2 hour refund window and then it heads straight for the bottom. Another reviewer compared it to Pirates! but it lacks that games side plots, mini-games, and humor.", "timestamp_updated": 1500168093, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500168093, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 174, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 60, "total_reviews": 234}}
