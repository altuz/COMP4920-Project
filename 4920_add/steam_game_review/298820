Just for clarity, let me state that I had already beat Millennium: A New Hope, and that I also only played the game on normal difficulty so my review will be based on those facts.\n\nIf you're a fan of the old 8-bit or 16-bit RPGs that were popular on the SNES or other systems, you're probably going to like this game.  It's very smooth, has nice artwork, good music, and I didn't have any problems with bugs.  Beating the game will probably take in the ten to fifteen hour range, depending upon how thorough you are in seeking side quests.  This game has a number, and you have to be a bit creative to discover them all without cheating.  The only ones I found a little superfluous were ones at the end where you basically went and had to hunt down gates in places you've already been.\n\nBut, I digress.  The story is set in a world where the lead character is Marine, a young girl who is living in a kingdom where a despotic ruler, Lord Dragon, with the help of some nefarious underlings, is running things where only a few benefit and many suffer.  So, she is trying to collect heroes to help fight him in a future election.  While searching these out, she goes on various misadventures.\n\nCombat is standard RPG menu based fare with basic attacks, accessible skills, defense, and item functions.  It can get a bit repetitive, but the game isn't too bad about making you work to level up at normal difficulty, and they offer easier modes called easy and story for those who want less of a challenge, and a harder mode as well for those who prefer.  Dungeons will take about an hour to two hours to clear.  \n\nOne thing that is challenging is finding all the secret rooms.  Millennium 2 often hides secrets, so be sure to look and click around a lot.  Some players use the mouse mode to do a quick check of the screen to see where jumping off screen can lead you somewhere new.  These quests are almost never essential to the game, but something players should seek out because they offer substantial advantages to the characters in game.\n\nIt's a good game, and I'll be purchasing the third when it becomes available here on Steam.  For the price I paid, just under $5, it was definitely worth the cost in terms of entertainment, although the one thing that does frustrate me a little is reaching the end when it felt like it was just beginning.  But, in terms of producing these types of games, I've been a fan of Aldorlea for a while, and if you like games in the RPGMaker+ vein, this is as good as it gets.", "timestamp_updated": 1405456272, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405456272, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "20313163", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507984", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1436234881, "steamid": "76561198065396619", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Millenium is an amazing game series, this is the first RPG I ever played on Steam and I haven't yet found anything that beats it.

Unfortunately part 2 of Millennium just isn't as good at all and reading reviews of the rest of the series I see that the main issues I have with part 2 only gets worse as it progresses. \n\nThe main storyline was much shorter than the first game. Things felt more unbalanced and there wasn't enough areas to explore to make all the traversing through the map feel anything but like a boring grind once I'd already visited a place.\n\nBut what really killed the game for me is how things are time sensitive. Unless you spend a lot of time searching every inch of the screen in the areas your character walk through you may later discover that you can't go back to that area. I like exploring and I had a lot of fun finding all the secret rooms in the first game. The first game had a time sensitive issue as well but not being able to buy all the things from the forge because I hadn't been aware of it  wasn't so dissappointing that I felt let down and I felt that I could easily replay the game on hard mode later and make sure not to forget the forge then.\n\nIn this game however I discovered that I had already lost the chance of completing all quests half an hour into my game since I had no idea I wouldn't be able to revisit Mystrock again once I left. It was a very disheartening discovery 15+ hours into the game that I wouldn't be able to complete two quests because I hadn't spent more time searching through the first town I went to before leaving it again. \n\nThis series makes me feel as if I need a walkthrough to guide me step by step through it if I want to complete all the quests. I usually don't want a walkthough until I've been stuck and desperate for a while. \n\nMillennium - Take me Higher just isn't fun enough to restart the game and replay it and I've lost the will to try the next part of the series.", "timestamp_updated": 1441746410, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441745989, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "30831104", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1490871919, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 362, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The second in the Millenium saga, this game takes the concepts of the first game and builds on them to a better degree.
