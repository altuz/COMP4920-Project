The fights in the main part of the game are more about tactics than raw statistics of your characters. Every enemy in the main part of the game has a specific weakness that you need to target to be able to do any meaningful damage and all the different negative states you are capable of inflicting feel useful as they can enable you to fight opponnets that you should not be fighting yet. The only enemies the different states don't work against well are the extra bosses specifically the animal kings bt those ae meant to be had to beat even on much highelvels.\nThe game uses a bit of rpg maker rtp sprites, but I don't think that is bad as frankly a lot of them are good. The overall atmosphere of the game is well made, different locales feel different and especially the underground portions make you feel like you are underground.\n(this part is extremely subjective) There are some fun mechanics in the game connected to some of the characters but I will not speak of those as that could spoil the game. (this part is extremely subjective)\nOverall the game is enjoyable and plays quiet well.", "timestamp_updated": 1409991187, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1409991187, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "30839105", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1490900621, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 362, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Third in the Millenium series, this game is a nice segment.
