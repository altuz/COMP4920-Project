I think thats about 1 and a half to 2 hours gameplay, the rest of the time i have spent troubleshooting. But step by step.\n\nThis game looks really good. Artstyle and details are pure Warhammer 40k. You really get the feeling of exploring an abandoned Space Hulk. I could spend hours looking at every little detail of my teammates armor or the high-gothic architecture of the different spaceships. \nThat said, they dont look like different spaceships. \nSure, every once in a while you get a different room or the architecture changes from wide and open to more functional/industrial looking enclosed spaces, but thinking back i cant really remember what the differences between the missions where or what i even did. \nYeah, there was one cool looking room with a large bell in the middle, i think they showed that in the trailer, and at one point i had to hold an area against 2 or 3 waves of enemies, but thats it. No real setpieces so far or a noteworthy enemy. \nAs i said the map in itself looks great. Everything is stuffed with little details, dead bodies, purity seals, weapons laying around, blocked doors, etc. \nBut everything is static. You can find some collectables, block some doors or hack a turret. You even have unlimited ammo for your weapons so you dont have to look for ammunition packs (which propably makes kind of sense lorewise), but that makes it dull. You just dont look at it anymore. Aside the occasional fake-wall with a collectable behind hit or a computer screen with some story information there is absolutely nothing that you have to care for. And things look cool only so often.\n\nThe mapdesign is okay. Every mission is another spaceship in the Hulk that has different objectives to it. You can move freely and choose your own way through it, but the objectives usually lead you through most parts of the ship. Open spaces and confined corriders are well mixed and there is little to no backtracking. Sometimes you can enter a room twice but thats mostly through different doors and a different part of the room. \nThe only thing i could complain here is that you can see enemy attack directions and spawn locations on your minimap. That is not really part of the mapdesign, but it works actively against it. A good part of the tension gets lost when you know when and where an enemy will attack. \n\nThe weapons are pretty nice. Everything packs a good punch and the soundeffects are good as well. Slicing enemies with a sword or punching them to pulp with a power fist looks great, feels great and is great. \n\n\nHowever. \n\nThis game is a technical mess. Not as bad as other titles, but a mess nonetheless. The Discussions are full of people having technical issuses, there are numerous game-breaking bugs and all sorts of other things that make it unpleasant. I have not touched multiplayer yet because my game kept crashing at random points. It got better after reinstalling my gpu drivers but still occurs every once in a while. i have my taskbar on the left side of my screen, which causes an offset between the cursor and its actual position in the game after alt-tabbing out. there is a pop-up box describing the effect of skills that you can choose. but that description box is outside of my screen, and only every first letter is visible. My workaround? get a second monitor, change the game to windowed, pull it so that you can read what is outside of my screen, and the write down what the skill-description says. Great. \nAnd the best part? those are just my bugs. i have not even encountered most of the other bugs that people tell about. things like crashing in multiplayer when you press 'i' for your inventory. \n\nIt is really sad. There went clearly a lot of effort into this game, and it struggles to deliver on the most important level. You cant enjoy a game if you cant play it. As it is right now, i cant recommend Space Hulk: Deathwing. If you want to pay 40bucks for a singleplayer/coop horde shooter/slasher, look at Payday 2 or Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide. Payday 2 hast the most content and gunplay, Vermintide has great maps and meele combat.\n\nI'll try to finish the singleplayer campaign and look at the multiplayer. If necessary i am going to update this review afterwards. \n\nAs a last thought: Im optimistic that this game gets into a better state. Maybe not tomorrow, and propably also not next month.

Ruined capital ship causeways wide enough to fit four or five large men, standing shoulder to shoulder become something like a three-foot wide clearance in the perception of a single Space Marine in Terminator Armor, and there are four of them trying to squeeze through these spaces. The steam, the liquid pouring out of a loose valve or pipe and shimmering on the floor and walls, heat waves, or the frost creeping its way up a helmet's visor give visual ques as to the environment outside of the nigh-impervious and vacuum sealed bipedal tank you command.\n\nIf a half-blind logjammer of four super soldiers in power armor stuck on one another trying to fit through the eye of a needle wasnt enough, the enemies complete the overwhelming sense of enclosure: they come in small waves of two or three at first, testing you, then...\n\n[i]\"It was the battering of drums I heard \nIt was hunger, it was the hungry that cried \n[b]And the waves, the waves were TYRANIDS moving[/b], \nMarching and marching in a tragic time...\"[/i]\n\nOne hundred screams become a single roar, the radar blips red in 320 degrees, and the little yellow dots come running towards the center. Someone locks and seals the airlock behind you, it diverts the horde, but they keep on coming. The Flamer whooshes, the Plasma Cannon/Spear of Caliban makes the snap-pew sound followed by a tiny sun exploding in the foreground, the myriad Storm Bolters with various ammunition rattle and shake and tracers lead to the beady glowing eyes and spiked spines and tentacled faces and toothy maws and claws and talons that approach faster and faster and the roaring doesnt seem to stop, a pipe explodes in the background taking a few monsters with it, and then the guns jam, bolter rounds bounce of an allies armor as he shifts positions and inadvertently blocks your lane of fire, and two Battle Brothers stop to reload, and that half-breathing space of ceasefire allows the enemy into your personal space and suddenly a Crozius Arcanum and a Force Axe and Power Fist and Narthecium are swinging desperately because there's no time to reload. Everything is crackling electric and a psychic fireball, from your side or theirs is going off in the middle of all of it. Eventually it all stops, the screams, the roars, the crackling and the explosions. It all gives way to the quiet creaking of the settling ship.\n\nThe steam and smoke and oil slicks are now joined by smoking alien corpses, blood covers half of the hallway, guts are splattered everywhere, and the Apothecary proceeds to do his best to bring everyone up to fighting trim. The Space Marines reload their weapons, and march on towards their objective.\n\nThe guns, the armor, the broad arching cathedrals-like spired and cramped narrow hallways are all gorgeous, the sounds are spot on, and the lighting effects are top notch.\n\nIt's really an amazing experience, [i]however[/i]: The flaws.\n\nThe game has a bug that causes freezing for upwards of too many seconds, it just stops, the sound keeps going, but your screem locks up - it can be the difference between life and death and many times it just means death if the person it affects gets stuck in a bad position, like the wrong side of a door, or out in the open. It usually means someone is sitting out for nearly 4 minutes if nobody can bring them back through a special ability.\n\nThe respawn timer itself seems arbitrary, like the developers wishfully thought someone would take the hint and be forced to play one of the two specializations capable of \"reinforcing\" - I appreciate a cooldown period, but going over 1 minute 30 seconds seems excessive. I shouldnt be able to go downstairs, cook popcorn, grab a few drinks, and be back with time left on the clock before I can jump back in.\n\nRegarding timers: some of the objective timers are too damn long, the Geneseed container room with the super awesome frost effect on your visor? It's ludicrous. Either you lock all the doors behind you, start the event, fight the broodlord, and stand there for a year doing nothing - or you don't lock all the doors, fight the broodlord, and then fight an endless stream of enemies for a year. Neither option is very fun. And several spots in the game have super-long timers while some Auspex Scanner-Servitor seems to be stuck updating Windows 10.\n\nMost missions involve the same formula - \"Walk to this place, fight along the way; arrive, put down a beacon/flip a switch/break a thing, fight while you do it and maybe fight a big guy while you're at it; escape to the next area, fight while you retreat.\" This gets repetitive, even with new environments which help to spice things up.\n\nThe enemies are basically all the same - they get new cosmetic skins and become tougher, maybe a little faster, and maybe they get a new ability or two, but on the whole you lose all of that in the lens flare and flashy explosions coming out of your weapons and impacting them. All Tyranids look alike in the glow of a Heavy Flamer. This gets repetitive, and it would be nice to have some other types of enemies to change it up - Chaos, Orks, Necrons something. Anything.\n\nCommunication is key in any cooperative effort. This game does not facilitate it very well. A majority of your in-game options for communication are achieved via hotkeys which produce decently voice-acted, but quickly repetitive and eventually agitating sound bites - [b]\"I will lead brothers! Follow me!\"\"I will lead brothers! Follow me!\"\"I will lead brothers!

Trying to get your apothecary to heal your third companion during combat is a waste of time, literally, the menu will jump around and if you  are struck by melee forget it. There really aren't that many commands to issue and why we can't remap these functions to hard keys and eliminate the ridiculous radial menu, I can't figure...especially since this has been a top complaint since day one...HELLO DEVS!!\n\nBesides the tutorial being too short and that it does not cover everything by a long shot. The biggest ommission is that you start with two psy powers, but they never even tell you about the first one, triggering outside of combat doesnt really tell you what it does so I tried it in combat and nice enough it blasts bad guys, yay,  but until you stumble upon it when you get skill points you don't really know what it is...\n\nThis game has great POTENTIAL if they fixed the stupid radail menu I'd be playing again in a moment.
