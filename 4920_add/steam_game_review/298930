I'm actually glad that I finally finished this game. \n\n[h1]My short review[/h1]\n\n Don't do this to you unless you have masochistic tendencies. I'm playing adventure games for almost 30 years now and I've dealt with my share of clunky UI, pixel hunting and unintuitive game mechanics while still enjoying the game but this one - just no.\n\n[h1]The idea behind it is good[/h1]\n\nI actually liked the idea behind the main mechanic in this game. Rather than just looking for physical items that you can use on objects in the world, here you are also looking for clues for a kind of \"brain inventory\". You mainly find clues by reading documents, letters and books and underlining interesting stuff in them. You then figure things out by combining clues in your brain inventory.\n\n[h1]Now let me tell you the ways this sucks in practice[/h1]\n\nFirst of all, the [b]inventory system[/b] itself. It is much too convoluted and unintuitive.\nYou open your physical inventory by right click and another right click lets you investigate physical items more closely. \nWith left click on a brain symbol you open your \"brain inventory\". The left side of your brain inventory has a list with your clues, on the right side are 5 open slots for combining clues and sometimes items. You drag and drop clues and items from your inventory into these slots by holding the left mouse button. To remove clues from these slots, you have to simply click on them. Physical items you have to drag and drop back again into a free slot in your physical inventory. To combine items, you have to click on another symbol. If in all of this you accidentally click the right mouse button, the whole inventory closes and you can start anew. This happens a lot. \n\nSecondly, [b]finding clues in documents[/b]. Oh god. Open inventory, open document, click on pen symbol, try to actually underline what you want to underline, click on another symbol to find out if you were right. \"Not particularly interesting\", ok, rinse and repeat until you have basically underlined the whole document piece by piece (granted, you can adjust your difficulty and be spared from all that but why play an adventure if you do that?). Some things are apparently interesting, but your character doesn't know what to think about it, yet, so you don't get a clue from it and have to return to it later. No problem, right? Wrong. Some documents you don't take with you but you have to physically return to whereever you've found it first. So, if you get stuck, you go through all locations, looking at all documents again to find this one elusive clue that you had found earlier but couldn't use at that point. Argh.\n\nThirdly, this would be pretty annoying in any case but it is made almost unbearable by the [b]god awful way in which you move[/b] in this game. You see everything from a first person perspective and to move around you move the \"camera\" around with an arrow in the middle of the screen. This arrow changes form if you point in a direction you can move in, which then beams you to the next point in the room where you can look around a bit. Why not move with WASD and look around with the mouse? If you want to have a first-person perspective this is the only way to do it. The way they did it is disorienting and induces sea sickness. No wonder the protagonist gets dizzy sometimes and/or loses consciousness!\n\n[b]The story[/b] is ok so far but it just stops in the middle. Almost nothing is solved by the end of it. \n\n[b]The graphics[/b] are dated but not too terrible. What is terrible, though, is the almost constant darkness. I used the highest gamma settings and still there were huge areas where I had no idea what I was looking at because it was all so dark. \n\nIn case you are still wondering, [u]I totally do not recommend this game.[/u]\n\n \n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1501146217, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501146217, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "34669219", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501750", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504559045, "steamid": "76561198113078861", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have genuinely enjoyed this game (so far). Given the age of the game it's incredibly atmospheric with a detailed backstory that you discover as you work through it.\n\nI understand some of the gripes other players have noted - including the \"back and forth\" game play and inventory management system but ultimately I feel that the good outweighs the bad.\n\nPros\n\n- Voice acting - excellent\n- Atmospheric music\n- Graphics - very atmospheric (a little dated)\n- Movement - I like the simple point, click and move premise - it works, don't knock it\n- Puzzles - can be fiendishly difficult but manageable by altering difficulty settings if necessary\n- Areas of exploration - more than I initially expected.

And the revelations you do get are entirely dependent on what you manage to dig up. That so much hinges on the player's own ability to search for information in order to puzzle together the bigger picture makes it a game worth re-playing, just to see if there's a tiny little bit more to see. There's a lot of reading but most of it is easy enough, presented in a good format and in sizable enough chunks to not feel like a chore to go through. \n\nNothing is handed to you; not even the ending is spelt out directly and instead leaves it to you to put together what has been going on and what the ending meant. I found it very satisfying to feel the game's own progression and writing is enough to let me know what happened. Too many times games, movies and books have someone or something give you a description of 'what really happened'  at the end. I find it a terrible device to use: if people cannot tell from reading/seeing the story what it's about or how the ending came to be, then sorry, your story suffer from a condition called bad writing.\n\nAlso a neat thing to note is that there are no blatant references to H.P Lovecraft's works in the game aside loading screen quotes and easter eggs. This gives you a game that can very well stand on its own for those unfamiliar with H.P.
