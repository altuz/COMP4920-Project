(sigh, so sad)  In all good conscious I can not recommend this game, unless the developers fix this game stopper.  (There is a game fix listed in the discussions for good game hackers, unlike me who messed up my game so badly I had to erase everything and start over anyway.)  Also unsure if it is my computer or the game but there are severely lagging areas.  When Amanda first jumps on the train, and the background graphics are moving, everything lags severely.  This lagging occurs anytime Amanda is outside the train while the train is moving. \n\nThis glitch is avoidable so here it is where the glitch occurs for the intrepid or the just down right obstinate like me.  The glitch occurs in Budapest as soon as the gamer opens the bank safe.  Before you do anything, or even move, click on the vault and the gamer should get a photograph.  If you do not get the photograph for criminal evidence you have encountered the glitch.  Please understand this photograph occurs in the third segment of the game, and more then halfway through that segment.  So play this game at your risk.  \n\nOther then this the gameplay is unique and interesting.\n\nStory: Amanda Waters (is the name the game automatically gives the gamer but the name is changeable) has brought her children, Peggy and Jimmy, to a train exposition.  The arrival of the train the Runaway Express is the highlight of the exposition.  While her children are on board they are not allowed to leave by a person in an iron mask and the train starts to leave the station.  Amanda jumps on board to rescue/save her children.  On the way she encounters three different crimes and must solve each one.\n\nGameplay:  A fair mix of Hidden Object finds and point and click gaming.  The Hidden Object finds, however, are not the usual list word finds.  The Hidden Object scenes are a combination of three different types of finds.  The first find type is the criminal investigation.  The gamer is given a magnifying glass, fingerprint power, a squirt bottle for finding blood stains and a flashlight for dark areas.  When using the magnifying glass and flashlight the game will state whether they are needed or not.  Finding blood stains is fairly easy as a find, since the game scene goes darker and the stains can be seen if looked for.  Otherwise just spray all over the scene like one has to do with the fingerprint powder until all of them are found.\n\nThe second type of find is silhouettes.  Find the object and click on it, easy enough.  Which leds directly to the third type of find, interactive.  If the silhouette picture stays this indicates that the item needs to be used somewhere in the scene.  Overall the Hidden Objects are not overly challenging, but not especially easy either.  They are a nice change of pace from the usual list finds.\n\nPuzzles: The few actual puzzles (not counting the point and click obstacles) are brain twisters.  Before my game glitched I encountered two quite worthy of the time and effort I put into solving them.  I would have to call them master puzzles since they are between the segments of the game or between major points in the game.     \n\nI really would recommend this game if it were not for the game breaking glitch.  (I would even recommend it despite the lagging, though I would warn everyone about that.)  Too bad.  I wish I knew how to contact the developers so I could tell them about the glitch so possibly they would fix it.

For a game with no save slots and no chance to backtrack, this is just unacceptable. Especially since the game tells me that I have everything I need to solve the case, but that's obviously not true as a quick Google search for others with the same problem showed. \n\nThe graphics were really pretty and the story ok. The map has fast travel, which I loved. It's only my second Hidden Object Game, so I don't know what's \"normal\", but the HO scenes have silhouettes you have to find and you must often combine items (Need a zebra? Find a paintbrush, use it on a white horse ...). Having to find fingerprints and blood splatter in each scene with some crime kit was just plainly annoying and made me abuse the hint option. \nI played it in Dutch to learn and noticed that not everything was translated - probably the same for other languages. \n\nOverall, I liked the game, but I won't restart it and risk getting stuck again.", "timestamp_updated": 1436615205, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436615205, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "24140297", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1467829971, "steamid": "76561198041316901", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Game is nice, but quite short and easy.
