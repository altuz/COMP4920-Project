Great ambient sounds, visuals consisting of often darker tones of colors and pretty grimyand scuffed surfaces, the cult stuff. Those combine to make one helluva great atmosphere. Basically. Horror setting heavily offset by excessively unrealistic gore and silly dark humor. Put short, you're a former cultist, betrayed. You get resurrected and go on a rampage on the Cabal. \n\n- Soundtrack. MIDI goodness, sounds best with Timbres of Heaven.\n\n- Challenging yet fair and fun gameplay. Weapons are fun. Even at mid difficulty there is a solid challenge, don't you dare stay in open and still when fighting the cultists. There are lots of secrets to find, keep on searching a level neurotically and trying every bookshelf, differing spot on a wall etc to find secret places with goodies. \n\n- Enemy AI is pretty good. Cultists randomly go prone to throw your aim off. They throw dynamite at higher difficulties, watch yourself! The Gargoyles constantly shift moving directions and move fast too when not attacking, to make them harder to hit. And what else is there.\n\n- Gunplay is great. Thompson is so awesome to fire full auto and wipe out squads of cultists. Double barreled shotgun too is fun and nice boom it makes.\n\n- The protagonist. An undead betrayed cultist who surely is not gonna just deal with his betrayal. A sarcastic combat loving gunslinger. Has a great selection of one liners, some which are uttered on certain points in levels and rest are said when you dynamite enemies. And then there also is the great, truly insane laughter randomly when you bomb enemies with dynamite.\n\n- Truly excessive and over the top gore. Cultists who burn to death somehow get turned inside out. Their innards fall out and blood sprays high up and around them, and their skeleton falls down.\n\nCons:\n\n- Closing doors of non mechanical kind crush you to death. And every door closes automatically. Really is a bad feature. Just what monolith.\n\n- This release ain't necessarily best technically, although it is serviceable. I think the steam version should be updated to come with GDXBlood port as a launch option. Dosbox emulation does work well enough though.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?\nBuy the game and embark on your adventure of slaying monsters and underlings of a vile cult.", "timestamp_updated": 1505910060, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505077593, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35073363", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505838", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505859601, "steamid": "76561198124319614", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's a good game BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WTF IS WRONG WITH THE FUKING CONTROLS!", "timestamp_updated": 1505859954, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "6", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505859954, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34954607", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506690875, "steamid": "76561197965193437", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of the best FPS games of a golden era, and also my favorite build engine game.
