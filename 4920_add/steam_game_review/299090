The fact that one of the main characters declares the final main story scene as \"an anticlimax\" pretty much sums it all up.\n\nI was immediately disappointed when I started the game and realized that I couldn't customize my character's looks at all. I expected to be able to change her hair color at least! Nothing. On top of that, the surreal feeling of being the only character who doesn't talk is pretty strong in this game. Even when you talk with your friends on messanger during the week, the chat bubbles only point one direction... she is silent in all things.\n\nI was disappointed again (though not surprised) that there was no creativity when it came to making the costumes, either. The tongue-in-cheek references were sometimes slightly amusing, but they would have felt more natural if there was humor in ANY other part of the game. And there really isn't.\n\nThe side characters are all okay, a little bland but not too bad. I can't imagine wanting to spend enough time \"talking\" to one of them long enough to date them. The friendship stat goes up so slowly that it was almost laughable. \n\nThe main storyline isn't the most exciting, but it was good enough that I decided to play through to the end. The last two scenes are painfully anticlimactic, however. There's almost no hints to the \"culprit,\" which makes the reveal boring, since there wasn't really a sense of \"did I guess right?!\" I'll use rot13 to add my final thought on the plot: Senaxyl, V jnf ubcvat gur ragver gvzr gung gur CP jbhyq or gur zlfgrel cbfgre. Gung jbhyq unir orra n gjvfg!\n\nThe upgrade you could buy (for ridiculously high prices) were almost useless. I noticed almost no difference between the lowest sewing machine and the highest, and the magazines and books brought up your stat by so little that they were effectively pointless. It also irked me that the developers put in the option to buy and upgrade that made each day go faster (and yes, you will HAVE to buy this, because the repetative and boring screens will make you fall asleep otherwise). \n\nThe main thing that annoyed me, however, was the oversimplified schedule. The game would have improved 100% by simply letting me choose a different task for each day of the week, instead of having to pick one task for the entire workweek. There were lots of times when I wasted a day because my costume was already at 100%, etc. If I had been able to make more choices, the slow friendship stat and low wages would have been easier to swallow.\n\nAll in all, this was a very mediocre game and it didn't have enough humor to justify playing it, even if you're very into cosplay/anime/manga. If you do decide to play it, I have two tips:\n1) Don't waste your money on the games available in the hardware store\n2) Social media presence is VERY important.", "timestamp_updated": 1463692398, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463692398, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "19975518", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499603", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451251464, "steamid": "76561198031527817", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If you're a fan of those simulator types, this game will keep you entertained for some time.
