Dont know what this genre is called if you do let me know in the comments please. Anyways this is sort of like a bad 3D version of that. You spawn an underwater mine in the corner of a arena you get little time up and time down things spawning (dunno if time up or down is better), and you draw shapes... you r goal is really vague and seems to be to draw shapes near your spawn area which doesnt make much sense as usually you draw something there and dont win. If you touch any shapes you previously drew they vanish. You seem to have a limit on how many dots you can use to connect lines to draw shapes but thats also vague.
