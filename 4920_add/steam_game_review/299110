But the voice acting was inconsistant as all hell. Bethany's VA did a very good job, as did the VA for the main character, but there were some lines that sounded more hollow for want of a better word. \n\nThough, despite the bugginess of the late game, I did like several aspects of the game:\n- The plot, as mentioned before, was competant at least. I rather liked the handling of the MC's amnesia as such a cliche is easily butchered.\n- The concept of the powers in the hand was a novel one that I really rather enjoyed.\n- The art. Holy hell, whoever did the art for this game deserves a prize because it was utterly sublime.\n\nIn short, while this game does have aspects that I enjoyed, I will be uninstalling it promptly so I don't accidentlly try to play it again and cause myself half an hour of frustration trying to get it to work.", "timestamp_updated": 1505311146, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505311146, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 72, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 12, "total_reviews": 84}}
