For that purpose only, this is my third playthrough of the game, in hopes of catching a glimpse of what I might have missed before. I know that it takes a maximum of 2 hours to finish the game, so it's not a labor, but the spark simply is not there.\n\nMeet our protagonist: Anna. We watch her drifting into the depths of an ocean in the opening cinematic, and then, she opens her eyes in an odd sarcophagus, remembering nothing of her past. She - who is a bit dim witted, may I say - is told that she just woke up from a century old slumber. She is in a mysterious underwater civilization and two unseen companions welcome her: an old man named Jacob who asks for her to try and gather three royal relics to uncover her own destiny, and a nameless young girl who we can only communicate as a fleeting, creepy voice in our head. One asks for our aid to help the sinking civilization by overthrowing the evil empress and the other asks us to activate 10 uncanny orbs to see something cool. Guess who is actually trustworthy?\n\nThe setting - besides being a shameless imitation of [i]Bioshock[/i] series - is beautiful, and I'd like to congratulate the visual artist on that manner. It looks old - as if taken from an old [i]Myst[/i] game, but pretty enough. Is there anything else remotely interesting or exceptional about this game? No. Sadly, the whole game doesn't go even one step further than being a collection of pretty environment design. Voice acting is tedious. Characters speak as they are about to fall asleep half the time. And other times, you can swear that Bollywood has seen better acting performances, with more feeling. Animations are actually old stop-motion presentations, and they look a bit eerie in play, which is not the intended atmosphere, I think.\n\nHOG scenes are horrendously bad, consisting of cut out stock photographs thrown around in blending colored backgrounds. It is nearly impossible to even recognize whatever you are clicking on half the time, so no one should expect for you to actually search for an item that you cannot identify! You'll quickly find yourself abusing the hint button just to get done with the scene. About puzzles; yes, there are some imaginative logic puzzles. But there is no skip option, so either you complete it, or get stuck on the present point until you manage to solve the puzzle. This becomes disengaging pretty quickly. Gameplay? There is a horrible amount of backtracking for a game this short in playing hours, and there is no usable map option for quick transport either.\n\nStill, my major complaint is about the story itself. At the beginning of my blabbering, I mentioned Anna being a bit dim witted. Well, I underestimated. She is downright stupid. I mean, she keeps seeing her own face on a family portrait, side by side with the same girl, and she doesn't get even slightly suspicious of the mischievous little girl voice, who speaks in a tone fitting for Disney villains! We practically see a portrait of the evil empress, carrying those purple orbs all around her, and we still keep activating them! I mean, there should be a limit to how stupid a character can be! [spoiler]In this situation, she was stupid enough to let a maniac blow up the archive of all civilization...[/spoiler]\n\nHailing from Gogii games, I'm not surprised to see a below mediocre game. Their games tend to be either brilliant, or horrible anyhow. What I was surprised is that there is a considerable amount of gamers who are in favor of the series. I didn't play the rest of the series yet, so I'm still hopeful that this shoddy little game doesn't represent all that there is for me to discover in Empress' world. I'll see for myself, and inform you accordingly.\n\nUpdate: Please bear with this game, 'cause with the following instalments this makes one great trilogy! I'm still annoyed when I think about this one, but I promise you, losing 2 hours with this game worths it when you experience the rest of the series!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_updated": 1461397373, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "6", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444766454, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "16975030", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 42, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529502", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1436534059, "steamid": "76561197972966291", "num_games_owned": 4448, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "Despite the lack of any animation, fuzzy hidden object pictures, cringe-worthy voice acting, no fast travel and backwards-walking that makes up half the game... uhhh... and unskippable credits along with a storyline that didn't even make sense, hmmm.\n\nOh..

It's an adventure/hidden object mix, which has become quite common, but leans more on its adventure side than hidden object, and instead of heaping in hidden object scenes every few steps, includes a selection of different kinds of puzzles, some of which were fairly unique. The hidden object portion is the standard fare you'd expect, perhaps even a slight bit sub-par with the amount of objects I felt I was squinting to make out (even with a hint, some were still unrecognizable in my opinion). \n\nThe adventure portion, however, more than made up for it. It won't shine in the way a full-fledged adventure game would, but as a casual title, it can be clever with the sorts of puzzles it throws at the player and gives a decent number of rooms to explore. This, though, leads to some backtracking, some of which is particularly unnecessary. Without spoiling anything, the ending makes you revisit nearly every screen to click a single object on each, which was a rather bland way of padding the already short game length.\n\nThe narrative is decent, but nothing groundbreaking. You'll see any major plot points coming a mile away, but it still gets the job done and gives you a reason to wander the game world. It's also fully voiced, and the actors do well enough a majority of the time.\n\nOne thing to point out is it ends with a \"To be continued.\" It does complete its own self-contained story at least, and the next part is available on Steam.\n\nLastly, it clocks in at a measly two hours.

You never have to worry about coming back to that area to find or do something else. And it gives a nice sense of accomplishment. I wish more hidden object/puzzle games incorporated that feature. The whole game has a very surreal feel to it. It's not a long game but I enjoyed every minute of it.

It's rendered with a grainy look and isn't hand-drawn. Together this makes objects harder to find than necessary. Add to this the bad font choice where you can't tell h from b, hat or bat?

I originally assumed it was a game for children because it started out so easy, however the puzzles rapidly (too abruptly) shifted from solve in your sleep to ones I finally got frustrated with and looked up the solutions.  It also had a handy Hint/SKIP Puzzle system so I wasn't too frustrated when I got stuck, but I did want to know how to solve one or two of them that stumped me, not just move past the obstacle.  \n\nThe hidden objects puzzle while using a telescope to scan an area was very unique.  Plus finding puzzle clues based on their scientific classification names, matching star maps, etc. were all unique for this genre.  \n\nThe game was colorful, exotic, and interesting.  I thought the \"surprise ending\" was way too obvious (again, was this game originally aimed at children?), which is why I only gave it 4/5 stars.  It felt like the plot was insulting my intelligence/situational awareness, but it forced you to complete all the steps to create the race against the clock situation at the end game.\n\nI recommend this game if you like Hidden Object Adventures!", "timestamp_updated": 1410864511, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1410864511, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "10233236", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500111", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1401042039, "steamid": "76561198076629424", "num_games_owned": 1196, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Really short, not so difficult, cute storyline and nice atmosphere... but the graphics is so bad only it makes the HoG parts HARD, because of the resolution you can't see the things you have to find. :/ So... 6/10", "timestamp_updated": 1401042229, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1401042229, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "10521313", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500111", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403303286, "steamid": "76561198053573780", "num_games_owned": 553, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I played this game straight through - I enjoyed it very much.
