After playing the first installment, I wasn't expecting much from this game but I'm glad that I decided to play it anyway. There is a decent amount of progress both in HOG scenes and puzzle design. Also Gogii Games managed to fit in some well processed plot explanations, accompanied by some bonus content.\n\nFollowing the explosion of the Arc of Humanity, Anna manages to escape in the nick of time. We awaken - this is becoming a thing now: passing out and waking up in completely unfamiliar territory - on a small island. The book that lets us communicate with Jacob is badly damaged, and our only clue is a doming piece of land far up in the sky: the Sky Temple is our next target. There, once again Anna's resolve and judgement will be tested by mystical forces. Will she be able to don the royal tiara and take the title of the Empress of the Deep?\n\nLet's see what has changed since the first game, shall we? Art design is just as beautiful and imaginative, this time heavily influenced by Far Eastern concept of aesthetic, alongside preserving the former Atlantean theme. I'm glad to inform you that resolutions are much better and the former grainy texture is no more. Voice acting is nothing spectacular - still a bit tedious and unimaginative - but there is a certain amount of improvement.\n\nThis time, we face better HOGs thanks to resolution changing, but they are still considerably hard for the genre. Puzzles are ordinary, with still pretty art design. Now, [i]Empress of the Deep 2: Song of the Blue Whale[/i] being a collector's edition here, contains some bonus content which would present you a brief glimpse on Pandora's perspective, our evil twin sister. When you complete her story through some memory logs, you'll gain access to a pretty fun casual game.\n\nScenario presentation is far better than the first game, and this time we face far better plot deceptions. There is an explanation for constant puzzles, the cause lying behind Pandora's evil, and even a second look on Jacob's personality and loyalty. The ending was somewhat foreseeable, yet made it obvious that Anna's story still didn't end. There are still questions to be answered and I'll salute the developer if all will be properly revealed in the last game.\n\nAs it is, [i]Empress of the Deep 2: Song of the Blue Whale[/i] is a beautiful and imaginative HOG, with the only minus being that one should play the former game to establish a decent understanding of the storyline. If you managed to bear the first one, you'll most definitely enjoy this one!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_updated": 1462545064, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444839502, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "12421250", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538752", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1488463731, "steamid": "76561198138437975", "num_games_owned": 1172, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I wrote a detailed review for the first Empress of the Deep and I don't feel up to writing another so I'll just quickly list the similarities and differences.\n\n- Number 2 is slightly longer than 1, much more so if you spend time in the bonus area and playing the new ZEM game.\n- Graphics are better.

However, another voice is also speaking with you, so, unless Pandora faked her death, you have to listen to Jacob and this new protagonist...\n\nThe plot is expanding: Pandora cursed the floating Palace and it's up to you to restore harmony, as the Empress of the Deep that isn't still crowned (but when would you have found time previously?).\n\nOnce again, the settings are really good: colorful, cheerful, dark,... anything related to the four seasons. Based on the same mechanisms as the first Empress of the Deep, this sequel is worthy. The puzzles aren't too hard though I had to skip one: despite pressing the right button, the game kept telling me it was wrong - a problem of a hitbox too small, making me go back to square one, which is annoying. BUT yeah, I've said \"Skip\". I found a Skip button :).\n\nThe Collector's Edition is also giving more information on your life before being pushed in the water by Pandora and on her state of mind. The extra game (ZEM) is also challenging - I will not say addicting but it is really a good idea.\n\nThe soundtrack is also quite good, as the voice actings.\n\nAnd guess what? There is a To Be Continued. I don't understand why, as you're restored harmony but by reading the plot of the third game, the TBC is kinda... not really tied to the main plot.

Like the first game, you know you've finished an area because of the 'area cleared' stamp.\n\nThis game's puzzles felt easier than the first one, and the addition of things like magical flying dolphins underlines pretty heavily that this game is directed at kids and pre-teens. You get to save animals and collect flowers and butterflies to solve puzzles. The game adds a new feature by having a minigame at the end that you can play for trophies or a high score.\n\nThe main character's voice annoyed me less than in the first game, maybe I just got used to it, and they fixed the terrible font.
