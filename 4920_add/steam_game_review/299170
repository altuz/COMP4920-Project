It took me about 4 hours to play on advanced, using at most one hint per scene.\n\nAs a hidden object game, it is mediocre, with the genre's all too common collage of objects not constrained by scale, gravity, or even common sense. Vault cracking is very minor: you get 5 simple logic puzzles in all. The most intersting part of the game are the 5 minigames where you eliminate people from a picture based on given criteria such as \"is eating\" or \"wears sandals\" until only one is left. You also get 5 chances to dress your heroine up with hair, makeup, shirt, slacks or skirt, and shoes. The major part of your time is spent looking for hidden objects. Plot and voice acting are forgettable.\n\nThe game has 5 chapters; best to save when a chapter ends or begins, as otherwise there might be bugs, check the forum. \n\nI'm a general gamer, not a hidden object fan, and I have played quite a few hidden object games that were better than this, such as [i]ClockWork Tales: Of Glass and Ink[/i], [i]Paranormal State: Poison Springs[/i] or [i]Isabella[/i].

Since the games release on Steam it has been reported to have a nasty string of reported bugs and I myself ran into them from chapter three onwards. So saving your game constantly is a must, unless you love restarting the game from the beginning.\n\nEach HOG scene requires you to find an assortment of listed objects from scenes that look like a tonne of grenades have gone off in an op shop. With the low res and high frequency of HOG scenes you will probably develop a headache in no time thanks to the constant mashing of the hint button with your forehead.\n\nOccasionally the game breaks up the monotony of HOG with 5 dress up your dolly scenes and 5 open this vault scene by solving a series of puzzles. The puzzles were so easy I was able to solve them by breaking wind randomly in the direction of the keyboard and letting wind power do its magic.\n\nThere are some interesting and novel quirks to the game like the limiting of people in a crowded room to find the subject you\u2019re looking for that fits all the listed requirements, and even the pick lock system which starts to shrink its correct hit box the longer you procrastinate.\n\nThe story is that Melissa a cat burglar who is a wizard at breaking into top notch banks using mundane objects like a pair of scissors and some blue tack has had her son Noah kidnapped. Demands of her illegal services are made if she ever wants to see her son alive again. While performing this last job she must uncover the identity of the kidnapper and outsmart them and bring the bad guys to justice. It should come to no surprise that Melissa super power of combining things like garden hose, mirror, fish hook and bread roll saves the day.\n\nThe real biggest problem against Melissa finding her son is not the bad guy, but more the nasty sudden crashes and glitched sounds that many experience from chapter 3 onwards. It seems the developers at Gojii are even worse than the bank systems she has to break into. As no objects whatsoever are needed to break this game. For the price it is advertised you would think that the developer and publisher would at least offer a properly working product.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1487168972, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487168972, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "14544868", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503663", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1424359815, "steamid": "76561198179752167", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "really disappointed with this game, it looked like really good hidden objects game until, i got to chapter 3 and the bookshelf glitch in the senators office, if you want to waste money on a game that you cannot complete then be my guest but honestly, dont bother", "timestamp_updated": 1424360044, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424360044, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "12409570", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500673", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1412771263, "steamid": "76561197970259820", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Bugs, glitches and no support make this game a no-buy!\n\nWould be a quite nice and solid hidden object game, if it weren\u00b4t for the glitches and story bugs.

It adds nothing to the gameplay.\nThe object elimination scenes were stupid. Original, but stupid. For example, you are looking for a woman in a crowd, why can't you just eliminate all the men and children? You can't. You have to go through pointless clues to eliminate every man, woman, and child, one by one, and some of the clues are ridiculous as well. \"He doesn't like lucky charms.\" Apparently, that meant having to eliminate someone wearing a sports jacket with the number 7 on it, or someone else with an outline of a horseshoe on their jumper!
