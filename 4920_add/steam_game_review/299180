Okay, gramps what have you managed to get yourself into besides a cage along with 5 other caged 'contestants'.  For accuracy's sake two people are in one cage, making 5 cages total.  Despite this bizarre and slightly unnerving introduction the only thing any of this has to do with gameplay is releasing the trapped and caged 'contestants'.  (Making this game 5 levels in total.)  \n\nI read all the reviews after I played the game and the negative ones did nothing to dampened my enthusiam about recommending this game.  This is what a TRUE HIDDEN OBJECT GAME IS.  No bells, whistles, or storyline beyond the premise.  No walkabout adventure/mystery.  No point and click, puzzles, achievements, or anything else that is associated with today's HO games.  This is a game for a connoisseur and an afficianadio of the Hidden Object genre. \n\nCirca 2010 and the third of a series, this game is only about finding Hidden Objects.  The only thing repetitive about this game is probably the music.  So turn it off.  This game uses a spin wheel to chose the type of hidden object play the gamer gets.  It is randomized and there is an auto-spin option.  There are 13 different types of hidden object find \"puzzles\": straight list, combine (which is equivalent to \"extra step\" finds), letter getter (find the alphabet which fill in the letters of find clues - almost like hangman), silhouette, focus (day version of night mode played with a fuzzy picture and a magnifying glass), riddle (i.e. orange and rabbits favorite food), elimination (eliminate several series of items from the scene before a riddle to the object needed to be found is given), triplets (find three of the same object), find 10 (find 10 of something), spot the difference, puzzle (match the puzzle piece to the puzzle piece in the scene) and countdown (30 seconds to find the object).  Just the variety of different types of Hidden Object \"puzzles\" is staggering compared to today's games.  Now add to this about 30 different scenes and the game is a very far cry from repetitive some claim this game is.  \n\nI never played the same thing twice, and not until near end did I even get the same scene (and then with a different puzzle type).  A mention about the scenes, the objects in the scene are what one would expect to find in say a garage, a swimming pool or a bedroom.  Albeit a very full garage, cluttered swimming pool, or extremely messy bedroom but overall the items are appropriate to the scene not just random junk.\n\nThe object of the game is to release the 6 trapped and caged 'contestants', who they themselves are a bit over the top.  Their banter is pretty amusing, as well as their stereotype.  There are six total game rounds that must be played to release each contestant. (In one case, 2.)  However, each game can be extended with bonus rounds (up to 3).  (I think this is random, or NOT getting bonus rounds may depend on whether or not the gamer lands the stop in a small gold area on the spinner.)  Despite playing a bonus round on the same scene the puzzle type is different, and the objects move or are added depending of the puzzle type.  During gameplay \"bonus\" scenes show up that the gamer can click on. (I only ever got two per puzzle.)  These bonus scenes last 15 seconds during which time the gamer must collect as many broken token pieces as they can.  These tokens give the gamer hints, 2x hints, skip (a puzzle type when placed on the spin wheel), and/or an unlock (unlock a new puzzle type) depending on how many pieces the gamer collects.  After each game round a scoreboard is given showing accuracy, tokens, etc.  (Accuracy may depend on misclicks, less misclicks the higher the accuracy??)  \n\nThat is the game. \n\nAfter everyone is free, the Master of Ceremony states the \"gamer\" cannot leave because there is more to do.  The \"more to do\" is found in the extended play area on the main menu.  In this extended play area, scenes are shown with stars beneath indicting which type of puzzle that has or has not been played.  \n\nOne warning: Some the scenes have windows which are so bright the objects in them can not be seen.  I thought this was probably my computer but apparently not.  Others have mentioned/complained about this.  I am quite sure if this game was ever remastered that this would no longer be a problem.  My solution was to use hints or simply randomly click on the window to \"see\" if anything was there.  Compared to some of the bugs I have encountered in newer games this was barely a shrug on the annoyance scale.  \n\nSo yes, get this game, and though I received this as a gift, full price is well worth it.", "timestamp_updated": 1474094771, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445403296, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "12033121", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527926", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1410261745, "steamid": "76561197998362518", "num_games_owned": 2357, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I bought this Game during a Sale after discovering how good HOG`s can be through the Artifex Mundi Games.\nSadly this one is not even close to them.

Like many of the older games, it's just finding objects in a scene packed with dozens upon dozens of items.  If you are looking for something like the new Artifex Mundi games which are more intricate and have more features, you probably won't be thrilled with this.\n\nThat said, there is a wide variety in the types of HO scenes in this game.  Essentially, you spin a wheel for each scene to see what variation you'll be playing, with a \"skip chip\" that can be used to block off a certain type that you don't like.  While they are all \"find the object\" variations, there is enough variety to keep it interesting (combining objects, traditional list, timed, silhouette, plus some pretty different ones that you don't see often).\n\nI've seen some complaints about pixel hunting and low-res graphics, but to be honest, I had no difficulty with it.  There was no pixel hunting for me, and all of the objects were defined well enough for me to easily discern what they were.  The scenes can be difficult, especially depending on the mode, but I don't feel like the graphic quality is the problem.  That's not saying that it's a gorgeous game, it definitely comes off as old with dated graphics, but not to the point where it hinders the gameplay.\n\nIt is a VERY short game.  I clocked in at 2 hours from start to finish in one sitting.  Finishing the game unlocks the ability to complete each scene with the different game modes, which adds a touch of replayability for people that enjoy the simplicity of HO scenes without the story.  I would recommend getting it on sale due to its age and lack of frills (I picked it up for $0.99 and it was a buck well spent, in my opinion).\n\nAbout the story... there isn't much of one, which is pretty common for these early games.  If you go into it for the gameplay and not the plot, it's not that big of a deal.  If you want a deeper story (or any story...), again you may want to bypass this.\n\nTL;DR: only worth playing if you don't mind the old-fashioned HO games that are ENTIRELY object seek without frills, bells, whistles, or embellishments, but well worth it if you like the old-style HO games.
