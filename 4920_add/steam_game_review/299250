There's not much to do, but at least you can sit back and relax, especially when commanding big cruise ships, ferries, etc. The game has excellent graphics and the water looks visully stunning, especially when you are out in the middle of the ocean and high up on the bridge. You can walk around the bridge on larger ships and see the scenery from every angle. Graphic quality inside the bridge is excellent. The controls are good as they offer precise steering on the ships. Game runs absolutley perfectly on my PC and I have never had any crashes. I also get a fantastic frame rate. I also love the 'swell' effect at the boats sway on the waves. Port Control speak to you and keep you updated on what you have to do which is great. Sounds are spot on, including engine sounds and cab switches/controls.\nOverall, I think is a great game and a must-have for any simulation gamer. Try to get it when it is on sale as then it is better value.\nOverall, I give it 7/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1500310735, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499629246, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34513622", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502521", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503797945, "steamid": "76561198415678429", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Bought yesterday, hard to load.

The whole scenario is rubbish, a bulk carrier with two engines and azipods at that, (I doubt there is one of those in the world) and I presume that the \"bow engine\" means a bow thruster, <0.1% of bulk carriers have those.
