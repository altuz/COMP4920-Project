I even highly recommend watching some gameplay before you decide to buy it. The gameplay is blocky and the early combat feels like an extremely downgraded Batman game, and everything else pretty simple and basic. HOWEVER I find the game extremely funny, and have mainly been playing it because of how much I enjoy the dialog and jokes, and while the platforming is pretty bland I love it because it reminds me the platformers I used to play back on the original playstation. Overall I'd say that I'm happy I bought this one.", "timestamp_updated": 1461318576, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461318576, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "22655535", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484734", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1462215927, "steamid": "76561198143884420", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Whens part two coming out", "timestamp_updated": 1461721245, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461721245, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "22573766", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478400", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1461291491, "steamid": "76561198118057251", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Not a hard call.
