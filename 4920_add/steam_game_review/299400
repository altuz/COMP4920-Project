First, the positive...\n\nReasonable Length - This isn't another 1hour/$20 VR game. I've completed the first of 4 chapters and there seems to be a 5th endgame area which probably isn't as long as a full chapter (it might just lead to the end credits for all I know) so at 90 minutes so far, I estimate it will last a good 5-6 hours or more. There's also a completionist element since you can find golden runes hidden in each chapter. I thought I only missed one in the first chapter since there was an optional door I hadn't figured out how to unlock but I missed 3 so some are decently hidden.\n\nNice Aesthetic - The scenery looks beautiful and there are plenty of moving details like the tide lapping the shore, water falling, flames flickering, butterflies flittering about, etc so it's not a dead static environment. It's very important for a world to feel alive even if there's nothing alive in it and they did that very well here.\n\nA Good Mix of Puzzle Difficulty - I can't speak on all of the puzzles yet but in the first chapter they started off very simple and the main puzzle near the end did take a little bit of time. \n\nAnd the one big caveat for VR users is that this game does not run fantastically. I run an i5-2500K @ 4.5GHz and a 1070 OC Edition and I had to choose between 100% resolution, 90fps and a very blurry game or 130% supersampling, 50fps and a game that looked a little better but was still blurrier than I would have liked. I still felt ok after the 90 minutes of gameplay but I was getting that tingle in my gut that said it was time to call it a night and I typically don't get nauseous in VR. While nice graphics come at a cost, part of the problem is just poor optimization.\n\nOverall, I will recommend it as long as you have a decent rig and don't get sick in VR easily.", "timestamp_updated": 1506202194, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506141614, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35114762", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516776", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506799766, "steamid": "76561197996634235", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 436}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Beautiful game with lots of content.

I am playing this game on my PC but will definitely return to it in VR. It is a beautiful vacation from all my worries. So far the puzzles have been linear and, push button logic to cross platforms and an overly drastic hint system. The game has very few bugs and there are only a couple things that I think should be polished so far. One being falling inbetween land water and platforms. I find myself getting stuck a lot, while it is easy to jump out it is a little jarring to the overall narrative and relaxing feel of the game. \n\nI enjoyed the shallow poetry through the first door.

They day night cycle isn't unique enough for me to give it 5 stars, but this is definitely a 5 star title for VR even though I haven't touched that part.

I'm really enjoying this game.  I'm not having any issues with graphics or performance.  I've tweaked a lot of settings and I have a high-end PC, so YMMV.\n\nI'd have to say that this is a very laid back and chill puzzle game.  It's mostly about the atmosphere and the spoon-fed poetic story snipets along the way.  There's something almost Zen about it.  It's not very deep and the puzzles start out very straight-forward.  It does increase in difficulty as you go, but not a whole lot that it's going to frustrate you.  If you are familiar with The Witness, this is NOT anything like that.  The puzzle complexity and more open world setting of The Witness is a much bigger challenge.  But that's ok.  Xing is like a themepark with enough environmental puzzles to make the scenery more enjoyable.\n\nSomeone complained about the background music.  I found it soothing, but there is an option to turn the volume of the music down/off, so if it bugs you, there is that option.  And then maybe play your own.\n\nPersonally, I'm glad that they chose the locomotion method that they did.  I don't suffer from VR sickness at all, and I find the experience of moving through the world of Xing nice and relaxing.  I like the method for interacting with objects.

Xing is puzzle game. Kind of.  Let's just start out with the good.  Graphically it's mostly good.   I downloaded this game the day it released because I was really looking forward to a Myst style adventure.   When I fist lauched it and the menu area came up my first reaction was, \"wow,.. this looks like poo.\"  it was super blurry and jagged around the edges, like many games I've seen where they look great in the screen shots and the clips but in actual VR, not so much.  Then I looked at the settings and they were all on low (probably due to the beefy computer you need to run this game)  so I maxed them all out which did help quite a bit but still the game was pretty blurry.  So I decided to wait to play and review and make a recommendation in the disscussions that the game needed optimization.  The dev responded and it sounded like he/she just didn't have any more ideas on how to improve the graphics and really, I can see that.  This game does a ton graphically.  lots of motion. details like the trees blowing in the wind and the water and reflections of water on the rocks and such make it very demanding.  I set my super sampling to 3, still blurry.  not terrible mind you but enough to make me constantly wish it was better.  There were so many people complaining about the blurriness and performance issues in Obduction (which I loved) so I went back and checked it out to see If I just didn't remember it correctly.  Nope this is def not nearly as sharp as Obduction is.   It does however seem to perfom better.  \n\nThe puzzle element is where I go to sleep on this one.  I have read in other reviews that they get harder as you go,. but from the 60 minutes or so I did play, they were spoon fed to me.   I think that is one of the things that just bugs me about Xing.   everything is just kind of placed right there.  The level design feels ,.. I don't even know how to describe it,. almost like an after thought.   There is just stuff kind of scattered everywhere,. but it's all right there for you,. a birdbath that tells you you need fire next to a fence with vines that clearly need to be burned then another very close by birdbath that gives you a poem about needing fire and low an behold it's right next to a fire pit.  I'm not feeling like things are really going to get to taxing in this game.  Myst it is not for sure. \n\nGame play itself,. the locomotion is great.  I'm surprised there isn't a teleport option.  personally if I was developing I would include one because there are so many people  that can't handle the smooth locomotion.  It's  the point your controller type loco which I love.  runs really smooth and didn't cause any frame rate drops.  the motion controllers work just as they should.  There is some jump mechanics that did end up frustrating me to the point of quitting for now but otherwise gameplay  is solid. \n\nSound,. here is one of the things that just kills this game for me.  The God awful music.  I would much rather have a game where the music is very minimally used.  maybe to emphasize an important event or area you have entered,.. but this music mostly plays on a loop over and over and it is just terrible.  Very corny ochestral soap opera type music.  I feel like this kind of thing really distracts you from being immersed in the world rather than pull you into it.  \n\nSo I am going to be the one with the unpopular opinion of Xing and say that if you are wanting a great, engaging, deep puzzler this is not going to scratch your itch.   If you want a simple somewhat pretty game to stroll along a beach in and follow extremely clear cut solution puzzles,.. then have at it.", "timestamp_updated": 1506349534, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506349534, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "35160868", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483918", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506180628, "steamid": "76561198052414642", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "May be it's great game, but why no teleport support movement?
