There's some chess (two types, normal and one where your characters fight out to see the victor) and there's various modes you can play like Last Man Standing. I've thoroughly enjoyed playing this alone with bots. The combat is gorey and heavy hitting, it won't be long until you have been completely covered in the blood of your enemies.\n\nOf course that's where the biggest problem lies. Multiplayer. This game has no dedicated servers, and there are no people hosting (as far as I have seen anyway). This is a massive hit in the face since the game promises multiplayer in the game descriptiojn itself. This means that you will most likely only play with bots most of the time.\n\nPersonally, I've been pretty happy with the game.

The are no longer official game servers provided by the game company and there are no other servers for this game anymore, literally none, nothing... so basically the online portion of this game is non existant\n\nThe game has multiple modes to play, there are two chess modes; classic and combat chess, and then a range of arena modes, which really feel like they are intended to be played online from playing against bots, the combat seemed enjoyable and it allows you to upgrade your character during a game with points you get from killing other players, you can buy upgrades such as increased damage and movespeed, and there are quite a few different things to choose from\n\nHowever the main reason I am slightly sceptic about recommending this game is because bots will only keep you entertained for so long, and most of the reviews of this game were written a long time ago, so there was probably a decent playerbase at the time they were written\n\nBut a game like this without multiplayer servers which is heavily dependant on playing multiplayer is definitely not worth the asking price and I don't think many people would buy something like Counter Strike: Global Offensive or the Left 4 Dead series without multiplayer, and this game shouldn't be any different...\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]\n[i] Provided it is in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given away to you for free, otherwise...
