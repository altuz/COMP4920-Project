I went in with very low expectations. Within the first 2 hours, I have encountered no bugs and the game runs on my potato of a laptop. It chugs along and occasionally becomes unresponsive during load times. BTW, the game loads a lot. Especially during story mode because it reloads every time the screen changes and this can take a while. A long time in some instances. \nThe humor is amusing, but nothing original, the graphics aren't specatular, but they are colorful and cute. If you have played  rogue-likes, the system is nearly the same, there's no hunger meter to worry about!\nBut seriously, at its current price of 5 bucks, and if you set your expectations to the bottom, this game is pretty fun and a decent time waster. Also, I wanted to write a recent review since the most recent are from a couple of builds ago.", "timestamp_updated": 1498867430, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498867430, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "32168694", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492701", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1467300672, "steamid": "76561198019982237", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "when was the last time we heard about the update? six months ago?\n\n\nit's a neat game, it has the potential.\nsadly, the developer screw it up.\n\n\n\n4/10\n\n3 points for the music, 1 points for other shits\n", "timestamp_updated": 1496555463, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496555463, "votes_down": 12}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 38, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 32, "total_reviews": 70}}
