The fact that the top of the screen wraps around with the bottom is quite cool. The goal is to get to the Sun and ask him some questions. Then after you do that, to go back to your place by Earth.\n\nThe Moon level set does a good job of making you understand the main mechanic of jumping through the screen. \n\nThe Earth level set gives you another interesting mechanic: a box which launches you in the opposite direction from where you hit it (up or down). It also plays a note that goes along with the background music which is a really nice touch. \n\nThe Venus level set has the best music in my opinion. It also introduces a sort of power-up which allows you to pause your upwards jump or downwards fall, stopping you in the air completely before gravity kicks in and pulls you downwards again. This allows you to avoid hitting spikes on the ceiling or to make longer jumps.\n\nUnfortunately another mechanic is introduced which is boring and rather frusterating. It's a timed wall that appears for two seconds and vanishes for two seconds. There's nothing really cool or fun about it, but it does add to the difficulty and challenge of the game.\n\nAfter the Venus levels, the game becomes a drag. It doesn't take too long to complete. While rushing, it took me about 1 hour 20 minutes. There are also achievements. These were fun to do. They add to the game if you want some extra, non-required challenge.\n\nOverall, it was a fun game for a while. AND IT'S ONLY $4. It's definitely worth buying the soundtrack with it.

The game takes a completely new take on platforming mechanics and executes a great 2-3 hour experience with it. In this game, falling off to the bottom or jumping through the top (or in the later half of the game, the opposite!) will instead loop you around to the other side, as though your jump went across a cylinder. On top of that, you can't control how long your jump is, making for even more careful (not torturous) platforming. It's completely wild and in the same kind of way that portal does, it just absolutely bends your mind for nearly the entirety of the game.\nThe soundtrack of the game is zen-like in its nature and even if a level would otherwise be particularly hard and mildly rage inducing, I even found myself just saying \"Damn.\" calmly after multiple failures at just the first part of one level. In fact, I have yet to be actually mad from this game just from it's soundtrack. Your experience may vary, but it is still a great feature.\nThe only unfortunate thing about this game is that its story is completely lost in translation. You can certainly understand what's being said if you mix and replace some words, but the story is extremely minimal and unless you are someone who plays games almost exclusively for a story then this shouldn't be an issue and may even further lighten the mood because of some silly translations.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game, espeically for its price point.

For a 4 dollar title, you get a nice relaxing experience that not only has some good level design that will challenge you with the mechanics it puts place, but one that will put you in a zen state of mind, even if you get frustrated. While the biggest problem it has is the games length (which lets be clear, seems appropriate for the 4 dollar price tag), the strong presentation carries the game by making it something you just want to look at, despite the limited color scheme. Mechanics don't stick around for too long before moving on to the next one, and sometimes you do have to think a little outside the box in order to move on in a stage.

It attempts to tell many different aesops, which for the most part are poorly constructed and are universally poorly delivered, and ends up feeling like it doesn't know what message it wants to give. The cutscenes are unskippable and get in the way of the game.\n\nThe level design is hit-and-miss, with necessary mechanic explanation levels, exploratory levels, and interesting challenges mixed in with levels which made me question how well the designer really understood their gameplay mechanics. Some almost unavoidable bugs, especially regarding the screen-wrapping mechanic, mostly do not get in the way of enjoying the game.\n\nIt is an exceptionatly short game, with my completion time (no extras or replays) sitting at 0.7 hours, and the \"Moon Rising\" mode adding an extra 0.3 hours. It also has very little replay value due to being a puzzle game.\n\nI would not recommend this game for anything over $5. Fortunately, it is currently on sale for under $4, and I consider it to be worth spending that money for a quick bit of enjoyment.", "timestamp_updated": 1411523985, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411517143, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "12577332", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1478387728, "steamid": "76561198035838716", "num_games_owned": 2562, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "what a magnificent little game moon 6180 is!  i had it in my library for a while and didn't play it, because i thought it's an unspectacular concept puzzle plattformer, one that challenges you until you get frustrated and doesn't offer much more with those simplistic graphics. well it really is an unspectacular concept puzzle platformer, but it sure didn't bring frustration and really was an emotional experience after all. \nthe game has a unique galactic atmosphere with an outstanding soundtrack and the simplistic graphics aren't lazy work, but a really good less-is-more design that supports the immersion. \nnow the gameplay is unique too and while challenging never discouraging. it challenges your orientation and your perception of space and gravity in a way i never experienced before. \nthere even is a little fantastic narrative of the moon that searches the sun, meeting other planets each with its own character on its way. like everything else the story isn't big, but charming and unique. \nall parts of the game work so well with each other that even though everything is so little i consider it a game of true greatness and a lesson in outstanding game design that a lot of AAA game designer should have a look at. \n\ni should probably point out, that the game took me less than 2 hours to complete, but i don't feel bad about it. i was beaming, the whole time. these 2 hours were wonderful. \n\nps: if you like the game,  you should watch the credits: first to see what a small team can realize a game actually and because there is a sad but personal message at the end.", "timestamp_updated": 1413770167, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413770167, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "12564762", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1413712426, "steamid": "76561197987885585", "num_games_owned": 2384, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "6180 The Moon is a rather delightful platformer that does a few interesting things, as you jump the screen wraps around, same if you fall, making you think more about how to overcome platforms and spikes, you play as the moon on a quest to find the sun who seems to have gone missing, the story is relatively light and told between worlds, of which there are five, each world with ten levels.\n\nOverall this game is fun and well worth checking out, however there is not that much here in terms of content or replay value, and the game can be beaten in just under an hour, but the mechanics of the gameplay along with the pick up and play ease and stellar music make for a fun platforming adventure.", "timestamp_updated": 1413710403, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413710403, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "25278107", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "4.962179", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1426296860, "steamid": "76561198079476296", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 7167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a great game to play if you want to play easy, well-made platformers.
