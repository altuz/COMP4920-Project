Is it the best tower defense I've ever played? No. Is it good? It's... OK. It's fun. That said, there are some flaws to the game, and pretty glaring ones, too.\n\nDifficulty is... off. The ramp in difficulty outpaces the cash reward per shell destroyed. It also outstrips the end of round bonus. This means that while the first few rounds are fine, and seem almost trivial, your ability to place and upgrade towers lags far behind the damage output required to keep up with the waves. \n\nMultiplayer is pretty broken. The address in the Join Multiplayer box is 127.0.0.1. That's not multiplayer. That's connecting to yourself to play with yourself. To join a multiplayer game, you need either the IP address, or you need the domain... and the host has to have configured their router properly. We had a network engineer to figure things out on his end to allow us to play, because none of this is readily apparent. And once the round is over? You're kicked back to the main menu, and have to enter the domain information again. Every single time. Same difficulty problems exist in multiplayer as in single player. In fact, they are exacerbated, as rewards and end of round bonus is divided among players. Five of us played, and it took one person saving all of their cash until round 17 to be able to afford a plasma turret. \n\nEven the enemies have issues. Have a color deficiency? Good luck. Finally managed to kill that last D4 working its way around the track? Oh, no, that was just the first set of shells... it was a D4 of Get Bent, you wanker, because now it's back to a D... A Lot. Furthermore, nothing seems to correspond to anything else in terms of how many lives lost. Was that enemy that got through worth five, or HOLY POOP, WE ARE DEAD! \n\nThe numbers need to be reworked. Badly. The network issues need addressing. Post haste. And yet... it's fun. Five of us spent a lot of time playing this in spite of the network and difficulty issues. We would spend a lot more time playing it if these problems didn't exist. \n\nI was going to recommend it, but for a game billed as 3D CO-OP Tower Defense, it fails pretty hard on the allowing you to play cooperatively. It has too many flaws to really recommend it. Fix a few of these, and maybe I could give it a thumbs up, but as it exists now, no, I'm not sure I can.", "timestamp_updated": 1503853093, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503841550, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 363, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 53, "total_reviews": 416}}
