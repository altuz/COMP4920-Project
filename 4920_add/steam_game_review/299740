Yes, there are bugs and glitches that drive us all insane, however, you can't deny that it is beautiful.\n\nNow, here is where I think the game is seen negatively and why I believe the reviews here are mixed.\n\nI think the developers were trying to please two audiences by having PvP and PvE. I don't think PvP works with how this game is designed. I have read so many reviews on here where people are upset because they spawn in and immediately die. If you were in an apocalyptic world trying to survive why would you kill each other? I get it, PvP but does it work? You get a handful of players in PvP that want to team up and survive, but then you have those players who just want to kill everyone off and not even communicate with anyone on the server. This reminds me of The Division and why it flopped so soon. If you want to go shred through players and win a \u201cchicken dinner\u201d go play PUBG or H1Z1 those games are designed for this type of player. \n\nThe hours I have played in this game have been spent in a Whitelisted PvE server called 'The Sanctuary' The name is true to the experience. I fell in love with this game because of how the game is played on this server. You are in a world where you are trying to survive. There are rules in place to keep the game experience pleasant. The best part? No floating bases. A community that plays together and has built relationships with one another because they want to survive together. We help each other find loot we need, help build bases, teach new players how the game works, etc. Every single player matters. If you die, you better believe we send everyone out to help you get your loot back. That's what it's all about. \n\nOn whitelisted servers you can find a place that works for your play style. It\u2019s very difficult to find a server with an admin who stays on top of their game. One who doesn\u2019t play favorites, who has rules in play to make the game easy and comfortable, who boots people because they are breaking the rules, and who has trusting moderators. I\u2019m lucky to have found that place.\n\nI really wish everyone could experience this game that way because I believe that's how it is meant to be played. I love Miscreated so much and want to see it be successful. I hope those of you who read this found this helpful and if you didn\u2019t I understand, to each their own. Happy gaming and thank you for listening.\n\nCheers,\nLadyWatters (Game name: Mia Valentino)", "timestamp_updated": 1506492011, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506446827, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "35081411", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516216", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1497745481, "steamid": "76561198327231070", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Okay so, this used to be my favourite game to play.

Do you want to scavenge for equipment to live and kill? Do you want to play essentially the same game as PUBG for $10 cheaper? Well do I have a deal for you! \n\nThis game is $10 cheaper than PUBG! Where is that $10 coming out of do you ask? Well, that's being taken out of useless game mechanics like a plot or any form of game security. This game will allow you to search for HOURS to find things, only for you to glitch on a ladder and die right where you stand.\n\nOh no! You died and all your stuff dropped on the ground with your body. That's OK! Your stuff will remain there until the very instant you run ALLLLLLLL the way back to your dead body, only for all your hard-earned materials to despawn right in front of your face!  Now if grinding for hours - days even - just for your shit to disappear in front of your face for apparently climbing a ladder the wrong way *doesn't* induce rage into your soul, well this is the game for you!\n\nOther cool things -\n\nThere are cars! Want to find a car, then only have to search even harder for all the parts to run the thing? Good! Now you have earned yourself a car through hard work! You can store this car at your base and use it for inventory until it decides to randomly despawn whenever the fuck it feels like with all of your shit in it. \n\nCRAFTING! This game is just like Minecraft! Only there are ridiculously long waiting times for crafting, and a horribly designed crafting menu. Can't get worse, right? Oh well, aren't you in for a treat you lil' shit. When it comes to actually *placing* the stuff you had crafted and worked so hard to build, there are only like 2 places in the whole world to place them, and they'll only set at a perfect angle. But finding that angle should be easy, the item will glow red meaning you cannot place it, and then it will glow green when you *can* place it. Only for it to say \"cannot place item here* after it had glowed green. THEN WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU EVEN GLOWING GREEN?? \n\nMoving on.\n\nThis game has limited storage, that way it causes you to fight other players and work for items. Or at least that's what the devs think. But what does storage even matter when all of the items you spent SOOOOO long hoarding either -\na. despawn\nb. are stolen\nc. are transported to the twilight zone\n\n(seriously, WTF game devs, why does every item have like a 1 day despawn rate or just dissappear whenever they feel like?)\n\nLet's see what else I can remember about this game that pisses me off...\n\n-Hotkeys decide to work whenever they feel like\n-Flashlights won't work through a scope (good luck during night time!)\n-Instead of running zombies over, they glitch into your car and kill you while still driving\n-Random glitch deaths\n-Random deaths\n-Seriously -- RANDOM DEATHS. THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE BECAUSE YOU WILL RANDOMLY DIE WHENEVER, only God knows when. Too bad he wasn't around to give the devs some pointers.\n-Run speed is about a fast walk\n-Stamina bar has nothing to do with running (thankfully, since you're practically walking anyway), but has EVERYTHING to do with jumping. A full bar will allow about 4 jumps until you're ready to pass out, and then you need to wait about 10 more seconds just to jump one more time\n-There is really NO plot to this game. Just collect random shit until you die.\n-No matter how much you build up your base, shit will either despawn or somehow magically get robbed.\n-The weight limit. Everything about it. It's too low, and honestly really fucking stupid.\n-Why the hell does a reload animation take over 5 seconds, but I can go into my inventory and do the same thing in an instant, but a hell of a lot more bothersome? \n-This game has been around since 2014. TWENTY-FOURTEEN. Check the release date. Why is there only an update like once a year and it changes absolutely nothing? Why are the devs adding hats and new animations when they aren't fixing major bugs and glitchs, or just giving the game a plot?? Work on the essentials before tweaking the minor things.\n-Wanna trade items with a buddy? Well the best way of doing so is just by dropping it and having them picking it up. Too bad half the time you drop anything it essentially teleports through the floor into the twilight zone.\n-Want to search the same storage unit as some else? Well, get fukt. \"Someone else is searching this.\"\n\nThere is so much more wrong with this game, like how it rains indoors and fog is practically an impermeable white wall after about 3 feet, but I feel like I had listed enough to prove my point.\n\nTake this review from someone who has wasted about 100 hours into this game. Miscreated had every chance to be everything that PUBG is, but they have bent themselves over with this game. Great concept, horrible execution. If you want this discounted version of PUBG, just bum the streets for ten more dollars and buy the real deal. My only wish is that I had purchased PUBG a lot sooner so I hadn't wasted as much hatred into this game. \n\nI'll come back to this game once it is rid of bugs and is actually fun like it was the first time I had played it. But based on the time lapse it takes for updates, I'm expecting I'll be living in a post-apocolyptic, zombie-ridden land myself before this game has even started to figure out to patch bugs before adding more hats. At least when I die, it won't because a ladder teleported inside my body.\n\nMiscreated - 2/10 - Do not buy.\n\nMiscreated w/ rice - 3/10 - Still wouldn't buy though.", "timestamp_updated": 1507072010, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507071520, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35092658", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505933", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505717704, "steamid": "76561198325179797", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 44881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have played this game a bunch, mostly due to the fun interaction with other players since the actual game content does little to keep one interested.

It now just feels like a big waste of time and a continual grind to regain the same items over and over that were usually lost to a glitch or another player looking to steal your stuff instead of finding their own. It takes a while to get good gear, weapons, ammo, vehicles etc. and to lose it constanly just to start over is pretty frustrating and unfulfilling. The developement team seems uninterested in doing anything to really improve the game or the many issues / glitches and would rather just add a few basic items occasionally to try to keep the community interested. It almost seems as if this game may have become less of a priority than their other project. Of the many players I interacted with, most seemed to feel an overall sense of dissatisfaction and I saw many who lost interest and just quit all together.

You can go out for an hour or two and have enough loot to fill up both of your maximum of TWO storage crates. Yes thats right once you build a base you can only have 2 Storage containers. Both of which dont actually hold that much. You are constantly having to make decisions on what to keep and drop. You can also use tents you can find around the world to store stuff in but you have to find one and there are only so many that spawn in the world and are hard to find. Its worse while your trying to build or add onto your base because you need to store and save up materials to build with. The building mechanics are also just terrible. Building pieces dont snap and arent designed very well at all. If youve played rust or ark and then try building in this game you will be very dissapointed. Its a shame really because the game looks amazing. its one of my favorites for graphics. Atmosphere is out of this world sometimes with mist and sunlight. Ambient sound is also great. The gunplay is also great. All of this makes the first point even more agrovating. Ive stopped playing it for this reason.

Gave this quite some time and it's just not interesting enough. Sometimes you wander around for half an hour before you find something more than food and a knife.

In 17 hours I managed to find one rifle with a few bullets.

In that stress test it doesn't go past 62.\n\n*EDIT 2 Also, depending on where you live and what time of day you usually play, you'll find that the server time for most servers there is 8pm, which means it's just starting to go dark, which means you can't even enjoy the scenery and you end up dying and getting a pretty fucked up jump-scare.
