You can get lost for hours playing the simple, yet still so complex and difficult, puzzle levels.  It uses a level hub that allows you to play and re-play levels in different orders so if you get stuck on one level you can always try another and come back later.  Each of these levels is a work of art in itself with the beautiful backdrops and the catchy background music.  However, the true glory of this game doesn't come from its pretty looks but rather its unique use of game Physics to enhance the puzzles.  The Land of Eyas uses a gravity-flipping center line to allow you to propel your character around the game board.  This allows levels with puzzles and solutions that your mind has never thought about before.  This creative concept gives a great feeling of satisfaction when you realize what you can jump off to slingshot yourself to the next goal.  The combination of the artwork, this cool gravity concept, and tight gameplay make this a must have game.  Not to mention the replayability that comes in because of the achievements and level times (Gotta get all perfect times!).  I definitely recommend owning this game and losing hours of your time to it.  You won't regret getting lost in The Land of Eyas!", "timestamp_updated": 1474139865, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1474139865, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "25659314", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500136", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1474681683, "steamid": "76561198032082383", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I was very pleasantly surprised by how easy this game was to get into.

The checkpointing needs work (too often there will be a long, dull part before a challenging part, and the checkpoint will be right before the dull part), the momentum of the character takes some getting used to, and the game under-delivers on the promises of its store page.  There aren't much in the way of secrets to uncover, and at least one set of them doesn't have any payoff for having found them all. Lastly, the story is trite, and doesn't really relate to your character or your place in the game-world around you (it doesn't help explain anything about the game, instead being thinly veiled history that doesn't really relate to the game's here-and-now).\n\nThat said, there's nothing wrong or bad that I would point to as a reason to avoid, I just wouldn't tell a friend to try this one instead of something else.", "timestamp_updated": 1469423668, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469423668, "votes_down": 6}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 4}}
