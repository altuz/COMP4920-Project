It is, however, pretty darned close on both accounts... \n\n    First bad sign: Opens in a small window which, when maximised, simply transforms the game from a small screen overlaying your Steam page to a small screen surrounded by whiteness. Spif-fy. Second bad sign: The only way I found to exit the game after achieving this extraordinary display option was to shut down my computer by force. Third bad sign: The, ahem, \"game\" itself...\n \n   It's a point-and-click game with static images, first person POV. So even when you look out a window to observe that your neighbour's house is on fire, you don't get even the slightest hint of animated flames writhing; just a static image of, well, your neighbour's house on fire. \n \n   None of this would be an especially huge minus, if the story itself were interesting enough. Spoiler: It's not. Nor would it be worthy of enormous criticism if the gameplay was compelling enough. Second spoiler: It sure as fuck isn't. Heck, even the presence of some cool jump-scares, or moments of split-second kill-the-zombie-before-it-kills-you action might have saved this from being one of the biggest shit-sandwiches you could ever opt to eat, and I've read reviews which claim you can use the shotgun you pick up to quickly shoot zombies as they pop up on-screen, but...I either had zombies fill the screen, munch the crap out of me, then unceremoniously disappear, or I had zombies fill the screen, take one bite out of me, and give me an instant Game Over. Neither event seemed to occur with any semblance of rhyme or reason, and the lack of any save system means that you'll be going back to the beginning over and over and over again, despite reports that the game can be completed in something like four minutes (a first-time feat which would require much more luck than skill, I suspect).\n \n   Add to this the hardest-to-find items in a video game EVER - I seriously challenge anyone to find that axe in the park without witnessing a walkthrough first, or simply spamming every inch of the screen just to see what happens - and basically what you have is an unplayable mess. It's a shame, too, because for all of two minutes the opening cut scene gave me some small semblance of hope that this WASN'T the crap-croissant which everyone claims it to be (i.e. said opening is actually quite good). Then the game proper begins, and it's all swiftly downhill from there.\n \n   The semi-competence of small aspects of this game - i.e. the moderately decent graphics and sound - unfortunately prevent this from even being one of those \"so-bad-it's-good\" propositions...so perhaps the only true saving grace of this product is the fact that it's almost eternally on sale for under a dollar. Given that the devs should probably PAY people to play it, that's still not much of a bargain, I'm afraid.\n \n   Only a REAL zombie apocalypse could be less fun than this steaming pile of undead excrement.\n \nVerdict: 2.5/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1465279160, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1465279160, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "10487170", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503466", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1402869259, "steamid": "76561198140006714", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Bought it.
