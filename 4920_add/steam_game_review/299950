I watched a few trailers and other videos and it made it seem to be a bit of a action fps with a lot of horror aspects to it. No, its a stealth game that gives you a awesome shiney toy youre not allowed to use if you want the good ending while having this idea of psychological horror thrown in. I dont really think the designers understand what psychological horror is.\n\nThat all being said the game does what its meant to do VERY WELL. Its an excellent game in its own right I just didnt enjoy it because i thought it was somethign entirely different. So do not let that first paragraph tell you to not get it just be aware its really not what some of the trailers will make it seem to be. \n\nThe story is actually really good even though i did not get to far in it this is very clearly a story driven game which i usually love but again, wasnt looking for that when i got this. The game will keep you slowed down pretty heavily if you play like they want you to and not guns blazing.\n\nThe phone and the apps were pretty cool and a neat gimmik that you dont see to often in games.\n\nThe shooting feels really good. The gadgets and weapons feel really good and all in all this could very well could be turned into an action fps with a few tweaks to the core gameplay.\n\nThe voice acting is PHENOMINAL. For a 30 dollar game the voice acting is utterly brilliant.\n\nAll that said it is a 30 dollar game, and looks good and plays very well. I cant speak for how long the game is, but again its a 30 dollar game so you get what you expect from that but you dont you get so much more. Ive paid full 60 dollars for games that arent anywhere near as well polished as this.\n\nI don't really have any real draw back or negatives for the game other then it just wasnt what i was expecting.\n\nI highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1506872097, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505021857, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35165750", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506206754, "steamid": "76561197991940839", "num_games_owned": 509, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 189}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Wow this game came out of nowhere, like a fantastic episode of Black Mirror, realised flawlessly. \nGet Even might have the most perfect sound design i've ever experienced in a game, impeccable voice acting and score. \n\nFrom the very beginning this was incredibly gripping and it only got moreso as time went on. \n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506207166, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506207166, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35305925", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499266", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503307512, "steamid": "76561198018329330", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Main feature of this game, what you do will have consequences. You can go rambo style and kill every oponent or try to go stealth and kill as less people as possible. Now the latter you actually can't, because then you regularly will get stuck (can't move anymore) when being to close to a wall or large object (for example car) which only leaves you the option to restart at the last checkpoint. That puts you into the position to correct your decisions or to boringly exactly redo your action. Your actions have consequences, failed.\n\nNow I'm in a underground car park, would like to go stealh but I get stuck all the time. Tried it three times and then gave up. I wanted to go refund but surprise, because I had to replay several chapters I was already at 2.2 hours. My only option would be to kill everyone while I avoid to get close to large objects, but I don't want that because that way free decisions in play style is failed too.\n\nThe developers obvioulsy don't see any reason to fix this game breaking bug, so now I sit here and did pay 30\u20ac for garbage.", "timestamp_updated": 1506722618, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506706148, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34816844", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490490", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502635130, "steamid": "76561198024417685", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[h1]GET EVEN[/h1]\n\n[i]3/4 in the game i hit a fatal CTD with no way to escape the loop ( so its safe to say that i never got to finish the game ) - from a technical standpoint-optimisation this game is a mess ( note : you need more than 8gb of ram to not run out of memory so increase the virtual memory page file to at least 6 GB ) - i liked the game ideas and the \"sequences\" , the mandatory use of the  camera functions was well integrated in the environment - tho too many ideas/mechanics cobbled together really hurt the flow of the story breaking the immersion big time ( a ton of documets to collect and read / also the camera has too many functions that must be accessed for clues ) - if you are looking for something \"fresh\" go ahead but i cant recommend this product based on the lack of functionality !\n\nalso if you want a good laugh - this was ( the only ) a ridiculous news-post-update 2 months after release from the developers part - enjoy;-D ![/i]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/games/299950/announcements/detail/1444947833826490970\n\nI recommend INFRA game on steam if you are looking for something similar that is not so stressful !", "timestamp_updated": 1506182309, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504884339, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 71, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 14, "total_reviews": 85}}
