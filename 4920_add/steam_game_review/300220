And by that, I mean this seems like someone's first attempt at making one of these games, and they seem to have done adequate. The plot is a bit contrived, but decent enough. Through a bit of comedic timing, you William, are turned into a girl because your boss/friend decided to insult a witch... who turned him into a butterfly. Note: You said nothing to the witch for good or ill...\n\nNow you seek a way to turn yourself back... while also changing the world... because that's the way things are done.\n\nWill you succeed? Probably.
