Sometimes these love-at-first-sight relationships end in crushing disappointment. (StarForge) Other times I get to witness the birth of something truly great.  So far, Adventurezator is definitely on the \"great\" side of things.\n\nThe style is fantastic, from the comical art direction, to the awkward pig genitalia, the delivery just makes me smile.  The whole concept of easy-to-use tools and emergent adventures is already quite enjoyable, and just screams potential.  Things feel pretty polished in an \"under construction\" kind of way.  Occassionally you run into these to-do notes where features should be.  But hey, this is a game that is currently in development.  You can't judge an unfinished house based on the fact that some of the rooms still need paint or furniture.\n\nWith Adventurezator's current state, in all honesty, my endorsement is mostly based on potential here.  I'm confident that Adventurezator will become something amazing however, because I see none of the warning signs that other failed early access titles exhibited.  Performance is good.  I see all good, original assets, not purchased Unity models.  The roadmap shown so far keeps things realistic, instead of promising the moon, only to ultimately fall short of it.  Because of this, I think you can safely give your money to the Adventurezator guys.

The story and the puzzles are simplistic, the 'action' is aggravating. Being eaten by a bear in suspenders is less fun than it sounds. Especially if it happens over and over, thanks to clumsy controls. Even picking stuff up or going through doors is unnecessarily complicated.  I didn't get very far into the story before getting thoroughly frustrated. \nThe lack of content on the workshop three months after release, might be a sign, that Adventurezator isn't a good game engine, either. For me the biggest issue is the inability to import my own assets. The models in the game are just too limited. The lack of any kind of scripting means, that I could only make the same style of unappealing action/adventure game as the builtin campaign.\nThe best part of Adventurezator is the cutscene editor. It's really easy to use. Pigasus Games should turn it into a standalone tool with export to video an GIF.

It has reams of promise, I like what little there is, but thats its biggest flaw. Very very little content, very little room for customization that would be expected when designing any type of game. Granted you can change backgrounds, masks and a few other art assets, what really hurts this title is limited ai entity customization. No real selection of body types, hair, or varied species lets say. To make anything really worthwhile that wont look like 100 different other user stories you need way way more customization otherwise every story a user makes will look identical possibly with exception to the text story. Thats just not enough to really warrant a lot of time at this point spent trying to create something.  I would rather have seen the developers add a ton more content and customization at a higher price point. The ability to create your own characters and ai. Ability to create outfits and edit facial features for example.  Art assets like furniture might suffice but still seems lacking. I just dont have the impression that I can create anything vastly different from any other user. I had hoped to create custom fantasy stories for my grand kids but none of them would look very different from the other. This is where this title suffers and its a huge shame as it has tons of potential to be amazing. Its just missing the mark in two very important and crucial areas, content and customization. I know its early access but even the dev posts seem they are content with whats offered. With just some smaller customization features in the future. Hope they realize they have a gold mine in the making. Slow sales most likely demonstrate that I am right in this regard. Needs more, higher price point to justify more features.
