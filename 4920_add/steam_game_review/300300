I usually end up quitting pure puzzle games like this for one of two reasons:\n\n1. I come across a puzzle that just feels impossible no matter how long I look at it, resulting in loss of motivation to pick it back up again.\n2. The sheer number of puzzles is giant. More is not always equal to better, and I find myself getting bored if there's no more new mechanics to be thrown in.\n\nThankfully, Ichi exhibits neither of these. Not once did I feel hopelessly stuck on a puzzle. A few minutes of thinking was always enough to get over any hurdle. Also, the amount of developer-made puzzles is enough to satisfyingly explore the mechanics the game has to offer. There's also a level editor with online sharing, but I think the game is fulfilling enough with the base levels.\n\nSpeaking of mechanics, the game play is very simple being a mobile game. This is not a bad thing, as this set of mechanics is very tight and even employs a bit of reaction time. One thing I love is when games reveal to you an ability that you had all along. Ichi has one of those (I'm talking about the action that doesn't count as a \"tap\"). When the game showed it, I definitely had an \"oooohhhhhh... I see\" moment.\n\nIt's usually pretty cheap on sale, so I recommend giving it a look if you haven't already.", "timestamp_updated": 1497998382, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497998382, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31250396", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504438", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505230910, "steamid": "76561198014895777", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Cute simplistic puzzle game.
