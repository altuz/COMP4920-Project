The minimal story is told through textual snippets found throughout the game, rleaving much of the rest up to the player to explore. When it works, the running, jumping, and sliding on platforms is good fun.\n\nThe problems I see are in 3 key areas:\n\n- The shift key is used for nearly every action you can take in the game. That makes it nigh on impossible to play when it unlocks the ability to spawn in platforms.\n- The actual spawning in of platforms is poorly explained at the start, and there don't seem to be any clear rules about what makes a platform spawn and stay spawned or just ghost out of existence.\n- The \"climbing\" ability is very jerky. Sometimes when you're very far from  grabbable surface, if you press shift the game bumps your chharacter forwards in a very unclean fashion, and pushed you up to the surface, often clipping through the world while doing so.\n\nWhen the game is just about running, and sliding in simple terrain it works very well, but as the levels get more complex it becomes nightmarish to try and manage.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1499697921, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499697921, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 78, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 88}}
