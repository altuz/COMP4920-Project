This is not a game for the casual player, the easily and not so easily frustrated, or anyone who does not take notes while they play.  This is a very difficult game to play.  (Reminds me of Deponia.)  This game has some very obscure references and reading the dialogue is extremely important. (Skip dialogue at your own risk.) More importantly is remembering some absurd remark or off-topic thought of some character a chapter or two later.  The clues are there, masked behind riddles that in some cases are very, very oblique, referenced in the boy's journal, various diary pages, or in some dialogue remark earlier in the game.  I would like to thank Micheal who posted his playthrough in the community videos, they were very helpful.  (Oddly enough he and I never got stuck in the same place. Note: Micheal's playthroughs are in German, but do not let that deter you.  The playthroughs are easy enough to follow.)  I would also like to thank those in the discussions threads, I found valuable clues and an answer or two.\n\nStoryline: The Boy (whose name is, by inferred references, Lautrec Van Hollow) steals/takes his father's book \"Halloween\" on October 30th.  Being a clever little boy, he says so himself (and quite determined), he wants to find out what Halloween is and why Halloween is never celebrated in his town of Dern.  To do this he needs to decypher the book, escape his room (I think he is grounded or it is past his bedtime) and go talk to adults who were around when Halloween existed. \n\nJust a note here:  The game dialogue is rather snarky, full of off-kilter remarks, and is very absurd at times.  I found most of the dialogue amusing, in a disbelieving type of way, since all the adults seem crazy until the end (and they are hiding a secret).  Leave normal reasoning and logic at the door since having both will only deter your gameplay.  An example of what I mean is this: The raven, whose name I inferred was Lester, wants a golden pipe, a newspaper, a pair of slippers, and a glass of wine for nightcap before he moves out of the boy's way.  Absolutely illogical and utterly absurd, but rather funny too.  The whole game plays like this, so be warned.  \n\nGameplay:  Difficult, very difficult in places, but not impossible as some of the negative reviews claim.  (I personally did not run into a game breaking glitch at the end and running in circles meant taking a break to clear my head.)  As I said this game is difficult, and the logic obscure, at best.\n\nThe easy parts:  The Hidden Object scenes were fair and the objects not unfairly hidden.  The items found in each scene basically match the area found, though littered with unusual items.  I did not find the actual puzzles overly challenging, but they are brain twisters.  The puzzle variety includes music, sliders, logic, recipe and picture puzzles.  I would call the \"knocking the sock down\", \"candle\", and \"lock picking\" puzzles, mini-games.  The \"candle\" and \"lock picking\" puzzles, my son, a player of FPSs and fast paced RPGs did both in about 15-20 seconds, first time, though I took much longer and required several tries.  The point is, both are doable with patience and speed, respectively.  I only had trouble with one puzzle, and not the \"candle\" or \"torch\" puzzles so many have issue with. (The torch puzzle actually made sense to me, and I did it first try.)  My trouble puzzle was the gate puzzle going into pumpkin-head town between chapter 4 and 5.  The riddle on the gate makes no sense as most riddles in this game seem to do.  It really is not nonsense, just extremely oblique.  Once I knew the answer it made perfect sense afterwards (even the riddle).  \n\nThe hard parts:  The point and click gameplay is uneven.  Some of it is very easy, other parts are very difficult.  I think some of the difficulty comes from the size of some objects needed to be found.  (The thimble on the train set comes to mind.  It is very small.)  I hunted and hunted for what needed to be done in that scene and found the thimble by accident.  (Oh by the way the cursor does change into a little octopus so careful searching of the entire screen is needed quite often.)  The other difficult part of the point and click scenerios is just the flat out oblique logic used and odd use of items (the golf club once totally disassembled comes to mind).  The logic of this game really reminds me of Deponia: strange, weird, and HUH?  Also the game inhibits the player from moving ahead in the story before the present tasks are completed or gaining items too soon in the story.  A good example of this is the guitar string in the toy shop.  A player may 'twang' the string early in the game but can not take it until later in the game when needed.  I can only presume the string's 'twang' is a subtle auditory reminder that the string is there and will be needed later.  \n\nOn a more even note: the boy uses a gizbelt, a clever invention of his.  The gizbelt carries his gizstruments which by the end of the game include a pairs of scissors, a hatchet, a slingshot, and a pencil.  These gizstruments upgrade (or down grades in the case of the pencil) through gameplay as they are used and the pair of scissors that could barely cut paper at the beginning of the game can cut through metal chain by the end. So if the gamer knows they need to cut something and can not do it wait until the scissors upgrade then try it again.  These items are used to do certain things and should not be overlooked when needing to do something like cut, break or retrieve things though the gamer might have to wait for the upgrade.  \n\nThere is a fast travel map once the gamer leaves home and the map is completed.  The first chapter takes place at the boy's home which includes 2 upstairs rooms and hallway, the main entrance (called lobby), the basement, the front of the house, the front yard, and the fountain. (No map).  There are six chapters in this game.  Up until Chapter 6 the game play is linear and the gamer can not move forward until every task is completed for that chapter, and there is no going back.  Chapter 6 goes everywhere but once all the tasks are completed in an area, the areas close off.  The map will show with \"an exclamation mark\" if something needs to be done.  Using the hint button I would say is a must, if the gamer does not use the map.  It will at least get the gamer to the place something needs to found or something needs to be done.  The hint button can be refilled by looking for little bats in scenes.  \n\nA word about candy, in this game the gamer can collect various types of candy found lying around on the floor, on shelves or stuck to furniture or buildings.  The only thing candy is good for is buying Halloween items from the store and decorating the Van Hallow back yard.  This has nothing to do with the game so do not fret about missed candy pieces.  It is just something fun to do if so inclined.  \n\nIn conclusion, despite the game's difficulty level and lack of normal logic, I found this game much more enjoyable to play on a replay then the first frustrating and hair pulling time though.", "timestamp_updated": 1452446414, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451937971, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "13374421", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501329", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1414895545, "steamid": "76561198067158754", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Yes it's kinda campy in terms of theme, but campy is fun for Halloween.

It's not that I wasn't able to finish the game - a slowly-recharging hint meter and the extremely helpful denizens of YouTube ensured I would be able to brute-force my way through the trickier sections. No, Evil Pumpkin foiled me by forcing me to resort to hints over and over again. A well-designed adventure game - and make no mistake, this is more of an adventure game than a HOG, to the point that the hidden object screens are actually optional - moves players through the story in a logical fashion, presenting them with obstacles to overcome and giving them fair clues and tools to allow them to struggle their way through.\n\nEvil Pumpkin goes a different way entirely, loading itself up with nonsensical, sometimes buggy, puzzles and some of the least impressive HOGs in recent memory.\n\nOn to the HOG criteria!\n\nCriteria 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?\n\nIt's pretty bad. While the game does a passable job of restricting its searches to areas that would logically be cluttered, many of those areas are littered with items which make no sense given the setting - and that's just in the logical areas. There are also plenty of screens where a load of nonsense is tossed in. A church pew? Seems like a good place for a gold bar, straight razor, bullet and tree! It's just a mess for mess' sake. And that's not even getting into the rampant cheating that goes into item placement. There isn't much size cheating - the game has a good grasp of perspective, at least. That doesn't stop it from defying gravity, changing colours, and going transparent whenever it suits the developers' purposes. Just shoddy work here.\n\nCriteria 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?\n\nOnly in the most cursory fashion. There are the standard 12:1 item finding sequences, but beyond that, no justification is given for the searches. This is largely because the game is far more interested in its puzzles than its searches - on the 'difficulty select' menu, HOSs only appear as an element on the lowest difficulty setting, aimed at 'casual' players'. This suggests that serious adventure gamers wouldn't bother with hidden object searches, and should focus on the game's other, more nonsensical puzzles. Given this attitude towards the genre they're working in, it's no surprise that the game's hidden object screens are so lacking.\n\nCriteria 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?\n\nNot well at all. The story follows a little boy on a journey to find out why his town is the only place in the world without a Halloween. It's not a bad premise, but his method of investigation never makes much sense, and the conclusion he comes to seems utterly random. This isn't helped at all by the game's terrible puzzles, which range from annoying to buggy. This isn't just a case of my distaste for sliding block puzzles rearing its ugly head once more. There's the equivalent of a jigsaw puzzle with pieces that don't fit together and offer no clue as to where they're to be placed on the board. There's an 'eliminate the subjects' game whose rules are so oblique that I could see people being driven mad. Then there's a puzzle which is just plain wrong - as in the developers forgot their own world's rules when crafting it, so the answer doesn't make any logical sense.\n\nWith its lacklustre HOSs, frustrating puzzles, and hint/skip meter which takes forever to charge, Evil Pumpkin: The Lost Halloween is a disaster on every level. Literally the only thing that the game has going for it is a wry wit that surfaces in a bevy of puns offered for nearly every circumstance.

However, some pieces were difficult to pick up since a few were left just next to a door or at the top of some stairs - which required some back and forth traveling just to collect them.\nWhile this was a cute trait for the game, it's not exactly rewarding, so if you do buy the game - don't get too serious about collecting every single candy.\n\nI don't necessarily regret buying the game, but I'm really disappointed that I paid full price for a game that I find difficult, and painful, to go back to - if it's frustrating, why bother finishing it? \n(But, then again, sometimes I'm too stubborn for my own good)\n\nIf you like point & clicks, and Halloween, you might like Evil Pumpkin - it still was fun to sit down and play on a lazy day, until the puzzles started getting obnoxious.\n\nBut, if you hate games that are purposely made to be frustrating and unforgiving, you might think twice; otherwise, buy it on sale. It's just not worth $10 in the state that it's in, I hate to say it but it's the honest truth.\n\n*Update: I finally did finish the game and I can't believe that it ended on a cliffhanger, that just adds insult to injury.
