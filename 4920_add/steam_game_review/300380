I noticed a multiplayer update has recently been added which i'm excited to play. It would be cool if some more basic racing modes with just melee weapons and longer, scenic tracks were added - and some livestock and pedestrians to brutally tear apart under my motorcycle - or whip around the teeth with a chain and then drag them behind my bike.\nThis is exactly the kind of game which is making people like me switch back to PC.\nWell done and thank you from the bottom of my heart.", "timestamp_updated": 1506512105, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506511874, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34871697", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507441", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506929210, "steamid": "76561198011763519", "num_games_owned": 3773, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6}, "votes_funny": 4, "review": "Rashly seeking asphalt absolution, Road Redemption is a motorbike racing game with strong combat elements, drawing heavy inspiration from the road rash series.

Road Rash was a racing game where you did underhanded things to get ahead. Road Redemption is closer to Mad Max on motorbikes, and they just happen to be \"racing\".\n\nIt isn't a true racer. You catch up to people easily and they go from being much slower than you to keeping pace with you almost instantly, staying by your side. The game just wants you to hit people, the race is secondary. Some of the levels are annoying, namely the rooftop ones, and aiming guns with a controller is a challenge. And it is now apparently a rogue-like, which is a thumbs down for me. \n\nHaving said that, it is good, clean fun. It's well made. It's thematic. There are a variety of weapons, most of which are satisfying to use. There are a variety of missions to complete while racing - some are fun, some aren't, but thats probably just my personal taste.\n\nAs long as you get into it knowing what to expect, I can recommend it.", "timestamp_updated": 1506611897, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506611563, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35042636", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507617", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505744717, "steamid": "76561197998217277", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "After purchasing Road Redemption just over 2 years back & thus leaving it on hiatus til august this year.

The driving is easy enough to control and the maps are randomized, which keeps things interesting. Lots of shortcuts sprinkled throughout. Four types of upgradeable weapons plus the ability to kick riders out of the way and the ability to grab onto someone or parry their attacks keeps the combat entertaining and varied, especially when you get put up against a variety of foes.\n\nThere are quick, fun, quick local multiplayer races if you just want to hop in and play wherein you can win by either outracing your opponents or killing them so that they can't finish the race. Most appealing is the excellent rogue-like campaign mode wherein you frequently die and lose, but can earn experience that you can spend upon permanent upgrades for future attempts. There are a huge amount of unlockable upgrades, from stat boosts to characters to cycles. \n\nThe campaign itself pits you against a series of short missions which can range from races to killing X number of enemies before they reach the finish line to beat the clock to simple survival. Your health and nitro boost carries over from level to level, so you have to be judicious about how to play, though you can gain both back gradually by taking out other riders. You do tend to lose 25% of your health if you fail a mission and continue forward as long as you are alive. You also earn money along the way which you can use to purchase upgrades for that playthrough.\n\nIt's a really well designed and implemented game for this genre.
