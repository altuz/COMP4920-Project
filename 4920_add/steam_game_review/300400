Well tough luck because they're useless here, Restart a level a million times till you get a good pattern and rail angles to line up for you, earn aches then uninstall the game or just uninstall anyways if your tired of the brainless nonsense. None of it matters anyways because it doesn't show or mean anything either does the hacked leaderboards.  \n\nWhats strange is I don't know wether to call the games main description trolling, or simply ignorance of the developer but it's spot on for being everything thats it's not, I would call it irony but after reading the line that says \"eveything is your fault\"  I'm going to go with the ladder.\n \nThat literally sums up the entirety of the game you either have a fun successful run due to everything lining up just right or you fail due to an [b]\"impossible\" pattern or angle of view[/b], your skill matters not. What I WOULD recommend is something like Thumper where skill, reactions memory ect all matter. \n \nUsually don't write too many nasty negative reviews but when I see devs of games being LAZY with their difficulty it just ticks me off. it just boils down to incompetence and a lack of ideas, of the which a game should not be released.", "timestamp_updated": 1501777029, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501775974, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 46, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 55}}
