There were not many mini-games.  The scenes are interesting along with the story.  Decent music.  Funky scene transitions remind me of a 70's low budget horror movie.  \n\nThis is listed as \"part 1\" and so the story does not resolve at the end.  It is also a tad shorter than some other HOGs and does not include a bonus chapter or an Unlimited Mode.\n\nEach hidden object scene contains ten secret items (hover your cursor over the start to see what they are).  You do not revisit scenes generally so if you want to find the secret items, you should find them right away.\n\nOverall I liked the game but did find it difficult finding some items--they can be small, and some objects you are supposed to open or move to expose other items do not give a visual clue such as a cursor change.", "timestamp_updated": 1407342286, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1407342286, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "19378042", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507467", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1448838341, "steamid": "76561197971341065", "num_games_owned": 2716, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "An uneven hidden object game that largely removes everything apart from the hidden object scenes (there are a handful of inventory items but they are picked up during the HOG scenes, and a couple of spot the difference puzzles). \n\nThe story is okay with a few oddities such as in the policemans office, and when you start hammering walls when the police are searching the building for you, but the story is not really going to be why you would play this (especially as being part one of a planned three episodes of which the others don't seem to exist yet).\n\nThe game also isn't very long (1-2 hours depending on how much you want to resort to the hint button probably) and like most HOGs isn't particularly replayable. Still it can be picked up pretty cheap, so that isn't necessarily \n\nSo it all comes down to the hidden object scenes. Firstly the scenes are reasonably clear and the graphics are good enough, and most of the hidden items are decently placed, so the game is playable enough, but there are a fair amounts of weak links here - there aren't many misnamed objects (the bane of HOG games), but there seemed to be a few with dodgy hit boxes, a fair amount of silly places (pumpkin, stuff silhouetted in the sky, the letter E type stuff). A major negative for me was some of the openable objects, some of which were completely nonobvious that you could interact with them (the mirror for example), where others like pillows would \"open\" any time you moused over them (but in other scenes pillows were immobile). There are also quite a few places where you are searching for an item that has several matches (\"plant\" when in a garden setting!), but only one is correct, which isn't great.\n\nIn terms of specific scenes the two screen pannable scene outside the church was an interesting idea, but I found it annoying once most of the items were found as you couldn't even be sure what you were searching for was on screen. Also it and the scene before had an annoying \"wind\" effect constantly obscuring the view. The UV filter bit was also an interesting variation, although all the animals looked about the same to me.\n\nFinally we have the bonus items - this seemed a bit tacked on and very variable in difficult (marbles, coins, mice were easy, whereas knives, snails and darts were very difficult to find the last few, etc.\n\nOverall then an okay HOG with a few flaws, with nothing exceptional about it good or bad. There are plenty of better options out there in the genre, but it is playable enough especially if you are paying less than a pound for it.", "timestamp_updated": 1448844069, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448842383, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "25460607", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506275", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1473591445, "steamid": "76561197988839076", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Avoid this one.
