I have played both these games to completion and had a very enjoyable time.\n\nI enjoy the combat mechanics, especially the point-base system. You have to hunt for points (which appear as gold coins) which motivate you to explore every small little corner of the game map. There is also an achievement for getting all the points. Furthermore, the points can be used to buy furniture which you can display in your house and they will give you combat bonuses. Furthermore points can also be use to buy dresses (armor) and weapons for Lily too.\n\nMonsters will drop crafting materials when they are vanquished, and these crafting materials can be used for making Spells, Potions and Furnitures.  I love this system.\n\nScattered on the ground are small green circles which will heal you when you step on them. However, there is a difficult achievement which will only trigger if you activate less than 20 healing circles in the entire game. So, this turn the game mechanics in a whole new direction --- as you are now trying to AVOID stepping on healing circles whenever you do exploration. However, this is not always possible, as some healing circles are on critical paths and there is no way to get through a dungeon without stepping on certain healing circles. \n\nThe story itself is well thought out. The starting scene is misleadingly simple and looks like an RPG for kids. However, this is not the case as there are a lot of depth and the story gets darker as you proceed. However, I love the major themes of the RPG which is actually love, mutual caring and cooperation. I get a warm feeling at the end of the story, which is excellent.\n\nI would strongly recommend this game to any old school RPG gamers out there who like a good story with interesting game mechanics.", "timestamp_updated": 1485767059, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485767059, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "12159184", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503603", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1411780109, "steamid": "76561198077195868", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game has great soundtracks, i liked the fun puzzles, game play settings and the interesting plot, but most of all, I loved the adorable look to the characters. \n\nOnly thing I dislike is how extremely difficulty some puzzles and mini-games will become and by that point will apparently prevent game progression.\nOverall i found this game very addicting and only wished I could've found more tips on solving maps and puzzles which are difficult sometimes...", "timestamp_updated": 1411210171, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411210171, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "11299349", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501365", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405665375, "steamid": "76561198089958698", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This has got to be one of the worst games I've ever played. The storyline is probably fine, but one would never know, because the combat system is absolute garbage. The game starts off with you having one character, lvl 1, and the rate of evade way to high on monsters. My third fight consisted of the enemy evading me 19 times ina row, before I could hit and kill it.\n\nTo make matters worse, when you do get a party, it only makes you more frustrated. The main character DOES NOTHING. First real fights, and she hits for 0, has no skills, and is just there to be punched int he face. Even lvling her up does nothing. add to that fighting monsters that add blind automatically twice each turn, and you get an entire party that can't hit ANYTHING.\n\nLiterally fighting 2 monsters, that do nothing but blind, no damage, and I can't hit them. After AN HOUR AND A HALF IN ONE BATTLE, UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING, I had to force the game to close, and realize I had been ripped off.\n\nPaying money for such a bad, bad game makes me feel bad, and the creators should feel bad for ripping people off of money.
