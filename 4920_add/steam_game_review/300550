It's Cyberpunk meets magic, and it's actually a very compelling setting, if a bit dreary and hopeless. Dragonfall conveys the setting very well and has a very nice story, but gets marred by its gameplay.\n\nStorywise, you're a young shadowrunner (basically a criminal for hire) who recently rejoined with an old friend named Monika. Monika is the leader of a small team of runners, and also apparently the mother figure to an entire quarter of Berlin. (Berlin is run by organized anarchists now. The irony in that needn't be pointed out, I hope.) You're on what they refer to as a \"milk run\" (basically a contract that proclaims itself to be very simple; it never is) and Monika gets killed by the haunted machinery. And turns out there seems to be a long-dead dragon behind it. (Dragons are the corporate overlords of this future. But, like, they are also literal dragons, with wings and firebreath n shit. It's a long story.) So now you're trying to figure out what is going on, avenge Monika, befriend the troll girl who hates you and get some really cool cybernetic implants.\nSo that's the story. It does a good job of conveying the setting, even to a newcomer, and it takes some very interesting turns throughout. It's also not above having a few quirky episodes, as any RPG worth its harddrive space should. The characters are likable and with defined personalities, your hub is atmospheric, and it's all very downtrodden and horrible, so they got the atmosphere of Berlin down correctly. Now the only thing it needs to do is be fun to play!\n... Oh.\nWell, to be fair, it starts out being fun to play. For the first half of the game, the turnbased combat is engaging, entertaining and pretty reasonably paced. But somewhere around the halfway point, it reaches critical mass and becomes an utter chore. There's three reasons for that.\n1. It's sooooo fucking slow. When there's more than four enemies on screen, all doing their little actions and taking for-fucking-ever to get anything done, it's already annoying. And when you then die and have to go through the whole bloody thing again and again, it becomes utterly nervewracking. A little \"Skip to your turn\" button wouldn't have gone amiss.\n2. It's formulaic. Seemingly every mission, no matter what it's about and how interesting it may have been, ends up having a shootout with the police in the end. It's predictable, and really not all too much in the SR spirit. What I would've given for a mission where instead of killing anyone, you have to get in and out without shedding blood and without a singular combat instance. And true, there are some encounters you can talk your way around, like for instance having a friendly chat with a janitor so she wouldn't punch the alarm, and some more minor instances. But inevitably, there's always a shootout with some gangers, or the Lone Stars (future police) or some giant scorpions. Your character's killcount ends up being in the hundreds, even if you try your hardest to avoid bloodshed.\nAnd lastly, especially in the last few stages, they REALLY go overboard with it. Fight your way through an entire office block full of police. Gun down hordes and hordes of drugged up communists and drones. Fight off tanky-as-fuck gargoyle statues, an entire cellar full of fire lizards and massive scorpions, and guess what, even MORE gangers. PACING is a nice word. This is the same problem I had with Planescape Torment's second half - too much samey combat with little to no breathing room inbetween and no way to avoid it. And again, SR isn't the kind of setting where you play a gun-totin' untouchable hero. Avoiding conflict is almost always preferrable. So making it a fucking horde shooter really misses the mark. It wouldn't be so bad if there were some more interesting unique boss encounters sprinkled in with everything else, but while there are certainly bosses and they are very good, there's just too much chorey combat inbetween it all. And you can't even overlevel yourself to the point of absurdity, because there's no avenues for grinding.\n\nSo I'm torn on this. Story is excellend and definitely makes it a worthwhile product, but the combat just bugs me to no end. I'll get around to playing the other Shadowrun games too based on my enjoyment of this one, but I'm not looking forward to the combat in those either. Mabye I'll just cheat in a bunch of karma, overlevel myself to the point of absurdity and name my character Old Man Henderson.", "timestamp_updated": 1506187613, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506187613, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34822644", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504857363, "steamid": "76561197979922053", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Harkening back to old-school video game RPGs is a thing lately, most notably with popular titles like [b]Pillars of Eternity[/b], and this is a really great exploration of the Shadowrun game universe. I only ever bought the rulebook for the game when it first came out (am I dating myself?!?), but I never managed to get enough friends interested to play it. It did help inspire me to create a similar campaign using the HERO System that allowed combining multiple RPG genres.\n\nBut back to Shadowrun. The story was excellent. There were plot twists I didn\u2019t see coming. There was also a variety of endings, [spoiler]although most of these are largely based off of the final choices you make at the end of the game versus the accumulation of choices made throughout[/spoiler]. The characters were also well written with detailed histories and gave a much deeper sense of personal interaction than is normal for most games today. By the end I loved my team (well, except one of them \u2013 guess who?) and wanted to go on more runs with them. I wish I could take them with me to Hong Kong. :D\n\nMy character was a Dwarven Mage. My backup skill set was Decking.\n\nThe game is not perfect, however. Several glitches posted to the forums when the devs were still pushing out patches never got fixed. None of them are show-stoppers. Additionally it\u2019s a good idea to save-quit and exit the game every few hours because the memory footprint keeps growing. I have 32GB RAM on my machine and there were times after several long sessions when re-loading from a save point or transitioning to a new location took 4-5 minutes.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that other team members can\u2019t pick up loot items except during combat. Outside of combat only the player is allowed to do so, and if you didn\u2019t have room you could only send items to your stash (your storage locker back at your HQ that can only be accessed by team members prior to the start of a mission). This setup meant team members would have space free up in their inventory as they used items but no means to replace them with items found during a mission.\n\nBut these issues shouldn\u2019t discourage playing if this kind of game appeals to you. It\u2019s definitely worth the time if you like this genre! :)\n\n[b]Rating: 8/10\nExcellent plot and characters combine to make an intriguing game world.

All of the characters have the *exact same* edgy teenage personality, the lack of variety in which makes it useless as a RPG to begin with, and your choices don't matter in the grand scheme of things. Sure, you get to see exactly what you say, but they all lead to the same path. What's the point in giving dialogue choices to begin with if it does fuck-all to change how it's going? I mean, half of my issues with the game in this regard are because whoever wrote the horrible dialogue throughout should stick to wannabe-bestseller YA fiction. Hell, it might even be below that.\n\nNot to mention how it looks exactly like a Facebook flash game... I mean, I get that it's an indie game, but they could make sure it's a little less apparent. Nothing bad looking, but the cheapness of it all is a little immersion-breaking. Even though there's no 'Made in Unity' splash, you can practically feel its limitations while playing. The cover system is horrible, difficulty is outstandingly inconsistent, and the overall gameplay is presented rather poorly. \n\nIf this were still the late 80s, it might be a game worth considering, but by today's standards?
