Time Trial, Hardcore mode, bonus levels.. you can find anything!\n\nBut of course, there are also a few negative aspects about this game. Which ones you ask? Well I'm so glad you asked, so here they are:\n\n- The bonus levels are always the same and thus, bore quite quickly\n- If you fail a bonus level, you have to kill yourself in order to be able to retry\n- There are no explanations nor a manual in the game whatsoever. If you forget how to do several things, you're on your own\n- The moving speed is too slow\n\nI'd still recommend this game to platformer fans, though.

However I have finished the first world segment, engaged in boss fights, played bongos, learned how to fly and managed to get a grasp that's good enough for a first impression. \n\nMind you, this review is personal bound, you may agree or disagree, I speak for no-one but myself.\n\nWhat does JUJU right?\n\n+ JUJU's levels are relatively short, this however is not a bad thing but makes it ideal for a game you just pick up and play   for a short while till you've got your fill. It also helps that the levels are relatively short as you have portals in each level that can only be attempted once during a given run.\n\n+ JUJU's world is a beautiful, vibrantly coloured world that really comes to life with all the critters wandering around in it. The use of colour also engages the player in exploring each nook and cranny for portals or other little secrets.\n\n+ Music, while I've heard the same music being played over again, it doesn't hinder or get annoying. It's quiet fitting with the theme of the game and the level design.\n\n+ Difficulty, the game gives you an initial laydown of the controls in the very first level you enter, however after that it's reduced to a minimal popup of explanations (I recall having seen one after defeating a boss). The game introduces new hazards, new enemies, new interactive platforms gradually while playing through a level. It also does this in a way that you don't get overwhelmed.\n\n+ Enemies, there are plenty of them, they look different, they have their own unique little thing. Stomping crabs is all fun and games, getting needles in your fluffy behind from a hedgehog costs you a life!\n\n+ Drop-in / Drop-out Co-Op. No need to do it at the start of a level or at a checkpoint, you can do it at any given time.\n\nWhat has bothered me about JUJU so far?\n\n- Camera, while I'd say the camera is your buddy 90% of the time, there are moments where it seems to have somewhat of a difficulty keeping up with your character, this can lead to cringe worthy deaths that could have been easily avoided. Granted the levels are short so you don't lose a whole lot of progress, everything you did in between checkpoints has to be done over though.\n\n- Relatively short, the game seems to be relatively short. I've completed the first world and my progress is at 23%. Looking at the background in the menu I'm going ahead and assume there are 4 worlds total. While there is some replayabillity, their isn't much to do in a level once you have completed it.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes.\nDo I recommend it for it's current price?
