Unfortunately the effects and scenes / levels this game generates to navigate are pretty bland and the immersion is lost as you drift down boring corridors with what look like Silent Hill Monster Spacemen floating about and twitching in the background. The game does very little to make the player interested in navigating to the next scene, with the same few models doing a different twitching animation in the corner of some dark area which might say have RED lighting instead of GREEN lighting in the previous corridor / corner. While I wouldn't say it's a horrible experience I'd just say it's more of a waste of time than anything and not very memorable or affective to any player investment or emotion.", "timestamp_updated": 1495001748, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495001748, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31478819", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1493610753, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 4956, "num_reviews": 1973, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Tags: Adventure - WS - Walking Simulator\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Will make you physically sick, Buggy, Narratively meaningless, An absolute chore to play\n\nThis is what would happen if a dev made a bad walking simulator then felt spiteful and added a bunch of irritation on top of his bad game to make sure that no enjoyment could ever be obtained out of his product. Can get stuck on invisible edges - be pulled or prevented from going in directions for no reason at some time and not at other times. Buggy - sometimes can enter invisible walls causing you to be stuck outside the areas you should be in.\n\nBad controls - very minimal and bad sound design - a maze-like level design where walls are lateral and vertical metal bars that interconnect each other (as you see through the wall) making navigation a jumbled mess. Dev seemed to almost troll by having boxes go through walls but push you around for no reason delaying and hindering your exploration, creatures and scenery are heavily reused everywhere, must often go to one end of the map to unlock something in an area previously explored and the game gives no indication of that forcing you to re-explore entire levels multiple times to progress - Dev added many scenes where creatures and the few scenery elements present are also sideways on walls and ceilings, causing me genuine vertigo and motion sickness.\n\nWhenever progress is made the player is rewarded by depictions of astronaut with buckets on their head or cutscenes of seahorses up close with a comical \u00a8you fail\u00a8 high pitched trumpet\n\nNarratively there is no text or dialogue, and the game converys very little other than a fairly perceptible disdain from the dev for the customers, with nonsensical fetch questing of meaningless objects though a trial and error method\n\nTo top it all off this game made it on steam through a loophole of steam greenlight where the dev used the pass for a different title to smuggle this in, and apparently weaseled out of giving bundle keys to legitimate purchasers of his game. Another one of his game he patched retroactively so it would stop launching (vigil bitterness) and would instead open the steam store page for RIP trilogy instead... \n\nConclusion: Trash Dev - Trash Game - Good Riddance", "timestamp_updated": 1506594128, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493613499, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 19, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 41, "total_reviews": 60}}
