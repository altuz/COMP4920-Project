Possibly up to 12 minutes as you fight with the amateur controlling scheme and the lack of camera rotation. Just a handful of enemies in each, You get a few powers that are click activated like teleport or drag enemy. The textures are so grainy I remember a sharper level of details from the Original Dos Dungeon Keeper. I liked the made up language and the heavy metal vibe to the setting. The game itself is just fighting to use the powers to do what the game wants you to do, usually something mundane like punch someone, or throw a big enemy in walls while you teleport between beams of fire.", "timestamp_updated": 1506594219, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493596829, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 13}}
