From out of the ether, a ghost tells you to find the light to bring back the sun.   You flash your highbeams to uncover the secret fire in a ring of moths and a kickin' 80s electro-rock riff shreds the truth of your victory in defiance to all the ghosts of lost drivers on this forgotten road.  How is this not a Led Zeppelin song?  We're talking air-brushed-on-the-side-of-a-van levels of bitchin' and righteous in that order.\n\nSo as you can tell, I love the idea of this game.  How much do I hate giving this game a negative review then?  A lot.  A real lot.  I really hate reviewing games like Night Shift: games that have got a full tank of new ideas, but lay on the gas and they explode long before they reach the promised land.  Watch a \"Red Asphalt\" video and you'll have an idea of what I mean when I say NIght Shift is poorly executed.  And it's unfortunate that it is, since that makes this review one of those back and forths where I have to praise the game, telling diehard fans of the genre \"NO PASSING\" on this one and, out of the other side of my mouth, damn it for its many faults and tell most readers, \"DO NOT ENTER.\" \n\nAlright, alright.  Let's shift this thing into gear!  What exactly is wrong with the game?  Chiefly, it's more cryptic than a hearse doing doughnuts in a mausoleum.  Night Shift starts being exactly that obtuse right from the start where it (one can only assume) deliberately obfuscates how to play the game.  Not only is there no tutorial, but if you decide to get clever and go to the menu to try and find the keys from the rebinding options, be prepared for disappointment.  There's no such option.  But, hey, this is basically a 2.5D FPS in layout, so W, A, S, D, Space, and E are pretty much the holy gospel of game design, so maybe we can give it a pass?  \n\nMaybe, but the game continues to be as impenetrable as an ice queen in barbed-wire panties with the layout of its many puzzles.  To find one, you drive around aimlessly for long stretches of minutes until hopefully you stumble backasswards into one.  And god help you if you should leave the puzzle because you decided to test the problem by moving just too far out of the puzzle's bounds or you got momentarily frustrated.  You will have a lot more aimless driving ahead of you as you try and guess how the handful of landmarks are related to each other or if they are at all.  You know those RPG type games, like Zelda, where sometimes they have a screen that will repeat if you don't exit it from exactly the right direction several times?  It feels like that, except after a ton of random wandering you hit a puzzle.\n\nSo I found driving around in the dirt without a clear sense of direction really frustrating.  But this is a game about driving at night and the atmosphere is great, it's a major draw, and this lets you experience it.  Fair enough.  The actual puzzles and how they relate to the controls are pretty dodgy.  Quite a few of the puzzles rely on you flashing your high beams at things, but the time between when you hit the button and when the beams flash is very sluggish and they only affect objects that are an annoyingly precise distance from the car.  This makes hitting the enemy ghost cars and other puzzles that rely upon timing your flash a teeth-grindingly grotesque experience.  And, for some reason, you can only flash your beams while completely stopped, which badly breaks the flow of driving through the night.  If real cars worked that way, I wager I'd have a lot more speeding tickets, if you know what I mean.     \n\nJust like in real life, you can get a single sentence hint for some puzzles by running over a nearby ghost.  And there are a few other clues like the activity on your radio and the descriptions for the game's achievements (yes, I needed to use them to figure out how to solve a couple of them).  But, overall, the puzzles are wickedly unclear.  To give you an example:  there was one puzzle that gave me the victory music after I wasted some ghost cars, but after pulling about a million U-eys looking for my prize, I finally gave up driving in the manner of my Polish heritage and continued into the night where the victory music died, right into another half of the puzzle that I accidentally solved while trying to return to where the music was.  There were at least two puzzles I still don't know the logic behind but I solved them somehow in a crowning moment of \"huh, I guess I was supposed to do that?\"\n\nThat said, I did solve all of them by myself in less than three hours, so they aren't impossible.  But that brings us to the last nail in the coffin that was at some point meant to be a favorable review for Night Shift:  it's short.  There are only seven puzzles in the game.  Yeah, they'll take you a while, but only because the game is stick-a-paper-bag-over-your-head levels of opaque and there's so much driving around lost in the dark to get to the puzzles.  And while the game's atmosphere is thick and rich like a seven layer chocolate cake, the story is more like a single chocolate chip.  There is really no more than the blurb on the store page:\n\n[i]\"The sun has disappeared from the sky! Darkness chokes the land, depriving it of all things good. Now it\u2019s time for you to figure out how to bring the sun back! Get behind the wheel and find the sun in Night Shift!\"[/i]\n\nThat's really it.  No further characterization of you or the task at hand or the world around you.\n\nSo that's my long list of grievances with Night Shift.  And I'm sad to have it.  The ending to the game was easily the most radical thing to happen since the 80s ended and the overall tone and idea behind the game are great!  How many adventure games exist where you play as a car driving on a 2.5D haunted highway practically reinacting the song \"Radar Love?\"  Night Shift.  That's it.  And that's why I can still recommend it to long time veterans of adventure games who have legendary patience and can put up with  logic that's been filtered through glue sniffing.  But to everyone else: sorry, you'll find more frustration than fun.  And even to those adventure gamers who will stick around for something new, there's really not enough here to be worth the cost of an entire gallon of gas.  There are meatier indie games with better puzzles and more character for the same price.

Whether they are real or a figment of your driver's sleep deprived imagination is unknown. The world you've cruised into is the essence of 80's obsession with a technological dystopia and sunless futures, the soundtrack ([i]Dance With the Dead[/i] - http://dancewiththedead.bandcamp.com/album/out-of-body) the embodiment of cyberpunk, retro-future values recently re-popularized by the likes of [i]Perturbator[/i] or the rest of the artists on the ever-popular [i]Hotline Miami[/i] soundtrack. [i]Night Shift[/i] caught my attention recently with it's appearance on Steam's Early Access, standing out with it's strangely unique concept and almost [i]Knight Rider[/i]-like aesthetic.\n\n[i]Night Shift[/i] is a decidedly confusing game, pitting your solitary and anonymous retro hero against the empty pitch-black depths of the unknown and ruined roads before you. Many questions are presented without any real explanation, what happened to this world, who are these other phantasms and who is our driver, what exactly am I supposed to be doing? You're dropped into the pitch black land without any clue or indication of what to do other than the trail of butterflies leading you back on the road setting you on the right path for exploration. The gameplay is very straightforward and simple in execution but sprawling and secretive in it's discovery, having you explore and steal light from dimming lamp posts with your seemingly magical high beams while watching your energy closely, which can only be recharged by the glowing white trees that stand out in the darkness. You'll be stopped on your journey to gather and restore the light around you by the ghostly apparitions of other cars, perhaps even previous drivers on the same failed quest to find the sun as you?\n\n[i]Night Shift[/i] already has an attractively old school and fully realized atmosphere, but in it's current form lacks any narrative as to what you're doing or where you are which while effective in it's mysterious and strange nature is exactly why it's in Early Access. The developer, creator of the puzzle-platformer [i]10000 Amps[/i], apparently has some pretty ambiguous ideas for where the story is headed in the future of [i]Night Shift[/i] and is enlisting your help to ensure it's further shaped into something great with the addition of story cinemas and lots of new plot, new levels, as well as full Steam integration for controller support, achievements, cards and the like. \n\nOverall, [i]Nightshift[/i] is an awesome and quirky concept with a really cool dark and retro atmosphere that still has a long ways to go in terms of the overall experience given, and if you're the kind of person who's keen on watching as well as help an uncommon and unique idea develop into something even bigger you can pick it up for a very reasonable $4.99.

Proceed with caution.\n\nIn Night Shift, you play a driver trying to bring the flame back to the sun and light up the world. You play in first-person view from inside the car. The game consists of a series of puzzles that you reward you with pieces of the sun's flame. Puzzle-solving involves the manupilation of light, mostly using the car's headlights. You drive in darkness in loops, till you stumble upon a puzzle. Throughout my playthrough, it seemed that once I've hit a puzzle, driving off would bring me back to the same puzzle again, which probably means that the game gives you the puzzles in sequence, rather than having all of the puzzles available at the same time. The puzzles tend to be obtuse and some of the requirements are a bit too fussy (i.e. I would know what needs to be done, but find the execution difficult). The game makes nice use of audio cues: choppy guitar riff for partial solutions and full-on blaring guitar goodness when the puzzle is solved). The game is on the short side, as it took me 1.5 hrs to fully complete it (though to be fair, I cheated on one puzzle that frustrated me).

If that feature is amongst things planned for the future, awesome, otherwise I dont fuckin know dude.\n\nYou are mostly left to your own devices in this one, the only indication you are doing something right is the music volume/ music complexity will increase as you draw closer to a point of interest.\n\nThe only indicator I can see that tells you how far you are in the game is a moon/ orb thing sitting in the middle of no where. \nI think a flame will circle it for each objective(?) you complete. \nThe most flames I got was 3, then gave up because I couldnt find any thing else.\n\nThis game really has potential. I just hope it gets what it's lacking and strengthens its strong points even further. Then we will be in for a bloody good indi game.\n\n5.5 / 10", "timestamp_updated": 1403521191, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403521191, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "10524431", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494124", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403235205, "steamid": "76561198062766348", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a VERRY different type of gameplay than im use to... but i verry much enjoy it, it is definetly worth the money and i reccomend the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1403174125, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403174125, "votes_down": 12}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 19, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 23}}
