But there aren't much games, which can entertain so many hours like the TOM-series.\nWith the totems and the boni you have always the special flow, which doesn't make the game boring. The difficulties and modi makes the game very attractive and challenging. \nAlso I have to mention the awesome background-music, which make the game-fun even more intense. There is a part of a music, which even made me goosebumps. But sadly this part come always pretty late, that I had to intentionally play the LVL a bit slower to be able to enjoy this moment :)\n\nI haven't much critism, but if someone want to hear some, then here some little things:\n\nI was very unlucky on the puzzle slotmachines, to get the calendar: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=928944640\n\nAs you can see on the right corner, it took 32 tries and this was a bit annoying at the end.\nAlso to get the \"Eternal Flame\"- Achievement was a bit annoying, because you had to play the completed story-modelvls again and again and you didn't earned any high XP or gold anymore. There it would have been a bit better to add this gamemode to the puzzles too.\n\nA bit strange were the names of the playerlvls. In the early LVL you were some kind of \"Master\" and on a higher LVL you became a simple \"Collector\". That's how I call it doing a great carrier! :)\n\nI really recommend this game and give it a 10/10.
