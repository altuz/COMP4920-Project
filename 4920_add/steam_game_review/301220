There's no actual randomized items, no deep character development, and the story looks interesting but sounds like it was badly translated. All together, the game comes across as bare-bones, it functions like its still in its development stages (hell, it probably is considering), and you really don't get bang for your buck. Thankfully I got this during the steam sale, so my wallet wasn't hit too bad, but still, unless the developers release a HUGE update that actually makes like it like an actually finished game, I don't think I have the strength to finish it. Plus, going by the achievements, its not very lengthy anyhow.

Realms of Ancient War\nWave Of Darkness\nTorchlight 1 & 2\nSacred 3\nIncredible Adventures Of Van Helsin\n\n& similar games of Neverwinter Nights 2, Divinity Original Sin & a few others that are turn based & more cRPG then ARPG.\n\nAnd despite it all & have ones like R.A.W. & Wave Of Darkness which both have some serious problems... I have to say this is one of the worst games I've ever played.... & I only played past the 1st fight so far.\nThis game feels like a RPG Maker RPG does to a decent RPG like Dragon Quest (the original). Poorly.. it feels like it was pumped out using assests that were bought in the bargin bin with little thought to interface or animations & other similar requirements for a good ARPG. It's like the framework for a game... or something you would present to a teacher to show what you're planning on doing your grade 10 assignment on \"oh yes here's a quick example of what I want to do... the final assignment will be more flushed out\".\n\nHaving waited until it was on deep sale... the currently 85% off because of how many bad reviews there were I actually regret buying this game for the $3.50 cents local currency. It is most definitely NOT worth more then $1.20 at best.... even that might be pushing it.... because it really does seem like you're playing someones failing grade computer programming homework.\n\nI cannot recommend this item in any way shape or form.  If you want an ARPG you're better off  going with something way older & hence way cheaper because you'll still get a better product.\n\nTLDR: Skip it.
