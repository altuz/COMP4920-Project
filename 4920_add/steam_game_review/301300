This installment of the franchise also features online multiplayers, as previous only had local co-op.\n\nBut unfortunately, atleast for me, not enough has been changed from it's predecessors. If you have played previous titles before, you will get bored pretty quickly as the gameplay is identical most of the time. Also the game is pretty easy, which hurts the replay value. The game also does not have many achivements or challenges to test your skill and keep you interested. The only thing I have found to make the game harder is playing with a keyboard instead of a mouse, since keyboards lack the speed and precision mice offer, but that makes it less enjoyable. \n\nIn conclusion, for the price they have given the game is worth picking up, although I would love to see the franchise steer in the Rouge-like/Rouge-lite/PDS genre, with RPG elements.
