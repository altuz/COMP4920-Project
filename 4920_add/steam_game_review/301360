Its the most fun game i found, I would play more if there were more players to play with.\nThe game is abandoned and what i think is if the developers were to work on the game to add more stuff. Maybe we can play once again.\n\nAnd im sure alot of people are just like me, They love the game. But no one is playing it.\nIf we can get alot of people to play. Then we can bring the game back maybe, Maybe. Maybe not..\n\nBut its up to the developers.", "timestamp_updated": 1491838307, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491838307, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 22}}
