It started it, but the art didn\u2019t really appeal to me. However, now that I actually gave it a chance I\u2019ve gotta say this is a solid visual novel. It has romance, mystery and science fiction and a story that makes up for the less polished artwork. \n\nThe characters that you can romance each have their own backstories and reasons doing what they are doing. They have a variety of types: sweet and innocent, lecherous and clever, genteel and polite, rough and tumble and the boy next door. There are good endings and bad endings. There is a final ending, but you have to complete all other routes to get there.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty typical on gameplay. It does have the added twist of a fairly simple puzzle you have to do before you pick your answer. Once you\u2019ve picked an answer you can skip the puzzle and pick that answer the next time you play through without having to redo that puzzle. Its a little twist, but as the puzzles are the same type all the way through it isn\u2019t much of a challenge.  \n\nThe artwork gets a little awkward at times (proportions are off), but it isn\u2019t a total loss. Some of the CGs are higher quality than others.\n\nBut it\u2019s the story that really gets you going. You are warped to another world and then stuck inside a house with 5 strangers. As you play you get to know one of the guys and find out the secret of what is going on. Your choices will impact your ending. \n\nI\u2019d say that for a $10 price tag this is a solid addition to my ever-growing steam library. I don\u2019t think I will play it again, but I got 5 hours of enjoyment out of it and $2 an hour isn\u2019t bad. \n\nRecommended", "timestamp_updated": 1496804608, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496804608, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31040692", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502240", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1459207858, "steamid": "76561198135681495", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Don't be fooled, I completed this game before it got on Steam but decided to buy it here to support the developers. This is a very solid visual novel and the plot is a joy to figure out. The story is very well-written and keeps you hooked til the end and the art is serviceable.

The writing is strong, the characters are flawed and complex yet still likeable, and the sci-fi/mystery aspect is super interesting, putting a nice twist on the typical otome genre. I really enjoyed playing each route to unravel the larger overall story. I also really liked how the protagonist herself gets a fleshed out character and backstory instead of being a completely blank slate; she has so much personality, I felt like I was unraveling her story too. The true ending was strong and it felt like everything got wrapped up nicely. Date Warp is a very enjoyable game overall and its pacing and length feels just right -- it's not super short but it doesn't feel like it drags on and on forever either -- which I think is pretty hard to do in dating sims like this where you need to play each route to get the full story. On a more minor note, I thought the music in the game was very good too, it was very fitting and atmospheric throughout. I like how it was mostly electronic, it really added to the sci-fi vibe of the game. \n\nI also learned that the version of this game on steam is the updated silver edition or whatever with  some new writing and an updated epilogue - I think that it's really cool for the developers to care enough to go back and do that for an older game of theirs. Achievements and trading cards are also a nice bonus. \n\nThe only real downside is perhaps some of the CG art for events looks a little rough around the edges, and the fact that you need to complete puzzles to select your dialogue options is kind of weird, but neither is a big detractor by a long shot. Thankfully, after you've already done a puzzle for one dialogue option, you'll never have to do it again -- a nice anti-frustration feature. The art overall is solid and the game is fantastic. It's another strong title from Hanako Games that hasn't gotten nearly as much attention as their other works.", "timestamp_updated": 1498667516, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495070288, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32282838", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504109", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1496981019, "steamid": "76561198048136838", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Not what I expected from the game. \n\nI thought MC would be a scientist investigating wormholes/time travel and meeting folks along her journey. Yanno, an actual agent in the story, an investigator solving mysteries! Instead she's just a victim in a mystery and her her destiny is controlled by the virtual strangers she's met. Not what I wanted or expected, and I kept playing hoping it would get better. \n\nThe art style wasn't the most polished, but art isn't the end all be all of visual novels. You get used to it. \n\nThe characters were fairly flat. As you progressed through multiple routes you got to learn a little bit more about them. \n\nThe most fulfilling route was Lind's because it actually half-heartedly attempted to answer the questions I was actually curious about. But the big questions about each character still remained unanswered and vague. \n\nThe true end was pretty unsatisfying. There was more mysteries to be solved. Honestly I think Rafeal or Linds would have been better MCs than our herione. For all that she had a personality and opinions, she was not an agent of her own destiny and was embarrassed when she tried to be. \n\nGameplay-wise it's also fairly boring. There's a game to play when you get to choices which was cute at first, but it's also buggy (I spent 10 minutes on a puzzle because I was convinced that this game wouldn't include an unsolvable puzzle, but a quick search proved that it had happened before, so... meh). The 'boy like you' meter looks more like a moral index and I genuinely thought I was playing to be a good/bad person and not falling in love with this dude (I was polite?? so now I love him???), so that was unclear. Once you're set on a route, the difference between endings is literally a SINGLE choice. Once you've seen one ending you've almost seen them all. And really, all of them are not worth it.
