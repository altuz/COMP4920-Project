I like this game I think it\u2019s pretty well done. There were a few issues I had with it though.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ouUlzYkqkDk\nIf you don\u2019t already know you have to sneak through locations, stealing valuables and getting past the goons without getting caught. For the most part it\u2019s easy to play, I don\u2019t mean difficulty-wise. As you can probably see, you just drag lines to create a path for the player character and tap special items and powers to activate them. The controls are simple and intuitive, so how to play the game is really easy to pick up straight away. I felt that that the difficulty was challenging but not unfair at all. It\u2019s fun sneak past the goons (that\u2019s what I call them lol) especially if you are able to slip past right behind when they go the wrong way.\n\nThe game look\u2019s really cool. The music obviously is great. However it was a bit loud and there is no in game volume control only on or off. I had to turn down the volume in windows. I hope that people can still hear me over it in my videos! I didn\u2019t pay 100% attention to the dialogue in cutscenes and during stages. But I think the fact that the game actually has a story is really cool for a puzzle game. From what I absorbed of the narrative it\u2019s cliche, you are private investigator and a beautiful woman walks into your office one day, she ends up getting you into trouble and so on. But still it\u2019s seems interesting and competent.\n\nThere are couple of little troubles I had with moving around which you will probably just get used to. To cancel a path you need to click near your character otherwise you will add to it and if you need to change course quickly to avoid enemies that will get you caught. Also there\u2019s not really automatic pathfinding for your character. So if you click on the other side of a wall a path seems to be made straight into the way rather than a way that takes you around to where you want to go. The other sort of more serious issue I had with game was crashes. It crashed twice the transitions from cutscenes to parts 2 and 3 of the game. However it didn\u2019t happen after completing the third part of the game before the prison which I thought it would because it seemed to be a pattern. But anyway even it crashes it only takes a moment to restart the game and it didn\u2019t set me back much time. If it happened more often and/or during actual levels i think it would have been a more serious problem then, but it didn\u2019t matter too much.\n\nOkay, so yes I recommend this game. Honestly I can\u2019t say a lot about the length of the game because as you probably gathered I haven\u2019t completed it yet. But I think I think it is fun, overall good quality (aside from the occasional crashes) and it\u2019s only $5.", "timestamp_updated": 1406160687, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406159148, "votes_down": 17}, {"recommendationid": "11382827", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474628", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1406173407, "steamid": "76561198022820771", "num_games_owned": 529, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buCuqRTd-MY&list=UU7_-PLIhjsEBwIQXqKxmNpA\nThird Eye Crime tries to be a Stealth game, but ends up just being a puzzle pathing game. It grows more annoying than fun as you make your way through the story, just finding what path to take not how to sneak around the levels, or being allowed to go at your own pace.  It has no stealth, for every map you are spotted with out chance and spend the rest of the time running away from the enemies.  Objects in the game that can help you are rare and of very little use. The story is decent but it does not connect while playing the levels and the game suffers from any real depth. \n\nThanks for your time and viewership for more reviews be sure to check out the channel here http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho", "timestamp_updated": 1406186017, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "8", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406156788, "votes_down": 27}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2}}
