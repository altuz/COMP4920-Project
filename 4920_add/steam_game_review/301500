This game is FUN. \n\nAlthough it might not be a 100% accurate sim experience it is a nice break from the stress of DCS World/IL2 mechanics,  and does not require an expensive Track IR and joystick setup (although joystick is recommended because mouse controls are a bit wonky right now).\n\nThere are 3 views, pretty classic, 3rd person, cockpit (my personal favorite) and 1stperson no cockpit (why people fly like this i have no idea) Cockpit features lots of gauges and doohickys, all of which seem to function. Cockpits are also unique for each flyable plane, which seems obvious but is lacking in some other flight games.\n\nIt features believable planes that are a cool mix of prop and jet/rocket fighters. You can usually guess which realworld aircraft inspired them by how they handle. Weapons usually consist of your stock machine guns and your choice of cannons/flak guns and other options.\n\nThe game features multiplayer but i have not yet tried it, I think ill stick with the story for now.\n\nOne last note, the support is awesome. Email with an issue and you can expect a quick reply and fix within days. They're helpful and courteous, and even though my specific issue has yet to be solved they told be to expect a fix in the next patch. Worth a buy for this alone.\n\nMy only negatives are that mouse control and optimization could use some work (both are being worked on by the development team)\n\nAnd that I would like to see more planes added (but to be honest, my ideal flight game features hundreds of unique planes, so take that with a grain of salt)\n\nHappy Flying!", "timestamp_updated": 1427757729, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427757729, "votes_down": 12}, {"recommendationid": "17181183", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 58, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563620", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1480258189, "steamid": "76561198020171626", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "MagzTV - Bomb - Early Access impressions\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cuyy6HOK50", "timestamp_updated": 1437614491, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437614453, "votes_down": 17}, {"recommendationid": "17307479", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540348", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1438299721, "steamid": "76561198003836545", "num_games_owned": 842, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "Oh boy, where to begin....\nIf you want the short version - the game is just not fun.\nIf you want the long version - read on!\n\nSo to start with, here are the pros of the game:\n+ Interesting premise\n+ The characters seem funny enough at times\n+ It's nice to see the devs attempt to emulate Crimson Skies type games.\n\nAnd here are the cons:\n\n- No tutorial what's so ever, the game is not hard to figure out, but it would have been nice if they included one.\n\n- The mission pacing is awful, the first 3-4 missions last for about two minutes and just make you fly forward requiring minimal input from your end. They could have made them in to a single mission and it would have benefited the game.\n\n- The flight model is arcade, but not the fun type of arcade like Ace Combat. The gravity doesn't seem to affect your plane, it flies the same no matter which direction you chose, be that up or down and the rudders rubberband like crazy. It will swing you back to the direction you came from the moment you release the turn button. I would also like to point out that it feels like you are flying though molasses instead of air.\n\n- The environments look extremely bland and the trees flicker like crazy when you fly over them, the planes look nice, but everything else looks like an late Xbox / early360 game.\n\n- The performance is spotty at best, I was getting frame drops from 80 to 20 while nothing was happening on the screen and it doesn't look like a game that should ever drop below 60 on a 290X even on the highest settings.\n\n- The menus look like they are placeholder, especially the options screen and the mission failure one. \n\n- And the main con of all that just made me quit for good? It just wasn't fun.

This game is excellent.  It's not easy at all, even though it doesn't model planes realistically.  Any comparisons made to Crimson Skies are pretty accurate.  I'd say the flight model is similar to War Thunder on \"arcade\" but the planes are considerably less maneuverable.  Considering you're flying a twin engine cargo plane, that's expected.  \n\nThe dialogue that strings the missions together is funny, brief, and to the point.  \"Go blow up the thing.\"  There are bombs, rockets, torpedoes, and a variety of cannons that get strapped on the planes.  Thankfully the missions do have checkpoints, and restarting a mission after failing is ZERO load time.   I'm playing with a Logitech 3D Pro stick and it works perfectly after button mapping.  The game is set up for a 360 gamepad by default.  It also supports mouse control BUT that isn't quite working just yet.   Views are cockpit, 3rd person, and no-cockpit gunsight views.  Hold a key/button to momentarily padlock the current enemy, so you don't get lost in all the chaos.\n\nThere's multiplayer, and even a dedicated server you can download.  I played some skirmish with the AI, and had them turned up a difficulty notch plus had too many of them fighting me, and I can attest the my end was brutal and swift.  :-)  The only thing I really feel absent is a nice hammy voiceover of the character dialogue.

Yes, Crimson Skies backstory is pretty interesting, as are the characters and the dialogues are witty. But this is just the glue that holds it all together.\n\nThe secret of Crimson Skies success is, it gives you the illusion to be this daredevil fighter pilot who not only kicks his opponent's \u2665\u2665\u2665 like an ace but who is also a skillful stunt pilot.\nThe environments in Crimson Skies are interesting and challenging, while in the above mentioned games they are only beautiful window dressing.

Although not required, a decent joystick setup makes this game a joy to fly, and it even supports TrackIR for those who are serious about their flight simulators (Oculus Rift support was added recently as well). \n\nThe aerial combat is reasonably plausible, and a working knowledge of advanced combat maneuvers will come in handy as the AI seems to be subject to the same rules of physics as the player. The storyline gives a bit of background to the fuss and although not perfect, it does the job reasonably well.\n\nThe missions are varied and there are actually some flying challenges in there (tricky landings) that is fun to pull off. The views are almost on par with what one would expect from a flightsim, and I primarly fly from the cockpit view with TrackIR.
