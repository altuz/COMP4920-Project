It's a about a game designed by Satan himself to torment sinners in Purgatory. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that such game really exists. It's called White Night.\n\nIt's been a while since I've seen a game so deliberately frustrating, so hostile to the player.\n[list]\n  [*]Camera. It's fixed and it's even worse than in the old Alone in the Dark games. Half of the time you don't see where you're going or what you're looking at. Running into a ghost right in front of you because the camera decided to look the other way is very common. Also, the camera loves to position itself at some weird angle as far as possible so good luck at pixel hunting tiny objects and barely visible collectibles.\n  [*]Controls.  No \"tank\" controls like in other games with fixed camera, here you go where you point the joystick. So every time camera switches you have to readjust the joystick, otherwise you change direction. This is especially great when running away from ghosts: camera switches erratically and you're almost certain to hit a wall and get killed.\n  [*]Light. You use matches to light the way. They burn out quickly yet the hero refuses to pick more than twelve. Also he's a complete idiot because he finds several candles but doesn't think of taking and using them. He doesn't even take a table top lamp capable of killing ghosts. No, no, he uses just matches during the whole game... Also, it's pitch black darkness two meters away from a glowing light bulb. Interesting physics.\n  [*]Ghosts. Insta-killing you on touch. Barely visible. Transparent and foggy, so it's hard to determine their distance from you even if you can see them. At later level some rooms are so full of them that getting around is based on pure luck.\n  [*]Save system. Oh god. You have to manually save by sitting on a marked chair, otherwise your progress is not saved. In a puzzle adventure game! So whenever you die (and that WILL happen countless times), you have to solve puzzles, pick up objects and watch cutscenes all over again. Collectibles are the only exception to this.\n  [*]The game breaks its own rules. It is clearly stated that only electric light hurts the ghosts. However, at one point you kill a ghost using fire from a boiler. Also if you stay too long in the dark, ghost will kill you even if there were no ghosts before and despite the fact ghosts should not see you in darkness (as revealed by one of the documents).\n  [*]No chapter select. Have you missed a collectible? Too bad, replay the whole game again.\n  [*]And like every s**tty game this one too has unskippable cutscenes.\n[/list]\n\nEvery time you save, the character sits in a chair, tired and depressed, and facepalms. This is exactly how I felt the whole time.

Not terrible, but not great either.\n\nAt its core, White Night is a survival-horror game in the vein of Resident Evil.  This means fixed camera angles, sluggish character movement, and an emphasis on limited supplies.  The most impressive aspect of the game has to be its art style.  It's full of sharp lines and a vivid contrast between light and darkness.  The game has a very stylish and appealing look (although the character models are sometimes less impressive looking).\n\nHonestly, the art style is the best part of the game.  The gamplay and story are far less impressive by comparison.  They're not bad, but they have their flaws.\n\nWhite Night places you in the shoes of a man who leaves a bar and ends up experiencing an accident.  Upon coming to, he stumbles toward a large mansion in an attempt to seek help.  Much of the game is spent exploring the house and piecing together diary entries and notes to get the story.  While it's a decent setup, the story doesn't ever really amount to much until the final twist, and most players will figure out the twist on their own fairly early on in the game.  It's not hard to see coming.  I think a more interesting take would have been to reveal the twist maybe halfway through the game and spend the rest of the time dealing with that.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's a mixed bag.  You use matches to light up the dark areas around the house, but you have a very limited supply (only twelve max at a time).  Fortunately the game liberally spreads out matchbooks, so you never really run into a problem with that unless you're careless.  The problem starts with the enemies.\n\nUnlike Resident Evil, you can't fight the ghosts that chase you (you can only kill them with electric light, which becomes the source of most of the game's puzzles).  But when they chase you, your character quickly turns into feeling like an unwieldy drunk.  Add to that the fixed camera angles and one-hit deaths, and you'll die a lot of cheap deaths simply because you can't get your bearings quick enough when the camera changes.  The save system doesn't help either.  You're only allowed to save by sitting in certain chairs.  The game does checkpoint at times, but not always in the right places.  During the first half of the game, there are a couple of hallucination sections where the game will checkpoint at the beginning of them, but not after they're done.  So if you die after the sequence, but before you get to a chair, guess what?  You're doing it all over again.\n\nSo here's the question: why checkpoint at the beginning of a sequence where (as far as I know) you can't die but not at the end of it?\n\nThe pacing of the game doesn't help in these matters either.  You can run, but since running makes your matches run out a lot quicker, you're incentivized to walk everywhere.  And this can make the trek back from a cheap death all the more aggravating.  It's bad enough that it can send you ten minutes back...it's worse when the game basically forces you to take your time or risk blowing through your resources.\n\nOn the whole, White Night was a decent game to play through, albeit sometimes an aggravating one.  The story isn't all that impressive and the gameplay causes as much headaches as it does fun.  The art style is the true standout in this affair, offering a very distinct feel to the game.  It's worth a playthrough for fans of survival-horror, but be prepared to deal with some irritation.  If you are not a patient gamer, then I would avoid this one.\n\nOtherwise, have at it.", "timestamp_updated": 1496353082, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496353082, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "31709510", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496714", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494619826, "steamid": "76561197966801020", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "While i love the idea and the visual style, it's just not fun to play.
