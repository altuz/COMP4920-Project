Won't be stating any pros, as they are most likely going to spoil the game, but generally, the graphics look good, and nothing else more I will say. Have to say though, not really worth the price if you're going to play alone, unless during a sale then that should be fine. Let's just jump straight to the cons. \n\nCons:\n\n-Certain mechanics operate poorly (e.g. running[the sensitivity when you are sprinting, honestly can't see where the f*ck I'm running sometimes], shaky screens)\n\n-Again, shaky screens. My friends have claimed that they get dizzy after playing this game for a period of time, because of all the shakiness this game provides. But I think this is just a personal problem, as I myself, do not have such issues. Worst thing is, literally ALL the people who paid up to get the 4-pack with me(during a -80% sale, totally worth it) were having signs of dizzyness while playing this game. \nQuoted directly from a friend, -\"The screen is shaking too much, it's weird, like everything is just shaking. It makes the game blurry and my eyes start to strain after playing this game for a while. I WANNA VOMIT.\"\n\n-Aiming is really clear and easy, but apparently CS:GO will very rarely decide to take over Zombie Army Trilogy. \nFor those who don't understand, in CS:GO, when you aim and shoot at an enemy(even when you're standing still), the bullet you shot directly at the guy somehow ends up on the wall behind the enemy. I'm sure that explains enough.\n\n-SFX(Zombies growling, basically effect sounds) is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too loud.\nYes, I know you can tweak the audio settings, just stating this as a con so new players(although it's already a 2 year old game)can tweak it before entering the game and getting ear-raped. <-Not sure if they're gonna censor this word(R4P3D)\n\nAnyways, that concludes my sheetty review on the game 'Zombie Army Trilogy'. Here's a summary of all the marks I'm gonna give this game:\nStory - What story?/10 (6/10)\nGraphics - 8/10 (for a 2015 game)\nMechanics - 7/10\nVariety of everything - 8.5/10\nReplayability - 6/10 (if you have no friends); 9/10(with friends)\nAmazingness - 7.7/10\n\nTherefore, overall score-\n7.45/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1504608328, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504608147, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34834826", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506618227, "steamid": "76561198145289232", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 391}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "would recommend this game if you have friends to play with, otherwise gtfo \nPROs:\n~graphics are amazing and really gets you into the atmospher of the game even at low graphics it's still great\n~playing with friends is really fun and intense \n~the zombies are well designed and the screaming really gives you that good spook \n~gameplay and handling is smooth and good wouldnt say much about it \n~the cam shots are really a well done 100% makes you feel like a sniper though you hit the damn zombie from 50 meters away\ni have not play the game much but it's enough to make a review about it i guess \nCONs:\n~the servers of the game are more empty than my balls after watching buko no pico it would be hard to find a game \n~the machine guns are S H I T you cant hit a motherfucker if it was right infront of you\n~the zombie holding a machine gun is op (if it was 2 or 1 player)\n~i'm a b itch i go after small details idk why many mistakes here and there\n~shotgun is shit too\n~i wanna die \nOVERALL:\nis gud", "timestamp_updated": 1504955537, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504955537, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34787311", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505869297, "steamid": "76561198240025012", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Bad Ass game!

I can't give it a positive review. The core gameplay, visuals, level structure, and atmosphere are all well above par. Your trip across a devestated Berlin will be very enjoyable, if one of many technical issues doesn't fudge it up. My biggest problem is the matchmaking system. There aren't enough people playing, and half the time the lobby I load into has a connectivity issue or an AFK player. There are also many bugs, especially with the zombie snipers. They jump around the rooftops, and often spawn in groups, but in some segments of the game they glitch out.
