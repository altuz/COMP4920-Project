I've been playing (not to mention making mods for) the Battlezone franchise since my childhood, and while BZ2 expanded and improved on the original in almost every way the original Battlezone holds a special place in my heart, forever and always. And I am positively thrilled to report that this reboot is the very same Battlezone I came to adore back in the 2000's, albeit with improved graphics and performance.\n\nNow, an un-biased review!\n\nFirst off, graphics. The graphics are, indeed, more than a little dated. This still looks like the game that came out in 1998. That's not to say that it looks bad or anything. It just don't hold up compared to modern games, so if you're looking for something as gorgeous as Crysis 3 you'd best look elsewhere. The reboot did do a wonderful job of reworking the terrain and textures, giving the game sharper details and clearer imagery while keeping the retro look and feel of the original.\n\nNext, gameplay. Where to freakin' start?! Not much has changed between the original and the reboot in this department. Gameplay is the original fast-paced RTS/Shooter hybrid, centering around the fleet of hovertanks you have at your disposal. Build a base, gather resources, build and command your army, all while dogfighting with enemy forces behind the controls of any one of the numerous vehicles at your disposal, from quick and nimble scout craft to meaty tanks to lumbering and terrifying walkers. Outfit your vehicle and your wingmen with a selection of conventional and futuristic weapons like anti-tank cannons, heat-seeking missiles, lasers, or that damn Thumper (an earthquake gun of all things).\n\nThe controls are rather intuitive for such a hybrid game. Sure, there are a few things that might throw off modern gamers (using E to jump and your spacebar to command units, i.e.), but once you get the hang of it the controls handle quite nicely. The UI is decent enough, with your units divided into catagories that you then select from (Offensive for things like tanks, Defensive for turrets and howitzers, utility for gatherers and such, ect.). The system is a bit limited but works smoothly enough with the gameplay.\n\nAll in all I HIGHLY reccomend this game to anyone looking to try something new. Battlezone plays like nothing else out on the market, and while an RTS/FPS hybrid does take some getting used to it is well worth a try. It may have aged a bit and might not look as good as current-gen AAA games, but this is one sleeper that will grab a willing player by the throat and keep them begging for more.", "timestamp_updated": 1505193459, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505193459, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 297, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 25, "total_reviews": 322}}
