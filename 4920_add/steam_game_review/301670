The moon shone red as blood in a pale circle and their scarlet tongues, formed like fishing harpoons, stretched out, curling to the edge of the flame.\u201d  \u2015 Gustave Flaubert, [i]Salammb\u00f4[/i][/b]\n\n[i]Salammbo[/i], hailing from year 2003, is the last of the adventure games created by the French developer team, Cyro Interactive. Since then, all rights of Cyro Interactive products - including [i]Salammbo[/i] - is acquired by Microids, another wondrous name for the adventure game genre. I must declare that it is more than lucky Microids decided to distribute Cyro's old games digitally, so newer generations of adventure lovers may also experience this beauty, based on Gustave Flaubert's original novel with the same name.\n\nIt's 241 BC. After the First Punic War between Roman Republic and Carthage, Rome wins the war. An uneasy treaty of peace has been signed between parties, mostly to the benefit of Rome and now Carthage must pay mercenaries that has been recruited from various countries. While the mercenary camps are settled just outside of the city borders in an uneasy wait, a slave named Spendius manages to escape his masters. While he was trying to get out of the city without being noticed, he is stopped by Salammbo, the daughter of General Hamilcar Barca and the high priestess of goddess Tanith. Salammbo pleads with Spendius that he would carry a message to the one she loves, Matho, the Libyan leader of mercenaries. Spendius agrees, and thus begins his long, brutal and laborious climb from a lowly slave to a general of the Mercenary Revolt that would threaten to bring Carthage to its fall.\n\nThe original story is written by Gustave Flaubert, after the immense success of his first novel, [i]Madame Bovary[/i]. Even though his main source was Polybius's [i]Histoires[/i] to establish the story on a historically just timeline, the setting itself is highly fictitious. With its incredibly violent descriptions of war and surreal depictions of ritualistic traditions of Carthage back at the time, [i]Salammbo[/i] was sensational for the era it was published. It should be also proper to note that the game is based upon Flaubert' work, yet takes a different turn rather than actual recordings; namely prefers to end the series of events with a less gruesome take.\n\nThe graphics of the game are simply breathtaking for its era, with futuristic architecture and intimidating character models. The artwork is inspired from French comic artist Philippe Druillet's graphic novel with the same name, and he has been heavily involved with the development of the game himself. The atmosphere is dark, elegant and overwhelming. Everything is intimidatingly surreal and there is a surprising attention to detail when it comes to all and any textures. It is probably nothing impressive for today, but it is simply beautiful still.\n\nThe game interface is annoying though, and it works really slowly. Remember really old adventure classics like [i]Myst[/i] series, where you'd have a 360 degree of visual angle, yet to you'd have to click at some direction to move? [i]Salammbo[/i] carries the same tradition. Since there is no \"you are here\" indicator or any kind of \"useful\" map interface, this can get pretty disorienting with all that dark and alien architecture around at the start. If you are not easily discouraged though, you get the hang of what is what and what may reside where after a while.\n\nGameplay is fairly simple. Collecting items, solving puzzles and some riddles. Fair enough. Nothing is especially hard or boorishly easy. If you are to listen to dialogue implications carefully and get used to making the best of your environment, the game flows fairly. One warning though: even though the story and the gameplay is linear, there are many, many ways to end up dead. You may very well imply the wrong notion to the wrong person in a dialogue or miss a timed puzzle to end up Spendius massacred in various brutal ways. Don't forget that you are a rebel and spy, trying to fight not only against a whole city, yet anyone that may decide it could be beneficial to get rid of you. Luckily, the game restores you to the last point where everything was somewhat okay the minute you screw up and end up dead. So, you won't be facing the labor of playing through a portion of the game just because you forgot to save.\n\nThe game isn't for everyone. But for the adventure gamer who'd appreciate a good story, beautiful environment design and some fair puzzle challenges, [i]Salammbo[/i] is a true gem, even today. It might be a bit frustrating for the history buff, since the environment is futuristic and the events do not match up with the actual recording, but I truly recommend to spare a leisurely evening to give this one a try. Good day, and good gaming to you!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_updated": 1484151243, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1484150991, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "11632579", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538320", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1407697763, "steamid": "76561197960673566", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Just finished it.

The interface is god awful/annoying, the story is kinda linear but follows the original novel pretty well without being boring, the puzzles are easy except for a few hard ones (Perfect game for the new adventurer), the music is decent but it's inaccurate whenever the game plays it & depending on how good you are with puzzles (There's mini games like War Chess but that doesn't last too long) the game will last around 7 hours.\n\nNow with that out of the way I'll start by saying for a 12 year old game it's got a weird & gorgeous art style it's just a unique piece of animation done well, the voice acting is very good, the humans look like aliens & demons, the atmosphere has that science fiction (Or Fantasy I dont know what Cryo was targeting) heavy metal type style you would see on music albums like Mastodan or GWAR for example & overall I would just wait for the game to go on sale since the game was only an average experience.\n\nBonus: The original story is on Good Reads if you want to check it out http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221597.Salammb_\n\nBonus 2: Another influence for this game is Phillippe Druillet (the website is in french) http://www.druillet.com/", "timestamp_updated": 1421201487, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421128348, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "11597116", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511145", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1407474764, "steamid": "76561198026983534", "num_games_owned": 789, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "One of the most unique adventure games I have played.

Cryo was founded also by members of Infogrames, the creators of Alone in the dark (the original)\n\nThis last effort of theirs, was troubled in its conception, partly because the studio closed its doors while doing this game (2002). Wich of course affected the development but luckily didn't  affect the game too much so the game was finished and published (2003). And while the game was not the best of the studio it was one of the good ones. The art, still present to the last minute was done in this case by Philippe Druillet an acomplished french artist who did work inspired by the writing of HP Lovecraft. Druillet created originally a series of graphic novels in the 1980s called Salammb\u00f3 wich were based on the novel of the same name created by Gustave Flaubert in the 1800s. This was a lush and very violent narrative wich depicted historical events about the fall of Carthage during the 3th century (the Punic wars) and the revolt of the mercenaries.\nSalammb\u00f3 is a dark game with weird visuals wich reflects perfectly the character of the artist. The game alltough it is dated now (2016) and has low resolution (it was one of the last full screen games before everyone went widescreen) still manages to this day to show some incredible art from Druillet wich work previously with Cryo doing Ring: The legend of the Nibelungen. I played originally the dubbed english version wich has horrible voices and now the original french one (both on steam) wich is better but still is not the reason why you are going to play this game.\nThe game has not much support from its present publishers so if you have a problem you are probably going to search for a solution. Personally, the only problem i had was that i had to activate compatibility mode in Windows 7 x64 bit version for the game executable, because if i didn't do that, the game crashed miserably when opening it...but aside from that (it was a very quick solution) the game worked without problems...still, it would be better if you just sold a game that didn't have such a glaringly fatal problem so big and clear in first full view (when you open the game i mean) even if the game is 13 years old, you should check from time to time the games you are selling for any compatibility issues (in this case steam) and fix them before continue selling them... what the heck, i gladly would offer myself to take the job of checking these games if steam would be interested, just for them to to be able to continue selling this classic games...without having crashing issues wich can be solved so easily (but shouldn't be done by players, because when you buy a game it shouldn't be crashing on you....like riven ...another great classic with compatibility issues....)\n\nAnyway, besides that, the game is surely great....i wouldn't necesarily recommend it to a modern age player, because it can be hard to adjust to is gameplay rules.... BUT if you dare to do it...you are going to be rewarded, because theres a nice story and great visual work by druillet.", "timestamp_updated": 1466541020, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466540575, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "11199914", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493451", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405185981, "steamid": "76561197974315887", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I remember I bought this game in box form when PC games were still sold that way.
