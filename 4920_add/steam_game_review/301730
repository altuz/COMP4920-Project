Cute small sprites. Sound effects are alright. Music repetitive. Voice acting and visual novel style character portraits that dont look half bad. Reminded me vaguely of Disciples II dwarves\n\nCons:\nOnly twelve levels, by level 8 or 9 some foes will start being outright immune to certain towers making planning ahead difficult and progression frustrating and putting into question the worth of keeping this title in library.\n\nConclusion: Kinda liked playing that one for an evening until the final few levels. Story is rather superficial, as is the rest. I am kind of disapointed that this is all there is to this game. I thought the tower types were fitting thematically. Not a lot of diversity in how you can upgrade, not a lot of tooltips or info on foes. Would had liked keeping this game around if it had more fleshed out mechanics and more content but given the circumstances it is too small ambitions a game that belongs on the mobile market or on a flash website.", "timestamp_updated": 1500348261, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500348108, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 16, "total_reviews": 25}}
