But the gameplay kills it and lack of options/polish doesn't help too. RADical Roach is a fast-paced arcade shooter with 3 difficulty settings - HARD, HARD & HARD. It is brutaly punishing, without checkpoints and only 3 lives per level ... plus some enemies/terrain parts are instant death. This game is for people who LOVE challenge. However, those people have to be masochist cats because it takes cat-like reflexes to get anywhere in this game. Bosses are cool but their attack patterns are so random that it becomes more about luck and gimmicks. Learning the boss attacks helps little when they attack faster than most people can react. It almost seems like this game was made with a lower framerate and the 60FPS framerate you play in is just crazy fast. Weird thing is that as you progress through the levels the game gets better and I dare say more fair. But not enough to make it worth your time, it seems to be missing so much dev adjustments that I cannot recommend buying it, not even on a sale.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]", "timestamp_updated": 1495266322, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457802601, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "23335475", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499648", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1433959428, "steamid": "76561198065429665", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Terrible gameplay, 0/10", "timestamp_updated": 1464822418, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464822418, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "13584048", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500041", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1408109012, "steamid": "76561197970897684", "num_games_owned": 1796, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Not worth your time or money.", "timestamp_updated": 1419495174, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419495174, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "15303591", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498989", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1429388477, "steamid": "76561198061095129", "num_games_owned": 958, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "CONs: Only one trading card and no achievements.
