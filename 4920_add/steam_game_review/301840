Personally, I feel the middle-eastern setting is one that many desire to become immersed in, as in the west it feels very alien and intriguing. \n\nFirstly, I will say that the screenshots did the visuals of the game justice. The game is not very demanding on Ultra settings which allows you to get good visuals, although not stunning, with a high frame rate. Although, I must admit that the graphics when on medium to high settings were not very sharp or pretty.  \n\nHowever, when on max settings the environment presented does look very impressive and paints a picture of a very wealthy and historic city. The streets are detailed and the views in the distance are striking, creating the illusion that you are in a real and lived in city. \n\nAlthough, it is rare that you get a moment to admire the scenery (which unfortunately sometimes does become repetitive) as the timer to reach the end of the level ticks on. This feature gives the game an early arcade feel, which is further enforced by the fact that dying on any level brings you back to the start of the game. While I\u2019m sure this has been done to create some longevity to an early access game, it does create some extra challenge which I know many will be fond of.\n\nFurthermore, for those that enjoy it this difficulty can be toned up further by the use of enabling buffs to enemies and hindrances on yourself in the menu before the game begins, similar to Halo. Although, the normal game is already quite challenging. There are many enemies and traps are common, hits do high damage and health is hard to come by. Some difficulty is created by the simplistic combat, combat is slower (which doesn\u2019t feel out of place here) and while it is satisfying to hit an enemy and see their reaction to a strike from your sword or whip, it often feels like you are simply trading blows (hit, get hit, hit, get hit\u2026). Perhaps adding in a parry or dodging ability with combos and more varied attacks would alleviate this though. \n\nA big positive is that enemies are varied and interesting leading to a small amount of variety in the simple combat system. I often found myself interested in the design and look of the enemies, their movements felt real giving the impression they were part of the world. \n\nSpeaking of world\u2026 Although visually it is very fleshed out, in terms of story it is very much lacking. The only real lore that you receive is in the tutorial, and this is very general, very generic and very poorly presented. I feel that this setting is more deserving of a game that involves deep lore and story, that inspire the player to keep progressing because they want to learn more of the world they are in, not simply to reach the end of a stage and kill more enemies. \n\nNow, it is extremely important to add that this game is very much in early access. Because of this it is easy to forgive the short comings of the game so far as I\u2019m sure these problems will be addressed. I do have faith that this game will improve greatly with updates as the game at this stage, while not full of content, is very polished. I personally feel that this is the best approach for an early access game, as it shows commitment to making the game a high-quality product rather than a long one. \n\nHopefully, the level design of the game will become less repetitive (street, followed by courtyard, followed by street\u2026) and there will be more light shone upon the story behind the city, the character, the enemies and the motive for exploring this beautiful but deadly location. \n\nOverall, I would say the price for this is fair and that I expect, as the game develops, may even become a very good price for a very good game. In its current state, I would not expect to pour hours into this game, but as content is added and hopefully some form of story is put in the game, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a fleshed out and immersive game that motivates you to explore and progress.\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1505762611, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505762611, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35057958", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505790516, "steamid": "76561198000186788", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Spelunky meets FPS.

Like Prince of Persia except in first person.  Instead it was a lot of combat and very slow progression, with the only parkour-style movement being climbing up on things and a slide maneuver.  The levels are nice and maze-like, with many paths to take and lots of areas to explore before you reach the exit, but it still feels very, I don't know, constrained and crowded and small, in a way.  Each room is filled with dozens of traps and many enemies and even open areas like courtyards and marketplaces still feel kindof small and cramped.  Was hoping for some more grandiose and open areas and designs.  The whip is a fun weapon to use against enemies and traps, but I wish it was more useful in traversal (there are a few grapple points in each level but they are not required to use.  I would very much like to see non-optional platforming sections where you have to run, jump, and grapple/swing in sequences).  There's also not much enemy variety but I also could not get past level 3, this game is very hard and hopefully it will be tuned appropriately.   I guess this just wasn't what I was expecting.  \n\nI thought it would be a rogue-lite first-person Prince of Persia but sadly it is far from that.  It's still a fun game with a very amazing unique aesthetic but it's just not my cup of tea.  I still recommend it though because the combat is still somewhat satisfying (using the whip to either stun enemies, knock their weapons away, or trip them, is immensely satisfying, and the sword combat has good weight and oomph to it).  The genies can either help or hurt you, which is an interesting mechanic.  The backstory of the world is great.  I wish there was just more to it.  \n\nI really hope they revamp this game since it's still in Early Access, but sadly I think that they have the gameplay mechanics set in stone and the final release will only just be a more polished version of what is already available (which is already quite a lot).  Seriously there's a good game in here and for an early access game this is already somewhat impressive, it's just not for me and not what I was looking for.  I still recommend it though to at least try.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_updated": 1506687934, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506687647, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35055556", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506265005, "steamid": "76561198073970485", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I had this game on my wishlist and kept an eye on it, waiting for it to be released as it looked like a lot of fun and very Prince of Persia feel to it.
