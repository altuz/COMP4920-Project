That's not an issue as in this game there's neither combat nor falling nor death nor are there enemies.\nThe controls work pretty well for climbing, no complicated inputs required, are very simple. The boat is a little wonky but well controlable.\n\nOn water you can find other boats to scavenge them and upgrade your boat's engine, which prolongs it's turbo boost a little.\nOn any of the abandoned structures you'll find 2 things:\n-paintings, telling the story of what happened\n-supply goods (better loot those only after you're done looting the place)\nFinding all the supplies is the goal of the whole game. Each time one supply drop is looted you're brought back to your starting area and the story continues, adding new tasks after that.\n\nThe game has a lot of good design decisions for it's simplicity. The spyglass allows marking spotted objects on the map and even points an arrow towards objects not yet on your screen for you to focus and mark them. You don't even need to zoom in, it's a good and useful feature, especially if used from high positions. The camera, which in other games is often an issue, actually helps spotting objects you might have missed otherwise and is freely turnable, even while climbing. Objects to interact with always highlight the \"use\" button above them when being close enough, so that it's always clear what can and can't be interacted with. Such objects also emit a \"shine\" effect from time to time from a distance, making it easier to find them when driving by with the boat. The controls are simple and respond well. Neither climbing nor using the boat causes any trouble and no special input is required at any time. It's just simple and it works.\n\nThe downsides: The game is short, linear and much of the same. The replay value is zero, except if you're in the mood for the game again, as each new game will be exactly the same, as the only difference you can make is by your choice where you go.\n\nI'd recommend this game to you if you\n-like exploring places\n-are okay with the fact that you'll spend quite some time with boat driving and climbing\n-want to spend some time in a stress-free environment\n-care about a game's story and it's setting\n\nThe more of these points don't match the less I'd recommend this game to you. This one won't ever be a super-awesome must recommend game because it's too repetitive, with too little content and it's not randomized a bit BUT it's well made with what's in it.

I'm taking this as buying a rather good $3 piano medley album that happened to come with a free game.\n\nFor the long, starting with concerns, read below. For the short, I do not recommend this game for $20, due to lack of polish, poor animation, clunky controls, disappointing graphics, lack of replayability or the want to do so, and I haven't finished collecting the \"story\" but considering it's just a scrapbook, looking it up online would work just fine. The gameplay is like the fun part (for me) of Assassins Creed with trying to figure out how to climb up the buildings, except remove the fun, the speed, or any choice of movement as it's either Route A. to objective, or Route B. to story page.\nOn the plus side, as previously mentioned, the music is good and the audio is surprisingly above par with full 5.1 support.\nOh, and I forgot to mention, if you just go from objective to objective you could probably beat this in half an hour first playthrough.\n\nI thought I should use a controller for this type of game, which is fully supported, but immediately noticed some goofy things. Walking forward (especially slowly) gives you that kind of 2003 era third person adventure shuffle slide walk animation, as well as the lack of a \"step up\" animation so the girl just kind of teleports about a foot upwards on top of the ledge. The funny thing about that is, for 90% of the locations it's completely flat ground, but they centralize you on an area with an angled roof where you basically have to do it any time you leave. Just kind of a goofy choice, and again, a bit of a lack of polish.\n\nOn the subject of animations, they're pretty harsh. Nothing is smooth and fluid with the girl except for her typical light and breezy scarf/sash thing. You'd kind of expect when all the jump distances are the same, and you only have three types of movement (Walking, shimmying on a ledge, and hanging) that they would be much smoother. Instead it's almost like they pulled something off the Unreal marketplace and just made it \"work.\" It's pretty evident in the videos, the girl starts a jump, the animation ends abruptly, then she reaches the ledge and the grabbing animation plays abruptly. Every single ledge in the game is exactly the same height, I don't honestly understand how this could look so goofy and unpolished other than using premade assets and slapping them in place.\nThe exception to this rule is the 8 forms of wildlife scattered around the world, although I suppose fish aren't that hard to animate.\n\nThe art style is decent, but the actual graphics tend to leave me unimpressed. There's very few very often repeating low quality textures, and of course assets like plants, rubble, etc... along with what appears the dark depths of either the black lagoon or hell itself as the water is a deep blue and has no translucency at all. I don't necessarily need/want a 150 foot deep view of the city streets below the water, but watching whales, dolphins, fish, buildings, floating garbage just instantly disappear under this mysterious void is a little disconcerting.\nI could easily get over the vegetation and other repeating assets, but the low quality textures and poor water (being ~80% of the graphics) really reduces the \"WOW! This looks amazing!\" factor.\nAgain, there's exceptions to this, as the game (inexplicably really) has rather nice day/night and weather cycles which constantly change the lighting schemes and gives off those nice beautiful colors to reflect off the... crappy textures and actually not very reflective water.\n\nI (as mentioned) haven't collected all the story pages, but they're just very simple drawings wherein you try to infer as to what's happening in them. To it's credit, most of them are actually fairly easy to understand. The only I know for certain *spoilers I guess* is that there seems to be some type of algae sickness that's spread to all the animals, people, and the girl, of which turns the humans into gross green algae mutants. I've also seen a dead robot on top of the altar of the main hub which piqued my interst more than anything.\nThe big problem in doing hidden story pages throughout the world is that it's just easier to Google them up rather than taking your slow sweet ass time gathering them, and you don't miss out on anything.\n\nThe biggest plus to this game is the audio, which has its own minus. The sound mixing is actually surprisingly great, and works with full 5.1, with the lovely (and also rather bassy) piano medley music, wherein lies the rub.\nAfter a while of puttering about in your boat the music ends and... that's it. Doesn't repeat, doesn't play another song, just ends. So it's just you and the sounds of wind and the stupidly large amount of whales and dolphins jumping around, though cruising along with dolphins around you is kinda neat.\n\nAnd that's really all I have to say about this game.

And boy am I disappointed. I like the idea of a combat-free exploration game set in a post-apocalyptic world, but the store page doesn't mention that it's also completely challenge-free. The game holds your hand so damn hard that there is no point for me to keep playing. While climbing or walking next to a gap you can't fall down, invisible walls prevent you from falling over. When trying to spot the next building with supply drops on top of it there are indicators pointing towards the \"right\" building. There is not even the chance to have a look around before it being put right in front of your nose. The map also contains information about how many \"secrets\" you can find on top of each building. For a game which completely relies on exploration and wandering around this seems unacceptable to me. \nThis might actually be quite a nice game for young children who want to practice their basic movement skills in a more or less beautiful game and I'd recommend it only for that.\nBut for a 32 year old guy like me the gameplay was beyond boring and bland, without the story being very appealing to me either.", "timestamp_updated": 1507097225, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507097225, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35353835", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510700", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506804173, "steamid": "76561197994971393", "num_games_owned": 1299, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 352}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is amazing for a number of reasons.

There is far more to the story than just \"sister saves brother\" (though that part of the story is very compellingly told). I don't want to spoil anything here, but even just the basic campaign content has some interesting twists, though they are very understated (a bit like Shadow of the Colossus). But if you delve into the secrets to learn the story of the city, and decipher the script, there is even more interesting things going on in this world. Very good stuff.\n\n4 The music is perfect for the mood of the game. Relaxing, but somber.\n\n5 The exploration mechanics are great. As some negative reviews have mentioned, this isn't the kind of Tomb Raider experience where you have lots of heart-pounding action avoid monsters and traps, or have lots of puzzles to solve.

The only bug/issue I encountered was that the boat would occasionally stall/stop completely. (This may even be intentional)\n\nThe issue is with the game mechanics and level design.\n\nThe world is beautiful, it's quite nice to just cruise around and explore it with the boat, get off on some of the smaller islands/buildings. The problem is that the smaller islands are the more interesting places to go, and the main story with the caches requires you to go to the big buildings that all look and feel very similar.\n\nNot only are the buildings very similar, but you're only ever really climbing on the facade of the buildings, with very few exceptions to the rule. There's some beautiful areas that just aren't accessible for exploration, and you're locked into walking along the predefined paths that the game wants you to take. (This is the part that really annoys me.)\n\nI don't mind the restriction of movement so much, it's that I don't get anything extra out of the restriction. I understand it's meant to stop the player from bypassing some of the climbing puzzles, but after climbing a handful of buildings that all look and feel the same, you want to bypass the puzzles, because they aren't challenging.\n\nGoing for the extra pages for the story can sometimes be a bit of a challenge, but the pages aren't very interesting, and you know after a few buildings that you won't find any other \"secrets\" other than the pages. Same goes for the boat upgrades that only ever give your boat more stamina. It takes away from the fun of finding a secret or any kind of loot, if you know what it's going to be before picking it up.\n\nUnfortunately this is sort of the theme for the game. A few core mechanics, which don't really do much for the experience. The first building you climb is quite fun, and it's fun to explore the world until you start to see the mechanics behind it all. The game is just too predictable.\n\nI hope to see another game from Uppercut soon, that expands on the mechanics they built for this, and makes it a less repetitive experience.", "timestamp_updated": 1507152062, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507152062, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35484879", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504856", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507170906, "steamid": "76561198001365794", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 196}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I paid $2 for this game.

Graphically it is a nice game - with nice particle wffects and good level design although it seems to be just one Huuuuge level. \nthe gameplay in itself i dont think will please many people who are looking for a more hardcore experiance and definitely would not reccomend this at full price however i picked it up for \u00a31.50 and for that price it a nice little distraction from all the other games i play - i wasnt expecting much from the game however the animations. particle effects and the genrally good design of the game is mildly pleasing. my only grip is that they could have made the game a hell of a lot more challenging by introducing jumping into the game as well as run and jump this would have increased the complexity of some of the climbing puzzles - just one hint to new players - before you collect the crate at the top of the tower make sure you have explored the rest of the tower - as soon as you get the top crate you will be ported back to the start area and if you missed secrets you will have to re-explore/climb that tower  and explore its other routes.\na very nice chilled experiance - a good game when on sale -", "timestamp_updated": 1507152926, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507103289, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35479283", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507144164, "steamid": "76561198087611671", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 279}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I have a feeling the creators artificially inflated the price on steam to then sell it for x price. To sum up the game and without spoiling, it's an 'adventure game' where you climb and find emergency rations in a post apocolyptic world where the people have mutated. [u] There is nothing else to this game.[/u] The characters other than the protagonist and the \" city's\" story have no plot other than to \" guide you\" (disappear at specific points). As it's only one path, you can imagine the complexity of brain power involved.\n\nI decided to waste my time and complete the game to 100% because I was hoping there would be something more exciting beyond it ( also because it was pretty damn easy to achieve).  Would a cutscene appear if I found the 'secrets'? Nope. Like many of the reviews here, the game is lack-lustre. The story itself is pretty straightforward and this is revealed without even collecting the secrets. It's missing a lot of important elements to a game and I would say the map is far too small to really call itself an adventure game.  There's not really much point to doing any of the achievements other than the boat parts nor would I say the game has any incentives other than the steam achievements but they don't really get you anything. \n\nThe graphics weren't a* but they were pretty and I enjoyed the smaller details the team has incorporated e.g. the effect of rain on the protagonists hair + clothing. The slow progression of details from \"chapters\" such as the boat. I also enjoyed the dolphins, and other marine life following you once you identified them. The music was phenomenally soothing, and would appear in bursts throughout the game. I would definitely agree with other users that it was the highlight of the game. Were the cutscenes longer or narrated/ voice acted, I would have definitely enjoyed them more. \n\nSeveral problems:\n[list]\n    [*]If you find an emergency ration box, and you have decided to collect the stories later returning to the bottom is troublesome and I'd recommend finding as many of the boxes as you can whilst you're on your way up there.  This added an extra hour or two due to the fact I had to rescale and descend from buildings through the very stimulating route (/s). \n\n    [*]The game crashed twice whilst playing however it does auto-save from your last checkpoint ( being if you find a secret, a boat part or a ration box).\n\n    [*]Whilst climbing the various ledge, there is a feeling of absolute nothing. There is no danger, no progression or no sense of puzzles. You are zen. You become Zen. You are also watching a youtube video just so you can say you've finished the game and when that happens, should you really be playing a game? \nEven when the boxes may have been up \"other\" paths, it was a pretty straight forward path and you had the evolved(?) swampy humans guiding you, The protagonist could do everything imagineable. Jump to a ledge the same height as her body? check. But don't even think about trying to divert from the climbing path. It was a \" press your finger on the right button\" game and the character did it for you. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Overall, play this game if you want to zone out but look at something pretty. Bad day at work? Wife is yelling at you? Boss is yelling at you?  Got fired because you played a game instead of listening to your boss yelling at you? Divorce papers on the desk? If you answered yes to any of the above, this game is perfect for you. Otherwise, avoid the game unless you want to listen to the music.
