As someone who played sants row 2, 3 and 4 this feels like it has nothing new to bring to the table. I honestly don't really see myself going back to it. It is  not the most interesting with a few cutscenes and pick your ending on top of basically old content. 3 to 4 was similar due to same location but it brought superpowers and such, this just doesn't have much to say \"that makes this game something good\".\n\nI got the game at heavy discount (like \u00a32.50) and still a bit disappointed, if I got for much more I would have likely been annoyed. We have some new characters but they really aren't explored very much and the singing cutscene I just found annoying...\n\nUnless you are seriously a die hard fan that has to go into the saint row universe I would give this one a pass. I was a pretty big fan of the series but I still don't think it was for me.

Its always been the weird, crazy, less sucessful cousin of GTA.  Its been fun.

I laughed loud enough to annoy my dog more then once, but between those carefully crafted magical moments, it was kinda...only okay.  \n\nNow this.  So, take away the REALLY repetive game play that was basicly a copy-paste from SR4, and your left with...well not much.  Its got some good lines in it, and yes, its got a fucking MUSICAL number, but its just not...much.  I didnt rush thru anything, and I was done with this game at something like 75% in 8 hours.  I spent longer enjoying NPC banter (which was really good...) then I think I did kicking devils in the crotch.  I feel like the superpowers that you first got in SR4 got amped up even more, and that just spoiled the fun.
