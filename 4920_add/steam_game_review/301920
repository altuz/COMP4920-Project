If you enjoyed the first one, definitely get ALTeR. ALTeR continues the story of the War of the Human Tanks world by following the campaign of a new character, Alter. Some characters from the first game make short appearances throughout ALTeR.\n\nA \"side\" campaign takes place in the Great Cavern, which is about 100 floors. This is actually where most of the story happens, so don't be surprised by the noticeably short \"main\" campaign. It's clever that Fruitbat decided to incorporate the main storyline as the \"side\" story in the form of the long Great Cavern campaign, because it allows the first game's story to connect more smoothly to this one. The two campaigns in ALTeR are largely independent plot lines, so you're on your own with questions you have after Operation Kisaragi (main campaign).\n\nComparison with the first game: ALTeR is much longer because of the lengthy Great Cavern campaign. Also, the story in the first game develops more linearly while ALTeR develops more quickly later in the Great Cavern. Also, the music in ALTeR is more... innovative, perhaps. The wit, humor, and touching moments are also in ALTeR. Overall, the first game has a more riveting story; ALTeR has more stuff for you to do and discover.\n\nThere is a lot of great content in ALTeR; get it if you liked the original War of the Human Tanks.\n\nP.S. If you earned the \"Special Save Data\" from the first game, you have to import it to ALTeR BEFORE starting a new game to earn the bonus unit.", "timestamp_updated": 1498947013, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498586979, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 43, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 45}}
