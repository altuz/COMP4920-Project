Not as good as Alter, but still a nice game.\n\nWhile the mechanics stay the same, for each mission you have a set amount of tanks to choose from. So there's no more developing tanks and modules for your liking. For like half of the game it's really annoying, since the enemy is always stronger and you don't have access to the quick scouts or assaults tanks which otherwise you could develop in previous game. Because of this, you have to change your strategy for this game. In pevious titles you always wanted to rush in and kill the enemy before he kills you. Here you have to take more cautious approach with multiple scout tanks (no Koharu for you!). Of course,  you will still sometimes lose because of random Shock tank blowing up in your face or stray artillery.\nLate game and bonus missions are much more interesting - you have better units, although not too many, so you have to plan ahead  the deployment, etc.\nThe addition of Limits and mission ranks is nice, but not really a gamechanger.\n\nOverall, if you liked the previous Human Tanks game, you will almost surely enjoy this one as well.", "timestamp_updated": 1491675522, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491675522, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 6}}
