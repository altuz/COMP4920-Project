An FPS where screen watching is how you play as other players are invisible. However, this feature can cause confusion with four players and headaches as you must watch four screens at once. This game is great with friends online or in local multiplayer, but the online seems to be dead so you won't find any games in matchmaking. You can play against bots or do time trials if you are playing alone. I would recomed this as a good local multiplayer party game.", "timestamp_updated": 1505920368, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505920368, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34942992", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505845033, "steamid": "76561198056255226", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is amazing. Only 2 hours in and I'm addicted. Nobody's online, but I got this game for my roommate as well and we each have an extra xbox controller. Between our two computers, we can have four people playing at once. And it is really fun. The weapons are really unique and the maps are well-designed. I can pull people into our room all the time to play this. Plus you can play with friends across the country, and it all still works.
