I used to have this on ps2. I think they could've done better with the graphics when they put it on pc but whatever. For 5 bucks, it isn't that bad of a game. One thing I don't like about it is that you have to get used to the controls. The controls are just pictures of swords and stuff which makes it difficult when you have to do those little mini-game type things. The story is somewhat fun but when you die, you pretty much have to restart the level. I think it would be alot better if there was more levels and more of a story. There is only like 12 levels and they don't take too long. I beat this game within 4 hours total. If you have a little extra money to spend, you should get this game but don't expect high quality graphics and stuff.", "timestamp_updated": 1499044318, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499044318, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31695706", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498760", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494313351, "steamid": "76561198106341569", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I bought this game in a pack and decided after quite a few years to play it.
