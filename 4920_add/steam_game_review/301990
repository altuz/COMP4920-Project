You really got to think which kid goes with which.. even for the sake of various bonuses. You got to upgrade your \u00a8bus\u00a8 when you can, it\u00b4s fun since you will really notice each upgrade will do it\u00b4s described job.

For this, I give it a small thumbs up. \n\n+ It's a solid timewaster-type puzzle game. \n+ Entertaining and requiring mild thought.\n- I think the devs could have added a bit more variety in vehicle upgrades.\n- Shortcut keys would have helped some situations. In particular, there should have been a key to cancel the trip queue. There's a button to do this, but the fraction of a second required to mouseover and click the button sometimes makes a real difference.\n- Some achievements don't seem to work right.\n-- The theme could (and should) have been a bit edgier.
