Once the rather contrived supernatural aspects are accepted even the \"weirdness\" that occurs is amenable.\n\nThe Story:  Vera receives a cryptic phone call from her estranged younger twin Arthur asking/begging her to come back to their childhood home, Pilgrim's Hook, a remote ex-whaling island village off Nantucket, Massachuesetts (USA).  (This fictional place would be off the coast of Boston, Cape Cod, or Martha's Vintage in Massachusetts for trivia lovers.)  By the time she gets there her brother is missing and she must find him.  Relatively typical storyline, except for the fact she finds him by chapter two.  Meanwhile, an evil lurking Cthulhu-like octopus starts talking to Vera through water puddles and flat reflective surfaces.  Creepy, and just exactly why does it want Vera?  This is actual storyline: the mystery of island and why it is there.  The evil denizen of the deep is left rather open to interpretation, however, its motives are not. It clearly states them.  However, why it considered Vera to be a good candidate is well ... simply a poor choice of its part.   \n\nThe gameplay:  This is where the gamer will love or hate the game.   If a straight forward linear hunt, search and find is your thing, then this game is not it.  The gameplay is \"open world\".  What I mean by this is the gamer can go anyway, look, hunt, search, find objects, and do puzzles in no given order.  What can be done is limited to the clues given, items found and objects available in the inventory.  This will cause \"confusion\" for linear thinkers, and complaints from those who dislike \"wandering\".  (There is a built in walkthrough that is set up in a linear progression and a fast travel map.)  The game \"bottle necks\" at certain points and the player can not progress until all objects needed to be found are found and the tasks needed to be done are completed.  (Personally I consider these points to be self checks, if I cannot proceed I missed something somewhere.)   \n\nPuzzles: There are two types of HOs.  1) Straight forward HO scenes with at least one cleverly hidden object. (Not the type that makes one say \"jerks\" but the type that make one say \"oh there it is, wow how did I miss that\"  2) Find x amount of objects.  Usually 3 different objects of different amounts.  \nThere is a variety of other puzzle types some harder then others, one requires a lot of patience and one ultra classic I have not seen in years.  (Some of those oldies will stump today's audience and this one will probably stump some players.)\n\nThere are two sets of Hidden Finds: Castor's Collection (fading in and out sea life) found throughout the main storyline, and the Whale's Bones, only available after finishing the bonus chapter.  \n\nOverall: Not a deep storyline and one that leaves a lot of room for intrepretation and unanswered questions if one thinks about it too much.  \"Open world\" game style.  A variety of puzzles (at least one ultra classic) and HO scenes.  This a relatively short game, too, compared to more recent games.  \n\nOne last thing: Achievements.  All in-game achievements can be achieved in a single playthrough and some achievements are quite different from the usual achievement fare.  If steam achievements and trading cards is the only reason you play then do not play this game, this game has neither.  However, if you play HOs for the sheer joy of playing a decent story with decent HO scenes and puzzles then play this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1451969615, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441159613, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "12856035", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516342", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1415437261, "steamid": "76561198032348802", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I haven't played any other pure HoG's, so I'm coming at this from the perspective of an adventure gamer willing to put up with some cursor sweeping here and there.

However, there's definitely a skip button, for all of the puzzles. These two features are only present in \"Casual\" game difficulty mode.\n\nThere are twenty-five collectible sea creatures. They're scattered throughout the entire game.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, there's a bonus chapter, but it can be unlocked only after the main story of the game's completed.

The artwork was lovely, though my only complaint on that front is that the talking animations looked a little stilted. My only other issues are that I wish the achievements were linked to steam, and sometimes the placement of an item was very sensitive to a select few pixels. For instance, I spent about a half hour furiously trying to use a pry bar on a loose board, until I finally found the right area of pixels.\n\nOverall, I find it very fun, but I wouldn't recommend spending $15 on it.
