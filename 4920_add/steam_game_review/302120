Find objects, use them somewhere else and from time to time, solve small puzzles. Sometimes you need to find many objects in a scene where then one is used to continue the game. Puzzles are all very easy to solve, and if you are stuck you have a hint system (showing you the next action). Very linear.\n\nPositive:\n+ nicely drawn graphics\n+ very relaxing gameplay\n\nNegative:\n- too easy\n- very linear\n- sometimes not logical (why have i thrown away x when i need it now again)", "timestamp_updated": 1493378483, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493378483, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31388024", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1492663880, "steamid": "76561198055489822", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This one is much worsem and a step down from the last one.

The puzzles are mostly tedious, and not fun. \n\nI honestly saw Zoroaster in the title and thought to myself: Are they gonna talk about Zoroastrianism? That's new! No one in the west basically knows what that even is! Are they gonna talk about ancient persia? Or How this is one of the first monothistic religeons in the world?\n\nNope. It's just a cool sounding name to these guys. Dump on the actual people who still are following the religeon.\n\nNO. BAD. Not appreciated.
