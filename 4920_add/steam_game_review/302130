It has a very creepy storyline and some new puzzles. I actually had to skip two because I just couldn't work them out. I got around 6hrs play including the bonus chapter. The characters mouths moved, and the extras such as moaning and hyperventilating made this game exciting. There are not that many hidden object scenes, but they were good with some puzzles within them. The only thing I didn't like was that there was no teleport feature. It was annoying running back and forth, but the game would have finished a lot earlier without it. I still recommend it.", "timestamp_updated": 1492947668, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492947509, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 53, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 59}}
