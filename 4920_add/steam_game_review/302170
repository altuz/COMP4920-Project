They are old games, but I think they look surprisingly good. There is no real 3D. Instead of a 3D environment like an FPS game you actually move from one point to another. And at each location you have a different 360 degree panoramic view. So it's basically like Google earth street view. The game is low-res and the images are pixellated but I think it look's good. You basically explore environment looking for items and clues etc. So far I've played for almost 1 hour. It's one of those sort of detective games where sometimes you get stuck looking for the next thing because you can't see it anywhere. But that is typical of this sort of game. Those parts are a bit tedious but I really like this game.

A few months ago, I decided to give it a shot.  I wasn't disappointed.  The game is a bit fantastical with a touch of a Sherlock Holmes-esque feel to it.

It is a touch confusing at times, and I did occasionally need to consult a walkthrough for some of the timed portions.  The mystery is enough to keep you engaged and interested to the end, and there's a good amount of action as well.  The protagonist is whitty and the puzzles are fun.

By the end of it I was screaming at the screen in anger and frustration. I then resorted to online walkthroughs so that such a poor excuse for a game did not defeat me. \n\nMy main objections are below (warning there are some spoilers):\n\n1. There is no tutorial. \nI was just flung into the game and had to guess how to access the inventory and hint system. Perhaps this wasn't a problem when it was originally purchased in a box with a manual, but it's a drag now.\n\n2. Movement/backgrounds/stupid, pointless mazes. \nThe movement is your standard grid system point and click which wouldn't be so much of a problem if the backgrounds weren't so poorly rendered. This really comes into its teeth-grindingly-frustrating own when the game decides it would be fun to have a largely featureless underwater maze. They then decide to compound this misery in the final section with circular corridors.\n\n3. The hint system is more of an 'I told you so' system.\nThis includes notes in a diary which sometimes bear some relation to your predicament, sometimes don't. The latter is more often true. It leaves you completely hanging in places for no reason whatsoever.\n\n4. Progression/puzzles are too often stupid.\nWe're not talking comedy stupid, or one-off perhaps they were having a bad day stupid. We're talking criminally poorly stupid. Why when I want to access the Loch do I have to magically realise I want a garden hose? Why when I want 120ml of a substance do I have to click on a bottle clearly marked as 30ml four times? It just doesn't make sense! Once or twice you can put up with, by the end of the game I felt it was almost constant.\n\nIf you're prepared to put up with all of this then please go ahead. All I can say is that it's a good job I'm blessed with a luxuriant mane as by the end of this a more folically challenged person might have had no more hair to pull out!\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1438105574, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438105574, "votes_down": 11}, {"recommendationid": "15370774", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485409", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1429010701, "steamid": "76561198169636590", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is very bad!", "timestamp_updated": 1429076671, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429076671, "votes_down": 15}, {"recommendationid": "13048170", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491559", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1416704201, "steamid": "76561198091916473", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "It is hard to see areas of interest due to the dated graphics.
