While the overall story is reasonable, I got really frustrated with the game on so many levels.\n\nThe keyboard controls were so awful I ended up using a controller, but those controls were only slightly less awful. The biggest pain was the ever changing camera angles which seemed to be almost purposely meant to frustrate movement on a level I have never experienced. The combat was absolute trash, especially the boss fights. When a billy club can dish out more damage than a mortar cannon, you know there's some serious issues. There's an endless supply of respawning minions that further make combat more mundane than entertaining. Finding the next objective is near impossible. There are no way points and there is no objective list to aid your quest. You do have a fat dude sidekick that always spawns after whatever obstacle you were trying to overcome, but he can't help you get past the obstacle. The inventory system was a mess to the point of not having slots available to pick up key quest items and no way to actually drop items other than giving them to said fat man or your alternate character.\n\nI honestly can't believe I finished this game because there were so many moments where I just wanted to rage uninstall.

Wonderful review, I assure you, but first we're going to open with a little something. Curse: The Eye of Isis has great controls. Hard to believe with all these reviews that are just \"the controls are bad\", sure, but they're there. You just have to coax them out.\n\n[list]\n[*] Get a gamepad to work on your PC. I don't care how, make it happen. Xbox, should work natively, PS3/4, get the depreciated version of SCP Server or the one Dualshock 4 program everyone uses.\n[*] Go into options and change control scheme from \"Keyboard\" to \"Joystick\". This also gets rid of the tank controls nobody likes.\n[*] Now rebind the controls in the control option to whatever you like. You can't bind them to the triggers and the actual \"get me out of this game please\" menu is unbindable, stuck to Esc on the keyboard.\n[/list]\n\nBoom, fixed. Thank me later. On with the show.\n\n[h1] NEXT TIME I WON'T MISS [/h1]\n[i]- Le Chat, notable for this and being called \"Le Chat\".[/i]\n\nCurse: The Eye of Isis doesn't really do anything wrong.\n\nThere's great controls, not quite 1:1 but you can run rings around opponents and even avoid bullets with ease. It has well designed characters who manage to make the conventional look unconventional. There's nice pacing, it never settles. There's even great production values - the shaders aren't great but the texture design and asset variety is there. \n\nAdd a hammy plot that's straight out of a Saturday Morning cartoon. It's all there, all the ingredients, and it doesn't grossly mishandle any one bit on what should be a heart-filled and memorable clone of a popular game, that just sadly lacks the budget to compete with the best.\n\nSo it's a challenge to really articulate why Curse: The Eye of Isis is so wholly forgettable and generic. \n\n[h1] This is normally where I put another quote. [/h1]\n[i] - already put the single memorable line from this game above so just roll with it. [/i]\n\nThere's no real puzzles. 90% of the \"solutions\" to the item-based puzzles are located about two meters from the challenge in question. There's no real level exploration, you're led around by the nose and exploration outside of one select instance is either punished or forbidden - by wasting your time, or burning resources for nothing.\n\nThere's no depth or variance to the world or story. Everything plays out exactly how you'd expect and does an incredibly tired job of it. There's no real horror: a few \"monster closets\" right at the end aside enemies just sort of sit in rooms, and then stay dead while spewing more resources then they consume (which is a fair bit to begin with, the average alive enemy will take five headshots before they die).\n\nThere's no real character arcs - characters sort of just state what they want to do, or don't, then do it and occasionally scream each other's names from offscreen. The itty bitty arc there is, doesn't so much exist, so much as the Arabian fez-wearing save point flatly tells you it does.\n\nEverything is incredibly underwritten so you don't even have that much ham in this hammy story to enjoy. There are no surprises at all in this brown, grey slop of a game. \n\n[h1] Pretend I wrote something here. [/h1]\n[i] - pretty sure half the script for this game looks like that too. [/i]\n\nSome games bore you to tears. Curse: The Eye of Isis manages to avoid this while also avoiding doing a single thing of interest. It is a perfectly playable, well executed corporate product, that I am going to go to sleep tonight and completely forget about.\n\nIf you're interested in a very cheap, very playable game then Curse: The Eye of Iris can contend with the other fifty billion of those on Steam. Otherwise just forget about this game, like everyone else has.\n\nSome games belong in the echelons of history. Some games belong in a garbage can.
