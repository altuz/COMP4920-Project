I can pause it and take care of my crazy kids, and then come back and not have missed a beat.  The different levels make it a challenge, the way the game is set up makes each play through completely different.

It's simple, classic Doctor Mario. Enjoyable RPG elements allow you to craft and find new items that provide play affects like dispatching enemies stuck in corners, or slowing the fall rate of your pills. Terrain details provide a nice twist that brings the play-area to life.\n\nThe sound design is abominable. The music is genuinely obnoxious and distractingly bad, while the sound effects are wispy swooshes that don't connect with the action, at all.\n\nMenu animations are pointlessly long, reminding me of Puzzle Chronicles, where half the game is spent waiting for the game to start. There should have been an option to skip these animations.\n\nIt's rare that sound design works against a game. I can't remember ever responding so negatively to the way a game sounds, but it's distracting at its best, and flat-out aggravating at its worst. If you turn down the sound effects, turn the music off, and think about what you're doing with your life during the animations, it's a wonderful game. If you try to listen to it?
