Classic adventure game exploration and dialogue are present - as different gameplay modes, along with disk-space-saving uninteractive text descriptions and simple gunfight sequences, all bridged by a simple flight simulator that can be further simplified by turning off banking (tilting when turning) by pressing B, turning on warp speed by pressing W, hovering straight up and down, and avoiding even that by using autopilot and the nav computer (via map coordinates or simple four-digit codes, the latter of which every story-important location has). As for the concept and story, it's the beginning of the series' unique and entertaining concept - a detective in a post-WWIII America bombed back to the noir era.
