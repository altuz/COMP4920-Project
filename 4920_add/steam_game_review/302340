You need a job, and you need it soon.  Lo and behold, Marshall Alexander, CEO of the TerraForm Corporation, hires you to find his daughter, who was abducted -- and something \"else\" . . .\n\nGone is the dialogue puzzle of the previous game, which disappointed me a bit.  There are times when you need to do more than just talk to people in these screens, such as give them items in order to move the story along, and I didn't realize this until I read a guide.  Granted, it's entirely possible that such was clearly mentioned in the manual that would have come with this game if you bought it hard-copy (in 1991).\n\nAlso removed from this game is the driving mechanic from Mean Streets, which was difficult at best and caused you to miss out on a lot of the previous game's flavor.  Another mechanic taken out is the side-scrolling shooting gallery.  I am pleased that neither of these mechanics made it into Martian Memorandum.  That said, the game then becomes rather linear, but it's still a pretty neat story even today.\n\n[spoiler](NOTE:  There's a portion of the game that you can actually skip because it was so mind-bendingly difficult.  Google 'Tex Murphy Martian Memorandum Guide' and any guide worth its salt will explain further)[/spoiler]\n\nPeople who are genuinely interested in seeing what constituted gaming in the early dawn of the industry should have this in their library.

But the time I spent playing it - 7 hours - is time I wish I could get back now. \n\nTo call the game mediocre is being generous. Thinking back on my standards around the time this game came out, I would have found it lackluster and tedious even back then. The dialogues are a meandering choose-your-own-adventure that sometimes matter and sometimes don't, and sometimes are dead-ends unless you interrupt with an inventory item. This wouldn't be too bad, were it not for the extremely low-fi voices. I give it points for being one of the first \"talkie\" games, but those points are taken away for the dialogue being very grating. There is also a lot of reading, which I am fine with in games, but the font style, size, and color used made it difficult to read, whether in a window or full-screen. \n\nThe graphics were a weird hybrid of detailed and abstract, so while you'd sometimes have a grainy photo of a real-life object, other times there would be two beige pixels nestle unobtrusively in a scene, that you were supposed to realize were important and click on (because it was a piece of paper or something.) And since this is before the days of highlighting, there was never an indication of what was and wasn't an important pixel, so you could click all over an object and get a generic response, not knowing that the slightly lighter pixels were the ones that would give you the clue you actually needed. This wasn't a problem unique to this game, but it was rampant within it. \n\nAnd of course there were the psychic puzzles where the only way you knew what to do was die and time travel. (See if that supports your weight. It didn't? You're dead? Well, good thing you can relive that moment.) Again, this wasn't the only game to do things like this (Sierra was notorious for it), but when the rest of the game is lackluster, things like this just add to the aggravation. \n\nAfter finishing the game and seeing the arguably anticlimactic ending, I was amazed that this went on to have a half dozen more sequels. (Though I've started into the next installment, and it's light-years ahead of this one in every way and will probably get a thumbs up from me.) My advice is to skip this one and go to the next in the series.", "timestamp_updated": 1418706562, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418706335, "votes_down": 22}, {"recommendationid": "10604143", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460307", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403611581, "steamid": "76561198035375228", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 4, "review": " I couldnt put my fedora on so im a shitty detective\n11/10", "timestamp_updated": 1403341828, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403341828, "votes_down": 26}, {"recommendationid": "24092312", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435520", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1467664611, "steamid": "76561198006875525", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "In my view, this game is barely playable due to the outdated graphics.
