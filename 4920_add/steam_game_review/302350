Under a Killing Moon made quite a racket at the time, being one of the first games that used FMV, and not just for cut-scenes but also in-game, and for being so unprecedently huge (it shipped on 4 CDs). This was cutting edge stuff back then, when some games were still shipped on several floppy disks... And than this mammoth came!\n\nAnyway, technologies aside the game turned out to be really interesting and clever. I spent lots of days and nights playing it (I was 14 and had zero experience in computer adventure games at the time) but in the end I made it, although I used hints several times. I've been hooked on point-n-click adventure games ever since.\n\nFrankly, I bought this game several days ago more out of nostalgia than anything else. I thought I would play an hour or so, remember the good ol' days, so to speak, and be on my way. Well, what do you know, I spent the night playing it and I'm now roughly half-way through, fully intended on finishing it. \n\nMy next step would probably be Tex Murphy: The Pandora Directive, which I haven't played at the time of its release due to some compatibility issues.
