It's got clunky controls, and graphics fighting against Namco Museum on my PS1. But it's got one thing that not even modern games have. An immersive story. After about 10 minutes of figuring out the controlls, I was hooked again. I was too young to be able to get past the first few puzzels in 97, but now I can fully understand the complexity of the story and the true power an adventure game has in story telling. \n\nIt's a gripping narrative which is not only brooding but overlayed of two seemingly not-crossible genres, noire and science fiction. It gives you exactly what you ask for out of the crossing between the two, and does not dissapoint. Characters, albeit primitive in design, are complex. Characters change when connecting plot points together, something that video games as a whole have not been able to since preserve, which is a major tennant of any American film. It features both conspiracies and science in the same breath, and does not overstep the boundraies of which the game lays. It is firmly rooted and knows what it wants to deliver in terms of story, and does so devistatingly well.\n\nIt's never a race of who has the better graphics, but who can convey the best story, and Tex Murphy is top gun in my book.", "timestamp_updated": 1402985413, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1402985413, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "20580917", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515093", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1402696565, "steamid": "76561197996662419", "num_games_owned": 5795, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "This is the best adventure game ever.
