It's not a terrible game, but it's not great either. The gameplay consists of using a grappling hook (really just a red line) to swing around in arcing trajectories in order to collide with some red bars. The levels consist of some randomly-placed grey boxes to which are attached red bars. The more bars you collide with (while avoiding collisions with the grey boxes), the higher your score. That's. . . basically the whole game. Pressing \"enter\" allows you to skip to the next level, but as far as I can tell all of the levels are pretty much exactly the same. Just randomly-placed boxes. There doesn't seem to be a clear objective to the game either, aside from simply getting a high score. There is no endgame as far as I can tell.\n\nHonestly, this looks like a simple proof-of-concept prototype that could have been made in Unity in an afternoon. There's hardly any content and the gameplay gets boring after a few minutes. A point in the game's favour is that it's free, so I can't really complain about the price. If you're curious, you might as well download it and try it out for yourself.
