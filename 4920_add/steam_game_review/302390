I like this game.\n\n(optional let's play footage)\nhttp://youtu.be/tOe1b9xBr5g\nOkay it is from 2001. But for a game that old I was really surprised by the presentation. It uses 2D images which appear to have been pre-rendered in 3D. I thought scenes would comprise of 2D landscape environments with 3D character and objects rendered over them. But the game is actually played from a first person perspective. You don't navigate a 3D environment like a modern (or even an old one) FPS. You move from one location to another i.e. different places in a room or the town and have different 2D panoramic views at each location. It's basically works like google earth street view where you can look all around from specific point. I guess this was the developers way of implementing the game that would run on the typical sytems that were available at the time. I'm not saying it's the best looking thing ever but I was impressed, I was expecting a lot worse. Yes the game runs in only 640 by 480 resolution so it's a pretty pixely. That didn't actually bother me But I've been playing games for over 20 years now haha. And you might think that some of the locations look pretty drab i.e. a town full of ugly brown wooden shacks and mud but it's typical of anything based on Lovecraft. I didn't mind the sound effects either, I like the creaking you could hear in your home while you were alone. The voice acting is mixed, some I felt was good other examples a bit lame but that just made it more amusing lol. It also has the occasional animated cut scene e.g. when you answer the door and speak to a visitor or approach a person on the street.\n\nYou can interact with certain objects and individuals you come across as well as picking up inventory items. Theres no tutorial or tips so you just have figure how to do things yourself. There's no journal or log to refer to for important information you have found or what your current objective is. There is no autosave, I think need to manually save using the menu.\n\nNot surprisingly being such an old game it has a few little issues. Not that these stopped enjoying it, but here are some of them. You need to wave the cursor around around the in order find things that you are able to interact with because unless it's really obvious there is no indication. The way you interact with you inventory actually and actually use items is a bit unclear. If you are able to take use an item seems to be completely situational. But it's doesn't prompt when you can't use an object when click on it in your inventory instead just exits your inventory. I found that if you are in the right the item will on appear on your cursor if you click on it in your inventory. Next you probably really need to be paying attention to dialogue and remember what is said in conversations so that you know what to do next. Otherwise you find yourself a bit lost. I was knocking on every door in town and wondering why the hell I was doing that lol. Unfortunately I hadn't saved the game before I died so without an autosave I lost progress. So yeah, save your game.\n\nI love Lovecraft and this is better than I thought it would be so far. The 2D panoramic view was a pleasant surprise. I think there would be plenty of people who might enjoy this especially if they like Lovecraft stuff as well.\n\nClick [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SatanovichZ1/videos]here[/url] for more let\u2019s play videos =)", "timestamp_updated": 1405395191, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "11", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405138146, "votes_down": 44}, {"recommendationid": "19101958", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568778", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1447615683, "steamid": "76561198139328230", "num_games_owned": 1770, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I am genuinely baffled by my conflicting feelings over this \"Lovecraftian\" adventure game. Okay, [i]Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness[/i] is nothing miraculous. It's old, it's clunky, full of bugs with irritable animations... yet still manages to set an eerie enough atmosphere to drive your perception skills to its limits. For that account only, it is not possible to recommend this game to anyone. Even if one is to set aside the fact that the game is raddled with bugs, it would still be an acquired taste forced down your throat.\n\nIt's year 1927 in rickety village of Pawtuxet, Rhode Island. A silent afternoon is abruptly interrupted for young William Stanton by his friend, Edgar Wycherley. Edgar seems off, panicked and fearful. He entrusts William an odd pyramid shaped relic and asks for him to protect it, even from Edgar himself at all costs. Then, Edgar takes off as oddly as he appeared before William's door. Minutes later, Doctor Egleton, Wycherley's family doctor visits William to inform that Edgar hasn't been himself lately, consumed by his studies of archeology and asks William to inform him immediately if Edgar is to be contacted. After these strange visits, William decides to visit Edgar himself and learn more about these \"studies\" of Edgar's in hopes of aiding his friend. That's how young and avid William Stanton gets himself into an interplanar mess centering a quite specific book of occult: Necronomicon.\n\nSo far, so good. The story is interesting to begin with, weaved with mummies, strange disappearances, long deceased ancestors, sigils and summoning of spirits. Yet is the presentation of the story fulfilling and satisfying as the game progresses? That, I'd like to vote as abstaining. There is a great amount of lore thrown around for us to monitor and take note, but they are not processed as elegantly as possible in my opinion. Anecdotes keep coming to us without any time for us to digest any kind of on-goings. On that part, it is bad construction for a story revelation.\n\nThe game hailing from 2001, graphics are nothing extraordinary, a bit clucky and plastic even for character models. Aside oddly shaped characters, the basic environment presents a creepy yet dull atmosphere suitable for any gothic setting, yet it doesn't actually deliver the Lovecraftian elegance that one would be waiting. Voice acting is neat, with accents of the original time period, but without the option of a subtitle, and much information for you to pursue hidden in cinematic dialogues - without an option to record spoken information in game - ends up being a complete obstacle for progression. You have to play this game with pen and paper + earphones if you'd like to make something out of the story.\n\nWe are already used to the linear gameplay for an adventure game, but [i]Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness[/i] takes this part a bit more seriously than it should. One of the main problems for this game, if you ask me, is that you are expected to complete one solemn action at a time, and unless you discover and accomplish that specific action, nothing progresses. You are allowed to explore on your own; it just won't do any good. That's why everything turns into an \"action hunt\" on a wide map for you to figure out quickly.\n\nPuzzles are another issue altogether. They are quite obscure even with the collectible information, asking you to run through a series of spiritual and occult references - most of them are authentic, by the way: kudos on that part - to figure out your next step. They are never easy and demand that you take notes in every step of your game. I'd love that if the lore that we use for puzzles would be at least somewhat relevant to the plotline that we are pursuing... It is mostly not. Oh, and remember \"Old Ones\" concept that we were so excited about, because, I don't know, this is a LOVECRAFTIAN game? It really doesn't deliver at all.\n\nCombined with a series of common bugs that would make the game impossible to finish without an exe. copy of an old retail cd - it is possible to reach one in the guide section of community - [i]Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness[/i] ends up being a lame adventure game with some cool references thrown around. If you are a fan of Lovecraftian literature, sure, you can try. But even then, I'd doubt that you'd enjoy it much. I tried so hard to like this game but even as a Lovecraft fan myself, I sadly did not.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_updated": 1483914936, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447618713, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "11207086", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 59, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543002", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405250343, "steamid": "76561198025674603", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Totally Borked!\n\nThis version seems to be missing cutscenes and some puzzles from back when it was on PS1\n\nAnd I have encountered a game-breaking bug that will not let me continue!\n\nNot impressed!!!", "timestamp_updated": 1405205368, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405205368, "votes_down": 24}, {"recommendationid": "12420876", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535671", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1412849821, "steamid": "76561197979793243", "num_games_owned": 520, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "What could have been a fun, notalgic release on steam is unfortunately hampered by some serious issues.

I do think it's important to note this.\n\nThat being said, the game is incompletable. As others has said there is a massive, leathal bug. A very large, and important cutscene, one that shapes the entire game, and gives the player direction in what to do next (as well as a huge part of the story, and reward for completing the puzzle which came before it) is missing. Also inventory issues, and not being able to access some items leaves the game incompletable from very close to the end.\n\nI do understand that meridian have offered their 'solution' which is to download a save game - which means still missing out on that long cutscene, as well as not completing a puzzle. Now that is no solution at all, it's basically a 'level skip cheat' It seems to be as though the developers really do not care about fixing this for the players.\n\nIt's an honest shame, because while the game is enjoyable - I would really not recommend anyone buying it.

The game play  issues with the game are the problems towards the end where you cannot get an important piece from an alchemist set you find earlier in the game; it is EXTREMELY frustrating. Also it is point and click game with short cut aways. However with that said, I think people are being too hard on the game.

It is not especially violent or typical of most games that are popular right now, slow and lots of reading/puzzles but with a very well done creepy feel.
