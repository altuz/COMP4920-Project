Gameplay mechanics are overall clunky, the graphics are not there, and the progression is one dimensional.\n\nHere is a bit more depth to the review into the only 3 game modes included in the game:\n\n- Manage game mode: This is where you set up and expand your company. This could have been a great system if there was more interaction than just pressing buy on a skill or item until you run out of cash. That is as much dept as this has.\n\n- Control mode: It is basically a top down click the icon game. An assistance call comes in, you grab the nearest available car and click on the call location. Over and over, and over, ad nauseum. Extremely frustrating that there is absolutely no onboarding for any of the mechanics either. All of a sudden the month ends and you find out you did a poor job, just because the tow trucks you are sending out don't change tires... oh I had to sent out just a basic car? doesn't make sense that the guy on the tow truck can't help, doesn't it?\n\n- Missions mode: This one is the one you get pitched more but its as shallow as a dinner plate. New missions are only unlocked after grinding quite a bit on control mode. Given, the portrayal of the NPC's are something I can completely see happening in real life. Unfortunately the controls are clunky, clicking does not always respond to your input. You get random cars ghosting through the player, etc. To make things even more disappointing is that as soon as you do the mission once, you can do it with your eyes closed the next time. They repeat down to the last detail so there is absolutely no challenge.\n\nIn conclusion I would give this game a pass. Wait for a sale or something as its not even worth the launch prize. I did get some entertainment out of it but, honestly, had I known I would have played something else.\n\nGraphics 6/10\nGameplay 3/10\nReplayabilty 1/10\n\n3/10 overall score", "timestamp_updated": 1411778555, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411778555, "votes_down": 11}, {"recommendationid": "12277604", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 38, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550101", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1411914585, "steamid": "76561197968763596", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I agree with the other reviewer when they say, \"..this should be called DISPATCH SIMULATOR.\"  The \"missions\" where you diagnose the car hands-on are only about every-now-and-then.
