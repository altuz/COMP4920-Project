You play a mage that is in charge of multiple unit squads and also pocesses the ability to cast spells. Both spells, character stats and units can be upgraded with experience gained through killing monster.\n\n[b] Gameplay & Story: 2/10 [/b]\nThe story is seperated into multiple campaigns that are played seperatly. Each campaign is divided through multiple missions that each have different objectives. The missions dont have any serious connection to each other besides the global story of the campaign that you are following. It is quite simple - you are a mage apprentice and receive a quest from your master to become a real mage to be able to save your kingdom and crush your enemies afterwards. The quests during the missions are always connected to killing a monster, so there is not much diversity there. \n\n[b] Combat & Challenge : 2/10 [/b]\nRarely seen such a boring combat as in Battle Mages - you right-click with your units on an enemy and use 1-2 spells available. You wait for cooldowns or till the battle is finished. Rinse and repeat. Once your units gathered enough experience and you have the gold, upgrade the units to progress further and repeat whole battle process with further enemies.\n\n[b] Graphic & Interface : 3/10 [/b]\nThe graphic is understandably dated (2003), there are really few points in the game where you will find details terrain or objects. The rest of the game is simply divided by colours - the grass is green, the rocks and wood are brown, etc. There are no real effects when the units are fighting each other, the spells are mostly just a small flash or a certain colour. The interface felt well structure, but sadly also with low amount of feedback. You dont really know what you would be leveling up in the character window until you press on it and find out.\n\n[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 3/10 [/b]\nThe progress is as in other games where a campaign is divided by different non-connected missions really simple. You focus on the objective of the mission and once you finished all the objectives you will continue to the next mission. Sadly, most missions take their time simply because it takes a while for your units to get from point A to point B, even if speeding up the game mechanics. Since there are no other activities than moving units, fighting and moving units again, the progress deserves a terrible rating for this topic.\n\n[b] Audio & Immersion : 3/10 [/b]\nThe music was most of the time a classic piano playing in the background. It did not feel any immersive or intrusive, so another game not using the potencial of immersive sound and fitting music. The battle and spell sounds were also on a low level, just to show the units are busy fighting. Due to the story break into missions and no graphical details during the missions, there was no feel of an immersion at all.\n\n[b] Side-Notes [/b]\n[list]\n[*]This game is single player only.\n[*]This game contains no achievements, neither in steam nor ingame.\n[*]This game has steam cards to collect.\n[*]This game offers medium replayability since you can try out different characters/factions and try their campaign.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Summary [/b]\nBattle Mages is not only simple, but also unpolished and quite aged strategy game. Possibly in 2003/2004 it might have received positive ratings, but in my opinion even then there were much better alternatives, making Battle Mages simply a waste of time. The missions are not fun to finish, so the story and overall gameplay falls apart since you dont really have fun progressing the objectives to finish the campaign. Unless you are an absolute fan of old slow and unpolished RTS, I would suggest you move on.\n\n\nI hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game.

Too many issues with mechanics, gameplay and AI. \n\nI can see how this could had been an awesome game back in the day. It is too dated to be really worth sinking so many hours into, would take a lot of patience to escort squads through all the small scenarios, micromanage them and deal with the AI issues. You need to be very finnicky with your mouse to get the AI to respond and often you need to spam click for them to constantly repath for best route and adjust to moving circumstances of battlefield. Best just move along to something more modern.\n\nKind of a Real Time Strategy version of something like Age of Wonders. You get your warlock that is off map and your units which you have to guide through a linear-like progression, get loots, do quests, kill monsters, go to town. Minimap is beautiful and makes navigation fairly easy. Everything is instance-based real with with a fully fledged campaign. Controls obey standard real time strategy standards and camera is fluid. Pathfinding is extremely dumb and units get stuck on each other constantly. This is somewhat made up for by the mage abilities which have more of an opportunity to play out when yours and the foes artificial intelligence just bottleneck together somewhere. However there was no music whatsoever playing out and the audio felt empty. Much like the visuals which despite being acceptable were not very immersive.", "timestamp_updated": 1503990089, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503989894, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 22}}
