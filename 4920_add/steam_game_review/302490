Ballad of Solar is an epic of a pampered prince who is trying to save his girl from the evil's of a wizard. The gameplay consists of 2 or 3 maps per level. Each map is a static board that has roads leading to objectives. Each objective is blocked by trees and rocks and holes. You need to manage resources to preform the task of clearing each object. More simply put, you click stuff on the map to clear it, then you move on to the next map. It's nearly imposible to lose a level, the storyline is all but annoying, and the voice acting is horrendous. However, the game has just enough fun to keep you ocupied. I am an achievement hound; I don't normally play games unless there's some achievements to unlock. I played this game to the end despite that fact.

It's labelled as a strategy game, but really there is little in the way of strategy here. \n\nIn a nut shell, you travel from one level to the next. Each level has different goals to reach; once you've reached those goals you move on to the next level. \n\n[b]Long Review[/b]\n\n     [i]Story[/i]: An evil sorceror has overthrown the kingdom and taken the princess captive. It's up to Solar (the princess's fiance) to restore the kingdom to its former glory and save the princess. \n\n     [i]Graphics[/i]: Each character is drawn really well in this game, with loads of personality attached to them. \n\n     [i]Music/Sounds[/i]: The music and sound effects are pretty good, though the voice acting is hilariously terrible. I'd almost recommend the game just because of the horrible voice acting (it's a great source of laughs), but I won't.\n    \n     [i]Length[/i]: I've played this game for just over two hours and have reached level 19 in that length of time. It should be apparent that this is an extremely easy game, based on this information. However, I do not know how many levels there are in the game as I can not finish it due to a bug which keeps me from moving on to level 20. \n\n     [i]Replayability[/i]: Each level is scored by giving you stars. If you're a perfectionist (and aren't hit by the bug I've run into), then the game is replayable only to get full stars for each level. Other than that, it really isn't worth replaying.\n\nIf it wasn't for the bug I managed to find, I would recommend this game to those of you who enjoy casual games. Because of this bug however, I'm going to have to give this game a thumbs down. \n\nIf you want to take your chances, then wait until the game is at an extremely cheap price. \n", "timestamp_updated": 1417982821, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417982821, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "28431185", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517155", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1481998635, "steamid": "76561198058127760", "num_games_owned": 939, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "In the casual time management space, it is hard to be noticed. Games and series seemingly pop into stores at a moment notice, fully realised and ready to be enjoyed by a public who cannot get enough. Whole websites are devoted to these click based games, where the management of resources against a timer will provide a form of accomplishment which is only slightly belittling. For as much as they bring new gamers to the fold, time management games, at their very essence, are a little insulting as they demand so very little from the player. Rising above this is a balance between providing enough feedback and interaction for the player but to not overwhelm the casual audience that this genre naturally attracts. In this case, I believe Ballad of Solar has done a remarkable job.\n\nIt helps that the game is very pleasing to the eye. I was surprised at the quality of the art and the animation, which was a little more ambitious than a game at this price point and genre have any right to be. From the set up and dismantlement of the tent for each level, to the conversations the characters have, even the movement of the workers you control to do your Prince\u2019s bidding, graphically the game is really attractive. It has a charming clich\u00e9 atmosphere that brings to mind all the great fairytales of yore but spins it with some fun character designs and interesting companions.\n\nIn addition, the voice acting was really well done, with some great lines and actors who have really brought these characters to life. From the knight in shining armour to the hearty blacksmith and the giant oaf, these characters are fun caricatures of fairytale tropes exaggerated with a natural belief that you can\u2019t help but go along with the ride. The dulcet tones of the Prince match sharp wit with the wizened Wizard and the oafish giant, who bring a lot of humour and character to their roles.\n\nNaturally, it is a clich\u00e9\u2019 story of a Kingdom falling to ruin and a Prince who is on a quest to vanquish evil and save the damsel in distress, but this works to the games favour with a certain silliness that is endearing. The Big Bad has ousted you from your former Kingdom and you fall in with a cadre of companions who will help you along your way, each of whom it must be said, is more engaging than the last.\n\nThe 30 levels will only provide even the most patient of gamers a few hours to complete, which is just enough time to get to know these characters and this story before it becomes to pretentious. Each level is split into several sub levels, and surprisingly, these sub-levels scroll to a new screen, a new and welcome effect. Snippets of conversation and the various posturing of the Big Bad and the Prince add a little flavour and make investing your time rewarding.\n\nThe music is pleasing if ultimately forgettable. The main theme is repetitive and a little disarming and would be better if it punched through the quality of the effects and voice acting. As it is, it\u2019s probably the weakest element of Ballad of Solar.\nThere isn\u2019t much in the way of challenge, and replayability is non-existent. But with that said, there\u2019s hardly anything to fault with Ballad of Solar. It\u2019s a fun time management game with above average visuals and sound that caters well to the crowd that will appreciate its me-too nuance. Well worth taking the journey.\n\n7.5/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1482000565, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1482000565, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "20231666", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511378", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451768743, "steamid": "76561197969752619", "num_games_owned": 4717, "num_reviews": 211, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Casual time management/strategy game.\nNot quite as polished as the \"12 Labours of Hercules\" series, but still a fun little time waster.", "timestamp_updated": 1451769104, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451769104, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "19131620", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504649", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1447840651, "steamid": "76561198066577948", "num_games_owned": 1771, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Basically, clicking simulator.

Easy on the eyes and ears. Unquestionably worth sale price.\n\nFull review: Cute. Simple. Amusing. Very high quality production values: zero bugs, high quality art (if a bit cliched, the iron jawed male hero and impossibly thin female characters are a bit much) varying from merely competent to lush and lovely. The music is nothing spectacular, but fits the scenery and mood properly and isn't intrusive or boring. I happily let it play on through the whole game without becoming annoyed.\n\nI played the game through in a single evening on the lower difficulty \"Adventure Mode\" setting (several of the eight hours Steam recorded were where I walked away from the game for dinner and chatter with roommates), and found it exactly what I was looking for in terms of difficultly and engagement for a stress free evening. Every two or three levels, I screwed up the initial run through enough to restart, either part way through, or after finishing and being awarded a \"Silver\" star. Obtaining the desired \"Gold\" star required paying enough attention to what I was doing that I remained throughly immersed. This is definitely a \"casual\" game (at least in \"Adventure\" mode), suitable for youngun's or folks looking for to while away a few relaxed hours. The story, which is, yes, cheesy as heck, unfolds neatly as you go along, each level taking no more than a few minutes and leading neatly into the  next and the one after that.\n\nIf you're \"hardcore\" or in the mood for a \"serious\" challenge leading to the occassional frustrated outburst, this isn't the game for you. I beat every level at the \"Gold\" star rank on my first or second try (although there were a couple of close calls with the latter).

It is NOT click everything in sight - you do need some planning to get the gold stars.\n\n2. It does NOT require super speed reactions/clicks - there is a reasonable rhythm to the play, that is very pleasent. \n\n3. The game play doesn't seem to get harder, simply variations on different idea themes.  It is very nice to just play the game and not be continually challenged. \n\nIt is a CASUAL game (not really for hard-core) and suitable for anyone just wanting to relax and have fun.
