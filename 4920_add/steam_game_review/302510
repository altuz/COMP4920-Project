It's very fluid, dynamic, have great executions and slowmo. Most of the time in game (all) you spend slashing enemies in beautiful locations like Rome, forest or deep forest which is exactly what I expected. What I didn't expect is actually great story. Voice of main character is also very nice, nice enough for me to mention it. DID I SAY THAT COMBAT SYSTEM IS AWESOME?\n\n~~~\nGame features also some upgrade systems but it don't bring much, just more health or more and faster anything. No gear upgrade or smth like that. Boss fights are OK (with Budica) and one (with forest \"monster\") is well, boring. Just keep doing same all the time. Gets somewhat challenging on Legendary level, but only a little (and only with Budica)\n\n---\nWhat I didn't like about this game is it's the fact you can't play it on max difficulty straight away. You need to play it on hard and PLEASE DON'T PLAY ANY LOWER (it won't be challaging AT ALL) and then start on Legendar difficulty, because you keep all the upgrades (health and stuff) from hard. Game is good enough to repeat it straight away tho which i did.\nSome may complain about fact that it is somewhat short - 5h for completing, but i wouldn't expect something more from such linear game.", "timestamp_updated": 1506369823, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506369766, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34920812", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505383531, "steamid": "76561198105588760", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Awesome game", "timestamp_updated": 1505313708, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505313708, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34855778", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499368", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504982053, "steamid": "76561198005020636", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Strange controls and very closeup perspective makes this game unplayable, atleast for me.", "timestamp_updated": 1505029949, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505029949, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35054075", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495660", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505624283, "steamid": "76561197999238882", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fast PC + high refresh rate monitor = baaarf.\n\nWatch out if you get motion sickness.
