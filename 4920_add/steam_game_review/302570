No.\n\nEdited for additional info: before you say that maybe it was intended with playing a controller, all a controller can apparently do is turn the ship and use the afterburner. Maybe jump as well. It doesn't work when you're inside a station where it requires something to press its buttions. You NEED a mouse or a touchscreen monitor to play effectively or at all.\n\nThe map in the game is very...simplistic. That's the kindest description I can give it. Last I saw, it was as if it was drawn with bright red and green crayons.\n\nIf you ask why you need the mouse for manual combat, well there's the fact that there's a button for the unguided lasers that you must click once for it to auto-fire. That's right, auto-fire. Which drains your energy bar that also supplies power to your shields and auto-repair systems if you get damaged, which by the way, can have thresholds on how much you can heal and such. If not for the tutorial repair, I would have been dead already in my first fight.\n\nYou also need the mouse to turn efficently at the same time as doing it by keyboard is kind of slow and unresponsive and it feels awkward holding a controller with one hand and a mouse in the other to do it. Think about that. No way to effectively dodge in combat normally, if there was any ability to dodge at all let alone aim the manual auto-fire unguided laser, so you must use the auto-combat system to get things done.\n\nAuto combat? It's where you first target an enemy ship, click on a button twice that makes it automatically use whatever turrents and missles you have so you watch and do nothing as either you or the enemy ship dies. You may have to then manually change the enemy and turn it back on again.\n\nEither the developers are pulling a bad prank with shoving the IOS/Android in here as I deleted the game and re-download the game to check and the size was 556MB (Not something that required 2GB of harddrive space that was listed) or this is the real thing.\n\nSeriously, This is not a good choice to buy, let alone try to play at the moment. Until they fix such things, I can't seriously recommend playing this if you enjoy the space genre. I'll hopefully check back in a month or two, but by then I'll probably play some other game worth my time and effort in.", "timestamp_updated": 1418846783, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "21", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418810285, "votes_down": 100}, {"recommendationid": "14659985", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 50, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510672", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1425381567, "steamid": "76561198067063429", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 8, "review": "This game is definitely underrated.\n\n+ Great open world gameplay with lots of sidequests & stuff to do \n+ Many customization possibilities (which actually make a difference) for Ships \n+ Really nice soundtrack\n\n- Controls take some time to get used to\n- Translations are bad", "timestamp_updated": 1424949063, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424949063, "votes_down": 37}, {"recommendationid": "14058264", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 137, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484204", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1422924376, "steamid": "76561197981587362", "num_games_owned": 1124, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 22, "review": "Not a bad game.  It's been out for years and finally arrived on steam.  It's a shame Elite moved their release date up to match this game....not sure why they'd have done that.\n\nNot as pretty of some of the newer games but a solid story and enjoyable gameplay.\n\nPeople will have to ignore the majority of reviews though.  The majority were posted by people who didn't take 5 seconds to get the facts.  For example they think this game was developed after Elite when the fact is Dangerous was released with that name over a year before Elite was even in the 'Being thought of stage'  But fanboys never look at facts.  No this isn't a Elite Dangerous cloan, nor is it an attempt to market off that game...in fact if you only went by the true facts then it's the other way around...if you base your findings using the same scale as most of the other reviewers.\n\nNow more about the game.  You can in fact fly planetside which is nice, the devs have talked about adding new planetside content later.  Controls are simple but at times a little painful and I wish combat allowed a more hands on approach.\n\nI'm still playing the game and I'll edit my review to add more information as I get deeper into it.  But I felt the need to call out the majority of negative reviewers that only posted because they have no real idea what they are walking about.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdated after a few more hours.  I'll admit I enjoy a more first person view but RTS type games can be fun.  I will say that there are things the Dev could have done to make this a little easier.  The game can be a pain during the first hour or so until you really get into the controls.  I also think the 'Tutorial' is a tad slow.  Usable and it works but the pace is a little slower than I'd like.  Also I've learned that the game leans on automatic for the most part.  You will not find yourself driving the fights that much, mostly clicking on one of the 'Automatic' options and just watching.  While that's normal for a true RTS this isn't that and it tends to make things too easy.
