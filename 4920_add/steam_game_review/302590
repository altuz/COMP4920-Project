Anyways its a very good game, I could go on about the gameplay and shit, but its FREE, try it yourself (Or watch the trailer).\n\nThe only big issue with this game is that it takes ages for a new update to come out, but its not really anyones fault since this game only has 2 developers. Worth a try, I'd do it..(P.S. all classes in this game are attainable by leveling up)", "timestamp_updated": 1505455615, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505455615, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 214, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 44, "total_reviews": 258}}
