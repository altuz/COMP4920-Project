Because of the simplicity the levels dont differ too much, but that can be a good thing. You could play it to try and beat your records seriously but at this price range its a simple, chilled, entertaining game. Nothing that you would play for long periods of time, so buy it expecting a little satisfaction.\n  You get what you pay for and everything runs smoothly, rather enjoyable.", "timestamp_updated": 1505051036, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505051036, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 612, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 42, "total_reviews": 654}}
