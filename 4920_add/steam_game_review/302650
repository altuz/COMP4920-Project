It was developed by the Ukrainian studio Room 8 and succeeds admirably in what it sets out to do: to provide no-nonsense, casual gameplay. The core gameplay is built around a more than decent physics engine that allows for puzzles of gradually increasing difficulty. By carefully adding new gameplay elements, the developers kept my interest for quite some time, and the above average, colourful graphics help a lot to provide quite some hours of carefree entertainment.\n\nThere is even a story behind it all: you play as Cyto, who has lost his/her memory and needs to collect snippets of memory during a voyage through space and several worlds/universes. By collecting these snippets, more and more levels and worlds are unlocked, as are parts of the - basic - storyline. In some ways, Cyto reminded me of World of Goo: there too, one basic but flexible physics-element provided some quite interesting challanges. Cyto is generally less hardcore and more forgiving: the puzzles get seldomly really difficult, and there is always the option to skip a certain level. This grants the game a more casual character, as does the relaxing and very appropriate music.\n\nMission accomplished - Cyto comes with Steam trading cards, but misses achievements which could have been easily implemented into this kind of game.\n\nOverall score: 8/10", "timestamp_updated": 1422540430, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422540430, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "11177021", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509868", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405051900, "steamid": "76561198032161980", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "First impressions:\n\nI've played for 15-20 minutes so far. I stopped to have lunch =)\n\n(optional let's play footage - coming soon)\nhttp://youtu.be/j3FJsfJlE7A\nThe game looks nice. The movement of fluid bags (first way I could think of describing them lol) of your character and objects looks good. I like the music, sound effects and the facial expressions that little Cyto makes.\n\nI guess you could call it a problem solving game, how do you reach all the pickups while avoiding hazards and getting to the exit. You have various methods of navigating the environment with Cyto. Launching, slingshotting, climbing, stretching out or just dropping down.\n\nIt's very easy to learn to play. I don't think I even saw a main menu, the just begins from level one and provides visual tutorials as you go. Just use the mouse and one button.\n\nI would recommend this game for anyone looking for a simple puzzle game of this type.\n\nClick [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SatanovichZ1/videos]here[/url] for more let\u2019s play videos =)", "timestamp_updated": 1405072863, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405050248, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "13214101", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508025", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1485970964, "steamid": "76561198135601646", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I bought this game to support Ukrainian developers, but mostly because the whole atmosphere of this game seemed interesting and the soundtrack that I heard in the video attracted my attention as well.
