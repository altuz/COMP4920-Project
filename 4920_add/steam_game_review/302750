There is also a free play mode where you can jack the difficulty way up that is quite mind bending as well. \n\nThis game is highly recommended if you like numbers puzzles and/or have kids who need to practice good math skills.

The design is splendid; the art, the music, and gameplay are all kid friendly. For instance, some of the built-in mechanics will even gently guide younger children to the answers if they become stuck.\n\nThere are a myriad of ways to clearing the monsters though. You can add spells together, and chain monsters together in various ways. You're also given potions with varying effects as you progress through the game, so there's a lot of creativity in how you beat each level. That creative freedom is what really gets me addicted. My favorite thing to do is take big risks, and let the monsters stack up a bit. Then unleash all the potions, and big spells in an attempt to get 'full clears'.  : )\n\nStory mode itself has numerous levels to progress through, and while you can revisit them at any time; there's also 'free play' mode with scaling difficulties. Oh, and each level is generated on the fly; so there's never any sequence to memorize.
