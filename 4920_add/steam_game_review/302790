If you wish, however, you can spend the $2 to get this game.\n\nI got Momodora III because I was very interested in getting Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight and I wanted to try out this game first. While I am still interested in getting Reverie Under the Moonlight and I DO recommend this game, it didn't feel like anything that spectacular at times.\n\n[b]Combat:[/b] The combat is very basic and apart from spamming your melee attack or shooting a few ranged attacks, there's not much you can do in terms of combat.\n[b]Characters:[/b] The characters weren't that memorable because they are introduced very quickly and are rather rushed. The story isn't a key part of this game, however, so that can pass.\n[b]Soundtrack:[/b] While the soundtrack to this game isn't as amazing as Shovel Knight's or Undertale's, I enjoyed it. The music was, at times, very relaxing. My favorite track was the track to the final level in [spoiler]Hell. The music makes you feel so utterly depressed and pointless. It went extremely well with the snowy and barren landscape and it really asks the question- What is Hell really like? Is it the sensation of burning with other lost souls or is it a cold, lonely landscape that you can never escape?[/spoiler]\n[b]Bosses:[/b] Most of them weren't really that interesting or engaging. The combat is very basic so it the bosses can all be defeated the same way.\n[b]Artstyle:[/b] The artstyle is extremely cute and I really love it. The enemy and NPC designs are very cute and unique and I love it. This is probably the greatest part of the game. This is probably what compels most players.\n\nAlthough I've been complaining a lot, my final complaint is about the final level. I put a spoiler notice when I talked about it before, and I'll do that again.\n\n[spoiler]The level in Hell felt kind of ruined by all the random monsters and the boss encounter before the final boss, the Goddess of Death. I felt like the level would have gotten its point across a lot better if it had been without monsters and had been the player simply walking alone through a bare landscape. I personally think it would have been better played out if the player just walks by themself through a landscape with, perhaps, dead monsters or NPCs appearing on the ground in a few select spots. When they reach the final boss, they kill them and the game ends. But, then again, this is just me being picky.[/spoiler]\n\nOkay, so... What did I enjoy about the game?\nWell, I thought the atmospheres were very nice and, like I said before, I thought the soundtrack was very relaxing. The NPCs were, while rushed in their introductions, at least likeable. The game doesn't give you a defined purpose, which is nice. You can make any predictions or guesses, which I wish more games would do sometimes. You can also occasionally find secret items, which I wish there had been more focus on. The game feels like 25% of a Metroidvania style game. The artstyle is, as I said before, wonderful. You can tell the developer obviously put a lot of time into it and that's what I admire most about the game.\n\n\nOverall...\nSure, I would recommend Momodora III. No, it's not the greatest game I've ever played, but it's worth playing and is a nice way to pass an hour or two when you're bored.\n6.5/10", "timestamp_updated": 1500998432, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500996045, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33898994", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495310", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500671009, "steamid": "76561198007868955", "num_games_owned": 1596, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "would kill an innocent owl again.\n\n[h1][b] \u272e\u272e\u272e\u272e\u00bd [/b][/h1]", "timestamp_updated": 1501399963, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501399963, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "34439913", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.372396", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504508056, "steamid": "76561198171033130", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Short game, well priced for the time. Great art and animation, very atmospheric music. Generic story, horrible gameplay.\n\n\nAs for the story, makes no sense, is not properly telegraphed to the player, no reason for it to be there really. The game is also sexist technically. Every character is female, not a single male human character. Why, probably because none of the developers were homosexual, so what pubescent wants to devote time to something that isn't a waifu candidate for them.\n\n\nOn the gameplay side.\n\nYet another two dimensional game where touching, some, enemies hurts the player. So in a game where the player can only attack with short range melee, and both the player and many enemies move quite fast, you also take full damage if you touch the enemy. Some enemies, most enemies. It's great, when half the difficulty is trying to hit a target that is running at you while you run towards it without simultaneously ever making direct contact with it.\n\nSome other random obnoxious elements include, having to skip through a bosses dialogue every time you go to fight it. Having to fight a boss then complete another area all without saving. Having it so that dying flat resets the players progress back to the last checkpoint, this including boss fights, item pick ups and mini boss fights. Having a secret alternate entrance to a boss fight, the secret entrance having multiple possible ways to get into it all but one leading to instant death. This secret entrance, when you finally get into it after over ten minutes of trial and error; and replaying the map to get back to that point, literally leads the player to a boss they will fight if they just progress two more screens ahead; these screens not even having any real threats in them anyways. \n\nWhat a pointless, stupid waste of time that was. What was the actual point developer, you made a shortcut to a boss which skips the player over a checkpoint in the process; this shortcut requiring obscene effort to use even though it handicaps the player. Whoever designed that, incompetent. Utterly incompetent. Should not be a game developer.\n\n\n\nIn general, the best way to play this game is to equip the item that heals for each kill, equip the item that increases defense and invulnerability frames; and then just rush spam everything. That's it. Not only does it work, but it is more effective then actually trying to be methodical because so many obstacles spam the player and require stupid amounts of precision and luck to counter; it's better to just ram through them with invulnerability frames while healing from the kills.\n\n\nMany enemies have very little telegraphs for their attacks, many enemies have projectiles with hyper tracking, many enemies have attacks with oversized hit-boxes. It is so overbearing, it's better to just spam through. This works, and is highly suggested, for beating the final boss as well because they are literally just all of the above in boss form.\n\nProbably the best part is the bosses. They have either one attack, or two attacks. Fighting them is literally just trial and error pattern memorization mixed with human error. Better yet, almost all of them are generic humans. Better yet, the humans are so small; the players attacking visual effect is so large, and the bosses damage recieve splash effect is so large; while attacking the boss it's almost impossible to see it. So you can't even tell when it starts attacking, which often it has little telegraph for anyways, because all the visual effects block it. Bosses also have so much health, and the player attacks so fast that mashing the button is mandatory to fight bosses. Which again, constantly keeps the fighting particle effects active which constantly obscures the actual boss besides being spammy and annoying to uphold in general.\n\n\n\nWasn't fun, at all, because the options are; play recklessly and actually progress through shear brute force, or try to be methodical and actually fight but take triple more damage because the combat system is spammy so not spamming back just leads to you getting hit a whole lot.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1503499643, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503499643, "votes_down": 70}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 305, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 37, "total_reviews": 342}}
