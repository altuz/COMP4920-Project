Here's the deal.  I just finished what there is of early access in about 2.5 hours, and I received two phone calls during my play that totalled at least 30 minutes.  What this means is that for $15 USD, you'll only be getting about two hours worth of content until more content is released as the development continues on this game through its early access period.  Please keep in mind that I bought this game on it's first day of early access launch and that there may more much more content available by the time you are reading this review.  (The early access launch date for this game was October 7, 2015)\n\nWhat this is available is plenty fun and the graphics are of a cartoony but very nice style that I like quite a bit.  There are some things I like and things I would love to see added to this game from what I've experienced so far in the first couple of hours on early access launch day...\n\nPart 2 (of 4):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUg5OTFPN38\n\nWhat I like:\n\n- Very nice graphics with smooth textures that draws you into the world.\n- Smooth animations and fluid movement controls\n- Nice story, though it does seem to be of typical RPG fashion.. the same kind of story that we've all seen and can predict 1,000 times before.  ..Still, it's a fun and well done story.\n- The combat engages you and requires much more skill and involvement then typical turn based RPG games.  This one is very action oriented and I love that!\n- The music is very peaceful and nice\n\nWhat I'd love to see:\n\n- This RPG game lacks a skill progession system at the current time and there's no way to upgrade skills or stats at any time, even after you level up it's all automatic\n- An RPG game without loot?  UGH.  No inventory?  UGH.  No cool weapons and armor and potions and junk loot to pawn at a shopkeeper in town?  Major UGH!  Please add all of this to this game please!  I want gold and loot galore!\n- No ability to select a class, profession or even change what you look like.  While this isn't a requirement, it would be nice to be able to have a few options even if they have no bearing on the story of the game.\n- Game currently on its launch day of early access is way too short!  I want more!!\n\nHere is Part 3 (of 4):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMK4TrmyoeE\n\nSo, as you can see from the lists above.. this game is easy enough to like and have fun with for what it does offer, I really just want to see so much more!  Mainly more content right now because I was enjoying it and want to see more of this story!  And I really want to able able to get loot and weapons and armor and have an inventory like any other RPG game!  Being able to upgrade skills and choose new attacks at level up etc is also something that really feels like it's missing right now.\n\nWhether or not the developers have any intention of adding anything that I want to see is unknown to me at the moment.  What I can say is that this game is nice, but until it offers more content then it current does on early access launch day (October 7, 2015), most people might want to hold off with their purchase.  I like it so far alright, but want to see more story content as well as more classic RPG loot and progression added soon.\n\nHere is Part 4 of 4:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81UNTUIQSuQ\n\n\nHere is my ratings at this point:\n\nVALUE:  15/40  This score could be so much higher if only we had more content and if there were more skills and progession like skill points and if there was loot and gear to choose from and shops to buy and sell it.  Just more content in the story to make this a 6 or 8 or 10 hour game would help my value score as well.  Right now, it's just too little for your dollar in my opinion, even though what is there now is fun.\n\nFUN:  25/30  I can't knock this important aspect of my scoring table.  This game is really fun right now, even though once you master the combat it gets a little tedious.  But isn't almost any RPG kinda like that?  I like it right now.. just wish there was more conent and depth.\n\nCONTROLS & BUGS:  20/20  For an early access game, this game plays without even a hitch.  You can change your controls layout now to whatever you prefer and it works very fluid and smoothly.\n\nGRAPHICS & SOUND: 10/10  A very nice art style and sound/music for a low budget RPG.  This one is an easy 10.\n\nTOTAL SCORE ON EARLY ACCESS LAUNCH DAY:  70% (70 out of 100)  This score will likely only go up as the development continues for this game thoughout its early access.  More content will only increase the value score which is by far the lowest score on this EA launch day.\n\n\nI hope this all helps you make a decision!", "timestamp_updated": 1444311629, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444237992, "votes_down": 20}, {"recommendationid": "20574621", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467038", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1458669994, "steamid": "76561198036145790", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I wish i've seen this before. a Zelda-like Action RPG, made in one of my favourite engines of all time.\n\nThe game \"feels\" good. It made me feel like playing Twilight Princess, but on PC.\n\nThe combat might be a little challenging at the beginning, the target system seemed kinda buggy to me and after some practice, i noticed i could handle enemies better without targeting them. It works fine when you have just one enemy left, though.\n\nAlso, i highly recommend changing your \"Evade\" key (alt) for Middle mouse button. It just feels better for some reason, i can react faster that way.\n\nThe game is fairly playable and even enjoyable even though i had a very low FPS in my computer, even with minimal settings, Maybe it's just because i have an old computer, but other source games run fine here. I wish there was an option to disable sunlights.\n\nThe enviroment is nice. I specially loved the caves and the [spoiler]grandpa puzzle area[/spoiler]. Nice work.\n\nThe characters and NPC are well made as well. Although some of their dialog artworks could be a little better. Their eyes specially.\n\nNow the game wont let me play past the [spoiler]Sword in the middle of the forest with grandpa's voice[/spoiler]. I get this error everytime:\nCUtlStreamBuffer::Close() Write (null) failed 31362 != 76695.\n\nNot sure if it's a bug or something on my computer. I'll google about it later after i'm done with some work but if anyone knows how to fix this, i'd be glad if you could tell me.\n\ntl;dr: The game is good enough to enjoy already, but still need to be worked on. If you're unsure if you should use your money on this, i suggest adding to your wishlist and following. If you do like Zelda games in other hand, i suggest getting it now.", "timestamp_updated": 1452994590, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452994503, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "28655510", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507170", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495367628, "steamid": "76561198083394973", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "WELL, just bought this game as an off chance, I Dont usually buy early access games in fear of them not ever finishing it BUT I just couldnt resist. Within the first 15mins of the game I could tell this game is HEAVILY inspired by the Super Nintendo game.. Secret Of Mana. The enemies, their attacks, music, temples, the spells you get to learn, even bosses (the water temple boss). THIS is NOT a bad thing that the game borrows from Secret Of Mana, cos that game was certainly one of the Super Nintendo's BEST action rpg games. The only main difference so far is that there's NO ring menu for item usage, the main chararcter you control dont look nothing like Randy off S.o.M, and the story is slightly different.\n\nI can see the game has a few issues it needs to still iron out for what content has been released so far but these are so minor it won't spoil your gameplay, someone needs to re-read this games english script and alter it cos things spelt wrong and sentences not making full sense are in this game, for example.. Wish spelt as Whish .. and talking to the water temple woman certainly needs reworking text wise. I'm now only just beaten the two werewolf monsters and saved the water temple princess and have stopped to write this review for the game so here are my marks so far..\n\nGraphics: 8/10 (Because of visible glitches, and the damage pop could look a lot more colorful and flash with crit hits also.)\nMusic/Sound Effects: 9/10 (I noticed a few minor jumps in the music and whilst loading areas, this though could be my laptop and not the game itself, not sure really.)\nStory: 10/10 (I'm loving it so far, makes me want to go play 'Secret Of Mana' all over again, hahaha!)\nOver All: Id certainly recommend this to my friends, in fact.. i'm just about to head on over to a facebook page thats dedicated to final fantasy and spread the word of this game to them, they are ALL Secret Of Mana fans. i'm also going to cover a mini-review on my website.\n\nSuggestions to the devs: Please dont think im making these suggestion out of spite or they are meant in any negativity against your game, it's constructive ideas for you to think about adding to your game to make it even MORE appealing, so..\n\n1. Make damage pop more flashy.. IF you take a look at 'Dawn Of Mana' on the PS2 and see how the damage pops on that, I think that type of effect would look FANTASTIC in this game of yours, look on Youtube.\n2. Get someone in to rework the English dialogue and spell check for mistakes.. Whish?\n3. Maybe introduce items menu, with potions etc.. maybe use the F-Keys, F1, F2 etc.. to use the items.\n4. have enemies drop items, like hp potions etc. by doing this it will give your game more content also, like item shops.\n5. give your game a coin currency, again for buying items in shops etc.\n6. get some side quests put into the game, with rewards like currency, items, etc. even if you only do like 3 to 5 side quests per chapter.. it adds more depth to your game and interaction with npcs.\n\nThere's probably loads more I could write here but dont want to overwhelm you, in ANY case, this is a fantastic game and look forward to MANY more updates for it.. good luck on getting this project finished.", "timestamp_updated": 1482718608, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1482718251, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "22551339", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481598", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1461195233, "steamid": "76561198007784806", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Version 0.92e review:\n\nSeems promising. It'll be interesting to see where it progresses in patches/development in the next few months, as it has been updated fairly consistently so far since being added to Steam. \n\n[u]My feelings right now[/u]\n\nPros:\n- The environments felt great and highly detailed.\n- Music was very enjoyable and fitting\n- The exploration and interaction style seemed very loyal to the Legend of Zelda style\n- Combat felt pretty fluid\n- Spell system seems like it'll be fun to use\n\nCons:\n- The strafe movement system is native to the Source engine (since it's an fps engine). This is absolutely awful for these types of exploration action RPGs. It felt incredibly awkward and slow to move, especially using a controller.\n- The enemies did not feel threatening at all.
