Even with the minimal effort the devs have actually put into this game since sticking it on steam as an unapologetic cash grab, it was still pretty fun if you had good guns and/or a good aim.\nThis is no longer the case.\nFor months, now, the game has been plagued by more hackers than I've ever seen in all the time I've played it. Around october of last year, the devs supposedly rolled out an anti-cheat system that's, according to them, resulted in the banning of thousands of hackers to date. But if anything, they've managed to increase the hacker count. It's impossible to go an entire round without at least one person joining with auto-aim or full out insta-kill.\nAt this point the message has been made clear by PiotrK, who is usually credited with the origin of the latest hack being used, and the inattentive devs who have abandoned the people of their game and given them no way to defend themselves, that Blockade should be put to rest. I hope for the sake of everyone who might come across this game in the hopes of finding an enjoyable FPS that one of two things happens:\nEither let this game die, take it off of steam, and roll around in the profit you made while letting the playerbase retain SOME level of enjoyment from this, or get your shit together and fix the game you made, show the people paying you for your game that you care about this at ALL.\nDon't play this.
