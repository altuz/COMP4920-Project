The tone and narrative are all butchered. Assets are recycled. Xbox pad detected correctly. Game looked okay-ish but thats about all it got right. \n\nStoryline does not match protag's sprite. I am supposed to be a disenfranchised king but I am playing as the grim reaper. The lore says the castle has stained glass monster attacking me but they only show up when I break the stained glass not when I try to invade which is backwards. Game has a lot of puzzles that involve guessing what the developper planned along with a lot of brute forcing by button mashing. Combat is very very floaty with yourself and the foes going through their animations in a hit and get hit affair. Slow controls make dodging difficult and the game is inconsistent in how it spawns foes sometimes allowing you to take one at a time while at other time swarming you with them. Walk animation, attack animations and jumping behavior does not feel like they were planned or designed for a sidescroll brawler or platformer. The animations are too drawn out. Assets get recycled quite a fair bit, kind of surprising to see how many background stained glass window have the exact same pattern in them, which is not good news for a game that has  the whole theme of it centered around stained glass windows. It almost feels like someone bought a castle asset pack saw the window decided to make a game around that and bought a grim reaper asset as protag and at the end could not put those two akward halves together competently through writing but decided to release it to Steam anyways. Those horrible hand drawn cutscenes do not belong in a product sold for money", "timestamp_updated": 1502126861, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502126736, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 10}}
