I will admit I got a few entertaining starts from the ridiculous jump scares (they are frequent, loud and awkward), but I did not enjoy this title. Allow me to elaborate:\n\n[u][b]Cons[/b][/u]\n[list]\n[*][u]Darkness[/u] - It is ridiculously dark at all times in the game. The light sources are laughable. While darkness is used in horror to stimulate the player and create a claustrophobic feeling, darkness is used in [i]The House[/i] to annoy you. It makes the game practically unplayable. If you are willful enough to play through it despite the darkness, you will find the most difficult obstacle is simply navigating the map. I only completed the game using a hedge-maze philosophy to walk through the house because you can only see the walls or floor if you are huddled close to them.\n[*][u]Story (or lack of it)[/u] - Probably the weakest of my points because story isn't necessarily the driving factor in a horror game, but the attempted story of this game is very poor. It explains nothing major about who you are, why you are fighting the house, and most importantly why the player should care. Next to the \"scares\" it means virtually nothing. I am okay with a horror game lacking a story, but I am not okay with a story lacking a point.\n[*][u]Honest Opinion[/u] - I love indie horror games, they are marvelous. Even when they are terrible, I can usually take something away from them because the developer(s) put so much of their heart and soul into it that it shows-or at least they were able to make a memorable experience through their efforts. This game has great potential, and could have been executed so amazingly well, but seems to have at some point fallen short. A low price tag does not make up for that. Maybe the developers are planning on revamping the game at some point, but for now they are profiting off anyone willing to buy their work that they either did not finish, or that they put up for sale when it wasn't the best they could make it.\n[/list]\n\n[u][b]Pros[/b][/u]\n[list]\n[*][u]It's Cheap[/u] - You do get what you pay for with this title. I can honestly say I didn't give them a penny more than necessary. Cheap doesn't mean a game can be bad, though. It needs to at least try.\n[*][u]Jump Scare Fest[/u] - I am not the biggest fan of jump scares-I prefer to have games scare me in a way that keeps the night light on-but there are plenty of them in this game. It can make for some good moments and fun in groups. Alas, they are frequent and non-cannon which will leave you growing tired of them eventually.\n[*][u]Unique[/u] - The house you visit stays roughly the same in design but experiences other changes as you play. You can tell a lot of work went into designing its stages-much of which goes unnoticed because of how dark it is, but I digress. If the game had gone a different direction, this would be a wonderful feature, but it is still nifty as it is.\n[/list]\n\n[u][b]In The End[/b][/u]\nI am not hard to please. I try to find good in everything I play. That is especially so with games I purchase. However, this game has very little positives in my experience. I beat the entire game and it felt like a chore. If I hadn't started it for a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PyFQGxvSJI&list=PLEfoVRiMFKL4vAJ4yP9Roq0kmTFqFmI42&index=1]YouTube Let's Play Series[/url] I would have never finished it.

When I saw the price, I had my doubts on its quality, and those doubts ended up being correct.\n\nFirst of all, the opening screen (eg when you press \"New Game\") is bugged if you have a higher resolution than 1024x768. Text disappears off the side into two black boxes. Then when the game finally started I couldn't do anything; I had to alt-tab out of the window and click back into the game for it to work properly. There are no transitions from the title menu to the game, nor from one level to another; so when the game swapped levels I thought for a minute the game had crashed. Transitions are so so so important.\n\nThe controls are not clearly explained; it took me a minute or two to realize that I had to equip my lighter before I could start using it, since I was under the assumption it would be assigned a key like \"F\". Even when you pull the lighter out from your inventory you still have to click a few times for it to \"light\". I found that to be particularly annoying. It also looks like you should be able to light up things like the lamps on the walls and the fireplace, but I've tried pressing all the controls while my lighter was out and nothing seems to work. If I'm not supposed to use my lighter on them, why does text pop up in front of them?\n\nThe game is also nonprogressible after your lighter runs out of oil if you can't find more of it. I don't know if you're supposed to find oil, but I couldn't find any from the start of the game and within five minutes I was unable to see anything. In real life, even when the lights are out in a house, your eyes will adjust to the darkness at least a little bit, so that you can make out shapes. It shouldn't be pitch black.\n\nAs for the scare factor, it definitely has an atmosphere, I'll give it that. The three jumpscares I ran into were kind of cheesy but they did startle me a little bit. But it was ruined by my frustration with the game mechanics and inability to see anything after my lighter ran out. \n\nIf you are looking for a good, short, horror game, this is not it. I would not recommend this game to anyone unless the developers address some of these issues first. It seems to me that it was really rushed and could've used a month's more worth of tuning up.", "timestamp_updated": 1404298836, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "7", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404298682, "votes_down": 21, "developer_response": "Thanks for the errors found in the game.

There is no way to progress in this game at all. When you run out of matches, candles, and light sources, which if you have even a cursory interest in exploring the levels you will, and very fast, the game is effectively over.\n\nYour options are to either memorize where the candles/matches/lamps are, or stumble around watching an entirely black screen. There is no way to see in this game without a light source, at all, so running out of light is effectively the end of the game. Turning up the brightness on your monitor does nothing, as the game's darkness is just a flat black screen with no detail whatsoever for the brightness to accentuate.\n\nThe game's titular house is HUGE, so even if you do find all the light sources through sheer trial and error and memorization, you will be forced to backtrack through areas without any new light sources and will, guaranteed, run out of light and the game will be essentially over.\n\nI have yet to get to a part with any combat, though the screenshots make it seem like there is some. I wouldn't know, I've only made it half an hour in before I simply could not find a single other light source in the whole house. And again, the game is absolutely 100% over once you run out of light, as you can see absolutely nothing but what might as well be a flat black .jpg in front of your screen.\n\nLight sources drain at around a percentage point a second, and the light pickups you find will never give you more than a handful of percentage points of increase anyways. Lighting the ambient stationary lamps, sort of like what Amnesia has with tinderboxes, is glitched and broken. Even though the lamps do turn on, they don't actually cast any light on anything, making them totally useless for actually being able to see and get around.\n\nThe opening cutscene is a laggy mess with typos galore, you can't re-bind key settings, there's no story from what I can tell, and the jump-scares may well be horrifying, but you'll never find out, as you'll never be able to see them.\n\nThis game is, no exaggeration, a black screen simulator. Don't buy this, don't even buy this as a gift. For that get Bad Rats, Desert Gunner, if you can find it Air Control. Those are bad in a funny way. This isn't funny, it isn't even a mess, it's simply rendered impossible by the developer forgetting that not everyone that plays the game is him, and as such won't be able to make a beeline for every single light source.\n\nThis game needs some manner of night vision, or at least some way to make out small details in the dark, or simply making your light sources dim once you run out of light.
