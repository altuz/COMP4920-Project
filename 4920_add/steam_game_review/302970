A lot to like in a TD game, with a lot of variety in waves, the auto-save feature in between waves so you can retry a wave if something slips through, a variety of towers to make you think about how to do it, etc.\n\nThere are some annoying things - towers turn so slowly; waves are not repeatable meaning you can just redo a wave exactly the same way & you'll get different results; fast forward seems to exacerbate this. \n\nBut then it introduces what I affectionately term \"the meatshield boss\" which invalidates any pathing / tower variety / etc you might have employed. You basically have to find and retry (or go watch some replays to get a strategy) to use a minimalist setup with your wide variety of towers so you can plunk down 10 missile towers, because nothing is going to work at all against the final 5 or so bosses except missiles.\n\nHaving to restart a level from the beginning because you can't handle the final boss is just stupid design. And only having one real weapon to combat these bosses takes away the entire point of having all these variety of towers.", "timestamp_updated": 1499929312, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499929312, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33816107", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502797", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500830115, "steamid": "76561198008743494", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a game made for a tablet and in turn doesn't run very well on a PC.  \nI would have gotten a refund and given it a no recommendation if it weren't for the awesome music and dialog.", "timestamp_updated": 1501097625, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501097625, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 31, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 40}}
