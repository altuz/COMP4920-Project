A Co-op Metroidvania style game! Almost never done before! To my dismay this game did not live up to its promise as such a game. It only took the very core-aspects of that style of game and made it real. \n\nStory:\n\nThe story follows two males who are trapped on \"Tristoy\" a prison island mean't for those who are traitors to the Iron King. They are forced to work together to secure their escape from Tristoy. \n\nFor better or for worst the story was actually quite interesting and the voice acting was absoulutely perfect! The interaction between the two main characters was hilarious. I was however disappointed at how little you get to know about the rest of the world. \n\nThis game is fairly short with me and my friend finishing it in about 2 hours so obviously it was a short story too.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay was declared to be similar to Metroidvania style but to be honest, its more akin to Trine style. You are a co-op team that must stick together to solve a variety of puzzles to progess through the levels. It is a linear progression throughout the game, I actually thought from the art in the background you would end up going down the Tower and then back up again! But this was untrue. Combat is short and is a not too in depth either.\n\nAt the beginning of the game there are a few decisions that can effect the amount of health divided amongst the two main characters. Honestly this made little to no difference considering all it allows is one character to take 1 or 2 more hits, almost every monster can 1-hit KO. \n\nThe conversational choices had NO impact on the story what so ever even though it you would presume so. I encountered many bugs within the game and especially in the end with such errors as \"[story path not found]\". \n\nHOWEVER\n\nMe and my friend did have fun even though we felt 10 quid for this unpolished game was outright robbery, if not huge kick in the teeth. I do respect though only a handful of developers were on this game in comparison to others.\n\nGraphics/sounds:\n\n\nI LOVE the art-work and the music, they suited the mood very well and gave the game its own personal feel.\n\nOverall:\n\nIf the developers had added more content, more exploration and just maybe the ability to separate into different rooms, this could of been one of the most successful games around. Already pumping out a game with no single-player can be quite a risk in doing.\n\nUnfortunately this game in its current state cannot be recommended due to it being 15 quid retail when this is something that could of probably better off benefited from being in early access. It is worth more along 5 - 8 quid in my opinion for the level of effort put into this game and the amount of bugs it has inherited.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1421406418, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421406418, "votes_down": 11}, {"recommendationid": "18691682", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505296", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1445788355, "steamid": "76561198073890731", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "What to say about this game? Well, first of all, the trailer starts with an outright ...uh ...misinformation about the lenght of the journey to expect. My friend and I finished the game in 4 hours without hurrying that much and it's a shame because it builds up the potential for a much longer adventure. \nTristoy is a pure coop game f\u00fcr two persons, preferably local because you will have to communicate a lot. This will be a turndown for many who don't have anyone to share the gaming experience with, but given the rarity of decent local coop games on PC, it was a great thing for myself. The hand drawn-looking graphics are nice and the whole setting is quite athmospheric, so is the sound design. The story and dialogs play a huge role, which is great at the beginning, but becomes turndown toward the early end of the game, where the whole drama that was built up feels cut short and the choices left to the player within the dialogs don't seem to have that much of a consequence on the turn of events. I could be wrong on that last part, though.\n\nI can recommend this game to anyone who has a couchpartner to play with; however, I really miss the button that's neither a 'yes' nor a 'no' for this one as it feels unfinished due to the shortness of the story and the lack of any other playing options than campaign mode. I purchased it at a very low bargain price and it was definitely worth it but I would have felt a bit cheaten, had I bought it at its regular price of 6,99\u20ac.\n\nNevertheless, Tristoy has enchanted me enough during its short gameplay to give a thumbs up. It's very unique in matters of style and gameplay, despite its flaws and overall shortness.", "timestamp_updated": 1445844351, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445843392, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "16980602", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513141", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1435311303, "steamid": "76561198005515853", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[h1]Short version of review:[/h1]\n After long pondering and discussions with my coop partner, I decided to [b]recommend[/b] Tristoy based on some interesting game mechanics. However, please note several things: First, Tristoy is coop-only game. For the price you get two copies of it, so you can gift one to a friend (and press him for his share later). Coop modes available are local with split-screen and online through Steamworks. I think if you start a game with one friend online then you can\u2019t continue with a different friend later. Second, the game isn\u2019t Metroidvania as advertised; it is only (decent) coop platformer. Lastly, I bought the game in a 75% sale, so you have a good chance it will run again and you can grab it cheaper. List of pros and cons follows:\n\n+ Original art style\n+ Bleak atmosphere\n+ Well-made coop\n+ \u201cDialogue between characters\u201d feature\n+ Quite hard\n+ Voice acting\n+ Bosses\n\n-  Short\n- Animations and sounds could be better\n- Rather buggy\n- Choices do not have big impact later on\n\n[h1]Long version of review:[/h1]\nAs Tristoy is a coop game, I decided to make a sort of \u201ccoop\u201d review and let my coop partner, Firaas, voice his opinions about the game. We played it each on his own computer but in the same room.\n\nStory and setting\nTristoy takes place in an island prison of the same name. The protagonists are Prince Freedan) and Steyn the Wizard Freedan is imprisoned in Tristoy and with help of Steyn he tries to escape and save Princess Freya who has been imprisoned there as well. There is also plenty of, sadly unused, story background about war, evil king and such so the atmosphere is pretty bleak.\n\nGameplay\nFreedan (played by me) and Steyn (played by Firaas) need to cooperate as each of them has unique skills. Freedan is more agile and can do a double jump and in the beginning is the only one who can fight monsters. Steyn can use \u201cgyromancy\u201d magic which turns gears (Firaas: Turns, but too slowly!) to operate machinery and in the beginning he is invincible, but can only stun enemies. Later he gets a millstone to break walls and monster heads with. The screen automatically splits if one character wanders off too far from the other. This happens even in online multiplayer (Firaas: I hated this. Often good part of the screen which we needed to see got lost in the split. Does not help performance, either).\nThe game consists of mostly linear sequence of rooms (there is a little backtracking here and there) which contain platforming puzzles and monster fights. The characters, especially Freedan, do not endure much and in our playthrough we died often. The game uses lives system. If even one of the characters dies, you lose a live and are returned to checkpoint (monsters will not respawn). Lose them all and you return to last visited savegame statue, with monsters respawned. Lives are replenished with energy gained by killing monsters and opening chests.\nUnusual (at least for a platformer) game mechanic of Tristoy is the dialogue system. At certain plot points or levels a dialogue between Freedan, Steyn and possibly somebody else is triggered and both players can input different choices that (in theory) affect the story. Truth is, the game is very short (took us about three hours to finish it, with plenty of dying and with reading most of the dialogues) and when you see \u201cXY will remember this\u201d, there is no guarantee that him recalling your action will actually fit into the span of the game and often you won\u2019t see the result of your choice.\nFor a game this short, Tristoy contains quite a number of boss fights which are great not only in quantity, but in my opinion also in quality and graphical design.\n\nGraphics, sound, controls\nI liked the overall graphical style and animations (Firaas: Myself, not so much. The characters were not very detailed and the animations were choppy.). Although the game is 2D, you can in certain parts go to a \u201clayer\u201d closer to or farther from the screen. This however leads to situations where you can\u2019t recognize if the destination of your jump is the same layer and you can fall to your death. Music was not very memorable. Weird thing with the combat is that if you hit a monster, a piano sound plays. On the other hand, the voice acting for all characters is excellent (Firaas: Except for death screams. These are horrible and annoying.). \nTristoy can be controlled by keyboard (can\u2019t be remapped, but 2 schemes are offered, 1 for each local player or either one for online players), controller (didn\u2019t try) and surprisingly also by a smart device using an app (might try later and update this review). We found the controls sluggish, especially jumping. Lots of lives were lost when one of us (usually Firaas with Steyn, who is slow and his jump is long only just about enough for most gaps) didn\u2019t perform intended jump despite pressing the key and fell to his death. I should mention that had we not been playing in the same room, we would probably think that the other one is fooling around, rage quit and never complete the game. \n\nPerformance\nTristoy runs on the Unity engine. Me and Firaas both played on our notebooks and despite Tristoy being a 2D game, we weren\u2019t able to max out the graphical settings without framerate drops. Setting one level below max ran fine, however.\nNow for the biggest flaw of Tristoy: the bugs. I already mentioned the jumping issues. Several others, partly game-breaking, happened to us during otherwise great boss fight or boss chases. At one time, you are required to run and jump over platforms that fall when you step on them. One thing is, the falling is scripted according to the faster character so if you fall behind with Steyn, it is certain death. You must let him ahead of Freedan to make it. Worse thing happened to us: once, after death, one platform didn\u2019t respawn or something and when we jumped where it should be we fell. A couple of times Freedan died after only entering this room. At different boss, we were close to deliver killing blow when I as Freedan died. To our surprise, Steyn respawned before the boss whereas Freedan at the checkpoint after it, as if the boss was killed. We missed out on part of the plot because of this. The hitboxes of certain hazards are questionable as well, but I think the game is also challenging by conventional means.\n\nMisc, verdict\nTristoy has achievements and Steam cards if you are looking for these. The achievements are also buggy though. I was awarded completely undeserved one for not dying once during the game and missed out on another which should have been awarded. I would also like to note that the achievement goals are weird in some cases: One is for dying in smelting room (How is dying an achievement, by definition of it), another is for dying 50 times in trap room (same thing, also where am I supposed to get that many lives?). Another thing is, the game is so short I got only one card drop after finishing it.\nTo sum it up, Tristoy as a game had potential but was held back by technical issues and short length. I would rate it 6 out of 10.", "timestamp_updated": 1451254941, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436556710, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "14412454", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502873", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1421557208, "steamid": "76561198044692321", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game was not a terrible game, not great but not terrible.

If you've found a few things in the other reviews that make you think you might want to purchase the game go ahead, the developers aren't bad at creating a game and I hope to see more in the upcoming future from this team.

That said, if you don't have a friend to play with, or if you prefer competitive games, Tristoy might not be up your alley. However, if you are a fan of the genre you'll find some great innovation in this game.\nTristoy may be the first game which supports a dialogue system tailored to two players. The dialogue options between the two characters can influence the story, as well as some gameplay elements. The dynamic split screen is another neat innovation to the genre, which makes splitting up and reuniting with your partner a real atmospheric event.\nThe only downside of the game is the high difficulty. The platforming aspects of the game can become quite frustrating if you are not prepared to playing the same passage multiple times.\nStill, I'd prefer that any day over a game that's too easy and beaten in a couple of hours.\nIf you are not speed-running through the game, and take your time to listen to the dialogues, I'd say you'll get at least 5 hours out of Tristoy.\n\ntl;dr\nIf you like a story-rich coop experience and can tolerate some difficult platforming, definitevly give this a go.\n8/10", "timestamp_updated": 1421951085, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421951085, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "19189127", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501651", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1448098422, "steamid": "76561198154905792", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Honestly an amazing game, albeit short.
