[i]The art, voice actors and the concept of the game are amazing, but sadly that's probably all.[/i]\nThe game itself wasn't bad, but there are several major drawbacks forcing me to disagree with all of those enthusiastic reviews. \nI could write a long text about things people already mentioned, like painfully stupid and unreasonable MC or annoying loading screens, but I will better focus on one thing that pained me the most which is the storyline.\n\nThe game gives you drastically more questions than answers, which I didn't mind at first but after finishing the game I feel just empty. Half of the routes just leads to nowhere and the endings are quite disatisfying and neglected. The most annoying thing is that the game forces you to play everything over and over and over and over again and I honestly admire people who got all of the endings without walkthroughts, I would never have the nerve to go through it more times than I had to in order to unlock the grand ending.\n\nSome of the characters have a great potential, but they just don't have enought space, the routes feel rushed and unfinished. After first few routes I stopped counting how many times I was just staring at that dark screen like \"please tell me it's not the end yet\" [spoiler] Hamelin's route was just one big joke. During the entire game I believed Hamelin will be that kind of \"fated\" partner for MC who is much more wounded than he looks like. But nope, that guy get's like 30 minutes of gameplay while both of the endings are again pretty disatisfying. On the other hand he might be the only character that really got my full attention...just to have me totally heartbroken when I got to know his route is more like a trailer for a whole TV series that is never coming. [/spoiler]\n\nIn overal I don't regret playing it, but I belive that with this potential it could be much better than this.", "timestamp_updated": 1501183033, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501182900, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 150, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 19, "total_reviews": 169}}
