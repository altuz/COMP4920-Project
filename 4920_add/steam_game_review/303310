Oh boy was I wrong. This game deceives you at so many levels, that you begin to question wether anyhting you see is actually real in this game. even the characters sprites seem to be an unreliable source. Some concepts that we normally take for granted in vn's (like being able to read the last few lines again by scrolling up) are used here as  means of subtle foreshadowing. It's probably also worth it to read it a second time (haven't done that myself yet), because the foreshadowing is just that good. At first I thought it was a little expensive (since this story doesn't have branching plotlines), but I read through it only once, and look at my playtime. Definitely worth your money, even at full price. If you're looking for a mystery and drama vn (and a little bit of horror and gore), this is the one to go to.", "timestamp_updated": 1505554946, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505554946, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35312103", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500242", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504568892, "steamid": "76561198051854304", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I bought this game on sale because the premise looked interesting and I'm always a slut for visual novels. I wish I paid full price for it. That's how much I came to enjoy it. Afterwards, I went ahead and I bought the game full-price for a friend of mine and I'm currently forcing her to play it. Yes, I said force. That's relevant and I have to be honest with anyone interested in getting this game: you're gonna have to push through the first couple of chapters, but it is absolutely worth it. \n\nThe first chapter is the weakest in the entire game by far. I found the story to be incredibly boring, predictable, and there was one soundtrack that played through most of it that made me want to claw my eyes out. I have no idea how I got through that first chapter and it's a miracle I did, but holy FUCK am I glad I stuck with it.\n\nLiterally everything is a big improvement from that chapter. By the fourth tragedy I was pretty sold like, \"Yeah, that was neat and I'm kind of sad but also intrigued.\" And then the game takes a MASSIVE turn for the better. And then I'm bawling (not clawing) my eyes out because that's what I do when I have feelings about sad and happy things alike.\n\nTL;DR: You'll suffer the tragedy of an awful start to a VN and then you'll suffer through the characters' tragedies because your heart is breaking again and again and just when you think it's done making you cry (in a good way) it'll break it again.
