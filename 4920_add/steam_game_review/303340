Pops a message about having to enable it prior to launching even though it was already done. Tried using KB+M to navigate main menu but game did not respond. Tried unplugging controller - same messages and problem. I tried disabling Steam Overlay in case it conflicted with the game. That did not fix it. I decided to give up. Game looked very juvenile in tone, with clearly low budget cartoony assets, green gems and young boy protag pitted against a vaguely bowzer-ish dragon enemy spitting flames. If i had to guess this one has green gems instead of coins. Anyways, I am deleting this game for declutter.", "timestamp_updated": 1500321787, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500321787, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 21}}
