This would be more of a problem if the game's mechanics weren't almost all re-used from other tower defense titles. It isn't hard to figure things out, it's just that the game doesn't really explain them.\n\n2) Mechanics\nIf you've played Sol Survivor or Prime World Defenders, you've seen everything the game has to offer already. Except neither of those games was restricted to five turrets. You get a slow turret, a generic shoot everything MG turret, AA turret, anti-armor, and a mortar (AoE) turret. The \"research\" is ticking boxes off a list for an undisclosed \"attack boost\" on a specific turret or unlocking a randomly activated special ability. Upgrades on turrets are perfectly linear, with no real encouragement to do anything other than front-load your upgrades for maximum efficiency.\n\nIn fact, the XP system on upgrades REWARDS stale front-loading.\n\n3) Graphics\nI'm listing this here not so much as a flaw as a suggestion to look hard at the screenshots of gameplay. The graphics aren't fancy, but they are serviceable. \n\n4) Personal Beef: Lack of Originality\nThere are plenty of TD games out there. Some are good. Many are not. This one does not really introduce anything new to the formula, and to me, that is very disappointing. Defense Grid did basic TD mazing best, Sol Survivor had a massive variety of turret types and active abilities, Prime World had its odd CCG-esque collectibles. Nothing in Rush for Glory makes me want to play it more or differently, partially because there are so few options to begin with.\n\nThings the game does well:\nSpeed bar is really well implemented. Admittedly I run the game on full speed more often than not, but that's a personal thing I do in most TD titles.\n\nI'll be putting in more time with this later, perhaps, and will hopefully come up with reasons to change my recommendation, but so far Rush for Glory isn't filling its price plate.", "timestamp_updated": 1403187414, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403187283, "votes_down": 13}, {"recommendationid": "10995632", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507767", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1443974112, "steamid": "76561197992909089", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "This TD seems to be a tower spam clishee game at first untill you find it it's much more. The balans between firepower, leveling up the towers, keeping some money to get more 'people', calling in waves early and repairing makes all the maps interesting. The game is made 3d in a nice engine and good UI: keyboard shortcuts for most actions, all the information you want from a TD. \n\nPro's: \n- New interesting idears: leveling / upgrading towers\n- Hard (dont expect to spam towers and finish the game, not even on normal)\n- Good UI\n- Polished working finished game\n- Leaderboards (just hope they wont be taken over by hackers like in Fieldrunners2 and DGrid)\n\nCons:\n- Confusing at first, limited tutorial. Info like the 'people' are carried over each level wasnt made clear (to me)\n- Tower placement is unclear where you are allowed to build and where not. \n- Few maps, only 10 (with minigames and 3 levels)\n- The towerplacement in combination with the map design does not allow much experimenting with the tower setups. \n- Few towers (5, and 5 powers)\n", "timestamp_updated": 1404205547, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404205547, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "10524896", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499194", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403133021, "steamid": "76561198005730731", "num_games_owned": 1757, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game reminds me a lot of Savage Moon on the PS3.\n\nLong story short, it is a tower defence game, but a good one.  In the same way that savage moon was.  I quite like the small camera rotation moments when you move back and fourth, gives it a little sense of a camera being there, not just movement around the screen. \n\nYou can also view the game from a turret perspective which is a nice little extra.  \n\nThough I like the little animations as you upgrade a tower, it would be nice to have an animation of the tower actually building on, for example,  starts with 1 gun barrel, then animates and slowly grows the second gun barrel.  I guess just like savage moon.  I really loved that game on the PS3, which is why I love this game so much, its very similar.  \n\nI recommend purchasing this.
