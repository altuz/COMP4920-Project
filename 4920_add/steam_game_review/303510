They either all work, or all don't work.\n\nYou'll be spammed constantly at the very beginning of the game by enemies you can't dodge, can't block, and can't defeat all at once.

Graphics are pretty good, and voice acting is moderately acceptable.\n\nWhat is unforgivable about the game?  Cut scenes have great art but are cursed with some of the worst writing I've seen in ages.  Game tries hard to look like Golden Axe, but one can't honestly compare the gameplay.  The gameplay in this title barely functions.\n\nOh yeah, and the kitchen boss died in such a way that the game couldn't continue (boss died offscreen).
