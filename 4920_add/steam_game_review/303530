I dropped blocks haphazardly in to a wheel, not understanding what I was supposed to be doing and not enjoying the sounds I was creating. I walked away feeling embarrassed that I had failed to 'get' Sentris.\n\nThe tutorial in the release version immediately got me on the right track and removed my doubts about this game. Within five minutes I was creating funky loops that went beyond the tunes the game was feeding me and I felt the thrill of composition that I know the designer was aiming to inspire. There is a real satisfaction in building loops layer by layer and it is especially cool to see how the sound evolves as later layers start to push earlier ones out of the loop. The way the progression of songs helps you learn what the game has to offer in terms of depth is almost perfectly executed, the only thing that I struggled a little to figure out was how to change octaves in freestyle mode (you have to climb or descend the scale to reach the octave you want to play in).\n\nI have now worked my way through all of the 'puzzles' that the game ships with (excluding one, Kentucky Fried Chernobyl, that seems to be broken) in their default forms and started to mess with the remix function, which lets you change the BPM, key signature, scale mode and instrument set for any track, and the endless random mode. There is a lot of room to experiment using these tools and although I don't think I will be using Sentris for serious music composition I definitely see myself regularly dipping back in to this game for short jam sessions.\n\nSentris is not without flaws; I would have gladly played through two or three times as many puzzle songs as the game shipped with or made my own with a level editor, freestyle mode being a face-button toggle rather than a shoulder-button hold makes the controls a little clumsy at times, and the game never gives you control over the length of the blocks you are placing even in the remix and infinite modes, although I suspect that this last 'flaw' was a deliberate design decision to force players to experiment and compose rather than reproducing tunes or beats they already know.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone, even if you do not think of yourself as a musical person I think you will be pleasantly surprised by what you are able to create in Sentris.", "timestamp_updated": 1440702603, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440702603, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "12459736", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508472", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1414895881, "steamid": "76561198042279906", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "The tutorial seems to be new based on other reviews, but it got me enough information to know what to expect.

Whether you are a veteran of the music game genre (harmonix fans I am talking to you), or you simply have an interest in making music, Sentris has something fun and engaging for you to discover.\n\n    The most intimidating aspect of learning to play an instrument or learning to write music is finding out how different sounds come together in collaboration to create an interesting complex whole. What makes Sentris so intriguing is the way it brings players into music creation without judgment. Players are invited to solve musical puzzles without harsh critique. This allows players to follow the game's progressive musical structure or completely deviate from the game's pre-set suggestions without negative consequence. The results can vary from being an only slightly coherent cacophony of noise to surprisingly deep melodies and rhythms that are uniquely authored by the player.\n\n     Samantha Kalman may be a relatively new name to video game players, but her work on Sentris gives me hope that we will see more excellent indie games from her and her company (Timbre Interactive) in the future. \n", "timestamp_updated": 1440043461, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440043461, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "17603427", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503613", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1440373374, "steamid": "76561198016701701", "num_games_owned": 585, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Sentris is definitely worth looking into if you have any interest in creating music.

It would be great to be able to select notes outside the standard scale that I choose, and to apply effects (such as reverb or echo) to specific instruments during remix.\n\nNevertheless, the initial offering (at time of official v1.0 launch) is a joy to play around with. When you hit upon a riff that catches your ear and develop it into something you love, it really brings a smile to your face.
