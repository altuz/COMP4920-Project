This game is pretty decent with everything it already has but it needs more content. Once I beat the game (Which took 3 hours) I was left wanting more levels. I like the references that are in the game and also wanted more from that. This game still has some bugs to it that need to be fixed and when jumping on platforms it can be a little weird but overall this is a good game!\n\n\n                                                Things I loved             \n                                                 *Art style                   \n                                                 *level design             \n                                                 *Trading cards \n\n                                                 Things I disliked\n                                                  *How short it is\n                                                  *Some sound effects\n                                                  *occasional frame drops\n          \n\n                                             Overall I give this game a 7/10", "timestamp_updated": 1505795640, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505791151, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35173470", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507057032, "steamid": "76561198007264707", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 371}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A fantastic game, i loved it but please put more levels in.", "timestamp_updated": 1506238190, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506238190, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35050179", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496454", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503272441, "steamid": "76561198371016622", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": ":( its a great game but i tried updating it and now i cant play it anymore", "timestamp_updated": 1505757715, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505757715, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 47, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 51}}
