This is baby's first lemmings game, almost every level is just \"bridge the gap.\" I've used Unity before, and almost everything in here is straight out of the default templates.\n\nBetween the irritating controls -- seriously, you have to use a mouse AND keyboard, no scroll wheel? -- the mind-numbingly easy levels, and the fact that you can't skip ahead to slightly more difficult levels, it's a boring, phoned in reimaging of lemmings. Those icons at the bottom promising interesting actions are dirty lies, when nearly the whole game is nothing but brick laying. The game is unfinished, but it's actually a relief that the levels end prematurely, they're so bad. I also can't believe this is 300 megs, when it could easily have been a Super Nintendo game.\n\nThe worst part is that this feels every bit like a $0.99 or free-to-play mobile game port, but it isn't, it's a student project that makes you feel like you're playing a bad knockoff of a good game. At least if it was on mobile, it wouldn't require the keyboard for half the actions.", "timestamp_updated": 1423998242, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423998242, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "12432730", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526731", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1412928793, "steamid": "76561198004359575", "num_games_owned": 6449, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Do not buy this game if you are older than maybe 5. All levels but one will bore you to death with how easy they are and no real way to fast forward. In addition to that you will experience bugs, bad controls, bad game design, and the unpleasant artwork. You have been warned.\n\nIf you want a good game that plays like Monomino, play MouseCraft here on Steam or the original Lemmings which is available as a free browser game, instead.\n\n\nbuggy:\n- With the first two solutions for level 59 I did not get 3 stars, because babies randomly fell through blocks. I had to rearrange the blocks until the babies did not glitch to death anymore\n- the level list shows 100 levels, but there are actually only 60\n\nbad controls:\n- no hotkeys for the tetrominos and special abilities\n- no pause build mode\n- level list keeps going back to the first group of 20 levels instead of staying where you left it and moving to the next non-3-star level automatically\n- fast forwarding is disabled until you have used up everything, and a bunch of levels can easily be solved with some stuff left over. And when it finally lets you fast forward, it's still so slow you can go afk while waiting, on some levels\n\nbad game design:\nThe pause button brings up a huge window that blocks pretty much the whole screen, obviously to keep you from planning out the level in peace. So there is no way to plan out the levels without failing to save the babies. When they are all dead you cannot continue to plan, instead you get whacked with the pause window, again blocking everything from view. Imagine thinking through different tetromino placements while the babies fall to their deaths literally right through the area where you are planning, in a continuous stream. Talk about a downer, seeing them all die when your goal is to save them, over and over. The only thing left to do is to trap them somewhere to give you some peace and time to plan. Basically you add your own working pause button to the game ...\n\nboredom: about 57 of the 60 levels are so easy a 3 year old would get bored, then you have maybe 2 levels that take a few tries optimize the solution. When finally you get to level 60, which is a nice challenge, the game ends directly afterwards. So basically you spend about one and a half hours wading through boredom to be rewarded with a single entertaining level.\n\nunpleasant artwork: This is strictly personal taste, but since I was extremely bored for most of the game, the ugly office style graphics and bad music soon got on my nerves. While I was thinking of a solution for the final and only challenging level, I did not mind them so much. Turning babies into suicide demolition bombs is not to everybody's taste either.", "timestamp_updated": 1412931360, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412930854, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "12361753", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512827", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1413324813, "steamid": "76561197982151760", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "So far this is a great puzzle/indie game. It's cute and generally it's just a timefiller.\n\nThe design is fitting the style although it's a little basic. Everyone with small talents of art could pull off something like this. The babies are easy to distinguish in the levels and the overall clarity of elements and level parts are great.\n\nThe sound is somewhat mediocre. I feel that not much effort has been put into, especially since most tracks are constantly 10-seconds looped soundbits. It becomes boring after a short time and there is no mute button.\n\nThe puzzles are really balanced and gets progressively tougher. It's definitly the strongest point of the game, although for veterans I feel like it's just a tad too easy, you'll roll right through most of the levels on the first try, but for younger audiences, this is will be a challenge!\n\nThere are a few bugs though, sometimes a baby will simply fall through a block without reason, or you'll end up having a wrong count. The worst bug so far is one that is currently still in the game (which I already mentioned in forums), where when you reach LVL 60 it will automatically complete LVL 61 as well and you can't progress as clicking it won't open the level, and neither unluck LVL 62.\n\nFor the score, I have to give this game a 7/10 because I think for filling your time, it does its job and the few glitches almost never happen, and reloading a level is one click away. But, I do hope the dev(s) fix this issue and please add a mute button! \n\nAs such, this game gets a thumb up!\n\nVIDEO Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NB09kRlj0", "timestamp_updated": 1413365161, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412432805, "votes_down": 13}, {"recommendationid": "12395308", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499532", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1412639523, "steamid": "76561198067286670", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "it's a point and click style game.
