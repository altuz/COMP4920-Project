When you level up, you can choose different skills to pick from, such as healing, fire attacks, physical etc.... This allows you to work around the skills of your allies and keeps you from losing effectiveness when choosing your favorite characters. \n\nThe levels themselves are rather small, think \"Mario Galaxy\", on a bit larger scale. Fortunately the game uses a flying system that allows you to speed around the map quickly and easily, making traveling rather trivial. I really enjoyed this aspect of the game because it allows you to explore the map freely and uncover secret nooks and other such things.\n\nTwo of the negative aspects I can think of is the lack of voice acting and the shortness of the game. This game utilizes a text based system, much like any other game, but the lack of voices kinda keeps you from being immersed into the world. I often found myself just clicking through the dialogue because I really didn't get much out of reading what was there. Honestly it was a rather weird mix of story to begin with. You are part of the faery world helping the king solve issues around the kingdom, which includes a \"ghost pirate ship\" for some reason.\n\nMy major complaint would be the shortness of the game. It just suddenly ends. I though it was going to load a new world or start off the second half of the story, but no, the game is just over. This is rather disappointing because I was actually starting to pay attention to the plot and wanted to see how the story progressed.\n\nFor the $3 I paid, I felt like I got my moneys worth. I played the game while listening to podcasts (no voice acting) and had fun with it. Would be interested in seeing the sequel to this game.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_updated": 1505065909, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505065909, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35215815", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505347688, "steamid": "76561198011965365", "num_games_owned": 1664, "num_reviews": 1566, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A sweet little RPG lite with some good ideas and nice environments.

However, for a game released in 2014, the graphics and game mechanics are superbly sub-par. \"Sprint\" flying disallows diagonal trajectory. This was one of my huge idiosyncrasies for this game because it made maneuvering extremely difficult. Up to the point of the Flying Dutchman campaign, things were swell. However, once the darkness seeped in -- figuratively as well as literally -- my patience toward the game decreased substantially. What got it for me was the Ghost Pirate's quest to kill the three trolls inside the hold. I found two, but that last one was just EXTREMELY difficult to find. I found it on a walkthrough video, but I absolutely could not maneuver my way INSIDE that LITTLE hole that the troll camped itself inside. It was so infuriating! I will try to continue this another day, but for now, my insight toward this game is negative. You can do so much better with a majority of other RPG games out there.

Lack of voice acting means a lot of reading, but I don't consider that a problem. Better to have no voice acting than to have bad voice acting. Combat is also not that complex, just pay attention to which enemies are vulnerable to which attacks, choose companions to adapt to enemy types and use potions if required.\n\nOverall, I liked it.
