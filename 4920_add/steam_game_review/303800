Although, after playing this I wouldn't want the boardgame because setting this up seems like a logistical nightmare meant for a computer.\n\nAnyway, I liked it. I looked at some of the negative reviews. This just isn't a game I would want to play online. It's a game meant for good ol' fashioned couch co-op, an art that is lost to a shitty generation (OMG not other people in the same room!). The video tutorials, if watched left-right top-bottom, start heavy but break down each component until by the end you're like, \"ok, I didn't think I would, but I get it.\" Anything you think you didn't get, the computer does all of the heavy lifting for anyway.\n\nSeriously, you don't even really need tutorials. The computer holds your little baby hand and guides you through every step.\n\nThis game is really fun with one of those shitty touch screen all-in-ones if you're unfortunate enough to own one (but hey, here's something cool it can do!)\n\nThe AI in this game are little bastards.", "timestamp_updated": 1505110049, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505110049, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 177, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 77, "total_reviews": 254}}
