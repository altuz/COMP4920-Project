Goal kicking is fairly good, I like the scrum,ruck, maul controls. It is playable and sometimes enjoybale.\n\nbad things, passsing is worse than you think, animations can be terribly timed and delayed, fake names for national teams and all players have the same height and weight....\n\nif its cheap and you really want a rugby game then i would buy it, I mean cheap though, I got it for 5 canadian dollars and  I think it is a fair deal.
