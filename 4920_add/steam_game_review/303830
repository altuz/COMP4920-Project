Although I'm not entirely sure how KTM would feel about their roaring twin sounding like a dodgy arcade version of a 4 cylinder 600cc screamer. Speaking of which, the noise from the bikes will drive you batshit crazy within 20 mins and a lack of ingame music doesn't help, recommend turning sound down and draining it out with your favourite tunes. \nIf you enjoy games that don't try to hold your hand then this is the game for you! not only will it not hold your hand, it won't even tell you what the hell you should be doing. 1.5h in and the only thing that seems to be unlocked are the first 3 races in the Beginners tournament that I have already done 3 times each. \nThe ability to change what bike you're riding during the race not only negates the need for the stupid rough area's that restrict the sports bikes to about 85kph and allows the cruisers to excel, but it removes what little immersion the game barely offered in the first place and just feels a little silly. \nI was hoping to get a slightly more arcade handling version of Tourist trophy, what I got was a cheesy arcade racer from the 90's, even if it has been wrapped into a fairly pretty exterior.\nThe cost is inexplicably excessive, and I will definitely be pursuing a refund.\nIf you see this on a steam sale for $2.99 then sure, give it a go, why not, you won't get 2 hours of average entertainment for that much anywhere else.\n\n3/10\n", "timestamp_updated": 1417613011, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417613011, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "18493131", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523769", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1454525811, "steamid": "76561198042648172", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 5, "review": "Terrible game, I get depressed everytime I play this \"game\", how i spent 30$ and its a pile of junk on my hard drive. 2/10", "timestamp_updated": 1444952737, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444952737, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "17426583", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503447", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506935594, "steamid": "76561198062396161", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9}, "votes_funny": 5, "review": "oh my good this is bad. buy it when it goes to .99 cents", "timestamp_updated": 1438941026, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438941026, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "13825934", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476592", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1420365330, "steamid": "76561198062197146", "num_games_owned": 544, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 4, "review": "I ride everyday and ride a CBR1000 so l soooo stocked to have a game other than the Moto GP series with real bikes. The only disapointment was the game is not optimised for the PC. My alienware latop has 8Gig Ram and i7 intel and a nividia graphic card and it barely runs on min specs.....But l play Ryse that is just has good on my PC than it is on the Xbox One!!!!! So l am very disapointed l can't enjoy this game. Please optimise for the PC not just for the PS4 that this game is also on. Most of my PC games that are new like FarCry 3 and 4 and Dark Souls 2 runs sooooooo good on the PC and Skyrim is amazing!!!! and they are open world!!! why can't this game run when its a simple arcade racer? Anyway if you are a bike fan this just cool to look at the bikes and is simple fun. If you are not a bike fan, ride the bikes in Watch dogs or GTA it would be way more fun than this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1420365719, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420365719, "votes_down": 29}, {"recommendationid": "30773963", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496539", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1490544976, "steamid": "76561198717311078", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "WHO WOULD WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME IT SUCKS!!!", "timestamp_updated": 1490627598, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1490627598, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "15903446", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457280", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1461346395, "steamid": "76561197979750959", "num_games_owned": 5346, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 7, "review": "Pros:\n- Smooth gameplay *Very important\n- Well optimized game *Very important\n- Unlimited FPS *Very important\n- Nice graphics\n- Different gameplay style - alternate between motos while racing\n- Many challenges to do\n- Many motos to buy\n- Many tournaments and gold medals to get\n- Many achievements\n- Customizable keyboard layout\n- Arcade\n\nCons:\n- Many times game crashes when loading the main menu\n- Sometimes game performance goes down and need to restart the game to fix\n- Can't customize gamepad layout, however the default layout is good\n- Can't open Steam Overlay, however achievements and chat messages are shown\n- Soundtrack of 1 music, but you can disable it\n- Game is too easy and bots doesn't alternate between motos", "timestamp_updated": 1444069356, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432057653, "votes_down": 37}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 6}}
