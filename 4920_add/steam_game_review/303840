With that said, if you are not a fan of the modern 8-bit style, you might not want to buy that game. Other than that I have to say that the asthetic of the game appeals to me personally and I find it good for what it is. \n\nLet's move on to the options menu: There is no slider for the music, only a button to switch it on or off. For sound effects there are more options available. \nGraphicswise the only option is how big of a window you want. Even with pressing several F-Keys on the Keyboard and pressing alt+enter, I was not able to have a fullscreen mode, you basically the best you can get is a windowed fullscreen. \nGameplaywise this could lead to the problem of you going out of bounds with your mouse and locking it into position as long as you are not going back into bounds. What has to be said though is that the game immeadiately recognizes the position of your mouse when you back into bounds, which dampens the harm that is done here greatly. It has to be said as well that you should not go out of bounds that often, since the game encourages you to have controlled mouse movement via instantly killing you when you move around too frantically. \n\nSo, into the game we venture and we find us dying immediately... at least that was me at my very first attempt. The game punishes your old habits of trying to swipe over/into enemies or to klick them. After the initial shock the game shows itself with a relatively smooth learning curve, giving you the chance to improve with every round you play. \nThe game has hard parts as well, but none of which can be considered unfair. The bossfights seem unbeatable at first, but with enough practice you will find out what they can do and deal at least a little damage to them.(Which is as far as I have got)\nStagewise I can say that you have a pool of stages which will come randomly and so far(after about 10 games, which are 30 runs) I found for myself enough variety in them. When you don't get past the first boss for a very long time though it might become repetetive so keep that in mind.\n\n\nFinally the tl:dr: Is it worth it?\n[list]\n[*] If you are a fan of casual games, which you can pick up, play them for 10-20 minutes and put them away again, I consider it a definite buy for you.\n[*] For the avid gamer who wants his old habits questioned by another game(after antichamber and the stanley parable), I'd say buy it. \n[*] For the people that don't find themselves in one of the two groups, described above, I'd wait for a sale, if I were you.\n[*] And finally, if you can't be asked with anything the game has to offer or you find the problems I've stated too big of an issue, I would leave my hands off that game\n[/list]\n\nAs for myself, I have to say, I enjoyed it and I can recommend it.", "timestamp_updated": 1405722126, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405695982, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "13085769", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502451", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1425240306, "steamid": "76561198088848890", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Its cheap, so you can gift it to your friends to insult their shitty skills!
