That being said the missions have good dialogue with each mission following on from the last. however start of fairly short. along side this the AI here tends to be fairly restricted at least on the 1st 6-7 missions leaving you to do most the attacking, and stomping them\n\nSkirmishes\nyou and upto 3 AI\nLike most War Strategy games this (and multiplayer) is where you will spend most of your game time. It features a nice suite of options including muliple landscapes eg, islands and climents (just for a change of scenery), and a  handful of \"popular\" game modes, \n\nMultiplayer\nwith the nice background of units, the multiplayer is failry equal, you have lots of statergys to use against your human opponent/s and spamming one type of unit might work, but can very quickly be countered. it doesnt support ui, meaning you cant have you and a mate battling too \"robotic\" ai. you have to face off another human team alone. you also cannot set it up as a private game, meaning if you want your friend you should time it, so no one else jumps in and steals his place(granted its a bit quite at the moment)\n\nOptions\nmost the normal options here, sound controls ect, resoluctions (upto 1080) and the ability to adjust particles (quality of the wepon's fire)\none of the negative aspects is the save option, it works but you can only save one game (although it seems Campaign save and Skirmish save is separate, but it mean you can only play one Skirmish at a time, and not bounce around between several, or have a backup save incase it gets corrupted (i personaly like to make a save at the very start as a map backup, incase i realy enjoy that map and want to use it again, but in another way)\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThis game plays somewhat like Supream Commander (1), if you have played that and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this game, it might not be a grand or as pretty but its a very good spitual successor to it with plenty to keep you busy\npros:\nLarge amount of units to choose from\nLarge scale war, who likes mothering over 20-30 units, you trained them to die,they will die\nGood selection of countrys to pick from, not just the old fashion USA/Russia/China choice (although the campain Revolves around these)\n\nMultiple resolutions (most of them are common ones such as 1080)\n\nEasy to use UI, if you have played a staregy game before you will generally feel at home\n\nKeybindings (kinda)\n\nPlenty of map choice (eg continates/sea/ islands ect)\n\nCons:\nMost of the keybindings are your control groups or open the map, you cant set keybindings to build buildings or train units\n\nNo repeat queue order\n\nMini map is in a odd place and cant be moved\n\nDefault options have the unit cap at 1000, im assuming this might be the top end cap for phones, and pc's can go higher without a high fps drop (upto 5000 units)\n\nShadows seem to be a dark green which just looks odd when your near a forest\n\nLow Res Grahics (commonly called charming or retro)\n\nOnly one Save slot (One for Campain, One for Skirmish)\n\nNo Private mode or AI in Multiplayer\n\nSteam Overlay doesnt work", "timestamp_updated": 1406312171, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406176323, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "13064296", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455891", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1484974585, "steamid": "76561198017735607", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Excellent game, would recommend to anyone who loves the original C&C style games, especially the Red Alert series.

I actually helped James at Isotope 244 with some ideas for the game on Facebook. If I remember correctly, 3 or 4 people pitched ideas on the Isotope 244 Facebook page. My suggestion was a nuclear power plant mega unit that blows up when destroyed. Good call not including that James, it was a bad idea.\n\nCompared with LASW I feel like Machines at War 3 is just a big update. Graphics are the same, units are a tiny bit different, and the AI is a little more aggressive but no necessarily better. However, Machines at War is a game in its own, so I'll treat it as a new game for this review. \n\nGraphics / Gameplay: 2D icon type graphics with some cool particle effects and decent physics. The graphics work well for the RTS genre, but the grid system is where the game really shines. Being able to zoom out and look at the map in the form of a giant graph is mad cool. It makes me feel like I'm some cold war commander controlling robots from a underground bunker somewhere. \n\nI also love the stats that pop up at the end of the battles. Its super cool being able to break down your strategy into the raw stats and numbers. \n\nMusic: The soundtrack is OK / Bad. The real problem is trying to play your own music instead. I'll cover this later\n\nAI: The AI is a huge part of any RTS, and this one does pretty good. \n\nBack in LASW the AI had OK strategy and terrible tactics. In Machines at War 3 the AI has become very aggressive strategically, but not much smarter tactically. \n\nStrategy: The AI knows that the key to success is mega units and Ore. So it conducts search and destroy missions for the special resources from the start of the game. Once it has the resources, the AI is able to out produce you, and overwhelm you with massive amounts of building, units, and mega units. \n\nIf you don't get a leg up on the AI by getting some special resources in the early game, you're on the defensive for the rest of the game for sure. \n\nTactics: The AI is still lacking a bit on the tactics side. The AI tries to overwhelm you with massive amounts of units, and it really isn't that effective against a human player who can set up decent defenses. One thing that I noticed was that the AI only attacks with one kind of unit at a time. The AI will launch an air attack, and then a land attack, and then a sea attack, waiting in-between to rebuild more units. \n\nA human player easily defeats the AI in tactics because we know that you're supposed to attack with air, sea, and land at the same time. No point in sending in tanks if a helicopter will destroy them. No point in sending helicopter if a fighter will shoot it down. No point in sending a helicopter, tank, or fighter if a gunboat or submarine is covering the river. The AI does not understand this, and sends units into areas where they cannot help or get slaughtered. \n\nIn addition, I just have to mention how horrible the AI is with building facilities. Why the hell would you rebuild your mother base next to mine? How does it make sense to build a factory within shooting distance of my factory? The AI is just too aggressive with building factories and buildings, and it ends up just being a waste of resources that the AI hoards. \n\nOther: I have to mention that this game has troubles on Mac. You cannot go into big picture mode while this game is running. You have to save and quit if you want to do ANYTHING ELSE while the game is running. Want to play music through iTunes? Better not want to change a song, you have to save and quit. Why is this still a thing Isotope 244? \n\nRating: Overall, I think Machines at War 3 is pretty good. I don't think it is worth $14.99 though. I would suggest this game to my friends, and I think that its great that Isotope 244 still makes RTS games even after they have fallen out of style all over the Mac /  PC space. In addition, it is great to support an indie dev.\n\nI'm also really glad this game was released on steam.
