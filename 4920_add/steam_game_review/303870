VERY BUGGY, puzzles are... Awful. There's no guidance in this game. You're basically running through rooms, you have to check every wall in every room to make sure you don't miss the place you're supposed to go.\nPuzzles basically mean \"Pick up these boxes and climb up this\", there's no variety at all.\n\nThe enemies are god awful. \"I WILL KILL YOU\" will be said about 80 times throughout this game, if not more. Your weapons are incredibly weak compared to their lores, considering your melee weapon is an axe that 'rips guts out'. It takes about 10 hits on the most common enemy to kill. 4 shots with a holy gun that's incredibly inaccurate.\n\nUpgrading mana is probably useless, it doesn't really help much at all. The game requires a lot of movement but you have stamina for sprinting so when you're stuck in a maze (Yes, a maze!) you can't sprint through it and instead have to hear the pathetic panting of your character.\n\nPhysics are bugged out as fuck. Infact in terms of bugs, I had to exit out of the game probably 4 times because I did a stage then have the game break itself. I got trapped in rooms, had a lift go without me with no sign of it coming back, have even died trying to break a forcefield with an explosive without even trying to use it!\n\nI recorded my gameplay of this - Around the end of the series the bugs happen more often. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h04WcaROtI&list=UUctwhP4L0qZWJRF4r0vMQ7w", "timestamp_updated": 1410315278, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1410314935, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "11682626", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 66, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568848", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1411089734, "steamid": "76561198042256643", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Here is a link to my [url=http://youtu.be/RmbtBmBht60]Blinding Dark EP#1[/url] and [url=http://youtu.be/buziDR7ydPo]Blinding Dark EP#2[/url]\nThoughts on this game. I bought it since it was new, had no reviews at the time, and I like suspenseful games. For me I'm mixed - I first gave it a thumbs up and then a thumbs down...back to a thumbs up. I could go either way because I like the mystery of what is going on and that makes up for the lack of explanation in the game. \n\nPros: \nThe lack of knowledge keeps me wanting to find out more. \nThere is a mix of spells and weapons.\nVariety of puzzles to advance.\n\nCons:\nThere are some glitches to be worked out.\nI found the lack of info on torch and orb frustrating - I didn't know what to do for a bit because of this.\nIn the first few areas there is a lot of asset and map duplication.\n\nOverall: If your thoughts coincide with what I was talking about above - you'll probably enjoy the game.

The game is fun and charming to begin with as it's going for a very Clive Barker's Undying style of gameplay as well as some of the funny writing in a specific journal entry citing that the main character might have shit his pants so that was pretty amusing. Things seem alright if somewhat derivitave from the get-go (You lost you memory, in some spoopy place, etc, etc, we've seen it before) but as you get further and further into the game, things start to take a downward spiral from the confusing, to the annoying, to the outright frustrating and then to the utterly disappointing. I like the game in a weird charming way but it doesn't get that 'So bad that it's good' vibe like it had in the beginning as at the end it had more of a 'I feel rather disappointed now' kind of vibe. But I'll break it down to pros and cons because TL;DR amirite?\n\nPros:\n- A refreshing take on the rather dull first person indie horror game\n- Weapons to fight monsters\n- Some interesting monster and weapon designs, taking from different folklores across the world\n- Dark, gothic atmosphere\n- Has plenty of old school elements, running around collecting random items is quite fun\n- First person platforming is actually not bad, utilizing the sprint and jump keys properly can take you far\n- Some fairly unique weapons, ranging from the standard revolver up to a large shield to deflect enemy projectiles\n- Voice acting is alright, but sometimes it's hilarious\n- Fighting enemies does have strategy as you can cancel and stagger their attacks with a well-timed swing or shot rendering them vulnerable, very rare for these indie horror games\n- Easy achievements for those who crave them\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive levels, pretty much everywhere looks the same all throughout the game\n- Bullshit enemies, enemies can hit you seemingly at random when you're clearly out of range\n- Very small hitboxes, you will miss plenty of revolver shots and you will hate yourself for it\n- Some weapons are useless and an absolute joke, certain weapons work for certain enemies but sometimes they bug out and the final weapon is terribly underpowered and doesn't even work on the typical grunts\n- The Doppleganger, you will hate this guy to your very core as he's the most bullshit enemy who is impossibly fast and can hit you from literally anywhere with a stupendous damage output and he WILL kill you but unlike all other enemies he will permanantly steal mana from the player which will piss you off\n- The sprint mechanic is stupid, it's the classic \"player has to stop moving to catch their breath\" kind of sprinting which should never be the case and wastes the time of players and ruins the pacing of the game and it will happen all the time unless you exploit it easily by sprinting sideways or backwards\n- The story is extremely thread-bare and you will find yourself not giving a single shit, I don't care about stories in games but it's a horror game, it has to have some intrigue in the story\n- The final boss isn't even a boss - it's basically an arena where you fight hordes of enemies you have been fighting throughout the whole game with a great, big spoopy monster in the background (Although it does look pretty cool)\n- The ending is perhaps the least satisfying ending in gaming history, sure it's going for this whole episodic thing but it just ends with blank text like an NES game saying \"Conglaturation!!! A Winner is You!\" and then kicks you right back to the menu - RIVETING!\n- Only one difficulty called \"Buttface\", that's not what it's called but it's what I call it because it only has a single difficulty with no name\n- 2.5 hours is far too short for the majority of people\n- And finally for a 2 hour experience where there's pretty much no need to go back and play through it again especially since you will most likely get every single achievement in that one sitting without needing to even think about it\n\nIt's a game with a ton of charm and had such a promising concept that it could have been so much more but sadly it's a game that falls flat on it's arse from a 10ft drop to a concrete pavement and you'll feel really disappointed when the game finally comes to an insultingly abrupt close. Though if there will be an ACT 2 then I would love to see if the devs made some much needed improvements to really flesh the entire game out - there's a lot of potential here and I love my horror FPS a LOT.

It's looked really interesting. Keep in mind it's a ten dollar game and given that I think it's pretty good, it's far from the worst game of it's kind.\n- the ambiance and music put me on edge and I got scared several times\n- it definitely has some faults, most notably the enemy AI on occasion, but this didn't really matter to me\n\nhttp://youtu.be/w5lPGqpJEY4\nhttp://youtu.be/idP29HfX3e4\nSo the majority of game-play consists of exploring the environment, platform puzzles, uncovering hidden areas, finding keys or items needed to progress to the next area. You find a torch early on which will illuminate dark areas. If you right click while using the torch it places a burning skull on the ground, I didn't see an explanation for why you can do this. But I think the idea is that you are a magic user and that's how you can illuminate areas remotely.\n-----Yes there are occasional enemies which you must dispatch with weapons that you come across as well. I didn't really come across lot of ammo for the pistol to use against enemies. The pistol doesn't have great accuracy at more than close range, so I was wasting some shots trying pick off an enemies. I was always conscious of my ammo count but in several encounters I basically panicked and spammed the mouse button emptying my entire magazines to take out single enemies. I had an axe to fall back on but it's not really safe to engage enemies with. I swung it in a mad frenzy against a pair of demons and barely survived that. The AI has a bit of trouble sometimes. But in most cases it just needs to run straight at you and it can usually handle that lol. They were kind of tough and definitely did a good enough job to scare me and sometimes in a way that make me laugh about it afterwards. The only problem with them is that you know that they are close because you can hear them and pinpoint their whereabouts so they can't take you by complete surprise.\n-----Before I stopped playing I'd reached a maze. While the other puzzles I'd come across were generally pretty simple, I thought the labyrinth was a pretty good one because I actually found myself getting lost in it. It all looked the same and it was very disorientating.\n\nSo I thought the game looked and sounded pretty good. The environments environment's are dark. There are plenty of creepy looking paintings hung on the walls. The music and ambiance made the game scarier for me.\n-----The premise that you have woken up with no memory of who you are or where you are is cliche. But I thought the role of a mysterious magic user was pretty cool. The protagonist mentions that he doesn't know whether he was a 'psychic or demonoligist'. I think that stuff like that has some interesting implications for developments in the story.\n-----There were a few odd things I noticed about the  game. Your torch appears kind of low poly, plant pots had a weird blue glow and the animations of hostile demons look a little bit mismatched. The ones that I came across were very animated when idle and when they moved they looked as if they were charging at you but they were actually moving relatively slowly. This in combination with their AI basically meant that they behaved more like shambling Zombies. However none of these things actually stopped me from enjoying the game.\n-----You are occasionally provided with a new journal entry by the games protagonist. They are reasonably well voice acted. Usually they are serious but one of them was actually pretty amusing 'I think I might have shit my pants back there...' lol!\n\nI really enjoyed this game, so I recommend trying it out. I felt that my satisfaction was mainly through the overall experience created by the environment and atmosphere not the puzzles and the combat. Yes people may feel that there may be better games of this kind out there such as Amnesia. But there are also much worse ones out there. Like I said, I think this is pretty good for the price. Unfortunately I haven't completed it yet, so I can't know how long it is in total.\n\nClick [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SatanovichZ1/videos]here[/url] for my YouTube gaming channel", "timestamp_updated": 1408093468, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1407893863, "votes_down": 32}, {"recommendationid": "24044653", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501968", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1409854951, "steamid": "76561197993512705", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Game showed promise.
