But this is a \u2018retro\u2019 game, so that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be. The distortion transition effect and backgrounds look cool. The game is presented pretty well for what it is.\n\nYou control a triangle. You use the mouse to roll it around and shoot enemy objects. You can shoot a big beam which is cool.\n\nControlling your triangle can be difficult with the mouse. I found that it over rolled or just didn\u2019t move when I thought I\u2019d moved the mouse enough to put it where I want. I think the terrain is supposed to affect your movement as well which didn\u2019t help. You don\u2019t seem to be able to use the keyboard which kind of doesn\u2019t make sense to me considering that it\u2019s a retro game. I forgot that I could avoid hostile objects by jumping over them using space bar so I didn\u2019t make it that far.\n\nIt\u2019s an arcade game and so far it seems to be a competent one at that. It would be nice if they fixed up the controls a bit. It is $3.99 on steam which I would say is probably not too bad a price.\n\nClick [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SatanovichZ1/videos]here[/url] for more let\u2019s play videos =)", "timestamp_updated": 1404964616, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404206197, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "12673293", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449251", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1414527615, "steamid": "76561198003476004", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Don't buy this.", "timestamp_updated": 1414527708, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414527708, "votes_down": 23}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 4}}
