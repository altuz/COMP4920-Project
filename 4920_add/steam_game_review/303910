There is also storm over the pacific which I also own, and its also an excellent game covering the Pacific theater.\n\nWhat I like about this game is there is enough detail to feel like I have lots of control over my nation, but not so much detail that I just give up trying to play it.  I have enjoyed games like Hearts of Iron II, and Decisive Campaigns Case Blue.  However HOI III was too much, and so games like war in the East and Gary Grisby's other games were just too much for me, as much as I wanted to like those games.\n\nThis one though, its just perfect.  FIghting as the Russians against Germany for over a year and a half in my second attempt has been excellent.  I had to change the difficulty to very easy, and Im still struggling to hold on to Leningrad in June of 1942.  There is a thrust toward Stalingrad, and a new one going toward Moscow which will be tough to contain.  This game is fun and challenging for both new wargamers and veterans like me.\n\nThe graphics have many options, so you can adjust the map and the units to achive the look that you want.  I think the screen shot of the graphics and my belief that the game would be too simple and have poor AI is what kept me away from these games.  Don't let that stop you.\n\nThe only caveat is that Wasteland games does not give the best support.  I had trouble with Storm over the Pacific and fortunately I had purchased the game from Matrix, who has awesome technical support.  They helped me find a solution to the game crashing all the time.  However, I have had only one crash and one other techical problem with Time of Fury, and both problems were fixed with a reload.  I guess if I had a real serioius problem I might have to buy the game again trhough Matrix.  So that is the one caveat, the support is really poor.  Which is a shame, because they have an awesome system for war games.  Heck I just bought the 1953 Nato vs Warsaw pact game, even though its incomplete in terms of balancing and pictures for all the units.  And again, the knock on that game which is in early access limbo is that its not getting any support.
