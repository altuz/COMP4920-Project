The sparse, grirtty interface elements and visuals (and the even sparser controls) force you to surrender to the brilliant and shockingly uncomfortable sounds of your breathing, the whining of the engine and the blips of the radar's pulse. And it is this sound design that makes Capsule what it is: an experience much more so than a game. Mainly because your desire to survive has less to do with winning and more to do with avoiding the desperate gasps of running low on oxygen.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and repetitive, but it does manage to keep you tense throughout. Alone in your claustrophobic capsule you traverse this unidentified alien space, using the radar to help you locate pockets of air and power while avoiding dangers, and using the compass/distance readout to navigate to your next destination. Balancing these simple decisions of speed and direction feels like a constant gamble stacked against you, so expect to die alot. Still, despite the very basic controls there are a couple of secrets and subtleties to be dicovered in the gameplay - a look at the achievements may give you a couple of hints.\n\nThe game has no pause button but saves at (and restarts from) the last base you have managed to reach. Those are also the locations where you can refuel and uncover your next destination, while skimming through the few lines of communication leftovers you can access - the only way the game delivers explicit story. There is of course a bit of mystery there, an anomaly, elements of the strange. But the snippets that mostly hit home tend to be the mundane communications of daily life: a greeting to a daughter, a joke, complaining about those working in the other department, life as it is lived day-to-day. And they hit home because underlying them is the same existential horror that underlies every design aspect of this game: the mundane sound of a breath turning into a hopelessly lonely death rattle amidst the uncaring void.\n\nSo is this a good game? Not... really. The narrative has those fascinating little moments, but never develops, and the ending is at the same time experientially satisfying and way too abrupt. The gameplay, while tense, is repetitive and doesn't evolve, the difficulty is only scaled up by increasing the distance between bases. In fact, the minimalist retro-futuristic aesthetic and the sound design are all that holds this game together, but they constitute such a superb achievement of immersion that they are enough for me to absolutely recommend this game. This odd collection of 4 buttons, colourless dots on a screen and a couple of sound bites took me on a journey that I will have a really hard time forgetting any time soon.", "timestamp_updated": 1463515872, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448493428, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "16495747", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521318", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1434557320, "steamid": "76561198008468852", "num_games_owned": 835, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I found this to be a somewhat unique little game. In some ways I consider it a combination of a sci-fi / puzzle / horror type of game. \n\nWatching a wavy radar-monitor screen while piloting something like an underwater mini submarine, or \"Capsule\", and there is an almost constant sense of tension as air and power can quickly deplete along with other lurking dangers hiding in the murky depths.\n\nYou\u2019re kind of dumped into the game and left to figure out what to do or what the heck is going on, but I think that\u2019s part of the enjoyment of it.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is well done. Sounds are good and an important part of the game. Graphics are minimalistic, but for this type of game it works really well. \n\nTo best experience this game I suggest to play with a headset, turn up the sound a bit, turn down the room lights, let yourself be immersed; Put yourself into a frame of mind that you're piloting a leaky cramped mini-submarine, or \u201cCapsule\u201d, with only an old flickering radar monitor screen for visual feedback, and your ears listening carefully for sounds, to help let you know what might be out there around you. \n\nHearing the last gasps of breath as you desperately search for a much needed air-pocket, then at the last moment you find one, you\u2019ll be taking a big gulp of air and have a brief sigh of relief and you contiue to limp your way to your destination while always on the lookout for sources of air and power to keep you going.  But, oh noooes! *Shhhriiieeeak!*. What was that aweful noise? Something's coming in... fast! Com' on, move faster you leaky tin can. Don't let me die here. I'm so close to the next base... So close!\n\nOverall; I think it's quite a good game with a well done atmosphere and I felt well worth the few dollars I spent to buy it. \n\nBelow is a little game-play video of me playing Capsule. \nCheers! :) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-Z8ebDSWro", "timestamp_updated": 1434679091, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434628181, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "10292930", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509754", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1401493691, "steamid": "76561197973621340", "num_games_owned": 884, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The initial concept of CAPSULE is very simple but the execution is where it shines.\n\nThe game does an excellent job with the atmosphere and immersion.  They aren't joking when they say that if you have anxiety trigggers then this game might not be for you.  What should be a simple matter of managing your resources has some very surprising refinements and is complicated by the way the world reacts to you, the subtle signs, sounds and behaviours.  There is that very strong tension that comes from the warning that your fuel is low, or the gasping breaths as your oxygen supply runs out.\n\nThat said, there are some frustating points.  The world is randomly generated every time you leave a docking station along with a sensor ping.  This can lead to some cheap shots that cost you your resources.  Sometimes it feels like the difficulty randomly spikes because of the generation and the immersion is lost as you just accept your death to restart and try again, this can make the death sequence annoying after the first few times.\n\nStill, I enjoyed it and even after being able to manage my resources to maximum efficiently and accurately guess what things were based by their natural behavours and sound alone there were some heart pounding moments of near panic.\n\nThe game does very little to explain itself and instead leaves you, the player, to figure things out for yourself.  You only get the basic controls once at the start of the game.\n\nIn technical terms, the game is set to fixed video options.  It locks the aspect ratio of the game and gives you either Stretched Fullscreen (with blackness in the wasted space at the sides), Fullscreen (with blacknes around the game area) and Windowed mode.  It can be forgiven as it is a point behind the immersion.  You also cannot rebind controls.\n\nIf you enjoy games centered on immersion and place that above mechanics then I cannot reccomend CAPSULE any harder than I already am.  If you enjoy exploration and figuring things out for yourself then CAPSULE is a fun little title.  For mechanically focused players like myself, there are surprising refinements to be found and enjoyed.  If any of those sound don't sound appealing to you then CAPSULE may be more frustration than anything else.", "timestamp_updated": 1401496033, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1401496033, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "10365196", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509639", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1421015729, "steamid": "76561197982217697", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Wow, to think such a simple, familiar concept could be executed so well. Have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket?\n\nCapsule isn't a AAA title, but don't let that fool you, this game has more substance than anything else I've played, spare for a few titles.\n\nWhy? First of all, this game is a nostalgia trip. Think of all the great sci-fi and horror films of the 1960s-1980s mixed into one place, that being this game, Capsule. Capsule is a minimalistic survival horror game where you control what appears to be a submarine through a large, hostile environment via a radar screen. The GUI of the game itself looks like you're playing through an old CRT monitor left in a space ship for a few decades, complete with scan lines and vignette.\n\nOf the game's many strong points, the first off is the emotional sense this game leaves. In the store's description, it warns players that this game is potentially triggering towards people who suffer from misophonia-- the fear or hatred of certain sounds (more on sounds later.) Going into this game leaves you to wonder many things. This is a visual adventure, though through mostly your brain. Your imagination is what does most of the work while you play. The player is presented with familiar, and cold concepts such as: desperation, isolation, depression, mystery, fear of the unknown, and survival. Everybody will get different things from this game, but that's what I got out of it on my first playthroughs.\n\nThe game oozes of substance. Think of Alien, mixed with The Abyss, and some elements from 2001 and The Thing placed in, for good measure. \n\nWhat it boils down to is that you have to do what you can to survive. If you are easily bored, I would not recommend this game as it can be tedious, going from checkpoint to checkpoint. The fact that the basis of the game is pure survival is frightening; to envision an actual scenario where the goal was survival at any cost is equally terrifying, which is part of the reason why this game hits home.\n\nSimple controls, easy to use, hard to master. Learning to control power levels takes a bit of skill, as you could speed your way to the next checkpoint, saving oxygen, but draining power like a faucet, or take your time, saving power, but draining oxygen. Calculated, mature decisions will need to be made to ensure your survival during this game. \n\nVisuals are top notch, the retro-futuristic look of CRT monitors and clunky keyboards and tons of vector graphics has been achieved. If you appreciate the artwork of Moebius, Syd Mead, Ralph McQuarrie, or Ron Cobb, you will be right at home with the themes of this game. Though there's only mostly geometric shapes in the game, the mind paints a picture of what the objects are. I can imagine the \"capsule\" picking up oxygen tanks or bumping into lichen on rock formations on the sea floor.\n\nEnemy encounters are genuinely terrifying, and the fear factor of this game in general is pretty scary. The isolation and fear of the unknown come up a lot. The first time I encountered an enemy NPC I nearly exited the game, it was such a surprise to see (SPOILER) a fast moving square come at me. Okay, I lied about the spoiler, but beware-- tripping a radar wave alerts enemies to your presence, making you think twice about your searches. Also, when you run out of power, you are doomed to a fate of slow death by asphyxiation (unless you can restart your capsule.) The screen fades to black and your last checkpoint is reloaded. Very scary.\n\nSound design is my favorite part about the game next to the visuals. The creators of the game present a meticulous array of perfect sounds. From small things like thruster jets, to the big things like docking with a base, or bumping into lichen (or an enemy hehe) it's all there and paints a huge picture in your mind. You feel like it's actually happening and you're experiencing it (or at least, I did.) When you bump into lichen you can hear scraping noises that are muffled enough to convince you that maybe you hit a rock or large plant. The beeps and fuzz of the monitor were a small, albeit nice touch.\n\nAll in all, for $5 I would be hard pressed to find a better game to test my wits and scare the bejeezus out of me without doing much. Very short story though! :l \n\nSome final words, this game requires you to think, and isn't easy. Prepare to spend a long time retrying checkpoints. It's more of a mental experience than a traditional video game in that sense, but it's tons of fun, especially if you're in for a good scare.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_updated": 1402038057, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1402038057, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "10279085", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505285", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403743654, "steamid": "76561198000514968", "num_games_owned": 768, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very atmospheric.

You can pick up air pockets and fuel cells from the various debris you scan (with Spacebar). The problem arises from the hit-or-miss game mechanics that rely mostly on dumb luck. You'll be mostly trying to refuel or fill your oxygen while space drones and these things called \"Shrikes\" persue you and drain your fuel. You lose your fuel and you stop in your tracks. \n\nNow this is my biggest problem with the game: The restarting of the engines. When you run out of fuel, you won't be able to move until you prime your engine and try to restart it. The way I see it, whether the ship starts going again or not is decided by a dice roll which may not be on your side. You'll be trying to move again and again without results as you run out of oxygen and eventually die. This becomes rather infuriating as you may have a full oxygen tank but won't be able to start the ship before it completely runs out.\n\nIt doesn't help that from the second station on, almost every damn bleep on the radar is a hostile trying to take you out and it takes around 3-4 seconds for the radar to identify nearby objects.\n\nThe atmosphere, while minimal, is very nicely created. There is always a sense of looming death surrounding you and reaching that next station can become quite a stressful ordeal.\n\nAll in all, it's a cool little game with interesting atmosphere but the gameplay falls short and relies too heavily on dumb luck in order to proceed.

Of course, it starts out simple enough - you're learning about the environment and the limitations of your old space junker, and boy howdy do you have no idea what's gonna be store for you once you get past the first few stages, because once you do, you're gonna realize that your lackadasical behavior towards space survival is not going to be enough, and the game will houndlessly kill you until you learn how your ship works. Maybe ease off going full throttle so you don't run out of fuel and choke to death in space. Maybe don't pick up the Nitroxes, because they make your ship blow up. Maybe figure out how to jumpstart your ship when you run out of fuel. Hurry up, buddy. Your oxygen's disappearing.\n\nThe thing I really like about Capsule is that I became a pro at knowing what I could and couldn't do with my old piece of shit Capsule spaceship. I learned from it while I operated - it's reliable, but energy-hungry, and I eventually started tweaking how I operated the ship to get the most mileage out of it as I could. Once I started intimately knowing what my ship did at what speed, I easily beat the game. It's all about intuiting what your ship can and can't do. If you can't intuit, prepare to hear that asphyxiation noise before you restart a LOT.\n\nIt's five bucks, and judging from the mealy-mouthed complaining about how FLASH GAMES SHOULDN'T COST MONEY ON STEAM in the comments, it might be a bit higher than what you're expecting to pay? Hell, I don't know many people who find the idea of pretending to be in an extremely cramped spaceship desperately searching for a gulp of air before they die to be fun. I like it, but then again I'm a sour, depressed first-world problems having dork who thinks the concept of other people is a concept that should be set on fire.", "timestamp_updated": 1463773338, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463697231, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "11496399", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500328", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1401560380, "steamid": "76561197998053180", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "An enjoyable and intense minimalist masterpiece.", "timestamp_updated": 1406838244, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406838244, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 49, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 56}}
