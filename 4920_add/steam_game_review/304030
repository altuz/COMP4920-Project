I saw a video of this game in alpha and followed it ever since. I played quite a lot during beta (which was the most fun this game had to offer). The number of possible class combinations is insane. You set up trade routes to deliver goods which are usually guarded by the enemy faction. If they kill you, they get that gold for all your hard work. Many of those trade routes take part across the ocean. You had to build your own boat or hitch a ride on someone elses to get across. The seas were usually filled with pirates (actual players) or the enemy faction, who could again, sink your boat and steal everything. \n\nThis concept is the best I've seen in any game to date, and it was executed SOOO well. The only problem with this game (and it is such a flaw that it ruins all the good) is that you have to spend thousands and thousands of dollars to keep up. Literally the person who puts the most money in will win in any battle. Sure you can get decent gear from grinding out gold (which it what i did, I never put more than like $100 into this game aside from subscription) but you will NEVER catch up. It is literally impossible. By the time you grind to get gear where you can do %25 of someones health before dying, it will be time for the game to update, releasing better gear. The people who spend money will have that gear in days, where it would take the genuine players like 6+ months. \n\nAlso, the only people still playing this game are the ones who have put thousands of dollars into it, so unless you want someone to farm you for honor every day, don't even think about playing this. Hopefully the game will die like it deserves to and some other developer/publisher will make a game like this and do it right.", "timestamp_updated": 1505075787, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505075787, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35056447", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500347", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1452311709, "steamid": "76561198054886843", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 104286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Archeage.. where to start..\n\nI brought the $150 founders pack in beta, I played for over a year and a half with a sub, even spent money in the in-game shop every other week for all sorts of crap and lemme tell you..\n\nHands down the biggest waste of time and money i've ever spent on a game.\n\nArcheage is a lifestyle, if you wanna get good be prepared to LIVE on it and dump cash monthly.
