Animal designs are so much more realistic than in ZT2, and many are unbelievable adorable because of it (the otters!!!)\n2. Animal's needs and behaviors are more realistic (i.e. needing it to be hotter or colder, interacting with the natural parts of their environment for food, water, shelter, and entertainment)\n3. More animal and plant species to choose from (including oddities that can only be achieved through breeding and certain species that have color options when you purchase them)\n4. Zoo IS NOT set up on a grid system which allows more design options.\n5. Environmental challenges such as weather changes and temperature challenges\n6. You don't have to make a zoo, ZT2 made you have a zoo entrance and guests would show up and complain no matter what you did. WP2 gives you the option to make a zoo, nature preserve, farm, ranch, animal shelter, or just a natural environment for the animals to exist in.\n\n\nThings I like better about ZT2:\n\n1. Terraforming controls are much more user friendly in ZT, however those in WP2 are more realistic in terms of how one would actually landscape and form lakes and deep water tanks\n2. The sorting system, WP2 has no sorting system for anything and that can be overwhelming before you know where everything is and tedious once you do.\n3. Staff didn't need their own individual buildings, nor did they have a limited range\n\n\nReally in the end it all comes down to what you are looking for in a zoo game. In my case, I wanted realistic animals more than anything and a wide variety of them on top of that. However, if you want a more user friendly, child safe (I've seen multiple posts in the discussion boards from parents who aren't pleased with the realistic mating in WP2) zoo game, then perhaps ZT2 is better for you.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1502829623, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502829623, "votes_down": 0},

being able to rotate objects 360 degrees, i like the animal selection, i much prefer the missions, and one of my absolute favorite features is the inclusion of albino/melanistic animals. \n\nthat said, be aware that if you're going to buy this game, you're in for a buggy experience. koalas that get stuck in trees and invisible cows are minor annoyances, but i've also found the game crashes
