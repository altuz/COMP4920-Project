The concept is sound, but as ever Ubisoft poorly executes an idea that could be brilliant.\n\nSo in summary, I wouldn't buy this game at this point in time.

Lots of nerfs to characters who didn't need nerfs and not nerfing characters that do need nerfs. This game has eaten so much of time and the last 30 hours or so have just been mentally exhausting to even try to like the game anymore. The player base is slowly dwindling and will most likely last until the beginning of next year sometime.

The game has just been plauged with problems since its launch and I just can't recommend it or even have fun playing it anymore.

My favorite is the Raider, who is just a big sweaty man who flails his giant axe around in a manner that can confuse and disorient your opponents. I also enjoyed playing as the Berserker, who is a viking who is less sweaty and has smaller axes, but can deal massive damage if you successfully juke an enemy. You can argue that some are less interesting though, like the flimsy Shinobi or over-nerfed Warlord.\n\n-The game gets really, really intense at some times. I usually play against a friend and we always freak out when we're both at 1 hit away and we're trying to be super offensive as defensive heroes. \n\n-The game looks amazing, and I love the customization options we have for most heroes. My favorite map to look at is Forest, just because of that view off the cliff.\n\n-The unreleased \"Tribute,\" gamemode looks really badass and I cant wait to try it. Can't make promises since it hasn't been released, so you can take this pro with a grain of salt.\n\n-As long as you dont play as Centurion or Gladiator, the community is rather supportive and nice, if you start out with a good first impression to those you are matched with.\n\nNeutral:\n-Connection issues are present, but people exaggerate them most of the time. It's probably just as bad as Rainbow Six's connection, imo.\n\n-It has a story mode, but it's pretty bare bones and only used to learn the mechanics of the game and certain characters. I mostly did it to get steel, the currency, though.\n\n-Faction war is present but at times it just feels like you arent fighting for anything because you just barely tip the 50/50 scale when it comes down to just one singular area.\n\n-One hit kills are a thing. Which I personally like in the 4v4 gamemodes, but some others would say otherwise. Basically throwing an enemy off a cliff, or a shorter ledge and then pouncing on top of them, is a one hit kill. If you play for duels, you will not be knocked off an edge most of the time. Ubi recently removed some of these killspots, also.\n\nCons:\n-HUGE HUGE HUGE balancing issues. Let me just number and list things that should be reworked or removed or literally anything to fix\n1. Gladiator. Need I say more? Glad has a good size of a stamina pool, a huge health pool for an assassin, a ton of unblockable openers, and a gutstab with too much of a reward. Also not many people seem to realize this but he can get a free gutstab from a deflect. Ubi nerf pls\n2. Heroes with incredibly fast zones/attacks in general. After someone uses this for the past 6 times like most of the people who put them to use do, it becomes sort of predictable, but if you aren't playing against the moron who thinks \"wow this is super fast, may as well make it my only attack,\" then they'll start mixing in other extraordinarily fast attacks, such as Warden. I'll get to more about him later. At later levels, this becomes less of an issue as your reaction time has improved, but I had a huge problem with this in early levels.\n3. Warden. The community refers to his only purpose as \"vortexing.\" Basically, Warden can do a shoulderbash which will stun enemies so he can get 2 garunteed light attacks, which is about 1 bar of health. Why is this bad? Warden's shoulderbash can be immediatley cancelled into a guardbreak, garunteeing either those 2 lights to continue that shoulderbash chain train or a heavy attack. Also, shoulderbash can be feinted into having an enemy try to dodge-attack counter, just to be parried. Aside from the shoulderbash, Warden has a top heavy that deals massive damage and has a super long range, super fast top lights, and a super fast zone.\n4. Berserker is severely underpowered against defensive hereoes such as Conquerer. Simply because Berserker does not have any unblockables, forcing dodges or parries. No one ever goes for parries when out of stamina or at full stamina with a defensive hero. Maybe a Lawbringer will once or twice, but most go for the free shove after a block.\n\nWhatever. Done with the balancing. On to the next problem.\n\n-Ubi won't fix what needs to be fixed. Aka Glad being out for 6 weeks now and still being overpowered and spammy. Highlander still merely dents armor with his giant claymore. A low-health Shugoki still can 1 hit kill full-health enemies by breaking their back AND regain lost health too. Shugoki has been in the game since the beginning. Atleast they gave Centurion a nerf after people discovered he could feint heavy attacks more than 10 times.\n[EDIT]: announced in the next patch, the Centurion is getting a HUGE nerf. His punches will no longer be able to stun on walls. Also, they are making the Shinobi less squishy. This may be the start of this con being completely irrelevant.\n\n-Warlord is dead. He was nerfed to the ground so far that he was nerfed to the grave. I've seen very few Warlord players since Season 3's nerf.\n\n-You get currency at a pretty slow rate. Not the biggest problem. Probably the smallest.\n\nI'm just going to wrap up here. If you really feel like picking the game up, go ahead. I'm not leaving For Honor, and I still play it. I just am leaving a negative review in hopes that Ubi does something to fix primarily the balancing issues. Also, if you pick the game up, don't play as Gladiator.

I will agree, I have had the connection issues a few times, but what makes that different from when we where kids playing CoD on consoles?? We dealt with it then. We can deal with it now. The combat mechanics are absolutely incredible, literally nothing like I have played before. Within a few hours I was confident enough to play against my own friends, which have over a hundred hours sunk in. This game has the option of microtransactions. People claim that is an issue, even though you can farm literally everything in the game completely on your own with no issues, whether it's time consuming or not. Overwatch has worse conditions of microtransaction and that game is a lot more loved then this one. I never cared much for Ubisoft, since they like to abandon older games. But this game has potential beyond any of the newer games coming out. This game is a master piece as of gameplay goes, and everything is counterable as long as you have the skill to do so. For the ones who hate this game, even the ones with dozens or even hundreds of hours, take the game into consideration from a different point of view, and realize no game, or anything for that matter, can ever be perfect. Ubisoft can only throw so much money for their next update, and if we continue to hate on this game, they will eventually abandon it plainly because of the terrible community that is being managed by the upper parts of the gaming social media. I paid $30 for this game, and felt like it was still worth the $60 i was going to originally pay. I even bought the season pass to make up for that fact. So far I have seen dozens of reviews claiming the gameplay to be exquisite. Stellar. Fantastic, and much more. Isn't that all that we really need for a game? The gameplay? The key word used as \"game\" as a huge represenation of what gameplay stands for?? I'd stop hating on this game.
