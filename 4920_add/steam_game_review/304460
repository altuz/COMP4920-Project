Although it says it's an adventure... well, it really isn't. It's strictly linear, the interaction feels unnecessary and the \"multiple ending\" part is more of a self-indulgent joke if you ask me. Don't get me started with writing and the story, the game works a lot better if you just ignore it. Oh and there's speciesism everywhere despite the whole \"harmony with nature\" theme it develops later on.\n\nWhat's really nice though, is the vast set of pixel art landscapes it brings you. If you're a sucker for well-done pixel art like me, it's must - imagine Shadow of Colossus style grandness with the visual simplicity of something like Knytt. I would've appreciated better character animation and less repetitive music, though. It just feels like a huge wast to see those awesome background images beeing covered in what feels lackluster.\n\nThat said... I'm kinda torn on this one. I can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't love pixel art and spatial greatness. Personally, I did not regret the 2\u20ac buy during summer sale, but I never would've bought it for the normal price of 10\u20ac. If you have both money to spare and strongly appreciate it's strong points, you should give it a try. But I can't recommend it under different circumstance.", "timestamp_updated": 1498388595, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498388595, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 58, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 30, "total_reviews": 88}}
