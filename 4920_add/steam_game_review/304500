You move rooms and use the mechanisms&utilities inside the rooms to exit.\n\nPros:\n+ Unique mechanics\n+ Nice puzzles\n+ Somewhat has positive production values on art department.\n\nNeutral:\n~ Soundtrack is repetitive\n~ Price is a bit steep for the content.\n\nCons:\n- UI needs some tidying up. Some parts are confusing at first.\n- Easy for puzzle veterans. Needs more challenge.\n\n8/10 Overall a unique puzzle game. Its a great company to have some fun on a lazy afternoon. Dont miss it on sale (-50% recommended).", "timestamp_updated": 1496240911, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496240911, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 17}}
