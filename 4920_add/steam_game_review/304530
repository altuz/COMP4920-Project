I really do. I love Saints Row and was hoping for the same over the top action here. But despite some of its strngths, there is simply no way I can recommend Agents of Mayhem.\n\nGood:\n-The cast, both heroes and villains, is great and diverse. Watching the heroes interact and chat during missions is great(the writing may be off at times, but the consistently great voice acting makes up for it), and gives just enough depth to the characters.\n-Combat. The combat is pretty good, though a few more skills per hero would have been nice(every hero has 1 skill(which can be customized with 1 additional effect) and 1 Ultimate skill(which can again be customized)). Despite this, each hero feels unique to play since everyone has different weapon mechanics and traits(though a few more melee heroes would have been nice), and switching up different combinations of 3 heroes for your party is really fun to explore and play around with.\n-First few hours of gameplay...\n\nBad:\n...remaining hours of gameplay. The game feels like it was incredibly rushed and cobled together during a game jam. There is a handful of activities in the world, and everything, including main missions, is put together from these simple activities.  It gets monotone and repetitive super fast, when all you do is clear the same legion lairs, save hostages, and destroy legion machinery over and over again, without any variation. The open world offers little apart from the endless stream of same side missions which serve as nothing more than opportunities to grind XP and crafting materials.\nThe town of Seoul also feels dead and empty, with perhaps 4 of bland, generic, car types and a handful of people. It lacks any charm or soul of Steelport and Stillwater.\nTerrible balancing. The game has 15 difficulty levels, and on anything over 8-10, any non-tanky character(which has damage to take down the bullet spungy enemies) will get 2-3 shot, which isn't rare considering constant FPS drops when more enemies are around, and even tanky characters go down surprisingly fast. And at max level, anything below difficuly level 10 is insultingly easy.\nAwful driving controls, with nameless radio stations you can go through, each offering 1... if there are more I haven't heard them yet... 1 original song, usually without lyrics. And cars can't go through bushes or up sidewalks...\nTerrible PC port, one of the worst in a long time. Game performs terribly regardless of your specs with constat FPS drops and stuttering at random moments, crashes frequently, and at least for me, ignores my video settings, and randomly changes them every so often. \nThere is also quite a lot of bugs, characters getting stuck in the scenery, impenetrable bushes and inch high sidewalks, dead AI, events not triggering, your abilities refusing to activate until you switch to a different party member and then back.\n\nAgents of Mayhem had the potential to be a great game, you can see it in there through all the bad stuff. Maybe at some point it was, but due to time or money constraints, the game we got was quickly put together in the hopes to earn enough for a sequel. Because storywise, the game just introduces characters and sets up the world, lacking a real proper story which has a beginning, middle and end. If a sequel offered more fleshed out gameplay and better mission design and a bit more character development, I would be all for it.

But it has zero replay value.\n\nThe character swapping was a good idea, but some of the mechanics fall flat:\n\nThe Gremlin tech is totally useless. Its cumbersome to use, juggling the cooldowns and menu-surfing to use it is awkward, the actual benfits from them are too shallow, and once you get the Mulligan (healing) tech, that becomes the only one you'll ever use. (maybe try llinking specific tech to specific characters, so everyone gets their OWN tech. Also try having it activated by specific actions (headshots, reloads, melee kills, etc.) to make them more accessible)\n\nThe overworld map is FAR too small. Fun, and delightfully detailed, but far too small.\nThe minigame touches between missions were a good idea, but are too anemic to be worth playing repeatedly.\n\nProcedurally-generated dungeons are only good if you have a complicated enough process to MAKE them. Otherwise, once you've played on you've played them all.\nThey tried to make multiple objectives available in these lairs, but they come off too generically, and aren't all that much fun.\nAlso...

I bought it because I'm a big Saints Row fan (SR2,3,4,GooH, and all available mission DLC).\n\nThe good\n-  Playable characters are numerous and feel different when you use each of them\n- Writing for the characters, enemies, and storylines is enjoyable and usually funny\n- There are a lot of races/ethnicities represented by the characters, and they don't feel like pure stereotypes or caricatures of those races/ethnicities.  (That said, quite a few straddle the line between archetype and stereotype of the intersection of a character's race or ethnicity and gender and profession.  It never seemed to feel malicious or patronizing though)\n- Grinding for XP isn't that tedious\n- While it's not Saints Row, characters from SR do show up in their own alternate reality way, and it generally works\n- The overall pacing is pretty good and the number of missions seems right for the main missions\n- I like the GI Joe/Saturday morning cartoon feel to it all\n\nThe bad\n- The city feels small, mainly because a lot happens above and below ground level rather than across a lower, wide city\n- A lot of the game is underground lairs that repeat the same few rooms and the same few missions\n- You can fine tune the difficultly level, which is good, but you need to because by midgame you'll be extremely overpowered at all but the highest difficulty levels\n- There are four kinds of attack: normal weapon, special, Mayhem, and \"Gremlin tech\" which is like super-special.  I almost never used Special or Mayhem attacks, and only used one of the many options of Gremlin tech which is a team auto-reincarnate.  As you upgrade, most of your characters will be so overpowered that you just need your basic weapon\n- There's no co-op.  Given the nature of this game, it's a glaringly obvious missing element\n- Every character has a unique weapon, which means a good character with a bad weapon will only be used when absolutely necessary\n- Driving/vehicles are simulaneously awkward and underutilized.  It's a small city, so driving never takes long.  Your vehicles are okay, civilian ones suck, and you can't take enemy ones.  You can't shoot while driving.  There is no SR-type vehicle collecting, or modding, or races.  And no motorcycles, which could work better on the map.  \n- Music isn't really a thing, so don't expect a GTA or SR3 or SR4 soundtrack of licensed music.  What they do have is pretty good though.\n\nI don't regret pre-ordering, and if there is mission DLC I'll buy it.  When the Lazarus character DLC comes out, I'll buy that.  And if they make a sequel (which seems unlikely), I'll pre-order it.  This is by no means a bad game.  It's an ok game with some flashes of good, but it gets undermined by some lack of creativity in mission structure (for the lairs primarily) and half-assing the vehicle part.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1507092933, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507092933, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35238093", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506500889, "steamid": "76561198060586866", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 57}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is very disappointing, i bought the game for $60 dollars and the DLC's, well it download for 4 hours, i clicked play and it never came up, it was in the background running and there was no way for me to do anything, i waited until an Updated, but they never made an Update, it turns out its an AMAZING game, but sadly i was one of these people who couldnt get to play the game.\n\nIts a Huge step up from the Saints row series, but unfortunately i wouldnt want anyone else to be disappointed like i was, so now i have to NOT Recommend this to any Saints Row fans, if i was you, wait until the price goes down.\n\nThe traliers looked fantastic, the gameplay looked great, but i miss the old characters like Kinze, if they make Agents Of Mayhem 2, add her back, her Story made me enjoy Saints row The Third, and Four, but... i didnt get to play this game because i waited so bloody long for this to Download, and it didnt work, so now im very upset, others are having the same problem as i am, and there is no way to fix it.

Fun and entertaining.\nPros:\n+variety of heroes\n+good upgrade systems\n+variety of enemies\n+well-designed city\n+fun driving\n+good loot box variety\n+fun platforming\n\nSuggestions:\n-more boss detail and development\n-more lair textures and variety\n-more customization of characters, weapons and such\n-more variety in races\n-smooth out environment\n-have some more human-like enemies with character\n-more open world activities\n-alternate way to collect shards\n-professor genki\n-workshop\n-coop\n\nPros:\n1. The characters. I think this is the biggest success of the game. The characters are so different and individual and well-developed that they're almost iconic. Seven are male, seven are female (counting Lazarus). They are American, Canadian (wait, Hollywood's Canadian?), Russian, Brazilian, Korean, Japanese, Iranian, Indian, Italian, and Moroccan.\n\nThey not only look different and talk differently, they walk differently, run differently, stand differently, and most of all, play differently.\n\nI absolutely LOVE the fact that it seems like everybody has a different favorite agent. Agents that one person thinks are weak, I think are my strongest agents, and vice versa. The strengths and weaknesses of the characters really work with the playstyles of different players, and I've NEVER seen a game with multiple characters that worked THIS well with players.\n\n2. Character upgrades. Character's have THREE kinds of upgrades: skills, gadgets and Legion tech, and how we choose our upgrades can really affect our play style and the effectiveness of the characters. As well, there's not simply ONE build that works, anymore than there's ONE strongest character everybody plays. The skills and gadgets balance, and again, work with how each character plays. This is SO well-done in this game.\n\n3. The enemies. Think of all the different kinds of enemies we face!\n* standard grunts with assault weapons and grenades\n* snipers\n* the ninja enemies that dart around throwing knives\n* the high level enemies that give shields\n* the high level enemies that have rocket attacks\n* the heavy troopers with shields and high health who do ground-punching attacks\n\nAnd that's just off the top of my head. They advance, they run away. I had a guy hide behind a wall and I had to go get him!\n\nThey fight much more intelligently than in most games I play.\n\n4. The city. The city is beautiful. When you count not only the ground, but also all the levels you can run around on, the actual play surface is HUGE.\n\nThere are a huge number of buildings you can enter, at least partially, and not just lairs, strongholds, or Gremlin meetups, but there are so many buildings with middle levels. I don't know how many times I've blasted out windows in the middle of a high-rise and jumped in. And then there are the underground levels. The city is enormous and has enormous variety.\n\nThere are so many ways to get around. There are elevators and moveable, hackable platforms all over the city. It's a joy just to run around.\n\n5. Driving. This city was specifically DESIGNED for driving, with wide streets, and with most of the intersections made deliberately smooth and wide. There are ramps EVERYWHERE, and lots of things that can be used as ramps. It's just fun to drive.\n\nAnd each vehicles drives and handles just a little bit differently.\n\n6. The chests. I have fun opening chests and seeing what's in there. Money? Supplies? Skins?\n\n7. Platforming. I love running around, jumping around, hopping from building to building. I love trying to figure out how to get to the highest point. I love parkouring my way up places that I think weren't meant to be parkoured.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n1. Introduce some alternate textures for lairs to give a bit more variety. Try adding 3 kinds of lairs: instead of just blue-grey, have different colors and textures, and maybe add some unique traps, or different kinds of enemies, or different objectives. Those details can make those lairs more interesting.\n\n2. More skins. Give us some DLC with character, weapon and vehicle skins!\n\n3. More characters. We have Gat and soon on PC, Lazarus. I'd love to see more! Give us some character DLC with character missions!\n\nI'd love to see a sniper character with a sniper rifle.\n\nI'd love to see a character with a rocket pack (who could reach some of those hard-to-reach shards.\n\nI'd love to have Kiki and Viola as a set, giving us FOUR characters any time Kiki and Viola go out.\n\n4. Add some new races that are a bit different than current races. Add some fun things to the races like speed boosters or jump boosters. Maybe have a kind of race where you run AND shoot targets.\n\n5. Add more open world activities. Let Gat have police missions. Let Joule have missions to fix power problems (recharge generators or something). Have Rama fire special medical arrows to hold back an viral outbreak. Let Yeti put out fires, or have to stand on an ice cream truck and keep icing it down so the ice cream doesn't melt. I don't know.\n\nLet us do some delivery missions, or even a dreaded escort. You have a lot of good activities like races, getting cars, destroying enemy vehicles, destroying lairs and outposts, but it would be fun to have some more casual activities that are just FUN, and don't involve combat or racing.\n\n6. Professor Genki. Professor Genki needs to be in this game as an enemy to defeat, like the golems or ice machines. Let him show up and cause everybody to dance to death or something. Have him control armies of cabbits or whatever those floppy-eared things are.\n\n7. Get that workshop mod support here. Give us easy-to-use tools that will allow ANYBODY to create a new character, create new skins or characters, vehicles or weapons, allow us to create new races, new missions, new bosses, new gadgets, new skills, new legion tech, etc etc. etc.\n\n8. Coop. C'mon. I know you won't do it, but seriously? Coop would nail this game down in history. \n\n9.  For AoM 2, consider cutting back as much as possible on awnings and eaves and other overhangs that get in the way of parkouring.  Try to leave openings as much as possible to allow free, flowing parkouring around.\n\n10.  Consider having another way of reaching some difficult-to-reach shards.  Some of us aren't good at some kinds of platforming.

The whole character switching had me skeptical untill I nuked ten enemies with some ridiculous debuffs. That being said this game has flaws.\n\nPros\n+Fast and fluid gameplay, the quick swap works wonderfully and the dash is awesome\n+Robust character selection with each character having many gameplay styles\n+Beautifully made open world city with verticality in mind and lots of RAMPS\n+Enemy design is varied, just like sr3 with different enemy units that fit a specific role\n+Vehicle mechanics, while shallow, feel nice and the city is built for them\n+Main story missions are fun and varied enough with lots of character\n+Art style is fantastic and so are the graphics, very easy on the eyes.\n\nMixed opinions\n~Despite being repetitive, legin lairs are decent, but get old quick. Needs more art variatey, different colors rooms, anything to fool me into thinking im in a DIFFERENT legion lair.\n~Story has great characters but the story itself is rather shallow, only because the 12 characters dont stick with you all the way through, you are the one involed into it, not them. The story itself is basic, evil dude wants power thing, you need to stop him and his friends from getting thing and conquering seul, not much more than that.\n~Activites are awesome and break up the monotney of legion lairs, but since legion tech is ONLY availible in legion lairs, they are practically worthless, wich is a shame since they are fun, just not rewarding.\n\nBad\n-Vehicle combat, in an effort to force you to use the agetns for combat, they made vehicles stricly melee. This makes the car-fu just feel bland, dodgy and unfun. Could have worked if the vehicles had anti-vehicle abilites like missiles or spikes, but they dont.\n-Small sandbox. The map is too small, while it has some great verticality and heights, it still feels like one half of a real sandbox.\n-FORCED Jokes, and i mean FORCED. If its not delivered by the main agents, the humor is so badly delivered it makes my skin crawl.\n----DENUVO, this drm murders preformance in some systems, ABSOLUTTELY the deal breaker for this game,\n\nI love this game but it feels a lot like saints row 1 or RF Guerilla, a good concept and game that needs to expand into a sequel to truley shine.", "timestamp_updated": 1506927473, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506927473, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35026985", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505661913, "steamid": "76561198136763723", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First off i would like to say that i like the combat.  It does tend to keep you on your feet and makes it so you actully have to move around the battle area and sometimes think outside the box.  The fact that you can have a tank, fast attack, and a ninja in your group at the same time is cool, you can have an agent for most any situation.\nI would like to say though that i hate the driving system, you use the same keys on the keybord that make your agents move to drive the car, when you call the car the controls of your agent and the view you have are almost impossible to get used to the first two or three times you call the car, and how on earth did the people think that using the same controls to drive the car and you use to walk around outside the car was a good idea (sorry had to bring that up again).  i can't even drive on the roads in game without crashing into every car and street light in the area.  When i am playing i dont dare use the turbo.\nThe only other thing i don't like is that for the most part the game could have been done a little better when it comes to story, I will admit i only played for maybe a hour or two when i am posting this but the storie seems a little to much like a run of the mill \"Bad guy has a plan and a group of heros have to stop it.  Heros get new members added to the team and bad guys had people that where more then willing to help just out right join.\" stuff that happens most any action movie.\nOverall, I do like the game to an extent and i will keep playing, but i would suggest that you look into this game a bit before you do buy this one.  I know i don't speak for everyone so just think on it a bit and i do admit this game has some fun parts, but don't expect a well rounded game.  this one does have it's flaws.", "timestamp_updated": 1505664149, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505664149, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34747319", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501065", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505252310, "steamid": "76561198065629080", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Except the cringy jokes and the bad optimization this game is pretty fun to play.
