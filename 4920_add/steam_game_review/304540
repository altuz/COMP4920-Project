[/b] \n... is not a perfekt Game, but its one of the few Freestyleski Games on PC. Clearly you cant compare it with the new Game called SNOW here on Steam. This one is from 2007 and the grafics always remind you on that. \nBUT its a really fun Game and it has great chellanges. Its a Game you could play for 1000 of hours like I did with the non-Steam version.\nI would recommend this Game to every Skier, especially to Freeskiers out there.\n\nKeep on Ridin^^", "timestamp_updated": 1465303131, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425137827, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "14290701", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510537", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1443490394, "steamid": "76561198002094837", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Visually the game looks a lot like SSX 3, but you can change the screen size to match current monitors and add antialiasing. You have a selection of about six skiers, and you can customize them with different clothes and gear. I was a little disappointed in the overall lack of customization. It's enough that you can pick an outfit you like, but you probably wont be satisfied with the selection of hats, pants, and jackets. Either way I've seen more customization in other snow games (Amped comes to mind). It's not bad, but it's not great.\n\nGameplay is challenge based, and remember it's a freestyle game so no races. Challenges come down to gaps, rails, pickups, and score challenges. The skiing is very smooth and responsive. Big jumps feel satisfying, and nailing a huge off-axis spin feels great. Crashes are physics based, so your character rag dolls down the hill and your skis fly off in all directions. The game also has controller support for two players with customizable buttons. I personally use a wired xbox 360 controller and it works fine.\n\nThere are about 5 mountain environments to traverse, all various backcountry areas. So far each run is about 2 minutes long from top to bottom, with multiple runs per different area. It is NOT a single mountain. Instead you select a mountain on the main menu and then select which run. The challenges are interesting enough to keep you occupied, which is good because there isn't any story. Also keep in mind that this is a semi-old game, so the music is completely dated.\n\nSo why do I recommend this game even with limited customization, old music, and no races? Because the core gameplay is very solid and intuitive. The skiing is fluid and feels great for an arcade style game. I also haven't experienced any pc problems with this game, so it is very stable. For ten bucks, you could do a lot worse. Is it the best ski/board game I've ever played? No. But it's also nowhere near the worst. A very satisfying ski game for the price.", "timestamp_updated": 1422845673, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422845595, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "17543470", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474872", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1438578324, "steamid": "76561198050500356", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "this game is realy fun and realy nice :) however this is not a game for the new and stylish skiers", "timestamp_updated": 1439599569, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439599569, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "17280273", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491892", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1485540414, "steamid": "76561198019218926", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 244, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Super!", "timestamp_updated": 1438168732, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438168732, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "31209088", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497624", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1486864675, "steamid": "76561198065534670", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 183, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Freaked out", "timestamp_updated": 1492471186, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492471186, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29569131", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495691", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1485710767, "steamid": "76561198028180223", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "NO gamepad support", "timestamp_updated": 1485710997, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485710997, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "16398856", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497874", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1434503353, "steamid": "76561198042718553", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The partial contorller support is broken.. half the buttons wont map.", "timestamp_updated": 1434312217, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434312217, "votes_down": 12}, {"recommendationid": "16630553", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497334", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1435005218, "steamid": "76561198038828453", "num_games_owned": 612, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Game has real potential to be fun, a bit reminiscent of SSX on Tour. Too bad the controls SUCK SO TOTALLY. You cannot properly map the controls to a gamepad and once you try you cannot even reset to the Default keyboard controls so you are doubly buggered. Considering it was released for PS2 and worked with a controller on that platform it is just a very poor effort by the devs with the shoddy controls on this PC port. This factor alone ruins what could have been a fun game. If you are used to proper controls, \u00e0 la SSX, you will NOT like this game. You have been warned.
