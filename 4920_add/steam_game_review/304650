There is so much to say, and yet only so much I can say if I don't want my review to be one massive spoiler. I will try anyway. Before I begin, though, and because the outstanding quality of this game is based on its writing, I must say that english is not my foreign language : I am good enough at it to understand everything it says, and yet not familiar enough not to find myself spellbound by some of the turns of phrase I encountered. Which will help me adress the first point of my review : although the game hasn't been translated, as long as you have some bases, you can still very well enjoy it even if english isn't your first language, and perhaps even more so than an english native speaker could, because of the exotic dimension there is in reading good writing in a foreign language you understand.\n\nLet's be fair : Sunless Sea's success was an unlikely series of risky gambles. First of all, the gameplay is tedious : you lead your ship from island to island at an incredibly sluggish speed ; the fights lack a strategic dimension and any kind of suspense or chance for you to take on bigger opponents before your ship is armed to the teeth ; the permadeath system, while keeping you on your toes, forces you to replay through the same stories over and over again ; a single wrong choice in a storyline's development can have incredibly punishing and dramatic consequences. By Failbetter's own admission, the roguelike part of the game was a failure. \n\nAnd yet the writing saves it all. Whether this was purely by luck or the result of machiavellian calculation is unclear, but the fact is that the tedious, clunky, harrowing gameplay, which often makes you feel miserable and desperate, works towards the incredible tension that comes from knowing that you will soon discover a key element of the storyline you are currently pursuing. There is something inherently british about this game : it wants failure to really hurt the player. This makes the bit of text you are to unlock next all the more desirable and precious. Sunless Sea feeds the compelling spell of its mysteries with your player tears. All this time you've been spending doing basically nothing while cruising the zee from port to port has secretly been used by the game to build up your expectations.\n\nIt goes deeper. I will try to keep this paragraph as spoiler-free as possible, but there is one particular storyline that openly defies one of the principles modern games are based on : gain. That particular storyline alone is worth buying and playing the game, because it is the single best thing I have experienced in a videogame since playing Pathologic and The Void (by Ice-Pick Lodge). Rather than rewarding you for pursuing it, that storyline demands more and more sacrifices from your character and yourself - because if you reach that point, it means you have been investing time and effort into that captain- to the point where said storyline ends up requiring that you destroy your character to be able to continue and finish it. You will be paid in words only, but oh what wonderful words those are. Even now that more than two years have passed since I finished that particular storyline (of which I will only say that the word \"Salt\" now holds a whole different meaning to me), I still find myself reciting a few lines of that text in my head, and the world around suddenly seems painted in strange colours.\n\nThe writing itself is kaleidoscopic. The main writer is Alexis Kennedy, founder and former member of Failbetter Games, and his style is incisive, concise, beautiful, and entirely aimed at freaking you out, but lots of islands' content has been written by guest writers, and thus the writing style, while always of high quality, is quite variable : sometimes it will be short and evocative, sometimes it will consist of extended, detailed descriptions, and so on.\n\nI will try to keep this review relatively short. Sunless Sea is a game I have been playing since Early Access, when most of the islands and content weren't implemented yet. I have been fascinated and obsessed about its secrets for years now. Imagine a captivating book that requires you to cut your own right hand to be able to read the last chapters, and you will have a pretty good idea of what Sunless Sea is essentially about. If you don't enjoy reading and self-inflicted pain, keep walking. If you do, Sunless Sea is an exceptional, overwhelming experience, albeit cruelly unforgiving and gleefully unconcerned about your spare time.\n\nAlso cannibalism.", "timestamp_updated": 1505082197, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505082123, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35055902", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504607", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506989458, "steamid": "76561198030124232", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 572}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Possibly the best game in \"This is realy hard to enjoy\" game tag.
