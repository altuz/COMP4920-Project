Unfortunately, reports of it being incomplete and buggy are actually pretty spot-on.\n\nI played for a little over an hour, and in that time I had to restart multiple games, mainly because pathing became broken.\n\nFor example: Build a road between two resource points - set up a couple of cart-horses to transport goods from one to another via their respective stations. It all goes well for a while, and the money starts to flow.\nThen I build another road, attaching to the existing road, to allow me to transport in a third resource.\n\nSuddenly, my cart horses leap across the map, and are on the new road, ignoring their old route. I wait, thinking that they'll return once they get to the end. Nope. The horses disappear, and the carts just sit there, racking up maintenance bills until I run out of money again.\n\nIf this was a one-off, I would have been OK with it, and put it down to a glitch... but it seems I can't add any connections to roads which have 'routes' attached to them without something screwing up. This is pretty fundamental, and makes the game too awkward to play.\n\nI loved the concept of this game, but the execution is incomplete.
