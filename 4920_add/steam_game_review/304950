Which is odd because of the things it offers. It gives you more clothing, which is a thing the devs already use the level constraints for normally, and more 'daily quests', which they should have gave you to begin with.\n - One generic, looping music track through the entire game.\n - There are little to no sound effects, and what\u2019s there is really bland and usually consists of a single tone. There's not even a stepping sound when you move.\n - All of the \"characters\" in the game are not actually characters. They are either walking stereotypes or just really obvious and bland (of course the bird is a pilot and the fox is a pirate). Sometime a character is even both (there's a llama clothing dealer/hairstylist).\n - Very little you actually do in the game. You can fish and catch bugs, both of which are stupidly easy and require a single mouse click and little to no thought or timing. You pick up trash and weeds, and remove rocks, which is as fun as you think it is. You wait for crops and trees to slowly grow (the trees take an hour or more to produce fruit). You also do those stupid back and forth missions everyone has always hated.\n - The quests you do for characters are also just holdovers from the mobile version. There is the magical sidebar with character pictures that all scummy mobile games have, and all of the quests were obviously roadblocks in the mobile game. Very few of them have to do with going back and forth. Most of the quests either involve planting something (which, in the mobile version, you would have to wait for a long time for it to grow unless you paid up), or buying something for them (which, I'm assuming, you'd have to spend a high amount a buyable currency to do).\n - Rather bland art style. Which means that the two things the rely on visual appearance, the clothing and furniture, are also rather bland. The art is not even that high effort, as I'm pretty sure anyone can create things entirely out of a small number of flat planes.\n - Finally, the price, which is the worst offence in my book. I'd be perfectly happy with paying five dollars for this game. It's not very good, but it would serve as an alright filler game that you buy with other more interesting titles. However, I can't justify paying fifteen dollars for this. You can get way, WAY better for that price.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1501024410, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501024410, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "33849934", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501599", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504462664, "steamid": "76561198137696494", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Cute as hell.
