In those type of degrees, a significant mistake on a draft can result in a large profit loss.\n\n[h1]Expensive?[/h1]\nIt was the first drafting software available on Steam.  Much of the prices on the more professional software available through Steam are kind of smokey, if you know what I mean.  For example, Maya, Modo, and Substance Designer/Painter all have modified licenses for use and some are less capable.  This is the full version of SolidFace with full licensing, with the catch being drive locked.  The opensource options for drafting are BRL-CAD, OpenSCAD, FreeCAD, and LibreCAD.  The opensource options, except for BRL-CAD, are very young compared to SolidFace.\n\n[h1]The Pros - SolidFace 2015[/h1]\n1. SolidFace does good prints\n2. SolidFace does good 3D drafting (2016 supports STL)\n3. Works though feels a bit quirky with tool use (2016 feels less quirky)\n4. It's a reliable solid modeler\n5. It's inexpensive\n6. The geometry outputs I've done have reliably imported into other programs\n7. the crash testing appears to be reliable in testing animated geometry crossing geometry\n\n[h1]The Cons - SolidFace 2015[/h1]\n1. The tutorials are not equal to tutorials available for opensource drafting software\n2. Not 2016.  2015 on Steam was experimenting with the Steam market, which was considered not profitable enough to warrant bringing 2016 to Steam.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's a capable CAD modeler available with the convenience of Steam on a non-rental basis.  That's a lot to like.\n\n[i]rewrite; most comments deleted as I assumed version 2016 was coming to Steam[/i]\n\n(*) mged, in [url=http://brlcad.org/gallery/]BRL-CAD[/url], is useful for 3D, and it's markup is wonderfully logical, though it doesn't seem designed toward 2D drafts.", "timestamp_updated": 1486268621, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "28", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438050352, "votes_down": 60}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1}}
