Yes, it is old, and hard - recommended 1st person driving (which makes it more realistic and much more harder than 3rd person driving that's available among other viewing options) and only ... Rallys (which means you compete, eventually, against the clock), no midgame saving - no room for mistakes. Car models are false, but resemble real life models.\nBut, you can still choose from different cars, you can change the wheels and etc. and adapt the cars to each rally. The difficulty in Arcade mode is pretty easy (well, only at first), while in Simulation the races are very hard since even 1 accident (with a tree or something else on the road) means you lost precious time. All of this makes finishing 1st feelling very rewarding.\n\nHelp/Spoiler: Advancing is very hard without significantly improving your car. If you find it hard to go on - go back, and race again where you already won - you race against the same drivers with same cars as before, while your car should be improved, and therefor it's much easier to win and get easy money."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1408910203, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506020", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11851454", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197999813772", "num_reviews": 39, "last_played": 1441655549, "num_games_owned": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 763}, "timestamp_updated": 1408910245, "received_for_free": false, "review": "For me this is still far the best rally game.
