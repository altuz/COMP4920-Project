Therefore the last paragraph has been changed.[/b]\n\nThe video is available here:\nhttp://youtu.be/K5mOC-wBvcE\n\nAs someone who loves plattformers, I thought I'd give this game a try, so I did just that and here are my first impressions.\n\nFirst off: The game is a HD remake, but it is not a case of just having its resulution upped. Sprites, backgrounds etc. were updated so it looks like a relatively modern title now.After taking a look at gameplay footage of the original game though, the animations, the physics, as well as the soundtrack are the exact same, as far as I can tell. You can call it staying true to the original or developer laziness...whatever you want to call it, I won't judge you.\n\nBefore we go into the game itself, we take a look at the options first, which provide us with fully rebindable controls. The audio options are fairly standard with seperate sliders for music, sound effects and ambient sounds. The graphics options are Unity standard: Low, Medium and High as well as standard resolutions are avaiable to chose.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to mention that, even though it is stated on the store page that this game has full controller support, I couldn't get my XBOX Controller to work with this game. So that is a big issue, at least for me, because I like to play plattformers with a controller better. \n [b]Update: After using the guide of the devs (which you can find in the comments), I was able to make the controller work, which enhances the experience greatly, in my opinion. [/b]\n\nAs we get into the game the first thing many people will notice is that the way the momentum as well as the physics feel in that game is quite odd. So might take a little time getting used on the \"oldschool\" style of movement and momentum there. After playing the first level my experience with the combat is that is very shallow, which is good for new players, but it hurts the longevity of the game. Since it only  has 4 levels and I have been through the first level within 30 minutes it is safe to assume that the game lasts about 2-3 hours. \n\nIf you are an achievementhunter you might go back to some levels, but at this point I'd like to point out an issue which might take you your completionist enthusiasm. Sometimes, mostly when collecting a lot of stuff at once, it seems to me that the game is not recognizing you picking up items. Some items even take 3-4 attemps to count as collected, even though you've clearly hit it the tries before that. \n\nSpeaking of hitbox issues, the hitbox of walls as well as the ground when you try to shoot enemies takes a lot of getting used to. \n\nFor both issues you'll see examples in the video, I've made.\n\nAnother issue I've encountered is that I don't see what potion currently is active, which was the case when playing the tutorial. In the game itself it is not shown though. It seemed to me that the potion mechanic is not working properly, but this could be my mistake. \n\nOther than that I have to say that the potion mechanic sounds nice in theory and it's a shame, I couldn't see it in action.\n\n\nFinally the question of questions: Is the game worth it? [b]At the current state, I say you can give it a shot, but keep in mind that the issues mentioned above make it hard for me to wholeheartedly recommend you this game. \nIf you feel the same way as I do, you might be better off buying it at a sale.[/b]", "timestamp_updated": 1405947068, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405885408, "votes_down": 16}, {"recommendationid": "15620000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498984", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1477232454, "steamid": "76561198166546343", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fantastic game.

But I\u2019ve been told that others have liked playing it and at least some are quite fond of it.\n\nPersonally I had a bit of trouble figuring out the controls at the start. It\u2019s a little bit more than just move, jump and attack. You also need to know the buttons to use and scroll through your inventory and potions. Take a look at the key-bindings in the main menu before starting the game and this shouldn\u2019t be an issue for you (it was my fault for not going back and looking for that at the start).\n\nEnemies take a lot more shots from your weapon than I\u2019m used to compared other games. So I just ran past most of them lol\n\nManeuvouring and platforming can be a bit tricky and might take some getting used to. Taking your finger off the shift button (sprint) when you need to more finely control your rabbit might help in some situations. (edit: after writing this I booted up the game and in the loading screen it said 'learn to jump, it is critical' lol)\n\nSo yeah, give it ago you might like. I may update this if I get a chance to play the game some more.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/cEdlW0aUp3A\nClick [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SatanovichZ1/videos]here[/url] for more let\u2019s play videos =)", "timestamp_updated": 1405774499, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405723376, "votes_down": 24}, {"recommendationid": "12296416", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489013", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494918178, "steamid": "76561198110612469", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "That's one CRAZY bunny!!!!", "timestamp_updated": 1412045022, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412045022, "votes_down": 12}, {"recommendationid": "11513539", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471768", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1406936957, "steamid": "76561198144355475", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "None of the keyboard controls worked, so I could not play this at all.
