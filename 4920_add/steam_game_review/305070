Those tassels. 10/10\n\n\nFist of Awesome is a fun game but got kinda boring fast for me. It just didn't have much going for it besides the punching bears bit. The game isn't that long, a single playthrough can be done in one sitting. This isn't surprising as the game was originally a mobile (and Ouya) game. It's a very simplified version of a game like Streets of Rage with regenerating health and no pick-up items. You level up as you play and unlock stat points to powerup your Health, Power, Speed and Special. The Arena mode looks to be a survival mode where you get to play as any character in the game that you've faced off against and other special characters. It doesn't add much enjoyment to the game sadly. Overall the game is horribly repetitive and offers little to no \"replayability.\"\n\nYou also fight velociraptors and deer alongside bears. I like the final choice, didn't see it coming.\n\nI'd recommend this game as a casual beat-em-up to play when you want a quick game. Although at full price it's not worth it really, but if you can get it at a discount it's a decent buy.\n\nFor the regular price of $7.99 or even the current sale price of $6.79 it isn't that good of a deal.\nYou can find the game cheaper on mobile platforms: $3.99 on iTunes and the Play Store and $1.99 on the android Amazon Store", "timestamp_updated": 1404940414, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404492061, "votes_down": 29}, {"recommendationid": "11523261", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 78, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544825", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1407000283, "steamid": "76561197962156510", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "I shouldve known what I was getting into with the quirky name, but thought I would give it a chance for just 4$.

It looked like a fun arcade fighter. But in reality its nothing but a pack of lies.\n\nLet's start with the enemies first. \nThe devs found it a great idea to create only two real enemy types: Bears, which are the level's boss enemies, and, also bears? I can't  tell if the second enemy type are bears since the bosses are clearly defined as bears but the common enemy looks more akin to a human-bear-squirrel freak of nature. And while there are several variations of this Humabearrel each one does the EXACT. SAME. GODDAMN. THING. It feels as though I'm playing the same level over, and over, and over again. It goes like this: fight squirbearmen, fight actual bear, go to next level. The silly gimmicks of traveling through time don't change the enemies at all except for amount of health, which, while im on that little part, IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS. You start off with the \"bear\"(don't get me started on how much they used this goddamn pun) minimum of damage that youre able to cause and each enemy has health into the hundreds. Endlessly doing single digit damage on an enemy that you know will take forever to defeat is tedious as all hell and gets boring after all of ten seconds. And the enemies never end either. You all must know about how in a normal arcade beat 'em up how you fight maybe one or two enemies already waiting for you and then three or so more jump out and attack, correct? Well in this game I constantly found myself against hordes of freaky squirrelbear shits, wondering when, oh when, will I be able to move on? Combine that with their massive healthbars ad you see why it took me 2.2 hours to finish what should have been a mayyyyyybe 45 minute game. Fucking A, did i hate those endless, boring, tedious parts. Not to mention the bears send you flying on every hit and the manbearpigfuckers stand over your napping body to wail on you every time you get up. And by wail, I MEAN WAIL. Every hit from them stops you from moving and if you're trapped between them well gg no re to you cause you're fucked.\n\nAnd now they storyline. This has spoilers, so if you plan on buying this game (protip: fucking don't its horrible) avoid this \narea.\nSo the story is youre Tim McFuckface, some random ass lumberjack guy (had to interpret this from his clothing) who ALL OF A SUDDEN gains a talking fist named, you certainly guessed it, Fist of Awesome. This fist's entire purpose is that it guides you in your quest, and even that wasn't explained all too well. In reality all it really does is help make shitty, shitty jokes and un-BEAR-able puns. Tim here and his mighty jerk-it hand suddenly arrive in an alternate reality where bears rule. So what's the first reasonable action you ask?\nThey punch deers.\nI don't know about you but this is flawless. 10/10. roll end credits.\nBut seriously,  shit's bad man.\nSo anyway you realize bears are the true enemy and go on a long ass adventure where you learn that somehow the bears have a time transport train that brings them back in time to breed with past bears and create new super bears and repeat. I could not be making this up. That is how it goes.\nSo you beat the time machine to explosive death and save your world, right? \nOf course not it's never that easy, because the bears have fixed the machine and made everything worse. Bow Bear-ba Fetts fight you as you make youre way to Bear-hatten and into a strip club called \"Bare Bears\" where you find OH HEY ITS FOA'S BROTHER WHO AS IT TURNS OUT STARTED ALL OF THIS SHIT AND KILLED HIS BROTHER WHO IS NOW YOUR HAND MAKES SENSE AMIRITE GUIYS????????????\nSo this fucker then transforms into a massive bear thing and you kick the crap out of him and you win. Fist of Awesome somehow stops possessing your hand and it turns out its now your wedding day. You then talk to some people and accidently walk into a guy who calls you lover and gives you a big sloppy kiss cause it turns out thats the gay ending. Literally.\n\nAll in all, 0/10 worst game ever.\nMuch bad.\nDo not buy for any amount of money.\nDon't even buy it for free.\nIt's that level of complete shit.\n0/10 game that runs on the 0/10 engine with 0/10 graphics 0/10 storyline and a 0/10 soul. \nFUCK\nTHIS \nGAME", "timestamp_updated": 1412913813, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412913813, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "11564493", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511262", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1406927591, "steamid": "76561197990726050", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's not the worst game I've played, but I've definitely played better.

Can you punch bears in this game? Yes, a lot.\nAnd here's a longer one. The reason I got the game in the first place is that I had a discount for it. And to be honest probably wouldn't have bought it if I didn't, however it won me over with its promise of flannel shirts, manly beards and a peculiar self-aware sense of humor. And that it delivered. The game has character. It has an appealing visual design, a great soudtrack to keep you motivated during the bear punching and a story probably written by H.G.Wells himself (probably not true).\nNow the 'punching' itself is not one of the game's strongest atributes. The problem lies in the lack of variety in combat, especially in the boss battles. You end up finding a single strategy that works for you and then using it for the entire game. That is partially mended by the Arena game mode, which has tons of challanges that force you to change and improve your play style.\nFinal vedict. I am probably in the minority here, by saying it's good. Not great, but good.

I laughed and tapped my foot through every level, and immediately started my second play through on a higher difficulty after finishing the game. This game has the perfect blend of great art and music style, humor and fluid game play, and one of the best credit theme songs of all time. Fist Of Awesome is priced perfectly and left me with a smile on my face and nostalgia in my heart. This is a great indie title and has earned 7.5 out of 10 from me.\n\nSTORY\nThe story of Fist Of Awesome is a timeless tale about a lumberjack called Tim Burr, who must fight his way to the truth, and set right the timeline that has seen his home destroyed and his family taken from him. Tim is empowered with the mighty Fist Of Awesome, a talking hand that guides his travels through the damaged timelines searching for the cause of the temporal disturbance. Along his journey Tim must face off against super advanced bears, deer and buffalo who due to the timeline alterations have risen to be the dominant power on Earth.\n\nFist Of Awesome's story is silly, but that is what I fight Bears was aiming for, and each funny one liner, pop culture reference or throw back to old school gaming is so perfectly delivered that the player will have a great time and laugh right through to the end. The fist play through of the story will take the average gamer no more than an hour to complete but with this in mind I was not disappointed by the playtime, and instead finished the game feeling that I had a great bit of fun getting there.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nFist Of Awesome's controls will be instantly familiar to anyone who has spent some time playing side scrolling fighting games and are easy to get the hang of. The combat is basic in concept but as enemies become more resilient in the higher levels a degree of strategy is required to progress. Each time zone Tim progresses through culminates in a boss fight which is started off with some funny dialogue and are a decent challenge to the player.\nTim gains points and levels up throughout the stages depending on the combos the player can land, and is able to allocate one point to life, strength, speed or special per level. I had a great time with the general game play and leveling system, with the only let down being that enemy types were a bit too samey, and didn\u2019t use their type specific attacks often enough.\n\nVISUALS & MUSIC\nThe 8-bit art and music style of Fist Of Awesome is brilliant, and further enhances the comedy of the game. I found each level to be entertaining and beautiful in its own way, and enjoyed the well paced soundtrack throughout this crazy adventure. \n\nFor my full review and heaps of other delicious content see [url=http://glitchnews.com.au/2014/07/13/fist-of-awesome-game-review/]Glitch[/url]", "timestamp_updated": 1413442545, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413442498, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "12483112", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499616", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1454255199, "steamid": "76561197989239997", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Got this game one sale for a buck. best dollar i ever spent", "timestamp_updated": 1413247077, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413247077, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "12467581", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500511", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1413146608, "steamid": "76561198074280793", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Ever wondered what it'd be like to punch a bear?
