It used to be if you were successfully attacked other than having to repair a few units you didn't actually lose very much cash you have accumulated in the game. Now a large portion of your cash is actually gone. In some ways this is great because it is more realistic and gives you incentives of building up better defenses. However, I can no longer build up in game currency fast enough to purchase items anymore so I'm either forced to pay real money to buy camo to protect me, or I have to pay real money to upgrade items. The most disturbing thing is today for example I was attacked by a level 136 player and I am only a level 36 so obviously they are going to wipe me out. I was never attacked by players that large before. As my upgrades are at a point I need to accumulate almost 2 million dollars to upgrade items I have a lot of \"cash\" on my base while I'm saving and it tells you how much cash they have and that they can win. So I'm an attractive victim. Even worse if I go to attack others there are now almost no players at a level I have a chance of winning that have any cash to win anymore anymore so I can't gather cash that way either. Basically what it seems to boil down to is there are not enough people playing this game anymore and it relies on the number of people playing to survive this model.", "timestamp_updated": 1486420105, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486420105, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "30066810", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413696", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1487626721, "steamid": "76561197994729886", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "TBD", "timestamp_updated": 1487626745, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487626745, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "29770809", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499935", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1490746506, "steamid": "76561198292751935", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "good game", "timestamp_updated": 1486506971, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486506971, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "30219013", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499319", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498303506, "steamid": "76561198290476547", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Good\n", "timestamp_updated": 1488200091, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488200091, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29710238", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497448", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1488290646, "steamid": "76561198273643989", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Real Strategy gameplay, with realism.
