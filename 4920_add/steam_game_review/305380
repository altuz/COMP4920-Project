But the story is confusing and the end makes no sense. It is somewhat funny but heavily juvenile.  The real problem is that it's just too repetitive to me. Once I completed the game, I had no interested in repeating the story just to get the badges. Yes, I did want to shoot more people in their package but not enough to play it again. I lost interest. Loads of other people love this game though so take this for what it's worth.", "timestamp_updated": 1505782538, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505782538, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "35148366", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506791651, "steamid": "76561197967962246", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fun to play.
