The midpoint in the Heileen story, this one adds a new mechanic, a bit of an experiment at least to my eyes. The tarot card mechanic influences the ending you might receive (though one ending happens before the cards even come into play). As for what ending of the prior one this feeds off of... well, none of them. You are stranded on this desert island with the two would-be slaves. Lora, Marie, and John only appear in the wierd dreams that are related to the tarot deck. (And considering you have a cat that talks to you... the entire thing might be a hallucination).\n\n And it really isn't a tarot deck at all (well, not one I've heard of), as it consists of the seven deadly sins on one side and the seven godly virtues on the other. There are fifteen endings, one for each of the sins and virtues, plus one if you are... indifferent.\n\nThis game is mainly good for both the interesting mechanic (it is... [i]different[/i]), and because it introduces you to more characters in the Heileen saga. All of which (and some from the first volume) are potential love interests in the end of the trilogy.\n\nNow, while I cannot be certain... I think the Chastity ending in this game is the most likely lead in to the final one (at the very least one of the pirate endings is).", "timestamp_updated": 1493552614, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493552583, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 12}}
