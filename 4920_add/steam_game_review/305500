Each character has a different storyline so picking a new character to play with will give you a new story and new objectives to completing their path.  In addition, each character has their own individual strengths and abilities so you will have to use those particular attributes to their fullest in order to capitalize on what each character is best at.  The skill trees for each character is individualized giving you access to new unique defensive abilities and attack moves as you progress through the story.  The action is fast-paced and tactile so if you are not familiar with your characters abilities, getting swarmed by zombies is inevitable.\n\nMachetes, knives, pistols, axes, tasers, bows, shotguns, rifles, grenades, magic crosses and vehicles.  These are just a few of the literally hundreds of different weapons that are at your disposal for dispatching the walking dead. You have the choice of wielding either two different weapons or one very powerful two-handed weapon.\n\nThe sound effects and soundtrack in the game are very well done.  The moaning of the zombies, the crackle of rifle report and the hacking of zombie flesh are all high quality sound effects and help to present a town that has gone to hell in a hand-basket with most of its population being turned into the undead.\n\n[b][i]Trapped Dead: Lockdown[/i][/b] isn\u2019t the worst hack and slash game I have ever played, but it definitely isn\u2019t the best one either.
