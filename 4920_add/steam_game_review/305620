I have a good feeling more stuff is to come. Sandbox is a great mode, and contrary to the norm im seeing in the comments I think Story mode is great too. One thing I think that seprates my response from others Is i didn't spend forever in sandbox mode. I spent 8 hours, which let me get the hang of controls. 8 hours on peaceful mode at that. It made it so story modes tutorials weren't really that bad. I never have problems with fetch quests because theres wolves that will get you, theres no time limit really for the quests so you can explore still as well. Also most games I've played have had fetch quests. Open world games are usually fetching or looking for things.\n\nPersonally, I love the game because it does force you to survive. You have to survive wolves, bears, rather food, water, hunt, worry about the cold, scavenge, treat yourself for various injuries you get, and you have to manage how much you carry and how much you use something.

Easy controls, easy to learn how to survive, massive maps and play locations, but the Wintermute story mode ruined this game for me. It starts off so quickly with semi-intense situations, learning the ropes of the new interface (not an improvement), and many flashbacks to the story line, but after you climb out of the ravine the plane crashed in the story progression all but completely stops.\n\nThe new interface is too slow to respond and the game doesn't have a great frame rate, but that could possibly be my system.There are a lot of items that should be interactive that aren't (branches that look usable, Astrid's backpack in the ravine, etc.) and there are many things that are clickable that serve no purpose (radios and visors in vehicles).\n\nI really wish they wouldn't have DESTROYED the 40+ hours of play I put into this game before the update, but at least they warned all of us that they would be removing our save files due to the update and a \"new way to save\" the game - instead of periodically saving the game now ONLY saves when you sleep. There are \"checkpoints\" you can reset to when you die, but they're not identified when you reach them so I'm not sure where they are. They could be new locations, when your character makes an observation, etc. I don't know.\n\nMy advice, play this on a console (I believe it's only out for the PC and PS4), DON'T pay the full price for it, and don't bother with the Wintermute story mode.", "timestamp_updated": 1507088004, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507088004, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34751433", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504365362, "steamid": "76561197983168733", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Well i wanted to wait for the story mode for this review. Anyway Long Dark is a survival game with sandbox mode. Sandbox is too sandboxy you can even sell your whole sandbox survival exprience to survival shows on tv.

Time is the real currency meanwhile your needs are like secondary objectives\n-Did i mentioned survival part of the game?\n-Sandbox\n-Challenges are fun\n-Achievments(in game) are also fun\n-Canada\n\nCons:\n-After some time it gets boring and you wanna rush stuff. So instead of spending large amounts of time with the game, taking it in small doses are better in the long run\n-MC is unable to jump over simple stuff like low walls, fallen trees\n-Medical aspect is just there.

Give or take?  About two years ago during the spring, for reference, as of this writing.  So while I don't feel like I've put in the time this game deserves, despite having about 125 hours on it as of this review, I've definitely seen it grow and evolve, making changes for both better and the worse.  Fortunately, it's mostly been for the better.  \n\nThe real draw for this game, in my opinion, is Survival Mode.  With four difficulties, its a pretty outstanding experience.  This game isn't easy to learn, I'll be honest.  (If you're having trouble, try playing the first five days of Story Mode, which is basically a tutorial, and then go from there to Survival on Pilgrim mode.)    Many things aren't explained to you and, while they are fairly straight forward to figure out if you check out your menu options, it can be confusing to some and there's definitely a lot of nuance to learn.  This is good though, as the game has a huge mastery curve and you'll often feel rewarded for the decisions you make, whether its the long term planning that had you prepared for a sudden blizzard or the snap decision making that saw you make it home in said blizzard without freezing to death.\n\nNow, its important to remember, while this is a survival game, it's not like many of the more popular survival games.  There's no base building and indefinite survival is near impossible and requires a lot more than managing a few garden boxes.  It's also just you versus the cold and the wild life.  The game is designed for you to die eventually, and it is permanent death.  Each death, however, is a lesson and you'll learn to do better.  There's no zombies, but there are plenty of wolves out there who'll want to nibble on your face if given a chance, unless you're on Pilgrim.\n\nI could go on for a long, long time explaining every little facet of the game.  But, you'll grow old and die before I finish, so lets not go too in-depth.  It is worth noting that there are four \"experience modes\", which are basically difficulty settings.  Everything from Pilgrim, where you can pretty much stroll in a blizzard without freezing and predators will actively flee from you, to Interloper, a sadistic mode that feels like its actively trying to kill you because players complained that Stalker, the next hardest mode, was too easy.  \n\nThis game is also extremely immersive.  Its easy to get lost in it, lose track of time, just exploring and survivng.  The art style makes for some extremely screenshotable moments (waking up and seeing the \"fiery\" sunrise from Jackrabbit Island is a particularly memorable one to me).  Sometimes I find myself reaching for a blanket or something when playing because I feel like I should be cold, even if I'm playing during the summer.\n\nThere are some significant downsides, however.  Cabin Fever being the biggest and most non-sensical one in my book, as it'll force you to either idle the game or go outside to sleep in a blizzard in some instances (luckily, I've never gotten it myself, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time).  Some of the UI decisions also confuse me.  I like the design of it, but having to flip through different screens to check what my medical issues are then then go to another to actually treat it is cumbersome, especially when it used to all be done from the same one, among other things.  The late game of survival mode is also a little boring, since you settle into a routine of just surviving once you've looted and crafted everything you need.  Extreme late game, once all the man-made stuff has decayed or been used up, promises to be interesting, but I've never survived that far.\n\nOther, smaller nitpicks include there not being enough \"stuff\".  I feel there needs to be more animals, more tool-types or just variations, more gun-types/variations, more types of food... stuff like that.  Cooking was supposed to have a rework for launch, but it seems to have not made the cut, so it's currently still a \"stare intently at the meat until it finishes cooking\" thing.  A lot of environment objects are also non-interactible, mostly man-made stuff.  This is especially notable in some of the interiors that have been trashed and I find myself really wanting to clean them up.  Also, crows.  Human bodies never decay, oddly, and crows love to hover around them when the weather is nice enough.  And since some bodies are near good base locations, well... it's \"CAW CAW CAW CAW CAW\" non-stop everytime you step out.  ...at least it makes finding home easier in the fog?  And... no custom difficulty.  I'd love to like... play on Interloper weather and wild life with Stalker or Voyager loot, for example, but, sadly, can't.  \n\nBeyond survival mode, there's a Challenge mode, which is a bit more goal oriented.  Some are better than others, with The Hunted:  Part 1 being the best of the bunch and Nomad pretty boring unless you're new and want to learn the maps.  These add some alternatives to survivng as long as possible, but there's not enough of them.  (Still kinda hope the devs add my \"Wolfpocalypse\" suggestion. even if the odds are stupidly tiny.)\n\nAnd then there's Story Mode.  There's currently two episodes and... it's a thing.  Episode 1 is all right.  Kinda fetch-questy and tutorially, but that's a bit expected.  The writing could use buckets of work as the plot has lots of problems.  But, it doesn't overstay its visit.  Episode 2 however... the first half is decent.  One part where a new phenomenon is introduced is great, espcially if you play it as the devs intended instead of turning around and going back to sleep when it happens.  But after that?  It grinds to a screeching halt and turns into an unnecessary slog tutorial on things the player already knows.  Follow that up with a quest involving one of the buggiest bears ever who likes to break unlucky people's saves and then both a main quest and two side quests which rely purely on a RNG event to occur to allow you to progress in them, an event that, mind, may take in-game weeks to occur if you're unlucky like me, and Episode 2 is just... blegh.  I've actually not finished it which... is a shame, since I want to give the devs a full review on Wintermute specifically.  (If you're reading, Hinterland, fix the flippin' spoiler weather event in Wintermute!)\n\nOver all though, I'd recommnend this game heavily just for Survival mode.  Its a great experience and way worth the money.  But if you don't like survival games, or need base building or super natural elements in them, then, well, you'll need to give this one a pass, I hate to say.", "timestamp_updated": 1506662609, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506570255, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34783623", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504353", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504733293, "steamid": "76561198028380940", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "You know that movie where Liam Neeson gets hunted by wolves in the wilderness for no reason?

If you enjoy having to manage your supplies, reading the weather and plan your actions meticulously, and suffer, a lot, it is for you, so buy it!", "timestamp_updated": 1506962787, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506962787, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34861868", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502228", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506205123, "steamid": "76561198104043688", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have put over 350 hours into this game, so I think it's high time I write a review for it. After playing sandbox, as well as both episodes of WINTERMUTE, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed sandbox mode. Don't get me wrong, story mode was enjoyable, but it felt like more of a tutorial for experienced players. In all honesty, I'd recommend buying this game for sandbox, and not for the story. Sandbox is something I've sank tons of hours into, and I've had such great experiences with it. You never forget the feeling of finding food when you're dying of starvation, finding a great coat in a locker, or finding a rifle in some rundown shack.
