Nice sprite art, very limited scope. Gets old quick but the short time it takes to play through a round makes it a decent pick-up game during breaks. There is not much to accomplish, but aside from the 'explore' run where you are guaranteed to eventually die and lose your gear, there are 3 missions which you can actually complete to win and bring back gear if you do. On top of this is a daily challenge which gives you a chance to bring back prizes.\n\nThere are two types of main equipment, a helmet, and a melee weapon. That's it. These are the two items that confer stat bonuses when equipped. On top of that there are various special use items which you may or may not find helpful on your run. Then there are mystery fluids -- potions -- which in true roguelike fashion you never know what they will do until you try one. Quite often the results are bad, and one unlucky potion can end an otherwise lucky run quick. The teleport potion, yeah it's almost certainly going to throw you off a cliff if you find it. This mechanic adds a rather stupid Russian Roulette factor into the game that really doesn't need to be there.\n\nAlthough you do lose your equipment when you die, you do retain the two currency types that you acquire on your trips, scrap which you use to upgrade your stats, and crystals which you use to generate more equipment. You can also get various pets to take with you as a companion.\n\nI recommend this game ONLY on the cheap and ONLY if you need a turn-based time waster. It's very mediocre on fun and probably better just as a phone game.", "timestamp_updated": 1503855231, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503855140, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33377077", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501708", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499749774, "steamid": "76561198031725579", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's a nice time-waster of a game, but I'd say definitely get it on sale.\n\nI like that I can jump in, play a round or two, and quit. It's easy to play, even though it annoys me a bit that there are no real defensive moves: you can attack, run away, or try one of your items, and that's it. The game is low-stress because dying doesn't really mean anything. Which is good, because you'll die a lot. The fun comes from collecting and trying out new items, finding new pets (which is mostly a matter of chance), and leveling your clone up. I both like and hate that the effects of all potions are unknown whenever you send your clone out. You have to try them to see what they do and hope for the best. The pets are probably one of my favorite features of the game. I wish it were easier to find and collect them - half of the ones I currently have are unlockable \"gifts\" from the game.\n\nSo far, I've mostly played Exploration mode. I've played one of the \"winnable\" levels a few times, and actually made it to the end once, mostly due to luck (I hit the much-more-powerful-than-me creature with a teleporter item and they just happened to teleport off a cliff). I prefer Exploration mode and its complete lack of goals, but it's nice to occasionally play an area where it's possible to survive and make it back to the ship.", "timestamp_updated": 1499526925, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499526925, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33958460", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493575", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501632450, "steamid": "76561198047198710", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I liked playing it on Android, since you can't use in-app purchases on the app decided to give my support buying the PC version of the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1501624540, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501624540, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 109, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 54, "total_reviews": 163}}
