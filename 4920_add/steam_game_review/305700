If I weren't already a diver, this game probably wouldn't inspire me to become one. I can't speak for everyone, though, and I suppose this is a nice way to try to encourage others to get into diving, despite the game's flaws. It is pretty realistic, with the dive computer and the gear and all, and there isn't much happening beneath the surface. Perhaps too little, though, I am disappointed with the lack of content. It also seemed to me like the diver runs out of air much more quickly than you would in reality, making your dives even more limited. You do get to customize your gear, though, so that's kind of cool. Then again, I've only played this game for about twenty minutes, so my opinion probably isn't as valuable as others.", "timestamp_updated": 1501213746, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501213533, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 5}}
