The game starts out with your guy oing some talking to various people to get his weapon then first mission. The first mission is just a solo one with minimal hostiles and a few pieces of loot. After the first mission you get the option to hire a knight hero who can perform quests of his own (though right now its limited to one quest, which sadly is not repeatable) as well as assist you in the second main mission/map, which has you build up a base and push forward to destroy the two enemy bases. \n\nNot a whole lot of content, i spent about two hours on my first run getting that done. Second run maybe 20 minutes to do both maps. What is there mostly works, i couldn't get my soldiers in the second level to advance on the enemy positions, but between my hero and main character it was a pushover anyway. I'm giving this a thumbs up, my money was well spent on this and it looks like things are only getting better from here.\n\nEdit: Just editing to say the dev has fixed the pathfinding issue causing soldiers to not advance on the second map i had mentioned.

This is an ambitious project and one that you would ordinarily expect to require the labor of a major game studio.  That an independent developer can make such a compellling contribution in this arena indicates that talented devlopers are alive and well in the world of indpendent game production.
