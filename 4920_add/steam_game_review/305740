Which is not a bad thing, but, honestly I was intrigued by the concept of a 70s distopia, only to find that this is more a case of not using the word correctly. This game *is* quite a good example of \"zeerust\" though, (the particular kind of datedness which afflicts things that were originally designed to look futuristic) but not distopia.\n\nThe big problem with this game is that it's an action-puzzle-platformer that just doesn't have enough action, puzzles, or platforms. It's just not engaging enough. Mostly, the game involves walking, jumping, and doing obvious actions to obvious objects. The story-line is bare-bones, which would be fine, if the rest of it was strong, but it's not. In a lot of ways, it reminds me of Teslagrad, but Teslagrad does everything better.\n\nILIKESCIFI, if you read this, you've shown that you can make a professional-level game.

So, that and music and art created a nice overall impression.\n\nPitiri is a lovely game suitable both for adults and children.
