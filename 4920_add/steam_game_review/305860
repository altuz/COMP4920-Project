And thats the main reason for the negative review. \n\nPros and Cons:\n\nPro (singular)\n[list]\n    [*]If you can make a handful of tiles yourself in the built-in editor - pixel by pixel-  you can probably churn out some tilesets of mediocre quality, edit them quickly, and churn out some more.\nBut there are better and newer pixel/sprite editors in the steam store. (eg. Aesprite, Pixel Perfect)\n[/list]\nCons.\n[list]\n    [*]No documentation, no manual, no tutorials. I might haver mentioned that already. You have to figure it all out for yourself (intentional by design apparently).  A a frustrating process figuring out what it can and can't do. You'll spend your time looking for features which are not there, not even a basic image import. So if there was a manual or even basic documentation you could save your time and your money.\n\n    [*]Bizarre interface, the functions are not very intuitive.\n\n    [*]Can't import images - or if you can I couldn't find how to do it after two hours, by the time you figure this out you are probably too late for a refund.\n[/list]", "timestamp_updated": 1505941850, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504202256, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 8, "total_reviews": 16}}
