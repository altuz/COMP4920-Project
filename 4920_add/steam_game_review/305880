There's a timer, but that's just there for the non-existant high score counter. The fact there's an undo button is great as well, because it creates very low-stakes gameplay that I can just relax with. The graphics are also crazy appealing, with lots of vibrant colors that really stand out and make the game feel really pleasent. It's a great game, and being able to pick it up for the price of less than a sandwich is great. One of the best impulse buys I've made in the past year.", "timestamp_updated": 1451014929, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451014929, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "25516048", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1468009824, "steamid": "76561197993520875", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This cozy, relaxing puzzle game is the successor to Gem'X - one of the most loved Amiga games. It features the same classic Chris Huelsbeck soundtrack but extends the original game with charming new characters and map-based exploration. \n\nThe puzzles involve clicking on gems to change their colour to match what's on the right hand side of the screen. The gem you click moves two steps along the range of colours, and the gems surrounding it change one step. So you have to carefully plan your clicks. It's much more intuitive than I make it sound, and the game features a nice tutorial so the gameplay soon becomes clear.\n\nAn absorbing game that positively exudes good vibes.\nrecommended!", "timestamp_updated": 1473967519, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1473967519, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 4}}
