Only the intriguing part is this parallax view that is the gameplay, where you view an object from two - or a multitude - of different perspectives and the object, in this case the level, changes its appearance. The gameplay itself is reminiscent of how some of the levels of The Swapper plays out, in the interplay of the \u201cclones\u201d or in this case just arbitrary copies or resized models of the same Braid look-alike character that we, the player, are in control of. \n\nYou get the feeling of Another Perspective's metanarrative quite early on in the game. Where the narrator seems aware that this game is, in fact, a game. The player is set out to find the objet petit a or the \u201cunattainable object of desire.\u201d The same object that later turns out to be something completely different. \n\nWe have many metanarrative games these days, games that poke fun at the derived nature of most game genres. It happens so often that these metanarrative games become this type of derived, iterative, easy way out for delevopers that lack \u201creal\u201d creativity in their storytelling. I struggle to figure out if this game is one of those games, or not. To break the parallax here I would say it's somewhere inbetween. It, almost, seems like the metanarrative in Another Perspective manifested itself qua lack of ideas. But in that process, what actually manifested itself turned out to be rather enjoyable, albeit mildly mawkish, but to be honest I've never felt as appreciated for playing a game, so I'm okay with the overly sentimental parts of this game. I was smiling during some portions of the game, due to its narrative, or to this self-aware developer/player interaction commenter guy. \n\nAnd on the subject of derivation, this game borrows its tone heavily from Braid. Not the melodies themselves, but the undertone, the brooding, surreal hum of the strings that plays throughout the game reminds me of the same undertone in Braids OST. The character animation is also something that, along with games like The Bridge, seems to be a not as iconic ersatz of the character in Braid. But that's something ubiquitous in the indie-2D-platformer-scene. \n\nThe general artstyle is rather simplistic, almost minimalistic, not to the level of Thomas Was Alone, but still very simple. This gives the player all their time to focus on the puzzles themselves. And in a metanarrative, the gameplay surely suffers(?), as in the case of Spec Ops: The Line and The Stanley Parable? Not in this case. The puzzles in Another Perspective range from simplistic, puzzles that are there to make the player happy (KEYS!!!), and mind-bogglingly complex puzzles that turns into a gradual understanding of the complete picture. As in The Swapper, and as mentioned before, the copies' interactions is what the majority of the puzzles are based upon, but in a deeper sense than what The Swapper provides, since in that game these are only one of multiple different ways these clones interact and solve puzzles. Here the focus is on different types of perspective and the interplay between these perspectives and entities. The way you had to think between different screens and positions really made the game's more complex puzzles very satisfying to figure out. And despite the narrative being self-obsessed it managed to, rather creatively, explain the games mechanics to you. \n\nThe narrative, narrator, commentator, the supposed player thoughts, does at one point in the game break down, due to the meaningless of it all, and pleads the game to stop, the player to stop, just for this madness to end. At this point I wondered if this was supposed to mirror the player's thought on a game where there is no discernible goal, or meaning. What that did instead was to bring down my overall thoughts on the narrative, the text on the screen, the conversations, that even though it's a short game, it starts repeating itself in a slightly annoying fashion. But at just that point of annoyance, it switches things up and the end draws closer, relieving not the player of meaninglessness, but the narratives' inertia.\n\nAnother Perspective is a short, cheap game, and it's worth your time. It's clever at points, in both level design and narrative, and even though there is no real outstanding visual or auditory style to the game, it has enough style, to not make it completely bland. As mentioned before, I've never felt so appreciated for playing a game. And just for that, I feel this game is worth something. Its humility despite its skeptical narration is admirable, and the final moments of the game are fairly cute and lovable, depending on how cynical and bitter you feel that day.

There isn't really a story. The game more or less tries teach the player about a way of thinking, which explains the title. \"So... The title is a spoiler?\" you'd might ask. \"Exactly.\" would be my reply, but the game tells it in quite an intriguing way,  a way I personally didn't see coming. It takes, the whole there's someone else who sais and thinks diffirent thing, what you've seen in the trailers and takes it few steps further. This, in turn, gives the story a little more weight to it, and, in my books, makes it a little bit better. The game really tries to make you think, but after a while it will be a little more brunt with its message, and you will notice that. That's quite the shame though, because at one point it really was making me ponder and this just made me lose the immersion it created.\nNow for the mechanics and design.\nLets start with the art design:\nThe art design is pretty good. The levels look boring, just brown and grey brown. The character though, that's what I really liked. The drawing style was just a breath a fresh air for me, since I've gotten used to the standard triple A level of charachter creation.\nNext up, the mechanics:\nThe mechanics are fine, great even. Mechanics are introduced and reused. The mechanics are varied and work as they should. And there's one more thing, a very big and important thing. Gameplay work together with the \"story\". Seriously, this game does things better than most triple A's out there.\nAnd lastly, design:\nThe levels are good enough. For me at least. I haven't got that much experience with puzzle platformers so I was surprised at the difficulty of this game. Other won't have this problem, because they have superbrains or something. The difficulty ramps up to almost at the end, but it never overstays it welcom by presenting levels that look very much alike over and over again. It is really short because of this, which is a shame, but I can't hate it for that little flaw. \nIn conclusion. Some people might like it for the message, some for the mechanics and some for the challenge. In my opinion is the design not something which will hold it up, but it did help me in the decision making.\n\nI hope you do buy this lovely little game and have fun.", "timestamp_updated": 1424044062, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412009851, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "25614072", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501166", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1474447985, "steamid": "76561198025824964", "num_games_owned": 585, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Oh My God!
