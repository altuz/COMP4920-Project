It needs to work on balancing resource development and technology progression, but the management systems at the core of the game are excellent and the devs are present in the steam/PA forums so the Q&A available makes getting a grasp on the mechanics more than doable.\n\nThis game takes the concepts behind the Anno series and games like Banished and then dives into the mechanics of colonist, resource and technology management and lets you micromanage the heck out of them. Progression is slow and every advance you make, be it adding a food item to the menu or unlocking a new tier of technology, must be meticulously calculated. That\u2019s why I love it.\n\nTo give you an idea of resource management, one of the more simple things in the game are plastics: you will need 3 different types (alpha, beta, gamma) throughout the game and a plastic manufacturing chain will be the second or third thing every colony establishes. You need to:\n[list][*]Build a hangar\n[*]Buy an alpha ship\n[*]Unfreeze a director, a pilot, and a technician and assign them to the hangar\n[*]Buy an alpha ship mission and set it to collect plastic garbage\n[*]Buy a maintenance blueprint\n[*]Set start/repeat on the alpha ship mission and maintenance blueprints\n[*]Build a recycling center\n[*]Unfreeze a director, two recyclers, and a technician and assign them to the recycling center\n[*]Buy a recycling blueprint and set it to recycle plastic garbage\n[*]Buy a maintenance blueprint\n[*]Set start/repeat on the recycling and maintenance blueprints\n[*]Build a plastics sorting/melting/flaking facility\n[*]Unfreeze the five colonists necessary to work there\n[*]Buy or unlock the four blueprints for the facility\n[*]Set the production chains for the last two blueprints to queue alpha, beta and gamma plastics\n[*]Set start/repeat on the four blueprints\n[*]Build a prefab facility\n[*]Unfreeze the colonists necessary to work there\n[*]Buy or unlock the blueprints for the facility\n[*]Set the production chain to queue alpha, beta and gamma plastics\n[*]Set start/repeat on the blueprints[/list]\nIf you don\u2019t have a blueprint or one is not on the market and you don\u2019t have a blueprint left to unlock, then you have a whole separate production chain to work on for researching them. This process isn\u2019t nearly as tedious as it may sound at first and the experience makes getting a production chain up and running that much more rewarding. The game is full of logistical challenges, and as you progress, the systems can become more complicated and rely more on other systems, which speaks to the game balance.\n\nThe balance of resources produced to resources used is already great. The balance of technologies researched to technology cost needs some improvement. It can be difficult to expand at all once the technologies to unlock power upgrades (vital for expansion) start requiring core techs/documents, because these take considerable resources to develop, not to mention a lot of time. While completely possible, this does cause long spans in the game where it seems like you\u2019re doing nothing but waiting.\n\nAs for foods, ship add-ons, automation stations and power modules, the game offers a myriad of evermore-complex upgrades that make noticeable improvements to every corner of your colony.\n\nWhere the game needs the most improvement right now (patch 2.96.2) is in the imparting of information. The game either needs at least a half dozen more tutorials, or a pure sandbox mode. This would go a long way towards teaching non-economic-worldbuilder-veterans how to get a good start, since the slightest mistake early in game could devastate your colony and make you just start over.\n\nAt the moment it\u2019s also absolutely necessary to claim some bonus packages at the new colony screen, because without some free blueprints and power modules, you\u2019re asking for a dead colony. It would be nice if there were either more tier-1 blueprints available on the market, or security boxes were easier to get in a level 1 colony.\n\nThe game also doesn\u2019t have any resource graphs that I could find, so it\u2019s difficult to track a decline in food or fertilizer or water over time. For that, you have to keep an eye on the numbers of resources in your inventory and try to remember values so you notice if you\u2019re running out of something. Graphs would be a great addition.\n\nThere is also nowhere to see a summary of what level colonists you have and the available housing space for that tier. I currently have to manually add up the number of junior, senior and master colonists I have and then visually check to make sure I have enough residences to house them. A summary screen for this info would be a great addition.\n\nIt would also be nice if there were some more glitter; 1x1 and 1x2 parks, industrial gadgets, commercial outlets, something to fill in the extra space left over once you\u2019ve completely filled a platform.\n\nOverall I\u2019m happy I bought it and 100 hours in I\u2019m going to be playing it more, even though it\u2019s not finished and things like drones and energy combos haven\u2019t been implemented \u2013 I\u2019m excited for when they are.", "timestamp_updated": 1505768699, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505768699, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 140, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 74, "total_reviews": 214}}
