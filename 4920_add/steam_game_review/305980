So what about this one.\n\nThis game definitely has a lot of problems: \n-Various camera bugs\n-Imbalanced enemies won't let you get out of the cover\n-If you pick up the ammo sometimes you won't change your weapon back from pistol and there is no button to switch weapons\n-Ingame options tell you to adjust brightness while there are no brightness settings at all  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n-Enemies look nearly identical to the ally AND they are the same color as the surrounding are all the time + they can't be seen behind the special effect like burning barrels so sometimes you can't find an enemy for ages.\n-God damn awful voice work (acting).\n\nNow why this game is not THAT bad:\n+This game supposed to be silly so if you take this into account voice work is okay\n+Nice visuals and the game itself is enjoyable enough\n+You don't see much games of that genre here at steam\n+This game is cheap af + goes on discount from time to time\n+Steam cards cover the price as well\n+Achievements\n\nI myself beat the game in one sitting on the normal difficulty with 1 hp left despite all the bugs and other problems, so i guess its not THAT bad after all.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=971031660", "timestamp_updated": 1499592217, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499559176, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 16, "total_reviews": 38}}
