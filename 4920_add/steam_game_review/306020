But strategic players will find this game extremely boring and repetitive.\n\nThe rules are simple. You have an army of monkeys (21 tower) with different abilities which stands against.... balloons. Seems funny. Looks pretty funny. Sometimes I have feelings it was designed for children, because graphics is so.. childish, but then I remembered what the gameplay is incredibly simple too, so the graphics and the gameplay perfectly fit.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137361368\n\nLet's go back to the gameplay. There are different colour of balloons. For example, red ballon can be popped with 1 hit. Blue releases red balloon if it was pierced, green releases blue and etc. There are also metal balloons, camouflage ballons, anti-freeze, boss and etc. \n\nSo this game ballons and monkeys. Place monkeys, pop balloons, buy stronger monkey with bigger weapons. And it's pretty funny until you realise that all maps has the same filling of waves. I mean 15th wave of any map has the same amount and order of ballons as all other maps. Incredible. Have you ever seen a TD game with this awesome feature? Congrats, there is a one.\n\nThis \"feature\" makes the game boring after you passed one of levels. But... suddenly.. I have found that casual players like it. There is a guy with 750h+ in this game. Can you imagine, he played a thousands of times at the same missions (yeah, there are 5 difficulties, which has 15-20 to wave count), passed the same levels with same ballons. Incredible. Actually, this is the main reason why I gave this game a positive review, because a lot of players could like this game. Thank to god, I am not one of them :D\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137361457\n\nPros\n- 21 tower with different speciality. I liked the upgrade system for towers. Each tower has 2 paths and 4 upgrades in each path. You can take both 2 levels in each path, but after you need to choose a path for 3 and 4 tier upgrades. Also, upgrades are interesting. Some of them are simple (more range, more attack speed) and slightly change visual (blue hat becomes red), but other significantly changes visual of tower and gives huge bonuses. For example, there is a Monkey Buccaneer. You can upgrade it to Battlecruiser with tier 3 upgrade and to aircraft carrier with 4 tier upgrade. So, there are actually much more than 21 towers. Meanwhile, a lot of them are useless :D\n- A lot of maps, more than 40. Each has interesting visual and changes a path. There are 5 difficulties and some other modes like Co-op or Odyssey and etc.\n- A lot of other stuff. There are upgrade system for tokens, rank system for exp, shop stuff for cash. There is a daily rewards with daily quests and etc, achievements and etc.. Hello from free-to-play past. (game doesn't require any in-purchases)\n- No text, no preview, no tutorials. You ll go into the battle on your own. But it's easy to understand, so it's plus\n\nCons\n- Same wave filling and order.\n- You need to play/grind a lot to open all towers upgrades\n- You can lose suddenly. I mean, you play, defended 40 weeks with no leaks, you play of course on 2x speed. When something happens and you lose in 5 seconds. It is really frustrating\n- Even the first level has 50 waves at least. Actually, all maps has 50 waves at least, so is the first. I preferred that the time of first map was less\n- Games crashes. I have got 2 game crashes during 3 hours of gameplay. Anyway, there is autosaves, so this is not big deal.\n- I have seen a lot of recent negative reviews where people complained about lost progress. I have seen no replies, so I suppose, debs don't care much about their players\n- Annoying and repetitive music\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137361512\n\nSo, If you are searching for an interesting TD game with deep strategy, different levels, unique enemies   - don't buy it, I can't recommend this game for you even for 1 dollar.\nBut if you play TD games because you like watching how your towers kill enemies or because TD games relax you - this is the game for you. There are 200h of watching how balloons pop, I suppose,", "timestamp_updated": 1505658886, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505656778, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34865239", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518823", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505232374, "steamid": "76561198309079003", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Fantastic game, with a free flash version on the internet.\nYou may be thinking \"Why can't I just play the free version on the internet\"\n1.
