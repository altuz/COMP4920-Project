First let me tell you what I like about [i]The Howler[/i]:\n\n[b]+) Nice art style/OST/general concept:[/b]\nOverall it makes a good first impression. Hand drawn sprites and backgrounds combined with soothing music are the perfect way to start a short break. As for the concept: The game seems to promote a SF novel, so I guess it contributed to some degree.\n[b]+) Hm...[/b]\n\nWell, that was short enough. So now the cons:\n\n[b]-) Slow gameplay:[/b]\nYou move your air balloon sideways by horizontally separated zones, which have different wind directions and/or forces. The problem is that even the strongest wind accelerates you very slowly. That might be realistic, but it doesn't help to get a good pace going. It's also the main reason, why it took me a whole hour to complete [i]The Howler[/i], which brings me to my next point...\n[b]-) Shortness of the levels:[/b]\nNormally I wouldn't mind with such a cheap game, but the levels are really, really short. Imagine the first level of Super Mario Bros being over once you get the first mushroom. That short.\n[b]-) Indoor levels:[/b]\nIt's a minority of the 16 levels, but frustrating enough for me to mention them. The main problem is, that some parts of the walls will pop your air balloon, while others won't. However the indicators (really small spikes) are often indistinguishable from the background. The only way to learn where they  are is through trial & error.\n\nBut you know what? Those aren't the reasons why I don't recommend [i]The Howler[/i].\nI love how Steam has a lot of good, free games and I think that [i]The Howler[/i] would fit perfectly in this category. But unfortunately it isn't for free. That's why I don't recommend it. It may sound mean, but a game with the quality & quantity of content as [i]The Howler[/i] (AND which is also mainly promotional material for a book/capital city) just isn't worth the 1\u20ac (or 50 cents in my case).\n\n[h1]Additional note:[/h1]\nThere are apparently a lot of people, who experience bugs/glitches with this game. Levels not loading, the balloon not reacting to voice steering, game crashes and so on. I played this game on a normal PC with mouse control and didn't experience any of them.", "timestamp_updated": 1505049778, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500755340, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33987156", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504677", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501750170, "steamid": "76561198257553424", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It has a cool artstyle and the levels are pretty decent.\n[spoiler] And you can use your voice to move the balloon if you want to yell for some reason.
