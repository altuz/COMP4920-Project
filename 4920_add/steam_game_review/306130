MUCH. LORE.\n+ The PVP in Cyrodiil is pretty good if you're not skirmishing, just use siege machines and run away from people\n\nSome notes for those curious:\n\nElder Scrolls Online takes place millenia before the events of TESV: Skyrim, so don't expect to see any dragons (because they're not back yet). Similarly, please realize that the Aldmeri Dominion alliance isn't any more evil than the other alliances you can choose from. They're not high elven supremacists in this game (source: Queen Ayrenn literally condemns high elven supremacy in one of her dialogues). You're the prejudiced one for thinking so. :)\n\nExtra words from me:\n\nI'll be honest, when ESO first came out, all it took were a few screenshots and some bad early reviews to get me to stick to the single player games. I figured it would come and go like The Matrix Online, but, like that One guy, it persisted. I probably wouldn't have liked it at launch, but when it had a free weekend at the beginning of summer this year and I was burnt out from a tough semester of pretending to like ancient philosophy, I tried it out. I ended up buying Gold edition for myself and my wife (I've always been partial to the Thieves' Guild and Dark Brotherhood), and we played it together (which I highly recommend, playing a TES game with a friend is amazing). I'm not sure how many things they've changed since launch, but it's caught me.\nThis game's got quests and sidequests with engrossing stories and memorable characters, beautiful landscapes and cities with music to match, and not everything looks the freaking same like in Skyrim. You can fight bears, run dungeons, drink mead with the Nords; not once will you ever be bored. There's crafting, cooking, enchanting, alchemy, stealing, killing, adventures, achievements, everything.\nAnd listen, because I know some people care about this, the game doesn't try to tell you anything about your character except that Mannimarco killed you and trapped your soul in Coldharbour. People consider that an Elder Scrolls staple, and it's in this game, so you're welcome. There are even user-created add-ons to enhance the experience, though they aren't quite as wild as the mods for the single player games can get (as far as I know, I haven't gone down that rabbit hole and don't care to because ignorance is bliss).\n\nSo, especially if you like the Elder Scrolls games, I highly recommend ignoring all the sorely uninformed negative reviews and buying this game. If you have always wanted to explore Tamriel, not just confined to Skyrim, or Vvardenfell, or Cyrodiil, you should absolutely get this game. If you need that sweet succulent lore, you need this game. If you have friends that also like Elder Scrolls and you wish you could play together, you should all get this game.\n\nWhatever your choice, I wish upon you Bright Moons, walker!", "timestamp_updated": 1505193836, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505193836, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "35022709", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545551", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506876956, "steamid": "76561198118990821", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 110266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3016}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I saw recently that the reviews for ESO were mixed.

Zenimax and Bethesda did not really master it.\n\nTHINGS I LIKE\n\n- Compared to any other Elder Scrolls game, this title is a significant technical improvement. Say, it has very good visuals, while not being extremely demanding resource-wise (for a modern game, at least). I often stop somewhere in the middle of exploration and save a screenshot. I mean, like, wow, they even made flowing water, so now a river is actually a river rather than a body of static liquid. The combat is a bit more diverse, too: they added actual dodging, so you can evade enemy hits instead of taking them all. Exchanging blows until somebody dies has always been the default combat mode all the way up to Skyrim, and it always felt stupid to me. Some effort has been put into usability as well, so the game is more comfortable as far as interface is concerned.\n\n- Another positive feature is, obviously, the unlimited Tamriel. Save for a few of territories which are DLC-only, the entire continent can now be explored. This ensures you an eternity of discovery, treading everywhere and looking around, finding new places and seeing new people. It\u2019s an explorer\u2019s dream. And it\u2019s the Elder Scrolls universe, a true magnet for any fan of the franchise.\n\n- I can also note an interesting approach to balance, which was designed to keep all players equal no matter how far they have progressed. Thus, any region and any quest can be done anytime, and the amount of challenge it\u2019s going to provide will remain the same. It has some drawbacks, though, of which I\u2019ll be writing below.\n\nTHINGS I DISLIKE\n\n- Combat is boring. Encounter an enemy, perform your usual routine of battle moves and see it dead. Well, sure, having a set of abilities in addition to the ordinary left mouse button clicks is great, but it doesn\u2019t improve the situation a lot. The difference, basically, is as follows: in Skyrim your battle succession was like \u201cattack \u2013 attack \u2013 block \u2013 attack \u2013 attack\u201d, and here it would be \u201cability 1 \u2013 ability 2 \u2013 ability 3 \u2013 ability 4 \u2013 ability 5\u201d. You will repeat this \u201812345\u2019 dozens of times, and that\u2019ll be it. I could also add that the abilities themselves are not quite spectacular, so I don\u2019t really find a lot of enjoyment in practicing them.\n\n- Magic is very unremarkable. The rich variety of Skyrim spells is replaced by a small bunch of dull skills, most of which have quite limited usefulness. Tactical use of spells is nowhere to be found: you can\u2019t exhaust enemy stamina with frost or drain enemy mana with lightnings. Visual aspect of magic hardly exists at all: it\u2019s rather basic, I might even say featureless.\n\n- Balance has a major psychological flaw: there\u2019s no progression worth speaking of. This will require a couple of examples.\n\n1) You\u2019re level 10 and you crafted a sword. The sword does 1000 damage. You have then progressed to level 12 and can now craft a \u2018better\u2019 sword. However, your old level 10 sword now deals 900 damage, and the new level 12 sword does exactly the same 1000 damage. You can develop your craftsmanship to great heights and forge yourself a set of level 40 dwarven armor, but it will have exactly the same stats as the rusty iron cuirass you had when you were level 5. Basically, you cannot become better \u2013 you can only keep up to be as good as you\u2019ve already been before. \n\n2) Most combat-relevant stats are measured in thousands or tens of thousands. Bonuses you gain from developing your skill lines or from using special items are usually lying somewhere around 3-5%. This effectively means that your attempts to improve will hardly improve anything. Yes, you had 10 000 health before, and now you have 10 500 health. Technically, it\u2019s an improvement, but actually, it\u2019s the same 10k as before. \n\n- Speaking of armors, different types of equipment don\u2019t have any drawbacks \u2013 they only have benefits. You will not move slower or spend more stamina in heavy armor compared to light armor. \n\n- Group challenges are achieved through simple multiplication of enemy health. If a dungeon is intended for a group of 10 players, the mobs will have x10 health. This is your challenge. Sounds exciting, right? Big bosses will also have skills that would oneshot you; somebody obviously thought that it would add complexity to the gameplay.\n\n- Many mobs are all the same, just having different exteriors. Here\u2019s a bandit throwing a dagger at you, here\u2019s a dremora throwing a dagger at you, here\u2019s a goblin throwing a dagger at you. The same set of skills is often found throughout the entire range of enemy variations. Wildlife does add some diversity, but to a certain extent only.\n\n- Presence of other players is often annoying, especially in public dungeons: every new visitor makes enemies respawn. They will often respawn right on top of your head and overwhelm you with numbers; you won\u2019t even be able to run for your life, because the mobs you killed before have also respawned behind your back.\n\n- A number of quests is not very well developed either lore-wise or logic-wise. Some look as if they were hastily compiled. It\u2019s a minor thing, but it breaks immersion sometimes.\n\nOVERALL\n\nFor an Elder Scrolls game, this is a good product. It\u2019s perfect for walking and sightseeing, and whenever the servers are not very populated, you can just imagine that it\u2019s simply another singleplayer title in the series, where the entire world belongs to you only. It preserves some traditions too: for example, Ayleid ruins are reproduced with exceptional attention to details \u2013 exactly the way they looked in Oblivion. It will appeal greatly to any explorer-type player.\n\nHowever, even though it might seem to be enjoyable at first, the gameplay is not very entertaining. Many things are boring and repetitive, and interactions with the environment do not provide much excitement. Of course, there are player-to-player interactions as well, but they can just as well be found in any other MMO.", "timestamp_updated": 1505671202, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505226551, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35283108", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502567", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507188454, "steamid": "76561198040978401", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 12329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6236}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Decent MMO. Fun. GREAT for RP-ing, since it's lore that I'm used to. Crowns are WAAAAY too expensive, also removed some key Elder Scrolls features that I think might be a dealbreaker for some.\n\nI play quite a bit of it, and I think it's quite fun. Bit restrictive, lots of expensive micro-transactions, but believe me, it isn't pay to win. Even for the PvP, it isn't pay to win. It's really just... pay to get there faster. But it doesn't take long to build a character, if you don't mind grinding, which is what MMOs are known for. The game doesn't hold your hand, which is what I like about it.\n\nAlso, let me be clear. THIS. IS NOT. AN ELDER SCROLLS GAME. It's set in the Elder Scrolls' universe, but it is far from being an Elder Scrolls game. Great MMO! Terrible TES game. That's ok though. Personally, I enjoy that it isn't pay to win (I mean, thankfully. They already make you buy the game, and tbh having a subscription just makes your life hella easier, but I don't mind really, provides me with lots of fun.) and that the RP community is thriving. I appreciate that it's set in the TES universe, because it's lore that I know, and understand, and can really get into.\n\nLet's see, as of the time of my review, here are a few pros and cons, starting with the cons.\n\n-No Unarmed skill, which is highly underrated\n-NO CHILDREN. ??? There are legit NO children in Tamriel. Ever. The closest you get are the shortest bosmer xD\n-Crown store. Now, there are positives and negatives. First of all, there is a lot of... 'persuasive advertising'. They act like the crown store is the only way to get certain items. Luckily the crown store is mostly just cosmetic/aesthetic items. They make them all look super cool, but honestly if you just play the game and IGNORE the crown store, you end up getting cool stuff.\n-The limitations on inventory space. Now, I get the need to limit inventory space, HOWEVER... in past elder scrolls games it was based on weight and the strength of your character. They did away with all that, and now it's a starting amount of 60 slots for items (at least you can stack those items in one slot? >,>)\n-You can play as any race! Except Imperial... Yup, if you want to be an Imperial, you have to use crowns to buy the \"Imperial Race Upgrade.\" which grants you the race, a white horse, and I think a few other silly things.\n-Pets are useless. Non-combat pets are a thing. Why? Because money.\n\nThere is light in this story though...\n\n+Pretty engaging quests, if you like lore. They even have a pretty prevalent Maormer presence, even though you can't play as a Maormer.\n+Each zone is a decent enough sized, though the loading screens can get annoying from time to time if you travel quickly.\n+For an MMO, it's great. For an Elder Scrolls game... well... eh. But, that's not so bad, because fans of MMOs can enjoy it.\n\nTL;DR - Don't buy unless you like MMOs. This is not an Elder Scrolls game. Seriously. On the other hand, if you like MMOs and don't mind paying an initial price... dude! Get it! Also, there are less trolls since you have to pay to get in.\n\nThere's my 2 cents.", "timestamp_updated": 1506662514, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506662514, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34767603", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504811", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505091588, "steamid": "76561198022301903", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "<3 Fantastic world if you love the elder scrolls games <3", "timestamp_updated": 1504660930, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504660930, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35357326", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504941", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507188677, "steamid": "76561198002060324", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 32413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2221}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's a really great game if you like the Elder Scrolls franchise, just don't expect Skyrim v2.

The other players running around may or may not break the experience a little, but for me this is not the issue.\n\nThis game isn't exactly like a regular TES game: you pick a class and you have class-specific skills and weapon-specific skills. The possibilities of class/armor/weapon/skill are endless: want to play a robed healer with a mace and a shield? - go for it. Want to play a heavy-armor mage with a twohander? - go ahead.

Nearly on par with Skyrim and the likes. Level scaling is something not everyone likes, but so far I really love it. Exploration is rewarding with chests, skyshards (skill points) and lore books. Always something stuck in odd nooks and crannys. The graphics are phenomenal and remind me of Skyrim and Fallout series alot. The justice system is not very realistic, but interesting enough to make it fun. The consequences are light, but can be fairly expensive if you aren't careful. The Guild Trader is something some like and other's don't. For me, I would prefer a regular Auction House simply for convenience when looking for things to buy, but the way they have it set up helps prevent a lot of the negative econmic situations other games deal with, such as gold farmers, inflation, and monopolies.\n\nAdd-ons are great. While the few that I use seem like they should have been in the game to begin with, it's nice to have the option to modify the game. The crafting system is quite deep and engaging, much moreso than most other games I have played, ever. Add to this the hunting and gathering economy and if you like to farm, this game makes that very rewarding. The stories and quests are top-notch with very colorful writing and voice acting. I recognized many of the voices from other games and television series. Some of the best ever. The music is light and entrancing. Very moody and some thought was put into which music to play for which zone. I really love the audio in this game, as well as the ambiance and immersion of the day/night cycles and weather patterns. \n\nWhile the game is buy to play, the sub gives you infinite crafting bag space and access to every DLC past and future as well as a 1500 crown stipend to use in the cash store where you can buy mounts, costumes, and loads of other uncecessary things. But if you like that sort of thing, this game has quite a lot to offer, even if it is mostly overprices outside of sales and the monthly stipend, in my opnion. I haven't gotten much into the player housing, but the fact that the game has it says something, because many do not. And from what I can tell, the system is very robust, with most if not all items being craftable. This makes for a very lucrative market as well as a nice gold dump for the economy. The one big drawback is that players are limited to the number of items they can have in each house.\n\n- No Global Auction House\n- Terrible search function/guild trader interface\n- Drab looking gear\n- Multiple guilds\n- No Visual Buff/Debuff indicators for self, party, or target outside of graphical effects.\n- Limited skill slots\n- Year old UI bugs\n\nAgain, with the guild trader system there are things I like about it and things I don't. It's a little too convoluted and cumbersome for my personal taste, but I do genuinely like what it's trying to do/be. Maybe in time it will get better. Thankfully there are add-ons that make this part of the game palatable for those that enjoy it. The gear is rather drab looking for the most part, at least at the lower levels. There are dye stations around towns to help spice it up, but you have to unlock the colors with achievements and some of the better ones are locked behind difficult or lengthy objectives. While I don't mind earning them (or not), it would be nice to not have to wear a costume all the time when my gear sets don't match.\n\nSome players like being able to join multiple guilds. I like it too for the most part. Joining and leaving guilds is very simple and it wasn't hard for me to find several that I enjoy. The problem is with a 500 player limit in each guild, one may feel forced into joining 5 just to be able to trade all their goods every week. That doesn't leave a lot of room for the non-trading guilds that I would otherwise enjoy as well. The reason for this is because the guild traders have designated areas to sell, so each guild has to bid on those spots every week. If a guild you are in doesn't win a bid, you can't trade with a guild trader in that guild for that week. And many of the guilds that are able to stay in good areas consistently charge very high dues/minimum sales. Its kind of supply and demand, and I get that, but for new players, it can be difficult when just starting out and trying to offload your trash for some upgrades or potions/food. Also, having 5 guilds in one chatbar is a huge nightmare. If there are options to make this less painful, I haven't found them yet.\n\nNo visual buff indicators is something that, again, can be alleviated with add-ons, but I feel it shouldn't have to be. Along with the minimap, it should be an option included in the game that more hardcore players can choose to disable if they wish. The number of hotbar actions allowed is 5 plus 1 ultimate. At level 15 you get a second bar (both based on weapon type) with 5 more slots and another ultimate slot. This is good for some players and bad for others. Personally, I like games where I have access to all my abilities at all times and get to decide on the fly which one I use. I do appreciate the strategy involved with limited skills, but being that every skill had to be leveled up and morphed individually through using it, while very cool in itself, makes combat and skill levling more convoluted than I am used to or prefer. I've run into a bug that shows guild has no guild trader, when they, in fact, do. Apparently this bug has been around since Morrowind released, a year ago. Some of the other UI are kinda janky, like when you are looking at your listed items for one guild, and you switch to another guild, and it shows no listings, so you have to click \"sell\" and then back to \"listings\" to be able to see the items. Annoying. \n\nLastly since it is an action/combat game, the combat is good. Its fun and engaging and there are so many options it is pretty overwhelming at first, tbh. After toying with it for awhile, I feel overall the combat is average. Some things I like, and some things I miss. It's fairly fluid, but also largely predictable for me, so far. I feel like some ablities and such are more powerful which kind of pigeonholes some classes beyond the \"magicka or stamina' decision. The classes themselves are fun and unique and I like how there are cross-combinations depending on what weapon the character is using. Gear sets make statistics junkies right at home as well.", "timestamp_updated": 1506982990, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506981119, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35185267", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502418", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507181572, "steamid": "76561198071977482", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 98901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2841}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "one of my favorite games. ever.", "timestamp_updated": 1506270714, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506270714, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34798308", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506391", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507179074, "steamid": "76561198129186870", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 778}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Honestly not a bad game if you enjoy questing everything else seems a little lacking though", "timestamp_updated": 1504803499, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504803499, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35002847", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505843", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506825210, "steamid": "76561198224688640", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 128853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1560}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have over 2,000 hours played in this game. I'll admit, though, at most a third of that was actual gameplay. The rest was spent either goofing off with my friends, or observing the many obscure roleplaying communities that ESO has to offer. \nNear the start of the game, I would farm a simple dungeon. Wasn't too boring, and it gave me enough loot and gold. Once I hit level ten, I immediately jumped into PVP, which is my favourite part of the game. From the get-go, I was constantly leading anywhere from 20 to 100 real players into battle, just at level ten. The PVP is amazingly diverse. I've been stuck in hour long sieges, just running back and forth to repair walls. I've led two full groups (58 people) of Daggerfall Covenant players into battle at once, against 100+ Aldmeri Dominion troops and their Emperor, who was leading them all. The entire battle lasted for about 3 and a half hours, only ending at about two in the morning when most of my faction went to bed. But just the simple fact that you can be sieging an enemy outpost one minute, and the next you're in a 3 hour battle pushing back and forward between forts just shows how diverse the PVP of the Elder Scrolls Online is. \nI've spent less time in PVE, as I've constantly failed to get enough motivation to min-max and get a good build. But from what I've learned, once you get together with some friends, or a friendly and skilled group it's all smooth sailing. \nNow I'll touch on a completely different topic - Trials. Trials are 12-player dungeons that are insanely hard. Despite my lack of a good PVE build, these are one of my favourite things to do in this game. The bosses can have well over 10M health, and you'll definitely wipe a few times before you finish one. But that doesn't make them any less worth it, as this is the main source for amazing gear.\nNow, there's a new PVP mode called Battlegrounds that was added with the 'Morrowind' Expansion Pack. It's much more close quarters and killing-oriented than the PVP in Cyrodiil is, and I'm way worse at it. But nonetheless, a fun gamemode. \nThere's also six expansions. One of the more recent ones is Morrowind, which is easily the largest. It adds the massive island of Vvardenfell to the game, with an epic quest in which you work together with one of the God-Kings of Morrowind, Lord Vivec. \nThe first DLC is Imperial City, adding the capital of the not-yet-formed Third Empire to the game. It's also the capital of the other two, but forget about them. The third is the coolest. In this you have to fight through hundreds of Daedra and other Players to capture all six of the city's districts for your faction. \nThe second was Orsinium, which added the Orcish Kingdom of Wrothgar to the game, in which you have to help King Kurog.\nThe third was the Thieves Guild. You steal stuff, duh.\nNext they added the Dark Brotherhood DLC, which of course lets you join the ever-notorious group of assassins. I won't spoil anything.\nThey soon added the fifth DLC, Shadows of The Hist. It simply adds two Argonian-Themed Dungeons to the game. \nAfter SoTH they added Morrowind, which I've already delved into. \nMost recently, they added Horns of the Reach. I haven't played it yet, so I can't really say much.\nZOS also added two major content updates. First came One Tamriel, which allowed players from differing factions to meet in-game. In february they also added Homestead, which added multiple customizable playerhomes to the game. \nOne portion of the game I've mentioned before but haven't really touched is the roleplaying community. Elder Scrolls Online has an amazing roleplaying community. There's hundreds of great guilds to choose from, and thousands of amazing roleplayers to interact with. I can't describe how much I love the roleplaying community in this game. \nI have about eighty seven days sunk into this game, with only more to come. I recommend that anybody who loves the lore of the Elder Scrolls Series and unique gameplay mechanics (This game is not Skyrim 2, nor Skyrim Online.) get this game.
