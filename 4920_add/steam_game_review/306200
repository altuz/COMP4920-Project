These ruins must be rebuilt into their original structures. (No freedom of placement here, as with traditional city-builders.) At first, you have extremely limited space for food, resources, and money, as well as a limited amount of resources on the map (although the nodes do replenish over time). The game doesn't tell you this, but as you rebuild resource structures, you can place a worker there to start generating resources for your warehouse. As you upgrade your warehouse, you can hold more supplies and gold (up to 900).\n\nIt took a little bit for me to realise that you can grab your workers from the worker list in the bottom left and drop them where you want (go to that location first, then select a free worker). Once I figured that out, management was easier.\n\nOne issue: there is a quest near the end of the game that requires you to sell wood to the Capital. There is no resource known as 'wood'.[spoiler]You will need to send *planks*, crafted in the workshop.[/spoiler]\n\nPros:\n\n+ trading cards!\n+ cute graphics.\n+ windowed mode.\n+ simple gameplay.\n+ always something to do.\n\nCons:\n\n- short.\n- the worker list is just a forward-and-back 'list', not a whole list.\n- no achievements.\n- no reply value.\n\nEphyRating: 7/10\nSummary: It's a typical, casual time management game. Short, but that's expected for a 'casual' game, I guess. It has cute graphics, and you could play it all in one sitting. Not that I would ever do that. <cough>", "timestamp_updated": 1500664310, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500664259, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 95, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 32, "total_reviews": 127}}
