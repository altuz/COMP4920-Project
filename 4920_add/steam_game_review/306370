It's cool if you want to experience something different other than Train Simulator. Yeah some of the scenery is inaccurate and there's bugs galore, but what do you expect for a $10 game? The only severe issues I've encountered so far is that there is no tutorial mode for new players, none of the important buttons and levers (throttle, brake, etc) are mapped meaning first time users will have to manually map the buttons themselves, and the biggest problem is that the game crashes whenever you attempt to change the graphics settings. I don't mean crashing in game because you jacked the graphics to max settings, I mean you change the settings in the menu, hit \"OK\" to save it, the game crashes, and none of your changes are saved, meaning the game is perpetually stuck at the default graphics settings. I'll keep this game and play it as is because it was cheap and it's the only real simulation of the PATH line out there. However if the game cost any more than the current price, I'd be pretty unsatisfied. If you have experience with train sims and want a little something different, go ahead and get it. But if you're looking for something serious, pass this game up and get Train Simulator.", "timestamp_updated": 1493332190, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493331979, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31926970", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502015", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495589503, "steamid": "76561198230177148", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "\"C4 engine has stopped working\".
