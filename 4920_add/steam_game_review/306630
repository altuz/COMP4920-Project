The map of the game represents the United States and North Mexico. Boxes also represent the Caribbean, France and England, to simulate a possible engagement of these countries in the conflict, but also to allow a blockade of the ships having traded with Europe. The map is divided into zones, each state of the United States being composed of several zones. A game turn represents 15 days. And as soon as two or more armies are in the same area, a confrontation is possible but not mandatory, some units have the ability to dodge an attack.\n\nAt the level of the units present, in addition to the commanders there are infantry, cavalry, artillery, refueling trolleys, but also naval units, be it river patrollers , troop-carrying vessels, or more traditional vessels intended for navigation on the high seas. Each unit has characteristics relating to its ability to move, its degree of detection, its morals, its supply of food and ammunition, as well as some special abilities like the possibility of ambushing, moving faster on certain types of terrain, ect.\n\nAt each turn of the game, the player organizes the movement of his troops, but also the creation of new units, depending on the available reserves, replacing the losses suffered by the units that fought, but also reorganizes his troops, avoid penalties due to the absence of a commander or the fact that a commander has too many troops under his command. Units are also assigned an attitude (defensive, offensive, passive) and rules of engagement, which will define the behavior of a unit when it encounters an adverse unit.\n\nBesides purely military management, you also have more specific options, related to the management of the  nation. Thus, financial options allow, among other things, to issue currency or to levy new taxes. The economic options allow to stimulate the development of the economy in certain regions, or to develop a specific type of industry. Means of transport may also be the subject of this type of option: increasing the number of steamboats to promote river transport, or extending the railway network. Of course, these options have a cost, both in hard cash and in terms of national morale. The national morale is a representation of the morale of the population of the camp played. This morale is evolving, as a result of a battle, a choice of an option, a random event, etc.). When this morale increases to a defined value from the start of the chosen scenario, victory is automatic. And if it falls below a certain value, it is defeat that is automatic.\n\n[b]THE GOOD[/b]\n- Some mechanisms that fine-tune management and allow influence on the course of a battle\n- Order of battle, with the infantry units designated according to their state of origin\n- Graphics looks good\n- Soundtrack pleasant enough to listen to\n\n[b]THE BAD[/b]\n- The feeling of not having much to do, or not knowing what to do\n- Lacks the possibility for the player to intervene in the middle of a battle\n\n[h1]8/10[/h1]\n\nDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | [b][u]GREAT[/u][/b] | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE", "timestamp_updated": 1506526985, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506526985, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 76, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 25, "total_reviews": 101}}
