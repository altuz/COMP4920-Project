Scenarios can be either be large and take an hour to complete, or very small and take 15 minutes.\n\nThe campaign scenarios are well crafted and offer hundreds of hours of gameplay. The in-game skirmish generator is also well-done and offers much more replayability. This game great for PBEM multiplayer and it's easy to find matches, even in 2017.\n\nI dislike how the numerical values of the three main stats, AT, AP, and armor, are only displayed in the detailed info menus. There is a meter in the main UI that shows AT and AP and range effectiveness, but seeing the other values would be helpful. It seems the first Battle Academy had this and I wish they didn't remove it.\n\nThe resolution stretch is also a bit odd. You can tell the game was made for devices that were less wide. It's a bit jarring at first, but you get used to it.\n\nOverall this is a solid turn-based tactics wargame.", "timestamp_updated": 1501424424, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501422160, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 35, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 39}}
