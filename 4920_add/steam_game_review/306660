This is one of the best battlefield strategy games I've ever played.   Starting with the VERY well researched and beautifully displayed battlefield of Gettysburg.  Top notch.  The forces, of course, are historically accurate as well.  Control of those forces are very intuitive and seamless which is necessary considering this is a real-time game and not a turn-based one.  Understanding the relationship of the different troop types is essential to success and the game does a great job of giving you the tools you need.  As in the historical battle, the game is win-able by either side so it really does come down to the decisions of the player.  I have achieved major victories using either side but it took a few tries (especially as the Confederates--I'll give you a hint NO REST for the wicked).  The artillery and cavalry superiority of the North make winning with them a bit easier, I think.  If you enjoy war games, especially well researched historical games, this is for you!  Again, A+\n\nAfter reading many of the reviews (especially the few negative ones) it is clear that a those individuals probably don't understand the tactics of the time period.  I think (by reading their comments) that many also are overly influenced by modern 'shooter' games as well as modern 'RTS' games.  This is a game constructed to be a U.S. Civil War game.  Meaning that the units, the weapons, the tactics, the formations, (i.e. everything) is tailored to this era.  If someone wants units to behave like space marines from Dawn of War...keep dreaming.  BUT since this isn't Starcraft I can tell you to just read between the lines in a lot of these negative reviews--they say more about the reviewer than the game.  Again, if you want a great historically accurate and well researched Civil War battle game that allows you to actually try different approaches to victory, this is the game for you.  C&C, DoW and Starcraft are all great games, but this is not those (nor should it be).  What this IS however is a great Civil War game.", "timestamp_updated": 1507056950, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507056009, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35429643", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501336", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507004399, "steamid": "76561198033823937", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 419}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The graphics, map, and controls on this game are awesome IMO. Armies form thier own kinda curve along the terrain, one star untis fall out of line and 3 star units are more reliable. The lack of total control over the troops appeals to me, but seems to annoy others\n\nWhat I don't like, and what I've learned has continued in thier new game- is that this game just sucks when the map is huge; which is 90% of the game. I only ever play these couple multiplayer maps that aren't massive. Also, they way troops enter the fight at certain points from the edge of the map sucks. \n\nIt gets a thumbs up from me bacause I do still play it and it was on sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1506982403, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506982403, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34872991", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492784", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505663949, "steamid": "76561197968454527", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "3/10 - great promise but barely playable\n\nThe controls are so bad it gets really frustrating to try to perform any action on this game. Moving a brigade is an exercise in precision mouse handling, canceling a move order is impossible, you tell your troops to hold and they start retreating, your canons are useless with round shot and disobey your fire commands all the time, your regiments disobey your fire orders all the time, and don't get me started on charging....\n\nI mean, the core mechanic of the game is completely broken:\n* Your brigades are almost always with the charge button disabled\n* If enabled, most times, the brigade just breaks charge and just stands there being shot at like complete idiots, not even firing back nor running... 2000 man charging a 400 man unit lose 30 and their reaction is to stop and stand there being shot at... fucking ridiculous.\n* But if by the willingness of the evil gods that rule this game your units happen to finish a charge, they will not start killing instantly... no, that would be too easy. They will stop in front of the enemy, walk around, walk through the enemy brigade, and only then start killing. All this while being shot at.\n\nBy the way, on this game, an artillery brigade can flee from a cavalry brigade.", "timestamp_updated": 1505085082, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505085082, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1301, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 210, "total_reviews": 1511}}
