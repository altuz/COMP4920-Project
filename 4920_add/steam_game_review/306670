But in this case it wasnt done properly. I see what they wanted to do, and i admire them for that. They changed alot of things that made the first two games enjoyable, now not just enjoyable but actually good. They changed alot about the minions which really, in my oppinion the minions made the games, and now there nothing and its so lack luster. they feel so useless. You dont have full control over them like you use to, and its so painfull to see that. Ive seen people complain about the Overlord you play as in this game, and that part actually didnt bother me as much as ive seen it bother other people. \n\nNow ive talked about how it differs from the original game, so does that mean that if you havent played the original will it even bother you?\n\nAnd the answer is yes! Which is a shame for me to say, i wish this game was better, and i hate to put a company down for trying something new and differnt. But the controls just feel really off, and slow, The combat seems sluggish and in my oppinion just bad. With out full control over the minions the combat feels even worse. The combat is just click click click, nothing very special to it. Because of this, it just feels very plain. \n\nI cant really talk any longer than this, simply because i havent played much. Just quit after playing maybe an hour and got frustrated with how it plays. This game had potential and i feel if done right it COULD  have been something good. \n\nBut overall i will have to say this is a dont buy, like a 3/10.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1502677232, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502677232, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34666999", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507092", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504292101, "steamid": "76561198085684229", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "(I want you to read at least my conclusion at the bottom)\nThis is a very ok game, but not much more than that. People clearly seem to misinterprate what Codemasters were intending this game to be. Everybody was expecting this to be Overlord 3, what they got was a hack'n slash dungeoncrawler spinoff. The buildup for that game on social media, etc., lead to a lot of hype, and what fans got was so different from what they expected they were just baffeled and confused. But is it actually that bad as people want to think it is?\n\nFirst off, drastic change is generally not well recieved by anyone, which is why so many people just hate this game because it's trying something different, which is childish and unreasonable by those people. Of course, a real O3 would have been better, but a lot of what I've seen other people say was vapid and unjustified. Give this game a chance, it's not terrible, just not that good or what we wanted it to be.\n\nEveryone that played singleplayer can clearly see that something is missing. That is because the game was intended to be played mainly in multiplayer. Epic bosses, puzzles, world exploring, seductive maids and world interaction, which made the other games so vivid, are all missing, which makes this game more vapid. After beating the campaign, there is absolutely no reason to keep playing, except maybe trying out every netherghul or upgrading everything, which is both not very tempting. \n\nBad things to point out:\n-Terrible build up to the release, more communication would have resulted in less backlash\n-Combat is dulled down to running and charging attacks, which is boring, and it lacks in skills\n-The developers lost focus on making a vibrant game, rather they wanted to make a multiplayer experience\n-Lack of world interaction and exploration\n-Minions are so unbelievably sucky, I fought without them most of the time\n-Terrible and repetitive 'bosses'. Only the very last one is somewhat cool\n-Buggy, not gamebreaking, but it makes the developers look lazy\n-Only roughly 6 hours of campaign\n-Ended on a cliffhanger, which will probably not be resolved now that the fanbase panned the developers\n-Lack of customisation on everything. Minions can wear hats, but armour, nether and even controls can't be customised\n-Overall lack of creative gameplay\n-Probably the death of the Overlord franchise\n-Ricket is in this game\n\nGood things to point out:\n-Nice to see the developers trying out something new, eventhough it bombed critically\n-Very great level design, atmosphere and worldbuilding\n-Somewhat stable and didn't crash\n-I liked the upgrade systems, eventhough they were a bit uncreative\n-Eventhough its combat is dull, it works for this kind of game\n-Some nice ideas, but not implemented well\n-Still captures the charme of the series\n-Can be quite fun with some friends\n\nConclusion:\nTerrible marketing, lack of focus and some bad ideas made the fans flip out so much, that their backlash pretty much destroyed the developers motivation for an actual Overlord 3. This isn't Overlord 3, this is a multiplayer focused spin off you should at least give a chance and try out or look more into it. I maybe recommend it for the novelty, maybe buy it in sale, but don't expect anything groundbreaking, especially in singleplayer. If you buy this, find some people to play it with you. The iconic gameplay is dulled down and the devs clearly put more focus on the mp aspect and left out the adventuring, which results in a weak experiance. It's not a bad game as a lot of people want to make it up to be, it works good fot what it is, it just lacks impact.\nAfter this bomb, this may be the end of the franchise, but evil always finds a way..", "timestamp_updated": 1504293027, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504292781, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33590163", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496037", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500226661, "steamid": "76561198059130652", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Not what I expected of the overlord francise.\nI thought I bought a game where you'd play like the old overlord games but with multiplayer.\nInstead, i get this top down game where I littirally don't have a single clue what I'm actually doing.\nI thought you'd be able to at least controll minions like in the old games but for as far as i've seen, even that was overestemated expectations.\n\nI highly recommend people NOT to buy this game if you like the old overlord games.", "timestamp_updated": 1500226838, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500226838, "votes_down": 6}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 51, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 158, "total_reviews": 209}}
