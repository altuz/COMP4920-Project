I tried to fend off guides for as long as possible, checking a solution for a single word here and there, but also checking words in an online dictionary, up until I couldn't progress without a guide and without feeling frustrated. It became a chore due to my own limitations, not by a fault of the game, cos it's the same game from the first to the last puzzle, 288 in total. How hard the Hard Pack puzzles were I can't say, cos I was rushing to the end with guides at that point, just to be done with it. \n\nI would've liked to see a more educational aspect to Lexica. For example, all the words in an alphabetical order at the end of the game or at the end of each puzzle, where I can go over the words that I didn't know, even if the definitions aren't provided by the game itself. As soon as you drop the last letter in its rightful place, the puzzle is locked and at that point you can't revisit a solved puzzle, it only gives you the completion time. At the very least I think they should've included a feature to revisit solved puzzles. There are Steam guides and video guides on Youtube (up to Medium Pack 7), but the point of any game is for you to play it, not continue it outside of the game. Hard to say if it's worth 5 euros, but it's good fun for the most part and it looks nice. It's also nice to have it in windowed mode, so you can place it right next to Youtube videos, while you watch 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, if that's your thing.", "timestamp_updated": 1506861674, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506855238, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 100, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 21, "total_reviews": 121}}
