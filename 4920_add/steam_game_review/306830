This is an amazing game that's really fun to play, but I cant even play it because of this issue.

ZMR is a fun time killer that plays almost exactly like Gears of War down to the executions.  the PvE is well designed, and there are tons of maps to choose from.\n\nPros:\n+Fun\n+Lots of guns and mods for said guns to choose from\n+Interesting enemy design and boss mechaincs\n+Giant Robots\n+Chill Turkish people everywhere\n+RNG table is surprisingly generous\n+you get tons of revive tokens for free from the \"bullet\" system (RNG boxes)\n+very easy to learn\n+cool drones follow you around and shoot stuff for you\n\nCons:\n-very few players at lower difficulties\n-need to play lower difficulties to unlock higher ones\n-need to be level 15+ to do anything in PvP because the novice PvP server is a ghost town\n-takes forever to level up\n-RNG based loot crates (\"bullets\") can give you as little as 2 revive tokens\n-revive tokens for PvE, if you die, you need to spend a token\n-There's very few players\n-high-level playeers can be rude and have VERY OP weapons that kinda take the fun out of PvE\n-not fun at all solo\n-nobody ever talks, except to call you a noob in the rare event that a new player manages to get into expert/nightmare stuff\n-no voice chat, really hurts the cooperative feel\n-also, I'm pretty sure this game's going to be dead in about a year, anyway (though EnMasse has a really good track record of keeping a decently sized core playerbase: see TERA)\n\nThis is only at 11.5 hours, played almost non-stop.

I was wrong, it is a ton of fun! \n\nNow for the bad stuff, my only negatives are the HUGE number of cheaters in the game, Aimbotting, walling... nothing is off limits apparently because the admin don't give a crap... if you can ever find one. Also this game is absolutely PAY TO WIN! You can grind for weeks and NEVER get anything even remotely worth a damn, step into a server and just get wrecked by some PTW badass using aimbot and no matter how many complaints you put in or report them, they will just continue to do as they please. \n\nOther than that stuff the game is a blast, PVE is a ton of fun, just make sure you spend about $20 on EMP when you download the Free To
