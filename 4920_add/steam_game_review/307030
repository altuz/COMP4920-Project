This core gameplay is very solid and the game is very enjoyable especially if you're the type which enjoys speedrunning and constantly replaying levels in search of a faster route. The replayability also comes in the form of getting Five Stars ranking and achievements to unlock on every level.\n\nSome points to note:\n- You can change the key bindings.\n- The ONLY video option you get is Anti-Aliasing of up to 8x.\n- The sound effects are very nicely done but the music is on the flat side in my opinion. The music doesn't distract you from the gameplay but it doesn't add to it either.

A platformer built on short levels with a dual-screen dimension shift gimmick that is as disorienting as it is clever and boy does this game take that gimmick through its paces. Every possible iteration of warping between two similar platforming levels gets tried here in these tight, compact levels. The difficulty is brutal, but checkpoints are plentiful. There really is not much keeping you from the end of the game even on the Hardcore difficulty setting... well, apart from always clever, always interesting, always quick platforming. Not a second of your time is wasted (Well, I can't really say that for some of the shmup levels but even then they average out quite good, again, using the gimmick always well. And when they waste time it's just a few seconds here and there.).\n\nThe end goal of this game, though, is to go back to each of these stages and replay it until you can get a 5 star ranking, by collecting all the secrets, clearing it under par, and taking no damage. Leaderboards are implemented for those who really want to compete, and the levels do lend themselves well to perfect speedrunning.\n\nHowever, even if you don't think speedrunning is the bee's knees, the levels themselves are still consistently interesting and fun for a lovely little platformer. Far, far better than the indie schlock you might see elsewhere. (*Cough* 1001 Spikes), nor does the speedrunning feel like a crutch attached to a game that just isn't worthwhile if you aren't speedrunning (*Cough* Mighty Switch Force.). Whatever your tastes are, if you want a clever, tough platformer that does not beat around the bush, you should definitely dig into Fractured Soul.", "timestamp_updated": 1424156698, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424156698, "votes_down": 3}, {"timestamp_dev_responded": 1423268160, "recommendationid": "14348674", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502829", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1423499383, "steamid": "76561198113512148", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Edit: It's really nice to see that developers actually take their customers' complaints seriously.

Nice job, Engame.\n\nThis game looked so cool in the trailer. I was all set to like it. I'm a huge Megaman fan and this looked like something I could easily get into. Nope. The biggest issue is the controls. They make absolutely no sense. I'm using an Xbox 360 controller. The default layout is garbage, but you really can't improve on it much since you can't map the A button for some reason. The next big problem is the graphics. The only thing you can change in the settings is anti-aliasing. As someone who's using 2 GTX 980s, this is very disappointing as the game looked very graphically impressive in the trailer. I feel that was very misleading. The music in the game is repetative and unimaginative. Overall, a huge waste of $7ish. I really wish Steam did refunds because I'd be all over that.

It has been one of my favorite games and platformers of all time. The speedrunning aspect is amazing and gives you a reason to truly master the game. Anyone who is a fan of platformers and challenges will love it. It does a good job with the learning curve on introducing you to the switching mechanic, but it can be difficult to master. At its heart it is a skilled puzzle game through learning the best paths and strategies to speedrun a level--and has a suprising level of depth. Between the steam version and the 3ds version I've put over 100 hours into the game and only stopped because I was at the top of the leaderboards for most levels (on steam). \n\nI've gotten to talk to the devs some and they are really cool people who put a lot of passion into their game and it shows. They respond to their customers needs and feedback which goes a long way in my book.  \n\nAlso, I will give a cookie to anyone who can beat all my times. Feel free ask me for help or strategies to get past a level if you need it. I want really want someone to beat my times to give me an excuse to play again :D\n\nOne last thing, do yourself a favor and play on hardcore. That is where the game really shines.
