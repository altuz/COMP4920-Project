It isn't even worth referring to as \"writing.\" This may have been made by some youngsters or something because this reminds me of the kind of thing I wrote with my buddies back in middle school because of the absurd lack of depth to anything and childish dialogue. EX: Main character walks into a monastery and comments, \"This monastery is s**t!\" or some such. He just uses profanity and yells at things I ASSUME so that he sounds like some kind of cool dude with a 'tude or something? That's half the time. The other half he's just blandly helpful. He loves his girlfriend (or I guess you could choose to not tell your girlfriend you love her?). He's mostly helpful, but he complains a lot. Which is probably supposed to be some kind of parody of RPG tropes and their bland fetch quests and such. Maybe he's supposed to be bipolar? Regardless, there are a ton of easily avoided spelling and grammar mistakes (EX: use of the word \"abandonned\").\n\nI'm not just ragging on these guys for choice of words and typo's, though. Oh, no. The story itself reads like a kid wrote it. Seriously, it's like Axe Cop only not hilarious or creative. For example, at some point you enter a village and are asked to go to a cave to stop... bandits or something (?) from attacking said village. A mercenary guy joins your party to help you as he is emotionally invested in helping this village, I think. In the cave you fight some kind of ghostly knights and an ogre. Then you stumble upon a time travel amulet for no reason. The main character goes \"Sweet!\" and finds out how to go back in time. The whole reason you came to that cave (remember the village being attacked?) was completely forgotten the moment you stepped into that cave and the warrior who joined you silently sticks with you for the rest of the adventure, given no characterization or lines of dialogue again (save for maybe pointing out the amulet is a time travel amulet). Later on, after you're done using the time travel amulet, a pop-up tells you the amulet is now broken. I can only assume this was some kind of afterthought when someone asked, \"Why don't they just travel back in time again?\" Maybe it only held enough magic for one use, but where does this place you in time? And why was the demon you were chasing exist in the same time line? It seems like when it broke you went back to the future and yet he's there with you. What kind of sloppy nonsense is this!\n\nThe whole game is like this. The first town has you start in a prison that you break out of. But then it's said the prison guards somehow hold the town hostage. So, doesn't that make them warlords or something? Not just \"prison guards?\" Why do they bother running a prison? Did they turn the castle into a prison? And they all live there? What?\n\nHow about the combat? Well, it's overly basic. I guess some people think this is par for the course for RPG Maker games or JRPG's, but I think it's plain lazy. Sometimes you have to heal or manage your mana, so I guess that's something. But there's so little strategy and so much overlap between the classes.\n\nIf there's one consolation it's the music. Sweet Christmas, this person poured his/her heart into it. I mean, it's not that it's outstanding. You know? Like I'm not rushing to get the MP3's onto my iPod or anything. But there's actual composition, effort, know-how, and emotion in it. There's even a live (I think) guitar in there! I'm a sucker for metal, true, but those boss fights were intense ONLY because of this chugging distortion and orchestral synth-work. Composer, please, whoever you are, ditch these guys. You actually have some amount of talent and skill!

Battles feature party members opposed to enemies in lines on either side of the screen a la Final Fantasy VI (or III in the US), there is a basic class system offering some versatility for the main character, as well as a few other recruitable allies with various set classes. While the game is an RPG Maker game, the visuals are reasonably good for the style of the game. The music is a noteworthy strength of the game, generally being catchy, exciting, or otherwise appropriate for the given circumstances.\n\nI do not recommend this game however. For all of the things right, there are a number of faults that detract from the overall experience leaving the game, as a whole, lacking. The game is short, at a somewhat methodical pace, trying to collect everything in each level, the game's first playthrough didn't take more than a couple of hours. Most of my time in the game was fooling around with the controller settings in which there were legitimately issues upon release (to the developer's credit, they acted quickly to resolve this, kudos to them for that).\n\nThe gameplay seemed somewhat unresponsive, particularly in menus, being an RPG, this wasn't gamebreaking, but still slightly annoying throughout the game. A number of glitches existed and in the short time it took to complete the game, I encountered the screen freezing after a scripted puzzle moved the screen, rain that carried over to other areas (including inside a shop and houses), etc. In combat, most of the abilities felt uninspired and, on normal difficulty setting at least, they could be all but ignored. Attack and/or heal pretty much would win the game if characters were decently equipped. The attacks didn't feel necessary or worthwhile to do. For instance, one of the final abilities I acquired with my assassin class only dealt about 10% more damage than my regular attack on average, for a relatively high SP cost. SP moves felt lackluster as they cost large amounts of SP (particularly for non mage classes), but only boasted marginal damage increases for using them with few added effects that often were unreliable. (It MIGHT apply a status effect. and to this day, I've never sucessfully paralyzed an enemy with the mage's Paralyze spell.)\n\nStory, was rather cliche and didn't feel relevant most of the time (if the gameplay were stronger, it might have been easier to overlook). Dialogue was usually particularly weak, with frequently mispelled words and conversation, at times, so unnatural to the point it was distracting.\n\nPro's:\n\n+Good soundtrack.\n+Pretty visuals.\n\nCon's:\n\n-Very short.\n-Weak story/dialogue.\n-Combat is not compelling, particularly abilities don't feel useful/necessary.\n\nFortunately the game's low price point and an available demo do not make this a huge investment and some may find the game worth the time to play it.
