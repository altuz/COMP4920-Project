The game uses an approach of sprites stitched together to make a human. It used to be a common technique in flash games, nothing wrong with it. But here he's used too few, so arms and legs don't bend. Your character crouches by attaching their legs to their shoulders (legs which look like turkey drumsticks),  arms are always bent at a slight angle, face is permanantly locked into one stern expression (with unremovable goggles). In general its just really awkward to look at and visually disappointing\n\nControls are awkward. Interacting with anything is a game of carefully positioning yourself into the right spot so it glows and can be interacted with. Mildly annoying for treasure, but a serious liability when you're trying to use consoles in the heat of battle. Consoles themselves are painful to manage, interacting with them locks your movement keys. The chatbar is also a huge pain, as well as being very buggy. The button to close the chatbar (tab) also opens the scoreboard, which you have to hit tab again to close.\n\nNeither your personal weapons, nor the submarine itself, can be properly aimed up or down. You get about 45 degrees of inclination and declination, which is a huge pain in a gameworld that is so heavy on verticality. It makes combat and steering awkward.\n\nCombat, at least initially, is highly repetitive. Which is bad because it's the core of the game. Leftclick to attack, or more likely, hold leftclick to spam swings. That's literally it, attacks can't be aimed, there's no stamina, no timing, no heavy strikes or dodges. You just click and hold until something dies.\nIt gets a bit better when you unlock some ranged weapons, i was fond of hurling dynamite. But at that point the game's camera becomes your main enemy. It's zoomed in way too far, and you can't pan around. So anything more than a couple feet infront is offscreen. You practically have to get into melee range to use ranged weapons, or else fire blindly offscreen and pray. The close camera is an issue for submarine combat too.\n\nIf you die in any manner, you can be revived at the cost of a permanant loss of 20% max health. According to the wiki there's no way to undo this. Dying is already pretty easy, yyour tiny health pool forces you to sprint back to the sub to rest every 30 seconds. one mistake and you're screwed\n\nRight now, combat on foot seems to be the main meat of the gameplay, you land in a cave and explore it. But it's just awkward and repetitive.\n\nSubmarine combat is a bit better. One person steers the sub, one mans the guns. The turret turns terribly slowly, but that's a fitting choice for the nature of the game. However it doesn't mesh well with some other choices. For example every early enemy is melee based.  Generally giant sharks, squids, etc. They charge at your sub and just hug you, chewing away. The biggest issue is that enemies can pass through you, so they can go from one side of you to another in half a second, while your turret takes several painful seconds to rotate. \nThe best you can really do is guess which direction they're going to go, and rotate the turret in advance to point there. it really is guesswork, since enemies stop for a couple seconds and charge suddenly, there's not much prediction. \n\nThere doesn't seem to be much story or context to speak of. There are some interesting events - like a ghost ship crashing into you, or a time traveller appearing on your ship. But these have very little narrative and seem to exist as a framework for more of the awful foot combat, by dropping intruders onto your sub. Everything comes back to the combat and it can't carry the game\n\nIt's also full of bugs, probably par for the course in early access, but bears mentioning. The scoreboard and chatbar are both buggy, you frequently end up halfway through floor, arms get stuck in odd poses, and whenever you're close to another player you seem to take control of their head and it looks at your cursor, instead of showing you where they're looking.\n\nLast, but not least, crewing problems. \nThis is advertised as a game for 2-4 players. I have two - myself and a friend. There's also a small ship which specifically states it's intended for a crew of two. \nBut frankly, this game is not fit for two people.  There are three critical roles on a ship.\nThe pilot has to steer. This is emphasised by the rather baffling design that the pilot can't stop the ship. The sub can only be stopped or started by altering power in the engine room. So the pilot is glued to the steering wheel at all times, lest you crash\n\nA gunner has to shoot. this is pretty important in combat if you want to not die. the shield wont last long, and you can die very fast once its down. The two ship weapons available (machinegun and torpedoes) can only be switched between by altering power in the engine room. If she leaves the guns, nobody is shooting and fights will never end. \n\nAnd an engineer is needed to repair breaches, adjust power levels for the above two, and fight off boarders.\nGiven there was only two of us, we try our best to be pilot and gunner without a dedicated engineer, but it fails badly. Something is always left undone if one of us has to leave their console. The ship simply cannot be crewed effectively by less than three people\nThis could be ameliorated by adding a brake for the pilot, so they could at least pull over in order to go fix things\n\n\nIn summary, the game has a lot of issues, some in design, some bugs, and a great many sharp edges that need smoothed out. Since combat is the core gameplay, it needs a lot more depth, skill and complexity. The exploration needs some purpose to it. And if the game is seriously meant for 2-4 people, then some work needs to be done on making sure its properly playable at both extremes. \n\n4.5/10, in need of a lot of work yet.", "timestamp_updated": 1505851931, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505851931, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35255594", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497351", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506559098, "steamid": "76561198049038867", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Lack of players, can't play alone.
