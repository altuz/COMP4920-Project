Asteria is just a weak aimless metroidvania with intept aiming and confused end user interface in a procedurally generated bland \nlandscape.\n\nReview: Those who compared this to Starbound and Terraria were absolutely correct. The navigation of the interface and menus is made fairly difficult with the gamepad and I would almost recommend KB+M setup over it despite the platforming elements. The crafting table left me pretty underwhelmed and unimpressed and constituted of just a collection of random components to spawn certain items. There did not seem to be a huge selection of stuff to even make, and most of it was better version of a previous thing. From what I saw you cannot actually build environments and make instead gear and whatnot. THe world is a procredurally generated boring collection of water bodies, caves and uneven terrain with the occasional dungeon portal scattered around that you play as a standalone instance with chests in it. The twin stick aiming felt really sluggish on the controller, with way to much time spent rotating the aiming reticle around. This was made even more annoying in that the protag will face whichever direction he shoots in, not whichever direction he walks towards. Which meant that I often found myself rotating all the way around just because it was bugging me that I was walking backwards after taking a turn down a tunnel. The combat system seems to be sci fi laser related, and I would assume gets a tiny bit of diversification and mostly power boost with upgrades. The game uses very tiny tiles to make graphics which gives it a nice and polished look. At the same time, you could see the tiny tiles as gigantic pixels, which in fact they are once you realize that their color are just tiled texturing themselves. So once your brain starts to factor all that in the game keeps a firmly low budget feeling despite the effort. I thought the backgrounds looked much better than the foregrounds.\n The audio featured some electronic music and weak sound effects for combat, the repetitiveness of the spider sound was getting grating. The controls themselves felt okay for character movement but the camera behavior, as it scrolled the screen around and tried to stay centered when jumping felt jarring, which suprised me given how zoomed out the action is to begin with.\n\nThis was just a first impression but Asteria left me feeling like it offered the worst of both worlds, all the restrictiveness of a classic platformer. The hybridization with the RPG genre through crafting elements felt crude and not fully implemented or thought out. But you did not even get handcrafted level design and instead are left with geographical messes with lack of interesting features and a bunch of randomly generated ressources all represented by samey looking tiny icons.", "timestamp_updated": 1501724768, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500947603, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 41, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 56, "total_reviews": 97}}
