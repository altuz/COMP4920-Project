You can play with no sound and still get pretty much the same experience, which is a pretty big indicator that this game isn't as music-centered as it likes to pretend.\nUpon having to play an extra two minutes to be allowed to post this review, I found that there's hardly even any difference in two of the three game modes, survival and score run are the same thing except score run lets you take a few hits before you die.", "timestamp_updated": 1498795579, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498795579, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 16}}
