I know the developer worked hard, but it's just not worth the $6.00 for full price. I got it for less then a dollar, and I feel maybe $1 or $2 is worth it. \n\nThat being said, what is it exactly? It's a very odd game. The best way to describe it is as a beat 'em up adventure game, where you have a choice between beating people up, or actually resolving problems peacefully. Peaceful resolutions are achieved through a surprisingly deep conversation system, where you need to pick your tone and attitude to give them a high opinion of you and convince them to listen to you. Alternatively, you can just attack them, using your three moves; a punch, a kick, and a shoulder charge. And it's not limited either. While you can only engage in deep conversation with certain NPCs, and have regular conversations with everyone else, you can litterally beat the crap out of every NPC in the game. \n\nThere is a loot system in the game, as you gain items from clearing your objectives. You end up having three stats; attack, defense, and speed, and the items will vary the values in different ways. Although, if you're not planning on being in combat all the time, it's usually a good idea to keep your speed up while walking around, and then if the item you want to use for combat lowers the speed, put it on before the fight. If your speed is low you will be very very slow at walking around.\n\nThe writing in the game is great, as its a parody of professional fighting/wrestling, considering your main character is a former world champion, who gets the equivelant of the Montreal Screwjob, and then takes off for at least a year. Upon coming back he decides to reconnect with his old rivals, who have taken up various odd jobs around the city. You need to deal with all of them and then you end up with the, uh, very bizarre finale.\n\nIt took me two hours to get through the game, but I only got 17 achievements since most of them are attacked to different paths and choices. There are also four difficulty settings, from Easy to Insane, and I played on Normal. These difficulties are just for bragging since they have no associated achievements. There is also apparently modding capability, but no one has really bothered with it as of yet.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game. It's funny, and a unique concept. As said before I can't recommend it at full cost but on sale you will definetly get your worth out of this 'game of the hour'.", "timestamp_updated": 1498877360, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498877360, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 20}}
