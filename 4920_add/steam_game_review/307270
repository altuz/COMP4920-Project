As a 2D Side scrolling plat former, it plays pretty basic. You must switch between two characters, and use their abilities to help one another get past a certain obstacle, obese managerial officer or a harmless office plant. The game offers three game modes, Normal, Hardcore, and Old School, each of which are basically a different difficulty, but the Old School mode really puts you in your place and requires quick thinking and a shit ton of lemonade.\n\nWith what seems like a playful story, the character dialogue unsurfaces some mature issues about this post WWII world, making each of the 72 levels that much more satisfying to play through. \n\nOverall, I have enjoyed my time so far in the Super Lemonade Factory and I plan to do so for a short while more.\n\n+ Lovely visuals and accompanying soundtrack\n+ Some deep story elements can be found underneath it's bubbly surface\n+ Plenty of levels and achievements to keep you busy\n\n- Not a big fan of switching characters\n- Some puzzles are cramped, often there is not a lot of room to move and items you need can get stuck in corners\n- I TOTALLY GOT THAT JUMP.

Not worth $5, but hey, on sale it's a great buy.\n\nEDIT (10/15/2014): I figured I'd elaborate on this review since it's sort of just a flat statement.\n\nThis game is a port from the mobile versions. It runs seemingly capped at 30 fps. At first I thought it might have been a compatibility issue with my 144hz monitor, similar to the ongoing issue Spelunky HD faces currently (which still has yet to be resolved, btw), but that wasn't the case. The game is just capped. This hinders the platforming, for which this game is advertised. \n\nThat issue aside, having forced myself to play, this game was still enjoyable. It took all of those 1.3 hours to beat, not rushing through anything. I didn't go for 100% because the low framerate cap eventually became too much to handle. \n\nThe artwork is great, but the music is not memorable.\n\nTo conclude: for 1.3 hours of gameplay $5 is not a bargain in the least, but yeah, on sale it's a worthwhile purchase.", "timestamp_updated": 1422017185, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405987630, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "11338637", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506229", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1430331197, "steamid": "76561198037931362", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Superrrrr simple and really fun, for the night when you dont have the energy to play something that envolves pew pew, or when you wanna think about something a bit different (by what the characters say, its fun to figure out their lives).
