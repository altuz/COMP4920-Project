The controls are shoddy, the fights are short and pointless and I find the entire game to be an insult to Capoeira. I would understand if the game was in PreAlpha, but it has been around for about 2 years before coming to Steam so the windo for improving it has been open for a long time. The only reason I can see for this pile of rubbish being released is to coincide with the world cup being held in Brazil. double thumbs down from a very disappointed fan of Capoeira", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1402683017, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1402683017, "recommendationid": "10461450", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615870", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1402670093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 207, "steamid": "76561198043424864", "num_games_owned": 254}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 60, "comment_count": "5", "review": "First off I actually like the game and enjoy playing, the fighting itself is a bit different from most games like this as in it is more strategy than button mashing.

After a few minutes I quit playing story mode, and then I noticed that when I do the tutorial, you learn instead of 5 techniques, 3 techniques at the basic technique tutorial... and then it suddenly stops and I get back in the main menu with the settings again on full, once again blowing my ears out.
