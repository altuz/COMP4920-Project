All hallmarks of being an APP initially. The game takes a long time to cycle through the various phases of every turn. The arenas are always small and with one or two pieces of junk thrown in the scenery as lame obstacles. Because the UI is inept you must click a bunch of times to do the most basic actions, the landscapes in tactics mode are featureless and empty. The characters look like cheap flat outdated 2D comic book type sprites. The game is full of silly references to naruto, pokemon and other kiddish things.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494316320, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506060155, "recommendationid": "31641604", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5}}
