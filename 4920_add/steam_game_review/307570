AGAIN another masterpiece from Wadjet Eye Games. \n\nA Golden Wake fictionalizes the 1920s Florida / Miami land boom and bubble burst through real characters and one fictional character named Alfred Banks, a real estate agent who's fate is linked to the rise and fall of the real estate business.\n\nYou'll learn and remember a lot of real historical facts and characters in A Golden Wake. Very interesting\n\nThe game also makes you think about life, the foibles of a cruel society, and the different facets of the human being, evil and good. I felt much empathy for Alfred Banks from the start to the end, combined with the on-spot jazzy music adding even more emotion.\n\nThanks to Francisco Gonzales, Pete Gresser for the perfect jazzy music and Dave Gilbert & co at Wadjet Eye Games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500999316, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501765555, "recommendationid": "33789572", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499628875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 527, "steamid": "76561198046449230", "num_games_owned": 18}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Oh it is a bad game. Unfortunately. I like almost all the other Wadjet Eye Games and I usually don\u00b4t write reviews, but this game is very disappointing so I wanted to warn you on spending your money on this one. The part in the free demo was picked perfectly, as it is the best part of the game (wich is why i gave it a shot).\nThings which really made me angry:\n\n- Poor voice acting, especially Merrick (in my opinion). The main character speaks good though.\n- Very (very) poor and few \"riddles\"\n- The most interesting feature are the persuasion games, however it doesn\u00b4t matter if you persuade somebody or not\n- You are sometimes given different options of answers in  dialogues, this answers however only influence the following sentence. --> it doesn\u00b4t matter what you answer\n- playing the game is like beeing in a prison, everything is strict, sturdy and planned. It doesn\u00b4t matter how you play the game, no effect on the outcome. no replay value.\n- the time span covers 20 years or so, but many backscreens are just recycled. (for example there is a hotel scene and there are some dancers dancing. A hurricane destroys the city, several years pass by and what goes on in the hotel when you visit it again? The same dancers are doomed and dance all the time into eternity..) even the text when you click on recycled things stays the same for ever..", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499629669, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499630710, "recommendationid": "33413201", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499882", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500177097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 243, "steamid": "76561197966471297", "num_games_owned": 707}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Don't buy. Any other Wadjet Eye game is miles ahead of this. There's minimal interactivity - no flavor text on objects or when you try counter-intuitive actions. Any effort you put into exploring the world is wasted - you can only choose the action that advances the weak and contrived (albeit historically inspired) plot. The protagonist is hard to identify with, irritating, and ultimately boring. Puzzles are nonexistent, and many setpieces are recycled. The exciting and underused 1920s setting is completely squandered. This is the laziest game I have ever paid money for. The developer is competent because Shardlight turned out to be quite good, but perhaps he put all his effort in research instead of making a fun game this round.\n\n\"full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.\" - Try that, but without even the sound and fury to keep you entertained.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501664379, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501666091, "recommendationid": "33966772", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501015", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 41, "total_reviews": 59, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 18}}
