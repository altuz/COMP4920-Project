No exploration, no shooting. Only moving and jumping. \n\nWhat else is there? A self-contained level whose borders you can cross to find yourself on the other side, and traps. Tons of traps that cycle during the duration of the level. Machine-guns, homing missiles, bubble-gum to make the platforms sticky while a see-saw journeys across\u2026 The goal of the game is to collect items that spawn in the level while avoiding different sets of traps. Simple, and yet effective.\n\nThis game is exactly what I was looking for. I am quite sick of the \u2018muscle memory\u2019 platformers where you have to learn by heart at which point of the level you jump, the perfect trajectory to land between spikes, and so on. Penarium focuses on the moment-to-moment frantic experience. Quick skills are required instead of a good finger memory, and it is rather telling that less than 20% of the players completed the 1st world. Penarium is very difficult, and as it sports a \u201csadistic circus\u201d theme, you would have to be a masochist to like it. \n\nAnd yet I never found its difficulty to cross the \u201cunfair\u201d invisible line. The hitbox of the character is actually smaller than he looks. The movements are perfect, with double-jump and responsive controls without either the sliding momentum or the input delay that harm many platformers. The traps are more or less hard to avoid, but all can be predictable or give the player visual cues. But yeah, quick thinking and fast reflexes are mandatory. Oh, and I really appreciate that there is no timer adding an external pressure to the action. It is possible to either rush through the traps, or time them carefully. \n\nSo despite the high difficulty, moving like a madman and surviving amongst the chaos is exhilarating. It is fun. It does not feel like the game is punishing the player, because the action is constant and the threats come from everywhere while still being manageable. And the variety/movement of traps help make the game not feel repetitive. It can be finished in a few hours, and this type of game is not enjoyable if it gets much longer than that. To extend the fun, there is an endless mode with permanent progression.\n\nTo conclude, I was surprised to love this simple game so much more than the other hardcore platformers. I think it\u2019s due to the good maneuverability, the difficult yet manageable design, and most of all the dynamic traps that require quick skills and provide a lot of fun by getting rid of the \u2018muscle memory\u2019 level design that usually goes with that kind of platformers.  \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=712733656\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467127755, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1467127755, "recommendationid": "23896414", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521010", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464121643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 502, "steamid": "76561198008885269", "num_games_owned": 120}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Oh the joy and the lower back pains this game gave me..\nPenarium is an addictive game.
