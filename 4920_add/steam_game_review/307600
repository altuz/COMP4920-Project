While I liked the first Chainsaw Warrior, it had some problems which were addressed in this game:\n- The inventory screen was clunky, only displaying two cards/items at a time. The user interface for this game is a significant improvement and much more streamlined, letting you see everything you have in one screen.\n- Similarly, whenever you attacked, you had to always pick your weapon, which could be a pain because it required you to keep telling the game \"Yes, I want to use this weapon\". Picking a weapon to attack with in this game is just one click on the bottom of the screen, plus you have the option to not use a weapon, which isn't in the first game.\n- Rerolling in the first game was TEDIOUS, since there was no way to do it except to constantly restart a new game and roll every individual stat. In this game, all your stats are rolled at once and there's an option to reroll right in the character creation screen. You don't know how much less of a hassle the game became because of this alone.\n- Ranged weapons were harder to use in the first game. First you had to roll for reflexes just to get a chance to hit, then you rolled for your chance to hit, and each weapon had its individual numbers to roll for each enemy type, which was affected by your marksmanship. In this game, it's less complex: marksmanship is the ranged version of your hand-to-hand score and is rolled against the enemy's reflexes or power (depending on if they're ranged or not), with some weapons offering a bonus to marksmanship. It makes ranged weapons less of a pain to use.\n\nAs for the new/reworked elements, I rather liked them. There's a little more replayability with unlockable items now, especially with different chainsaws (also, you start with a chainsaw automatically now). Using ranged weapons is a little easier now (no more botched reflex rolls), plus having weapons that can take out multiple enemies is very nice. Some of the more oddball items from the first game are gone, and nearly every item in this game has its uses and doesn't feel as situationally-useful as in the first game.\n\nAlso, you can punch Darkness. That's cool.\n\nOverall, a much improved sequel to Chainsaw Warrior. If you liked the first one, this is definitely worth getting.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494494286, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494494499, "recommendationid": "31679864", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
