And when I saw this game on Steam, I jumped at the chance to relive those memories of my childhood I blew on Flash games like Stick RPG 2. And those memories came back, for the first hour, the next two were slowly realizing this game's critical flaw.\n\nThere's one issue with this game: You can play the same game for free, still on those sites. In fact, the only thing this \"Director's Cut\" adds is an entire small area with a whole 3 different jobs, a few combat zones and a small plot involving murder. It also gives you cheats of varying utility, mostly making the grind easier to pull off. But everything else about this game is stock standard from the free online game, in fact too much is.\n\nI blew 2.99 on this game, and that's the lowest I've ever seen it go and I still wasn't satisfied. This game needs a lot more content to differentiate itself from the online version, and it doesn't. It's still in the same resolution with the same annoying XGen save system, the same incredibly outdated memes and the same music. It's a incredibly painful port of the game onto Steam in an attempt to revive nostalgia in people of the original game without much attempt to make it better than the free version still available to play on every flash game site on the Internet.\n\nMy advice: Play the free version online and leave this overpriced port to languish in the same hell that all bad ports sink into.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501190324, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501190324, "recommendationid": "33841648", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477081", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1403005120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 204, "steamid": "76561198042289508", "num_games_owned": 115}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Aside from the version thats free, you only get like a few new jobs.
