Here's why. There is a bunch of scenarios in the campaign, it's not one long campaign so your characters and items do not carry over so there is little incentive to give a shit about them or bother too hard with optimizing people. Your party changes a lot as well. \n\nStory is okay I guess, it's a supernatural wild west like if the Mysterious Stranger from Red Dead Redemption made a game. It's nothing special at all.\n\nLike XCOM, the hit rate and luck can be insanely frustrating. You don't have a big party so sometimes you get 2 character turns or so then the enemies 6 people start stumbling around and you have to wait every single time as they move really slow. So you take your shot, miss, and then watch them tipple around until you finally get your turn to miss again. \n\nYou can unlock special moves and such through playing but I have yet to find a single use for any of them. They're so specific and require so much Luck (attribute in the game) that it's just ultimatley easier and far more effective to just shoot them normally. It can also be really difficult to find decent cover as enemies come from EVERY direction so you always have to spend at least one action point running away to hide, letting you shoot only once which will likely miss anyway making the battles take a very long time.\n\nAll in all, it's not that bad but I just couldn't recommend it for all it's flaws.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506177204, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506177223, "recommendationid": "35155108", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512593", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501482674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 219, "playtime_forever": 1048, "steamid": "76561197961194018", "num_games_owned": 420}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A textbook \"Get on sale\" kind of game.\n\nHard West is a case of amazing ideas executed good enough.

I really, really wanted to like it. I love the wild west, I love supernatural, and I love tactical, but this game is just too confused for its own good.\n\nAs others have said, everything is divided in scenarios. Unfortunately, the scenarios are short (1-2 hours), so just as you really get rolling and interested in it, it ends. Then nothing you did in the previous ones carry over. The cool guns? The characters? The snazzy equipment? Were you buying and using alcohol to raise your characters Max HP? None of that matters. 1-2 hours and you start from scratch.\n\nThe other problem with starting from scratch is by Scenario 3, I just didn't care anymore. The characters disappear, the plot is jumbled and confusing (scenario 1 is you as a miner fighting cowboys, scenario 2 is you as ghost rider fighting demons - I'm not joking), and it just takes away all enjoyment when you know none of it matters.\n\nThe luck system is also a pretty huge failure, as it makes it nearly impossible to figure out when you can hit. It might say you have a 60% chance, but I tested this 10 times against one enemy, and I missed every time. Luck will ultimately decide whether or not you hit.\n\nYou also can't take back moves, so you if you accidentally click a space, there goes your character, walking to their death.    As a huge fan of tactical games, they really took out a lot of the tactical things and strategy. They could have done a lot with medium, short, and long range guns and party members that excel at them and making you fight a variety of enemies with specialities. Ultimately, nearly everyone gets a six-shooter and a longer range gun and it doesn't matter. Why is my shotgun better at hitting a guy 12 spaces away than my pistol? I have no idea. The game said so.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is that each scenario has its own gimmick, but those gimmicks are the ENTIRE scenario. So scenario 1 is all about gold mining (which is pointless, you discover. I had 1300 gold at the end of it with nothing to spend it on and none of it transferred). Scenario 2 is just about ruthlessly murdering people, and Scenario 3 is... a trading game. Yes. It's a trading game. You need to buy goods from one store at a low price and sell them at a higher price later. Also the game suddenly introduces a hunger mechanic for no reason.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how confusing and frustrating this is for a player. I liked being a miner - I really did - and just as I got used to it, it changed. Then I was a spirit of vengeance - okay, complete 180, but I went with it. Then a trading sim? That isn't what I signed up for, and it not only wasn't what I wanted, it was really poorly done. It wasn't intuitive how to figure out prices, who to sell them to, or when.\n\nA great idea gone completely to waste.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506841075, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506841075, "recommendationid": "35367196", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505095", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506780968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 700, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 998, "steamid": "76561198015913752", "num_games_owned": 253}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Good alternative for Xcoms(firaxis ones).

In other words, if I never shut up about how the wallpaper in your house makes me want to stab my eyes out lest they see it again, you can assume the plumbing was functional.

And I certainly got that, but it was jumbled in the middle of a genuinely unique and great RPG in the exact style of \"Deadlands\" an RPG in the savage worlds system. The Story Elements genuinely make this game fun. Maybe not an original world since it's on the coattails of the Savage worlds game. But so what?
