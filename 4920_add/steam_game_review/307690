You are either going to love it, or hate it with no inbetween.  It is safe to say that I am in love with this game.  The storyline alone could keep you hooked, but it is much more than that.   I have a tendency to go off on sidequest adventures to the point where I forget where I was in the main story.  Fortunately this game does not let you get that deep into sidequests as they open up while you progress the main story.   At first I was annoyed by being forced to complete missions in order to open up side quests, but in the end I appreciated the fact that I never got so into side quests that I forgot where the heck I was in the story.\n\nWhat can you say about Wei Shen?  At first I thought his character was going to be this angry guy that carries a chip on his shoulder the size of China.  While he does remain pretty angry, he is a protaganist that has every reason to be as you discover in the story.  I really enjoyed the fact that he was undercover amongst the Triads and you get to see him walk that line between the law and the underworld.  I also loved the fact that you had side missions that were on both sides of the law as well.  They did a wonderful job showing Wei's struggle to do what is right over just wanting to go on his personal revenge.  Every great protaganist needs a silly sidekick, and you get that with Wei's best friend, Jackie.  If anyone watches the show Pawn Stars, Jackie's personality reminds me of Chumlee.  The voice actors were on point with their characters.  All roles were played beautifully.  Oh... Wei Shen singing karaoke is a must do in this game.  Listening to him sing Flock of Seagulls was hilarious.\n\nThe world itself is pretty big, so it took me awhile to explore every part of the map, but I have always enjoyed games where you have the ability to explore from one corner of the map to the other.  Of course it took me a few car crashes to remember that I was driving on the wrong side of the road.  After that, exploring became more enjoyable.  I went into this game blind, so I knew nothing about these random events that would pop up while you explore.  Finding some lady in a trunk of a car with lingerie on, who then proceeded to chew me out because I messed up her and her lover's fantasy, kept me quite amused.  I won't say what any of the others one are, so I don't spoil things.   \n\nCombat was okay.  I did like that you did not have to use a gun or any other weaponry for the most part.  Hand to hand combat was effective and I didn't have to curse at my screen because I had to wait while Wei reloaded.  The reason why I just say it is okay is because it was pretty simple using a mouse.  You just clicked and clicked and you could pummel some unfortunate peon into the ground.  I did play with a controller as well, and that made combat a lot more challenging when it came to getting off combos and the like.  Wei's leveling system was pretty well designed.  He had a level system as a Triad member, as a police officer, and as an ordinary helpful citizen.  Each of these level systems had some wonderful perks, so they were all worth maxing out.  The hardest one to level up for me was for the Triads.  I had to replay some missions to get a higher score, but the police and citizen track was pretty easy.. no backtracking needed.  \n\nThere is so much to do in here, boredom just does not happen.  If you like open world games, you will love this one.  Regular price or sale price, it is completely worth the money.  I even enjoyed the DLC, which is not something I say very often about any DLC.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505765774, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505765774, "recommendationid": "35052364", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569943", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505035472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2498, "steamid": "76561198389715861", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 42, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Chinese version of gta but lot cooler and has Kung-fu.
