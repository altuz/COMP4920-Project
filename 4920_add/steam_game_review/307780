It's an excellent game and runs really well on the PC. One thing that kind of sucks for some people is how short the story is (takes about 6-8 hours without skipping any scenes depending on how often you need to continue) but most of Mortal Kombat X's replay value is in the competative and casual online games with friends and random players. Combos feel great to pull off as they are not quite as easy to string together as other fighters I play (in my opinion), and the large roster with 3 variations of moves per fighter is a perfect way to keep games fresh. Another minor flaw for some people is that a lot of costumes are in the Krypt which you either have to grind for gold to unlock everything, or buy the DLC to unlock everything (I don't recommend it unless it's on sale)\n\nOverall it's great game, a bit graphically demanding, tons of replay value, definitely worth the purchase.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506611631, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506622190, "recommendationid": "35264256", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505392650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 842, "steamid": "76561198402746699", "num_games_owned": 2}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Best game really like it", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1506878926, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506878926, "recommendationid": "35390372", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500676", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506986813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198287769760", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "by far the worst set of controls ever", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506986854, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506986854, "recommendationid": "35430649", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506825877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 912, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 912, "steamid": "76561198322208749", "num_games_owned": 50}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game but 3 hours of gameplay like legit", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506728947, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506728947, "recommendationid": "35316316", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501864", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500142042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 176, "steamid": "76561198099234862", "num_games_owned": 65}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Simple words...just amazing game, great work for Netherrealm for this version.\n\nIt's visually better, richer in content and more comprehensive in terms of gameplay compared to its predecessor.
