The only reason I'm taking the time to do this is to warn potential buyers. I bought this game a year ago. I bought the 4 pack so that me and my friends could all play together. The game looked cool and seemed like a cool concept and though I've always had some hesitation about buying into Early Access games, I saw the potential for this game. When my friends and I played this game at the time it was barely functioning. While I could play, I found the gameplay to be absolutely bare bones with little to do. Two of my friends on the other hand could not even run it properly without it crashing every half hour. Their hardware is not bad enough that this game should do that. I believe that the issues they experienced were due to poor optimization. The poor gameplay combined with the poor performance left a bad taste in all our mouths but we figured that the game was in very early access and while I can't fathom why any developer would want to release their game in such an unfinished state to the public, we hoped that this game would improve. We tried playing it again some months later and sadly it was the same story. No improvements had been implemented as far as any of us could tell and my friends who had gotten new machines were still plagued with stability issues.\n\nFast forward to now. I decide to check the updates on this game, figuring that it had been some time and I see a post from the developer that explained that they were working on another project as of July and attributed that project for the reason why development on this game had stalled. We're near October and no word for the developer on the steam front has shown up. Honestly this game shouldn't have been allowed to be put up on the store. It allowed the dev team to make money which most likely went toward other projects. They preyed on the good will, hope, and ignorance of their customers and will continue to do so in all likely hood. This game should be taken down from the store and the developers should be called out on their poor business practices.\n\nI know that in their post they said they had contractual obligations they needed to meet for other projects and implied that this game was more of a \"passion project\" but that doesn't change the fact that they accepted money from other people not for a product they had but a product they promised and with the little to no progress they've made in delivering that product I cannot recommend that anyone give these guys any more money.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nDon't buy this game! It's just a trap for the developer to take your money and use it for other projects. This is pretty much abandon-ware that they are hoping to make some quick cash off of and will only update it when the fanbase gets riled up enough to scream bloody murder.
