I really enjoyed it! Anyone who loves animals, the ecosystem and a good, a bit complex and difficult economy/strategy/simulator/magement game to play or have kids and wants to play something on the PC with them should buy this game as soon as possible and buy the whole collection!\nPS: You need to own Wildlife Park 2 to play but for the Missions/Quests  & Different Starting Screen to appear you need to launch the according game icon, for example for Marine World Missions you need to launch Marine World but for Wildlife Park 2 you need to launch Wildlife Park 2.

What I like is that, despite it only being DLC, it's a standalone game too, you can play it without needing the base game installed.\n\nWhat I Dislike: The game teases you with what you can find in other expansions. In some campaigns you're allowed to mess around and play with animals from other expansions (Which is pretty neat tbh, and not really a downside), however, this confused me once I went into freeplay and was only left with \"some\" of the marine animals. All others are locked, the game does not tell me why and I cannot find any information online as to why. I understand why the base game animals are not there, but when I have unlimited cash in freeplay there is no reason why all the marine animals are not available.\n\nOverall, this is a good game. At times it felt like it was trying too hard to be a zoo tycoon copy. While this game does play like a ripoff of the more major title, some parts of it are done way better (better quality animal appearences, more realistic animal interactions, the ability to choose the color you want on certain animals, guests require doctors when animals hurt them) but other features it falls short (instructions are never clear, sometimes frustratingly so, random parts of other expansions are \"thrown in\" as a tease but leave you more confused than in want of more (I spent 2 hours trying to figure out what to do with the researcher until I realized he couldn't do anything in my game), and controls take some getting used.)\n\nDespite the bad sides, this is an incredible competitor to Zoo Tycoon 2 and I believe if they had polished it a little more and made it more player friendly, it could have been more popular than the ever nostalgic ZT2.\nReccommended for anyone seeking an alternative to Zoo Tycoon.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495782205, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495782205, "recommendationid": "31966991", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "total_reviews": 12, "num_reviews": 12, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
