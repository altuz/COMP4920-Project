Has a few improvements like choosing skin varients and being able to sterilize animals. The missions are a little more challenging. I liked the new buildings and decorations. I loved the new maps. There are many new maps to chose from that vary in climate and set up. If you like plants, it has crop farming which can replace your greenhouse. I liked the animals better and caring for the plants wasn't very fun for me. \n\nA little buggy for me. The skin varients didn't work for me in freestyle, only in the missions. The narrator for the missions didn't speak (which maybe you prefer, but I would rather hear him talk). Also all the animals constantly vocalized so if you went to first-person mode near a large group of animals you might find all the noise quite annoying. \n\nThe expansions for WLP2 don't tie together very well. For example, if I wanted to play Crazy Zoo, I could still get the Farm World animals, but thats it. None of the plants, buildings, or decorations would transfer to the other expansion, which is kind of annoying. \n\nI enjoy playing the game, it would just be a lot better if they fixed the buggy stuff.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1407047046, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1407047979, "recommendationid": "11530534", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538307", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438440755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 122, "steamid": "76561198038741660", "num_games_owned": 68}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is really bad from many perspectives. \n\nTutorial - From scene 3, you just have to figure out yourself how to achieve the listed goals.

There are many options for ground leveling but it doesn't work properly. I mean roller coaster tycoon that was released on 1999 works better then this.\n\nItem tooltip - So the rice says it's cold. What do you want? A blanket? \n\nPlanting - You have to plant the rice one at a time. How annoying is that?
