All the old bugbears have been taken out. goes on regular 50pc sale. Well worth a peek.\n\nLong ramble below....\n\nHello there\n\nI dont often write reviews as there are others far more adept to that than I. But Here goes...\n\nIm an old *original* Il2 player and a fan of all the off-shoots and rivals of the genre.\n\nSo, when Battke of Stalingrad was released I was very keen to take a look.\n\nHowever, like many, I was (incorrectly) expecting an upgraded version of IL2 and it's oodles of content. That and the Premium plane puchaces seemed \"odd\" to my sensibilities.\n\nSo, for a couple of years I shelved the sereies (and the genre) and tootled off to do other stuff.\n\nFast forward a few years and I got the sim bug again and fiddled with War Thunder, which initially was impressive. But the pay to win aspect as well as the \"wobbly plane\" lack of fine controlability became too much for me and I looked elsewhere.\n\nCoincidentally, the BoX (ie BoS,BoM,BoK etc) was on one of it's regular 50pc sales so i snaffled up BoS for 25 quid.\n\nComming from Il2/DCS etc and not wanting an arcadey experience I initially balked at some design aspects and interface decisions of BoS (as well as the premium plane shop).\n\nBut after spending some time with the game and seeing massive improvements the devs had implemented and knowing of upcoming changes to the series, I can now understand many of the choices the devs have made, which at the time felt so alien and \"wrong\" but are actually simply \"different\" and have their own value.\n\nThe \"Premium\" planes were renamed as \"Collector\" planes as that's exactly what they are. They're not needed nor are they pay to win as each is very quirky and by no means a beast rather are for enthusiasts.\n\nThe unlock system for extra weapon pods/extras has now been removed (which I actually rather liked) and the Visual options has been greatly expanded.\n\nTo name but a few examples\n\nFor me, the series has now reached maturity and is an essential purchace for any avid ww2/flight simmer.\n\nAre the games pricey in comparison to other mainstream games? Yes. But these guys are in a niche market and producing incredibly high quality content. WT planes and flight models are in no way comparable.\n\nBut, as I mentioned there are regular huge sales (up to 50pc off) and for those unsure are a great way to get your feet wet.\n\nThere are no \"clicky\" pits and as a DCS player I originally thought this  would be a turn off. In actual fact , for me, its a boon as the engine control management is more than enough to concentrate on whilst in flight over clicking about the cockpit. others will feel differently but in BoX, I dont miss it. YMMV.\n\nNow, what converted me utterly is BoX's VR support. It's not perfect (what VR game is?) but it *is* astounding.\n\nThe pits really come to life and I cant go back to my trackir 5 and 3 monitors (6400x1080) any more. VR just blows them away.\n\nI feel \"there\".\n\nIndeed ive often tried to physically use pull bars or adjust something with my hands for a second or two before realising im not really in the cockpit.\n\nNow, the game isnt perfect but it's damn close. As development goes on I find less and less to gripe about as the pros simply outweigh any cons at this stage.\n\nI know own the entire series as well as all the \"collector\" planes. I often simply fly to just fly and dont always need combat to spice things up.\n\nThe planned Pacific setting for the next expansion is exciting and there's more major changes planned from the new campaign system to the introduction of modding.\n\nThis game isnt for the uber casual but if one does play WT with as Stick/Hotas then this series is well worth investigating. It's mnot a study im like DCS either but has more than enough complexity to keep the most ardent of button pushers happy.\n\nIts also a hugely pretty game and still keep surprising me.\n\nIf you have the pennies, get it...get it all. If not wait for a sale, I dont think you'll be dissapointed.\n\nRgds\n\nLoK", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505310971, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505324632, "recommendationid": "34920020", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515268", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507171889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1909, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21630, "steamid": "76561198037242282", "num_games_owned": 81}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have no idea how anyone can dislike this game in its current state. I've been reading through some of these reviews and its ether:\n\n-They miss the older Sturmovik\n-Complain it's too complicated\n-They complain about polishing of the game\n\nNow on the first point, this game is by no means even comparable to the original Sturmovik. The amount of environmental realism that is put into this game is light years ahead of its time for prop driven planes compared to everything else on the market currently. (Just as the original Sturmovik was) And the level of detail in this game can visibly be seen painstakingly grinded into every inch that this $49 title can hold to make it arguably the most innovative game on the market. \n\nSecond anyone dumb enough to buy any SIMULATOR and complain it's too complicated is just plain ignorant. To claim you\u2019re between a casual and hardcore simulator really just makes my eyes hurt trying wrap my head around what that even means. This really does not even deserve the effort to respond to.\n\nThirdly, while I can agree that this game was not the best polished short of a few months ago. I managed to get this game to work properly and smoothly at max even though I ran a graphics card that was struggling to be compatible with this game. Sure enough I rolled back a few drivers and it worked just fine. This simulator is extensive and I'd recommend running this game on an SSD with a decent processor to support it. Polishing isn\u2019t the easiest thing to do for a game as complicated as this title is; I find it easy to be forgiving with that point. \n\n\nThis review is a bit extensive for me and I just thought to put time to write this review after seeing the recent reviews as \u201cmixed\u201d to clarify that at its current state this game is more than an overwhelmingly positive review game for a flight simulator. Also with the new content that\u2019s planned to be released, it\u2019s on the rails to becoming the go-to simulator for majority of the market. The amount of content and free upgrades I\u2019ve received since its release more than pays for itself. I can gripe and say that there\u2019s not enough aircraft for it at its base. But compared to other games on the market, it\u2019s just enough. And as well as the Career mode and content upgrades that any other expansions receives is generously distributed across all of its titles.

It really is a beautifully made WW2 Simulator. I recomment this SO MUCH !\n\nIts very complex to learn in almost (we dont have clickable cockpits, but thats it) every aspect and sometimes its really harsh when you loose. Enemies in multiplayer are unforgettable. If you die, it really was your fault. Either you were to low, did not spot the enemy early enough, \ndecided to fly somewhere you shouldn't to in the situation you were in \nor crashed your plane somehwere into the ground.  \nbut at the same time it is so damn rewarding if you are successful.\n\nIf you are completely new to this, dont expect it to be easy. The learning curce is steep at the beginning, but becomes more and more flat with time. \nAfter you learned to taking off and land, you need to learn to navigate, identificate friend or foe, learn to aim, learn improve your combat maneuvers, drop bombs in the right moment, learn to level bomb, fly formation and how to fly together in combat and get to know every plane you face in combat in particular. Only duels against other players are a science for itself. \n\nThe community is very friendly and there are active Teamspeaks online. I recommend flying in a group, cause you're better not alone out there and it speeds up your learning curve. \nAlso there comes more skills to learn in a group like formation flying and flying together in combat. \n \nGraphics are beautiful, flight models feel very realistc\nthe development team is responsive and keep updating the game a lot\nand all maps are for free. You basically pay for the planes of one Version and get the Moscow or Kuban maps (or whatever you purchased first) for free.\nI also highly recommend a Joystick (T16000m) and later a Headtracking Device (Delan Clip), MouseAim is not good. \n\nIf you want something hardcore and extremly rewarding, here it is.\nJust get it on the homepage, not here..

This one by far has the most realistic WW2 flight characteristics and plane mashups. If you want quality over quantity this is definitely a contender for your time. The Devs for this game are the most vocal out of the other games on their forum (forum.il2sturmovik.com) where they discuss the project and future goals weekly. I started getting into WW2 flight games from War Thunder and found my most enjoyment from the Sim game mode there. It translated well when I got this game because after having all of that experience with joystick movement I felt right at home loading this game up. I bought the majority of DCS modules and really liked the in depth, almost \"study sim\" aspect of that game, but thats all it really amounted to for me. The combat of DCS WW2 planes falls flat compared to this new IL-2 where the damage models and smoke trails are so detailed that you cant compare it to another game. IL-2 Cliffs of Dover is also really good but only after installing a modpack. All in all I hope this newest IL-2 project (lots of people call it the BoX series standing for \"Battle of Stalingrad, Battle of Moscow, Battle of Kuban, and a planned installment of Battle of Midway next year) someday matches the amount of content of IL-2 1946 but it will be a long road as there is a lot more detail in these planes and environments than IL-2 46' ever was capable of.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505328460, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505328460, "recommendationid": "34925139", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503115", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507163631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 521, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6243, "steamid": "76561198076806212", "num_games_owned": 33}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The best WWII flight simulator ever made.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504995136, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504995136, "recommendationid": "34847892", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507136464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 205, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1458, "steamid": "76561197981917323", "num_games_owned": 331}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It is a good flight sim.

I waited patiently for the VR patch, perhaps having up to 50 hours in game prior to VR mostly single player.\n\nA lot has happened over the years. DX11, VR implementation is second to none. I now have over 700 hours in game, most of that since april.\n\nI reccomend this game to pretty much anyone who has any interest at all in flying. I used to fly gliders, for 12 years of my life, I get a similar joy out of flying these warbirds in VR, as I did back when I used to fly. Combat is a thrilling bonus.\n\nThe game really shines in Multi Player. Community hosted servers provide some interesting dynamic ongoing battles, or stand alone conflicts over short periods of time.

It's clear for all to see that the Dev's have put a lot of love into this game, to try and get things as accurate as they can make them. After 700 hours, I am still learning things, appreciating nuances in small details that I might not have noticed previously.\n\nIf anyone is sat on the fence, and has a few questions, visit the official forums and ask them there.

Typically, for cheaper games, I'm not as concerned about voting \"yes\", because if it's not quite to someone's palate it's not a major loss, This game is pricey, however, and knowing that I would recommend it to some of my personal friends, and not others, makes it more difficult to generalize an opinion.\n\nWith that said, I am changing my vote to \"Yes, I would recommend.\"\nThe determining factors are thus:\na) The Devs changed the progression model so everything is unlocked now when you purchase the game (you don't need to torture yourself trying to complete the campaign and level up).  I miss this concept so much from the good 'ole days. Pay money, obtain product, no gates.  Beautiful.  \n\nb) The attention to detail and effort the Devs have put in is actually quite remarkable.  The \"Mouse-Aim\" mode to make this game more approachable without a Joystick.  Physics tweaks. Even down to immersive sound effects. There is nothing I can say that will give you a clear picture of how good this game feels, due to all the polish. \n\nc) Business Model.  We're so accustomed to the \"Freemium\" style of games, or subscription based. So seeing a game where each expansion is $60 is a hard pill to swallow.  But it makes sense when you consider this product isn't made for \"bulk\" sales, and doesn't have monthly subscription costs to maintain development. \n\nd) Combat aside, just fly around.  It's wonderful!  It takes some getting used to, and if I already wasn't familiar with this style from when I was a kid I can imagine it being incredibly frustrating. \nWhen you pull too hard you can hear and feel the turbulence off your wings.  You can feel when your tail is about to stall.  It's more of an art than a science. Even trying to train yourself to go easy on the rudder to prevent crazy jerking, but then mastering how to *use* it instead of *fight* it. \nThe Combat, however, especially on more realistic difficulties, is just a nightmare I'm still trying to figure out.  Just resign that you're not going to hit a thing, and you will immediately be out of ammo. (play quick match with custom settings to have unlimited ammo for training). \n\ne) Joystick is a huge plus.  I purchased the Thrustmaster T16000M and it was like night and day for the feel of the game.  In the end, it's a simulator.  It's about the \"feels\". But not a necessity.\n\nand most importantly...\n\nf) The community -- So incredibly helpful, supportive, and rewarding.\n\nSo here is what I would recommend for the general user:\n1) Play World of Warplanes for free.  This is the most arcade flight game you will find. Play it until you are in Tier IV, maybe V.  Just to get familiar with basic flying maneuvers and combat.\n2) Play War Thunder for free.  Start off with arcade, but then go to \"Realistic\" (not Simulation, which is harder).  \"Realistic\" War Thunder is kinda similar to \"Normal\" campaign settings in IL-2 Campaign mode.  Hud indicators for enemies, but not a lot of hand holding. \n3) If you are finding that you enjoy \"Realistic\" mode in War Thunder as much, or more than the arcade feel of World of Warplanes, then DEFINITELY consider buying IL-2.  It's like War Thunder \"Realistic\" mode with a bucket of polish.  Added in with the benefit of single-player, and being able to turn on more \"easy-mode\" options if you just want to goof around. \n\nThe exception to the above statement is if you prefer to play multiplayer games, I think the multiplayer is a smaller playerbase in IL-2, and they tend to play on Simulation difficulty servers. I also am not sure how the Moscow and Kuban expansions will impact you (if that restricts the servers you can join).  So if that's a bit too hardcore for you, then sticking with WoWP and War Thunder might be your best bet.  But if Single-Player is your thing, then IL-2 is a strong candidate! \n \n\n==================================\n\nThis game is not for casual players, certainly.  I consider myself to be somewhere halfway between Casual and Hardcore in terms of simulators.  Enough that I'll watch 45 minute videos of how to start a plane in complete simulator mode, even if I only play under more casual conditions.\nHowever, even with the settings turned as \"Arcade\" as possible, the game is still pretty brutal.  Even in \"Quick Match\" where you can completely customize the options (including physics), the game just feels so clunky.  Both with MouseAim and using my Joystick.\nGranted, it's probably very true to life.  If you want a super hardcore simulator, you've found it! \n\nHowever, if you:\n-Want something casual at all\n-Want a game to relax to\n-Want to relive the awesomesauce that was the original IL-2 Sturmovik back in 2001 where you could turn the cockpit view off, and play in a completely Arcade Funzone Arena\nThen this game is *NOT* for you.\n\nI fully support the concept though, there's certainly a place for hardcore simulation players, and this game is great at it! I was just hoping for something closer to a Single-Player version of \"War Thunder\"/\"World of Warplanes\". Granted, I certainly didn't expect that extreme of cartoon-mode, but I thought I'd be able to enjoy some action with all the \"cheat\" options (Unlimited Ammo, Invulnerability, etc.) like I used to as a kid in the original game.  But even then, it can feel like trying to pilot a washing machine; and yes, I can do it, but it feels more like work than a game to relax to.  \n\nFor the insane price tag, definitely not worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505168025, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505473547, "recommendationid": "34891169", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507035526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1125, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 1291, "steamid": "76561198097641030", "num_games_owned": 228}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Had this game for a while.
