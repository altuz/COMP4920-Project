It has had fairly minor tweaks over the years as my original tactics used to dominate one dayers dont work anymore and of course 20/20s arent all that old.\n\nThis game brings back memories...I played the first copy that I had to death and found a spreadsheet on an old usb that had stats for an England Captain game from 2000 to 2026 on it earlier today!  I've also bought a version that had Phil Hughes on the cover that I remember he averaged 65ish opening for Australia (might have been 2009?) as well as the 2011, 13 & 14 versions.  This is the best of the lot with the different game modes and a one-day engine that I haven't figured out yet (I'm only 30 odd hours in).\n\nThere is a reason I keep spreadsheets with this game - it has 1 big bug....at the end of the season some players may disappear!  It's something that's happened since the first version and with Nathan Lyon magically disappearing and taking his 176 wickets @ 31 as Australia's only spinner with him in 2015 I certainly noticed (particularly as Ryan Harris just retired and I lost 1/2 my bowling attack in 1 off season)....it's a worry when Maxwell is your frontline spinner!\n\nIt's sheer playability and the constant searching for that next great player helps to get over any quirks in the match engine as pretty much anything can be chalked up to it being cricket (still not sure how I got rolled for 50 in a T20 and then won the world cup only a couple of months later).\n\nJust like Football Manager you'll make attachments to players you've never heard of...I see from my original game Matthew Bulbeck played 176 tests scoring 6898 runs at 36.11 and took 754 wickets at 28.65 (I'm sure he wouldn't have minded that sort of career and I've tried with Butterworth and Faulkner in recent years to find a similarly performing left handed allrounder) while I had a regen, G Fuller play 207 tests, score 20155 runs @ 70.97 with a HS of 397 and 75 100s.  \n\nIn this years game I'm only up to 2016/17 with Australia but Chris Lynn 19 tests 1459 runs @  54.04, Ryan Carters 21 tests 1314 runs @ 50.54 and Glenn Maxwell 17 tests 808 runs @ 42.53, 35 wickets @ 35.23 would be pretty happy with their new careers!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419992552, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1419992552, "recommendationid": "13728043", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517694", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436632688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10463, "steamid": "76561198022670252", "num_games_owned": 205}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I've been playing Cricket Captain since ICC III (2007) so have been a little disappointed with the 'progress' of the game since then.

So when I learnt that Cricket Captain was coming to Steam naturally I was excited. Playing the game brought back all those nostalgic feelings of my youth but after an hour or so something occured to me and made me realize just why I had that feeling\n\nIt's the same f***ing game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't mean that as like \"oh it's nostalgic and a great throwback\" I mean the same game as in nothing's changing, sure the graphics have SLIGHTLY improved and there are a few new quirks like Hawkeye but it's the same animations, the same featureless blobs in what should be players and the same looking screeens between bits of footage.\n\nNot only that, the AI has somehow gotten WORSE in this iteration. For all the illusion of control you have your batsmen have all of two states of play, \"Two Runs an Over\" or \"Swing at everything like your 5 year old brother in the backyard\". Meanwhile the opposing AI has no trouble whatsoever going merrily at 4, 5, 6 runs an over regardless of what fields and what agression you have set on your bowling.\n\nThe game engine is a mess, the Australian career mode is a joke and the same animations that were in the game in 1999 are here in 2014.\n\nDo NOT buy this game. For the love of god make Childish Things get their shit together. This game is an abomination on all mankind. If you want a good cricket management game buy Cricket Coach, it has no graphics or commentary to speak of but at least that has an excuse (It's made by a one man development team).
