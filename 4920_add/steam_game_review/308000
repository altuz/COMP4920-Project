These games (for me) are memories of growing up and sitting on my father's knee and learning about computers...(the next step involved constructing my own PC from scratch, but that's a different story for a different time) \nSierra INVENTED the adventure genre as far as I'm concerned, and \"Gold Rush\" is not only an excellent example of a classic adventure game, it is also the benchmark for self-involved concepts as well as being true to life history.\nWhat I personally love about this game is remembering my youth (I was 8 when it came out) but what makes it spectacular for its development at the time is that not only is it an emotionally involved storyline (regarding the family story) it also sticks to factual history.  In addition it reminds me of the current housing crisis, in that if you don't sell your house before a certain set time in the game (always save, save, SAVE with these classics!) you lose a large amount of monies and can not proceed in the game as desired!!!\n*LOL* These games always frustrated me when I was younger due to the fact that you almost EVERY TIME (with Sierra...<3 Sierra <3) had to RESTART a game from scratch if you missed ONE...MINISCULE...ITEM!!\nBut seriously, that's more realistic than ANY game I've seen or played up until now.  When else (In Real Life IRL) have you been able to rewind and make sure you did something in a specific way to ensure that things turned out the way you wanted?  In addition, when we played these games, if we were stuck, we couldn't just hop onto Google and figure out the answer, we had to call a hotline and pay REAL CASH to get a hint book that didn't always guarantee a correct answer, but still left us guessing...damn, love you Google, but seriously, you made life too easy!\n\n*Steps off of soap box*\n\nIf you have a LITERAL dollar to spend, give Sierra adventuring a try.
