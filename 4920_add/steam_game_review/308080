This is racing game first, flying can be learned as you play. Really low flying for better times is the key. Probably easier said than done, you will be crashing a lot before you learn to fly your machine.\n\nFirst, learn controls. Standard controls make cornering easier while advanced controls give you full control over cornering. I think I will stick with standard controls for now.\n\nSolo mode has a license campaign with different jobs to complete and upgrade your planes with new parts. There are also many user tracks, mostly hard but fun. Some players who created these tracks must enjoy punishing others!\nStill need to play more, fun game overall!\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505832289, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505832289, "recommendationid": "35065756", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507035688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 218, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 218, "steamid": "76561198259975341", "num_games_owned": 12}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Flying takes time to do well and low flying is even harder.
