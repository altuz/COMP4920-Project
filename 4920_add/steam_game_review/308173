Radios were not invented yet (another 3000 years to go) but somehow your enemies work together to launch attacks at your weakest points.\nOK, you think, what i need is more dakka... so you build up your armies... nope, now winter comes around and SMASHES you with starvation because of the armies appetite.\nOK, lets drop the food requirements of the cities... Nope, their morale drops too and they go into rebellion... \nSo you rush off to put down the rebellion, and at the exact moment you are [u]just[/u] too far away from the border you were protecting... guess what... another invasion force comes barrelling in!\n\nWash, rinse, repeat.\n\nEventually your supply of reinforcements starts to drop and the invaders make short work of their target cities.\n\nNow this would be fine if it was happening to the AI cities... but their magic-radios (to their non-allied battle partners) also seem to spew out food and reinforcements as well.\n\nThere are so many moments when you look at this game and think how cheap the AI is... there is no fun in a constant (and i mean CONSTANT) tidal wave of enemy attacks as you are hamstrung by the seasons in a way the AI is not. \nIn individual combats you have the upper hand, no doubt about it... but even this is 'fixed' by the AI just spawning more units or launching a flank attack out of the blue.\n\nDiplomacy consists of paying a huge cash blackmail to a faction that will suddenly backstab you anyway \"because reasons\" (by this stage of the game you are so sick of the sound and message box spam from constant attacks that you no longer care enough to read what BS reason your close friend has made up to justify attacking you)\n\nIt COULD be a great game... hell, even putting a half-speed option in there could make it less aggravating.\nFunnily enough, the game only has Pause or Full Speed but the Menu system is a tedious bunch of pointless slow screen transitions that make even the Menu frustrating as hell!\n\nBut in the end that is what it comes down to... how long you can stand watching the game chip away at your willingness to put time in to it.\n\nFYI i also played with some of the Mods from the Workshop, just to take the edge off... even that didn't help - dont waste your money or time on this rubbish.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505716063, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505859959, "recommendationid": "35040019", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509222", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 155, "total_reviews": 207, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 52}}
