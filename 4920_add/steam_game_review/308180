It was very enjoyable and if you've played the previous episode, you will know what to do here. Click birds, complete puzzles and don't forget to pick up the soda cans!\n\nOne of my favourite features are the cutscenes and voices. They are very well done and true to their characters. Simple, yet beautiful.\n\nIf you're new to the Jacob Jones games, I'd like to mention that it is kid friendly! The puzzles may feel more difficult, but the content is 100% safe.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n\u02d0GreenCube\u02d0 All-ages content\n\u02d0GreenCube\u02d0 Great voice actors\n\u02d0GreenCube\u02d0 Cutscenes are appropriate to content; not too long either, just perfect!\n\u02d0GreenCube\u02d0 Character interaction needed in order to progress story\n\n\u02d0LightRedCube\u02d0 Most puzzles are really easy to solve; for a 28 yr old anyways XD\n\u02d0LightRedCube\u02d0 The game is very short...\n\u02d0LightRedCube\u02d0 The slide motion to turn around is sometimes frustrating because I slide too fast and just keep walking into the next area, into the next, into the next... until I get used to the sliding motion. I wonder if this feature would work better on a touch screen (?) During the tutorial, they teach you to use Q and E to move the camera. However Q and E seem to do nothing once you have left the bus from the first scene.\n\n[h1]FINAL THOUGHTS[/h1]\nI was enthralled by the game and so focused to collect every bird and soda can that when I hit the end of episode 2, I was quite surprised! \"No... this can't be... My birds, I need the birds! Oh wait; I already have all the birds! LOL\"\n\nI look forward to episode 3 (\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\u273f)\n\nCute papercrafts btw. I've already shared the link with a friend who has a child \u2665\n(Papercrafts is a link found in the pause menu on the right inside of the screen. It'll open the browser to a webpage where you can print templates of the characters. Cut them out and glue to make 3D paper models.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496285340, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496285639, "recommendationid": "32098889", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
