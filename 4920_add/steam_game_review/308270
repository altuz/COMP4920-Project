There are some specific programming choices that just ruin the simulation for me which is primarily the routines/math used to determine mission success or failure.  While true each game the success chances change, once set it's going to succeed or fail no matter how much research or time you put into it.  For example, if you have a mission package researched to 95% and save that mission before a launch which then fails, then no matter how many times you reload (even several turns back) and redo the mission, it will always fail.  So in my experience random factor is basically zero, you're just clicking buttons in a pre-determined outcome that changes with each new simulation.  It's for this one reason I find myself giving this a thumb's down, otherwise I've enjoyed the mechanics and strategies involved with this management sim.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502184126, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502184126, "recommendationid": "34099306", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502090", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506778090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 149, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 750, "steamid": "76561198116846254", "num_games_owned": 40}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game is far too much down to luck.\nEven if you have well over 90% reliability on all parts and you hire 3 tiger teams to try to fix your problem it feels like a 50/50 weather or not you will fail.
