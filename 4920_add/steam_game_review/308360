And honestly, the game designer did a pretty good job. The mechanics aren't new or spectacular, and in general, there's only ever one way to solve the puzzles, but a puzzle game can't have everything.\nOf the mechanics it does have, I can speak positively. The guns - most easily described as platform, crossbow, grapple, and magnet - allow for some interesting and actually challenging puzzles, and even if the game's nothing to look at visually, ordinarily the core gameplay at work here would signal a thumbs-up from me.\nBut- and given my non-recommendation, you knew there would be a \"but\"- the controls and physics are wonky. It's fine for my character and the objects to be somewhat floaty, if it didn't make setting up the more elaborate platform solutions frustrating to the point of rage-quitting. I'm not talking about puzzle difficulty here - I'm talking about the very simple aspect of control, which any game that uses platformer elements should implement properly. No matter how often you try, your boxes will slip, slide, perform mind-bending dances and fall off of the platforms you have spent minutes - nay, hours - placing them onto. And then you will have to try again.\nAnd again.\nAnd again, and again, and again.\nThe ratio of hours I have spent attempting to place one box on top of another box/platform while in mid-air, or attempted to carry a box over my platform-gun's tiny platforms to the number of hours I have spent actually playing the game is probably 1:1, maybe 2:1. The character becomes easier to control as more time is spent on the game - so depending on your speed at solving puzzles, you may become an expert before reaching the stages in which mid-air stacking is necessary - but it should not be required to spend 10 minutes solving a puzzle and 30 minutes trying to stack boxes. Even with practice, that is my experience at the end-game levels.\n\nAs to the levels themselves; I can only say that experiences shall vary. Most of the puzzles were not very difficult, although several of the later puzzles would have made me feel justified in my purchase were it not for the control issue.\n\nI cannot recommend this game until the physics and controls are fixed. That's too bad, because the designer really did come up with something clever and created some interesting puzzles.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406523510, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1407009281, "recommendationid": "11444631", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521705", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1407828604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 972, "steamid": "76561197993164388", "num_games_owned": 123}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Play time ~16 hours\n\nDON'T READ THIS - BUY IT NOW!!!

The best part: non-violent and female protagonist (some mention of killing, etc, but mostly empty threats and it all plays well when you reach the end - you will see). Truely a progressive game!

Each level showcases some novel way for the different mechanics to fit together; not a shred of level is wasted. As far as I can tell, none of the puzzles are easily broken, either, whether with ninja moves or unconventional puzzling. The levels themselves are also very challenging; particularly upon nearing the latter third of the game.\n\nA few things are unfortunately still desired; a more lenient physics engine (jumping is somewhat fiddly, as is stacking blocks, as you'll see from many reviews), a better menu (options should come BEFORE savefile selection!), more levels (only 40+8 bonus), and possibly a better redesign of the final level.\n\nThe number of mechanics is sometimes overwhelming, too. In addition to the 4 different guns and the zapper, there're also bombs, grapplable boxes, light boxes, heavy boxes, polarized boxes, lanterns, impact-toggled switches, lasers, colour-mixing puzzles, ice, glass, barriers that objects can't pass through, barriers that put out lanterns, barriers that arrows can pass through but you can't... Suffice to say, you may find yourself trying to recall what exactly a green dashed barrier does, and how it's different to a blue dotted barrier.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, this is definitely a good one I can recommend to you; it's up there along with English Country Tune and Snakebird in terms of pure gameplay. It is definitely worth the 4 GBP, whether on sale or not.

On a few occasions I was scratching my head in confusion for a while until it finally dawned on me what I needed to do. The actual basics to play the game are really intuitive and easy to pick, there isn't really a learning curve here. I played something else recently where basic movement was a challenge because the player character was difficult to control. But in this she would just go where I wanted her and you have good air control. That helped the experience a lot. About the story? There is an occasional text dialogue from an anime looking character but I found that I was too preoccupied just playing the and I missed half of it.\n\nIn terms of presentation, to me the game looked good. I liked the shadow effects. The music was good too.\n\nSo yes, I recommend this game.
