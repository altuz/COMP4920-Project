I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys rogue-lite and perma-death games. \nThe biggest complaint I have heard about this game is \"I ran out of ammo and I have to wait for my wand to recharge while I run around\". Yes that is true. My response? Play more and get better. Learn ammo conservation. Yes there is a small luck element but generally you can avoid having to rely on drops by learning when to spend special mana and when not to as well as shot accuracy. If the special mana dropped more then the game wouldn't require as much skill. \nYou aren't expected to win your first time playing and probably not even the first couple times. That's the point. Over time you learn how enemies behave, how to avoid getting hit and what weapons you prefer to use. It's a learning experience that in my opinion is worth the time and effort.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504653004, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504653004, "recommendationid": "34766136", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500883", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506532226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 223, "steamid": "76561198188964367", "num_games_owned": 11}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game is nice it looks good even with very low quality!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504795091, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504795091, "recommendationid": "34795572", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505271", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506626449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 217, "steamid": "76561198072187551", "num_games_owned": 162}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is probably the best value of any that I own.\n\nIt is quite challenging and requires patience, but advancing through the levels feels very rewarding, as it is a roguelite (which sends you all the way back to kindergarten every time you die.) \n\nThe scenery is colourful and interesting; although it is procedurally generated, the themes change with each level, making the whole thing more interesting as you progress.\n\nThe combat gameplay calls for quick reflexes and sharp wits - without strategy the enemies can be overwhelming. Loot drops can be quite stingy, but it seems like they get better as levels increase and with better fighting performance. In general, you will find that you are rewarded as your skills improve, and a sense of momentum builds. \n\nEven for a really good player, there is a lot of time to invest in getting to the top of the Ziggurat, for me it could take years - and even then, the game is infinitely re-playable thanks to the procedural generation feature.\n\nA likable aspect of the gameplay is the speed with which the player can move around - a necessary feature as the combat calls for quick and precise movement.\n\nThe game has a platformer element as each level has a room with a platform puzzle, which I think are usually optional.\n\nThe artistic side of the game is expressed almost solely through the graphics. There is a minimal amount of game lore and absolutely zero dialogue to sit through - just the smooth gameplay, in all of its challenging and unpredictable brilliance. There is a backstory in the form of the game intro, which can be skipped. For most of us, lengthy exposition that delays gratification is not sorely missed.\n\nThis title is an instant classic, which will be remembered as a highlight in the history of the FPS genre. I also think it is one of the best values for cost available on Steam, most especially when it is on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506627933, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506627933, "recommendationid": "35270438", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500235", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495121181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 377, "steamid": "76561198032470739", "num_games_owned": 118}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A first person shooter procedurally generated dungeon crawler, play through , unlock different spells and staffs, managing your mana as you go (the resource to use your staffs) play through a series of levels clearing rooms to find a key for the boss room.\n\nSomewhat challanging, highly stylistic in a cartoony fantasy style but not all that interesting once you've played through a couple of times, there are quite a few mobs but they all have similar AI in that they like to run towards you or stand still firing at you making it not much of a chellenge once you learn which ones move and which ones don't.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507026579, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507026579, "recommendationid": "35441618", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501633", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504786561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 382, "playtime_forever": 90, "steamid": "76561198034217511", "num_games_owned": 448}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "2 hours of game content.
