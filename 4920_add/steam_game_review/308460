The graphical style is pretty inspired -- everything looks like it's made out of cardboard and paper and the levels look like a child's playset. You can move the camera just about anywhere and there's also an option to see the game from a tower's perspective (watching it fire at enemy units). The art is definitely top notch.\n\nOn the flip side, the gameplay mechanics are not very sophisticated. The tower defense genre has dozens of titles that have innovative twists and interesting mechanics. This game is a bit lacking in that department. Towers are placed in a few fixed positions and have 3 levels of upgrades. Towers and upgrades are instant and there aren't any extra buttons to press. There are no end of level stats or bonuses for leftover money, and while upgraded towers do more damage I couldn't see numbers anywhere.\n\nOne mechanic of the game that is somewhat interesting is that each unit, tower, and bullet fired is modelled in the physics engine. This means that trees and destroyed units can block the trajectory of your tower's bullets, and sometimes units go flying off the screen when they are destroyed. It also adds some randomness, since some tower shots may be blocked and this throws off the timing for a wave.\n\nAll in all, though, the game is too simplistic for my taste. The art style is cool. But tower defense as a genre is a bit played out and this game adds nothing innovative to keep me interested.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404547569, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1404547569, "recommendationid": "11080882", "language": "english", "votes_down": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629969", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498520709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5281, "steamid": "76561198018733768", "num_games_owned": 386}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": 0, "review": "What can I say about this game?  It's absurdly addictive :)\n\nReally wasn't expecting much of anything from this title at all.\nI bought it on sale figuring it'd make a nice mindless game for my 6 year old son.  As it turned out, it made a nice mindless game for Dad - LOL.  No kidding, I love it!\n\nWaves and waves of progressively harder enemy armored cars, tanks, and planes attempt to navigate the maze of defensive measures you place to stop them.  You start off each battle with a set amount of cash to buy pre-positioned guns.  As you kill the enemy tanks and planes, you get more cash to buy new guns or upgrade existing ones.\n\nThere is nothing to the manning of the emplacements (they fire by themselves)... the skill comes with what type of gun to buy, when to get it, where to put it, and in what sequence.  A sole gun in the right (or wrong)  place at the right (or wrong) time can make the difference between plastering the enemy before he gets his steam up, or getting overrun by the hun.\n\nThe music is a blend of cheesy bravado-style muscle pumping arcade noise - that somehow meshes perfectly with the action (I wouldn't change it).  The interface is remarkably easy (took me all of 10 seconds to figure it out - with no manual), and the entertainment value is undeniable.  For those who would complain about the graphics, I say they are perfect for what it is.  For those who would call the game too repetitive, I would guess they were not around decades ago to enjoy the genre of arcade games like Pacman, Asteroids, or Space Invaders.\n\n1 out of 10 if you're looking for Company of Heroes or Men at War; 10 out of 10 if you're looking for a few hours to kill (\"just one more turn\" anyone? - LOL)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449581419, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449641318, "recommendationid": "19565113", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541272", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1419158252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 72, "steamid": "76561198031200400", "num_games_owned": 156}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very limited game play for a game that looks so amazing.

If you can't tell from the screenshots, it is a Tower Defense game made from cardboard. I bought this game when it was -80% (CDN$ 1.09) just as an impulse buy to kill an afternoon. I can say it is an ok game. \n\nPROS:\n- Turret First Person View. Clicking on a turret and selecting the button lets you see from the turrets view. Really cool, but you can't do anything other than watch. (Would have been cool if you could control the turret.)\n- Interesting level design, with great graphical design. The cannons look ok, and the enemies look great!\n- Obstacles like tree and dead enemies can block your attacks, or even the terrain.\n- Short, only 24 missions with Normal and Hard difficulty.\n- Simple Achievements\n\nNow here is where I nick-pick.\n\nCONS:\n- Towers can ONLY be placed in designated areas. Because of this, if you don't place the CORRECT tower that is needed to beat the level, you will lose. There is basically only 1 way to win each level. Some are super easy to figure out, others not so much. Very \"Trial and Error\".\n- Only 5 towers. Certain levels will take away towers as a challenge, making certain levels even harder.\n- Game feels very slow. I've kept the game running at x2 most of the time, and x3 when there is nothing else for me to do other than wait for the map to finish.\n- There isn't really an Options menu besides the Unity options menu that pops up when you boot the game up.\n- Only 2 music tracks. One for the Menu, the other in game. It gets very repetitive and annoying fast. No options to turn off music, so I had to mute the entire application just so I can have my own music.\n- No Steam Cards (for the people that care about it, like me xD)\n\n\nIn the end it's an ok game, and only spending $1 as a time killer was great.

That is all it is\u2026  One view from a chosen turret.  No shooting or even turning the turret.  It's just a camera view.\n\nThe game is okay, but it's basic to the point of not really wanting to play it again once you get the 3 stars and 100%.  There are only 5 towers with 3 upgrade levels and 24 small maps.  You can only build towers on predesignated platforms and there are not very many of them scattered throughout the small maps, so you must choose your towers wisely!  Like only 5 - 7!  Once you figure out the correct combonation of towers to use and placement, there is no challenge anymore.  Also, once you place all of your towers and upgrade them, you just sit and watch the battle.  There's nothing left to do...\n\nIt's also got one bad design choice IMO.  The enemies don't explode or disappear from the track fast enough and this can cause unpredictable problems. Sometimes shots get blocked, making you lose the level and have to restart the mission over from the beginning.  If you are going for 3 stars, you'll need to start over sometimes.  It's not that bad and doesn't happen all the time, but when it does, it's frustrating.\n\nAnimations are stiff, but the enemy are supposed to be made out of paper, so it fits the game style I guess.

You [i]will[/i] yell curses at your towers, and wonder if they're manned through some sort of outreach program for special kids.  But the levels are balanced for the towers as they are, and you can somewhat compensate by tower placement.\n\nThere's nothing really original here, just your basic tower defense game, and I wouldn't pay full price for it, but I still liked it, and if you're not totally burned out on tower defense it's worth $5 IMO.  It hasn't crashed once on me, no bugs or gliches that I've seen, and for the most part  the levels are balanced well (level 9 has issues).\n\n[Note: this is the same game as Tabletop Defense, apparantly some issue between the devs and the first publisher, but the devs claim they get money when you buy this one and they don't from that one, for whatever that's worth.]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1410672334, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1410672334, "recommendationid": "12093402", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500180", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 45, "total_reviews": 64, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 19}}
