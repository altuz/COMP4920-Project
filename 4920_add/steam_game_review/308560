I saw this pop up on Steam, thought it looked quirky and interesting and decided to wait for a sale and when it happened I snapped it up. The only regret I have is in waiting so long, this game is worth it at full price.\n\nThis game may not be for everyone as it makes you think out of the box, I understand that the box these days is \"Here is a gun, go shoot things\" but I'm talking about in adventure game terms.\n\nSure, there's quests to do which are pretty straight forward involving helping the homeless, pimp business and corrupt politicians. Your standard adventure game staples you might think. But you're some white dude with blonde hair who definitely has a disorder of some sort who can be talked into trying to disguise themselve as a Yakuza to aid the mafia.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't really make sense then the rest of the game will make less sense. If it did make sense to you then you're probably the protagonist of the game.\n\nI may edit this after a few playthrough's, but somehow I think leaving this game in people's minds with a little morbid curiosity might fare better. If you've seen it and read about it and/or put it on your wishlist just do it. It's one of those games that you think you'll fire up for a few minutes to see what it's like, think \"everything is fairly standard and boring, nothings really happening. That's the first bit over, what's the fuss? I'll play a bit more and... what? Wait! What? Seriously? Is this?... Yes it is happening\" and will just continue on.\n\nIf you want an adventure game that really makes use of you interacting with it for Steam achievements then this is for you.\n\nIf you want an adventure game that makes you try to find inventive ways for you to be killed then this is for you.\n\nIf you want an adventure game that tries to make you find ways to steal babies and then eat them then this is definitely for you, and you should probably seek help.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440282074, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440282074, "recommendationid": "17667967", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507329", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440463502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 143, "steamid": "76561197993486160", "num_games_owned": 195}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have followed this game since its Kickstarter origins.
