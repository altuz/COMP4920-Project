This game reminds me of super monkey ball, but plays a bit differently. You only control directions LEFT and RIGHT. You constantly move forward. The left and right directions somtimes change based on the camera angle (espeically doing a loop on a track), which can cause trouble navigating at times. The music is fun, and the menu system is very quick. It's cute. It's fun.
