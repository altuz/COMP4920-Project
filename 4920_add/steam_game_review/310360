It adds a new sense of immersion which makes it the definitive way to experience these novels, in my opinion[/b]\n\nWhether you're already a fan of the anime/manga or you're dipping into the world of Higurashi for the first time, I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys visual novels. The characters are loveable, the mystery is very interesting and the psychological horror aspect is brilliant in my personal opinion. Even as someone who's watched the anime twice and knew what was going to happen, I still found myself quite spooked on multiple occasions. I was also surprised by how engaged I found myself in it, despite again, having already watched the anime twice. The VN definitely has enough to keep those who enjoyed the adaptions interested, while giving those who jump in for the first time an absolutely captivating experience.\n\nI really only have two complaints. The first is that the pacing can be quite slow at points. Though that's more of a nitpick that applies to the genre as a whole for me and it never drags for very long, so don't even worry about that one. More of a personal peeve than anything else and it never truly affected my enjoyment.\n\nThe second complaint is not even about the game itself, but rather the marketing. Despite MangaGamer insisting otherwise, this is a novel through and through. No gameplay is present. I could go on about how this is essentially lying to the consumer but I'll hold my tongue. Personally, I don't mind the lack of gameplay as the story itself was more than enough to keep me invested during all of my playtime. But understandably, the lack of any sort of gameplay or choice will turn off some players. Which is part of why the misleading marketing really annoys me, but I digress \n\nAll in all though, if you enjoy visual novels I implore you to at least check this one out. It's not exactly expensive either, so do yourself a favor and pick it up if you haven't already.

And the twist, well forget about it, too much psuedo science / 10. \n\nIf you do like this sort of thing, good for you. I would rather have Studio DEEN do the art though. This is sort of like a more realistic Fate/Stay Night if you like that sort of thing.
