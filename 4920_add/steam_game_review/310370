Plus, the dream door just really made me happy personally, [spoiler]because he dreamt of his wife and he always comments how beautiful she was, and how happy they were.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]In the nightmare door, his sickness is the gateway to this feeling of hopelessness as Death himself pursues you and destroys your world as you run away from him.[/spoiler]\n\n\nFinal verdict: Buy this game.

It fails to deliver any meaningful experience rather focusing on the quantity of content than on his quality.\nThe graphics are very unoriginal and have the typical touch of low-end Unity games.

Just clicking around until you find the relevant content that you are supposed to find. It's not bad, it's just average, but I don't think \"average\" is worth investing your time into.\n\nNow, the \"best\" part of the game is its narrative. Here we can see a collection of different stories about the many perspectives of life. But, sorry to say, even here I can perceive its lack of deep structuring. The stories, like the gameplay, are very generic, but in this case they try to bring a meaningful message that just fails to impress me. \nThere are many games out there that can have an emotional impact even on the most cold-hearted people. Every aspect of the game contributes to this experience, that's why The Way of Life, with its complete average content, falls into the category of games that you will not remember.\nI appreciate the time the developers spent on this game, but they didn't go in the right direction.
