You have to register on their site to get mods.  Registration requires a serial number.\n\n2) For reasons outlined below, I have a major issue with Slitherine and Matrix with their anti-consumer behavior for games you purchase directly from their site:\n\na) Matrix and Slitherine as companies do NOT honor a download policy when games are lost.   You can  reinstall on Steam but you are out of luck if you bought the game(s) through their site.  They require you to register, provide a receipt, and provide a serial number.  All of this is ofcourse is on the hard drive you lost.\n\nb) Matrix and Slitherine do not provide credible help support for issues with games.\n\nc) You can not get updates without joining the site as a member and providing a serial number.\n\nI stupidly purchase this game without realizing any of this and regret the purchase.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503678950, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503678950, "recommendationid": "34485117", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482181", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "total_reviews": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
