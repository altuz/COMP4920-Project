(More details below.)\n\n[u]The Good[/u]: Truly exceptional world-building! It's a fun mix of Dan Brown, Assassin's Creed, and Tintin. There's a nice balance of occult history, Venice travelogue, Judeo-Christian mysticism, and political thriller elements. The narrative hits all the right notes for me. \n\nI don't even mind that the present-day sequences don't use the art style from the original comics, because I wasn't very familiar with Corto Maltese before playing this game (other than a few tangential references in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen). \n\nMany of the puzzles are genuinely fun, even if they seem a bit ridiculous in the context of the story. In fact, I wish I had thought of the explorer/Age of Discovery puzzle myself. (I run a brainteaser-oriented game night in Manila.)  \n\nI like how the Compass mechanic works, in general. It's a neat way to bridge the story and gameplay elements.\n\nBonus points for the puzzles that make use of real-world outside resources: Google Maps, Wikipedia, even TripAdivsor [spoiler](one puzzle involves searching for a review posted by an NPC)[/spoiler] It's quite a bold risk because it involves user-generated content that might end up getting deleted, later on. But for now, it feels inspired.\n\n[u]The Bad[/u]: The over-reliance on AGS-style connect-the-squares mini-games. Gets hella repetetive, especially in the late game. There's some occassional wooden voice acting, which I can forgive. \n\nThe stuff that makes this game unplayable at times comes from sloppy QA, rather than poor creative decisions by the devs. So it falls under...\n\n[u]The Ugly[/u]: At least four of the expert-level/hard-mode puzzles are basically unsolvable because of poor implementation. I can't go into detail without spoiling it, but have a look at the discussion for this game, if you want to get an idea. \n\nThe most obvious example are the hints for a mid-game puzzle involving book titles. The in-game tips make reference to books that aren't even mentioned in the puzzle!\n\nAlso, the Achievements seem to be completely bugged. NOBODY has been able to get them, so far.\n\nBased on other people's feedback, I get the impression that the original Italian version may have better quality control.\n\nIt's a shame -- I *really* wanted to like this game. The premise and gameplay have SO MUCH appeal to me.

I've changed my first analysis.\n\nGame's atmosphere is nice and, if you are a lover of Corto Maltese comics, it seems appealing enough.\nThe aim of the game is to quest by yourself, outside the game (Internet), to answer the riddles that the game offers to you. This makes this game unique and, enhances the detectivesque feeling, since you are yourself who should investigate outside the game, browsing wikipedia or google maps or whatever other source of info that could help you to get the answer.\n\nThis is one of the hardest click & point adventure games I've ever played (and, played a bunch). Sometimes, the tips or clues aren't that clear and can lead you to absurd paths. The bad thing is that there is NO guide or walkthrough anywhere (there is just a single one covering the very first steps), by today.\nI was really stuck for several days with just one riddle and, I was going to give up the game, until a forum mate was giving me the last piece of the puzzle to get the answer.\n\nAfter suffering lot of frustation, I've finally ended it and now, I feel more satisfied than with other easier point & click adventures.\n\nSo, you've been warned. If you love HARD point & click adventure games, try this one, even if the character of Corto Maltese isn't appealing to you.

I like the idea of looking up the answers to the puzzles.  It was super cool and kind of a throwback to playing Carmen Sandiego on the Apple IIe.  But this game messed up  a lot of things.  Half of the puzzles were either worded very poorly, or they were designed so that it would be impossible to solve by means other than looking up a walkthrough or by random guessing.
