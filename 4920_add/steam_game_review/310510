The game is pretty fun in co-op mode as well as dorking around in single player. \n\nUnfortunately only 2 of us could actually play the game. Nvidia cards seem to not have the same issues but if you have an AMD card in your system I don't recommend buying this game. I've spent countless hours and multiple system configurations trying to tweak and solve whatever the issue is. \n\nFrom everything I can test it seems to be with how the game interacts with the video card drivers. Its like they wrote a proprietary interface that works correctly with nvidia drivers only. It is really unfortunate but I've found no settings that make the game playable past around level 14. And the game play is rather crappy up until them most of the time.\n\n** NOTE: if you have an AMD video card do NOT buy this game! **\n\nI want to recommend this game, and if they ever fix it and I notice maybe I would, but for now it has left me with unpleasant feelings and so I would warn people away from it so as to save them the pain.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499736565, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499736565, "recommendationid": "33445110", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499595", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501092363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 4948, "steamid": "76561198041108461", "num_games_owned": 106}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Would give this a positive review, except for the \"Bottomless Pit\" map Tier 3 ruins it.\n\nYou have to grind and outlevel your toon to beat it... which makes the following maps not fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501033157, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501033157, "recommendationid": "33798774", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499073", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503491092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 415, "steamid": "76561197975202931", "num_games_owned": 475}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Diablo meets Tower defence, not bad game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503654282, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503654282, "recommendationid": "34477611", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497672", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502674419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 330, "steamid": "76561198004670756", "num_games_owned": 216}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game itself is awesome, but all of a sudden the game constantly crashes... also the controls are aweful.  \n\nThe sucky part is the game is great and a lot of fun, but unfortunitely its unplayable :(", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502497988, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502497988, "recommendationid": "34180157", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485618", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503757113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561197995749953", "num_games_owned": 129}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Ack.  I don't remember how much I paid but $1 would be too much.  If you are interested in this because its a \"tower\" defense game - it's not.  You can only place specific traps in specific limited locations (So your only decision is when to place a trap - not where or what type).    Much of the \"challenge\" (if you call it that) is as a run-n-gun type game.  And that run-n-gun has a wierd mechanic where you have \"essence\" that fuels your shots.  When you run out you have to run and hide to allow it to regenerate.  So you are never really in a fight very long.  And your \"towers\" are all pretty much decided for you.
