Ever since I played DiRT 3 for the last time a few years ago, I never bothered to search on the net if a new project by CM was ongoing. The late news of a new DiRT game released on 2015 made me highly interested but, above all, I wasn't able to predict what would it be like.\n\nAll those videos on YT made my mind spin as I was seeing a game that could be just the best ever made by CM to date and I wanted to buy it so badly I started searching it everywhere on the web. In the end, a friend of mine sold his game to me because he found it too hard for him to play. I couldn't agree more with this statement.\n\nHaving played the previous DiRT games and also some CMR ones during my childhood, I thought this game would be easy to get used to. I was wrong.\n\nWith DiRT Rally, in summary, you'll be able to feel both edges: it's an extremely tough, but ultra realistic driving simulator and, at the same time, a very addictive racing game, just like an arcade one.\n\nSo DiRT Rally is an \"arcator\"? Or maybe a \"simulade\"? Those names are weird as hell, so you better call it just an \"simulator-arcade\".\n\nIs there another thing that makes it even more special and unique? You can bet it and I'll list my pros and cons below:\n\nPROS\n\n+ Sweden\n+ 12 stages\n+ Group B\n+ Focus RS is back\n+ Original CMR liveries\n+ Smooth menus\n+ A lot of active players setting world records constantly\n+ Delta S4 (RIP Toivonen)\n+ Online dailies are just way too fun\n+ Insane hillclimb\n+ You're not a good driver anymore\n+ It'll make you sweat\n+ Challenging, but rewards practice\n+ You'll spin a lot\n+ You'll restart even more\n+ 170 achievements\n\nCONS\n\n- Where's Xsara?\n- No Australia\n- I want a Playseat, but no money\n\nOverall rating: 9.8\n\nIt's a game that I loved so much I bought it on Steam just to play in 60 fps.

I have played A LOT of racing games in my time but it has been quite a while since a racing title has given me that adrenaline rush DIRT Rally gives me. Rally racing is a completely different monster that is harsh and unforgiving to rookies. When i first started up the game i was treating the dirt like it was regular old asphalt. I was pushing it hard into corners and braking way late. I lost count of how many times went straight off into the trees never to be seen again. I got frustrated with it, but i could never put it down. I buckled up and kept at it. It can be intimidating to new players but i feel the results are rewarding. DiRT Rally is an unexplainable experience. The feeling of the car sliding on the loose surface. The satisfying sound of a boxer engine crackling as you downshift into a corner. The language that spurs from your mouth when you screw up. This title made me a better Sim racer. It let me know my place and i have a new found respect for this sport.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506050835, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506050835, "recommendationid": "35119233", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507149822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 71, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1659, "steamid": "76561197993054434", "num_games_owned": 267}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1] im race the car goodf and fast down the slips and slopes [/h1]\n\na fun rally adventure just for you...please, consider it an essential!!!!!!\n\nsound: 8/10 the co drivers are not robots this time around! great engines!\ngraphic: 8/10 very nice attention to detail it does not feel flat\ngameplay controls: 9/10 feel very good. it is difficult! if you are looking for an arcade racer look away immediately!\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505341206, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505341206, "recommendationid": "34928124", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502297", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505260083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 172, "steamid": "76561198066805703", "num_games_owned": 167}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Love it.
