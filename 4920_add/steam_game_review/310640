with strings attached looking to bait the creatures of the sea into biting their hooks.\n\nkarl marx once said, \"the products of fish belong to all people, especially poor people because they're pretty great.\"\n\ni really like european fishing. it's like sailing in a boat in a body of water and casting a line into said body of water and waiting for a fish to take the bait.\n\nit's

in beta but is going to be special)\n\n2nd FishSim 2\n(old game but game and fish pysics work well plus it can be modded with a big cummunity) \n\n3rd SEGA Bass Fishing (old Classic With action cam You gotta love it)\n\n4th Carp Fishing Simulator (could be a great game only time will tell)\n\n5th Europeon Fishing (shocking dont waste your money, The developers should of been shot at birth)",

I played child fishing games better then this. Steam has way better games then this!  I never write reviews or even fuss but the fact is this game has be fixed.
