I played You Have to Win the Game first, and while I enjoyed that, I thought this game was an improvement, smoothing out some of the rough edges, and appealing even more to my sense of nostalgia. The game is a definite nod to Zelda 2, with lots of nods to other great NES games. I saw some people comparing this to metroidvania games, and while there are some minor elements there, I would not put this in that genre. It's closer to Zelda 2, Battle of Olympus, Faxanadu, and the older Mega Man games than a full metroidvania.\n\nThere is some backtracking in the overworld involved, but it was pretty minor timewise, and the exploration of the overworld to find some of the hidden areas was worth it, for me. I also loved the music - I could see it potentially being grating to some, but as I grew up with the games this is emulating, the music was a huge win for me.\n\nI felt like this game got me to interesting-levels-of-platforming more quickly than the first game, introducing double jump and wall slide nice and early, and had some really enjoyable platforming moments, without any of the overly punishing long and difficult backtracking areas that the first game had.\n\nEven if you don't know the original games (like my friends 8 year old that also loved this game), I highly reccomend this just on the platforming elements alone.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505838505, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505838505, "recommendationid": "35067786", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505020283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 119, "steamid": "76561198188309629", "num_games_owned": 23}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really liked the game, however, I repeatedly ran into a bug which crashed the game.

Everything you would expect in that kind of game is there but in its dullest, most basic form. Metroidvanias thrive on a sense of exploration and curiosity, but if everything is run-of-the-mill and you're seen every single solution being done in much more creative ways before then there is zero payoff.\n\nThere is no combat nor any way to kill enemies so you're confined to a \"move and jump\" kind of gameplay that gets old really quickly considering how lazily designed the levels are. The game is not challenging and the parts that are, are more annoying than exciting.\n\nThe world is not nearly as \"massive\" as advertised, by the way. A few hours in and you've seen it all and are pretty much walking back and forth to the same places to get to new areas. Also, exploration is incredibly underwhelming since aside from the important items that get you to places, your rewards are pretty much just gems and keys that get completely obsoleted by one skeleton key you get when you have enough gems.\n\nThe \"dream\" scenes are completely pointless as you have no idea at all what's going on with the hopelessly unengaging story of the game so they just look like nonsense and an unnecessary hault to your gameplay.\n\nThe music is TERRIBLE and quite possible the worst aspect of the game. Seriously, I love 8-bit style music, but the soundtrack of this game is pretty much unbearable. It is at the same time saccharine and souless, and utterly ruins the mood of whatever was attempted to be accomplished here. It made playing the game a depressing experience more than anything else.\n\nThis game is cheap and all, so one is tempted to cut the game some slack, but honestly this game was just a waste of my time and I urge anyone to make a better use of theirs playing something else.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504828609, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504933309, "recommendationid": "34804868", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498130", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 190, "total_reviews": 214, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 24}}
