The original Deus Ex and Thief games are high on my list of all-time favorites, and this is a game that tries to pay homage to both.  Unfortunately, it falls well short of such lofty heights.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. A number of levels have several paths through them.\n\n2. The neon art aesthetic is different, and sometimes works in some levels.  I like the synthetic neon trees.\n\n3. Light propagates between rooms if doors are opened.\n\n4. The shifting architecture in the VR level was clever, I would have liked to see more tricks like that.\n\n5. It has community mapping support, so fans can make and share their own levels.  Nice!\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1. The AI is incredibly crude, getting stuck on street lamps in wide open areas, soemtimes bumping in to you without detecting you, and virtually blind and deaf.  \"Search\" mode on hearing a noise or glimpsing something is laughable -- the AI will typically walk in a 5 foot circle, never branching out.  This is the worst stealth AI I have seen in 30 years of gaming.\n\n2. Difficult to impossible to tell what the actual light level of a given spot is by looking at the world around you often -- one square will be 100% visibility, while the square next to it will be 0% visibility.  Only way to tell is to look at the light meter.  This problem is exacerbated by the odd choice to apply a shaded vignetting to the screen when you're crouched, that artificially darkens the edges of the screen.\n\n3. Sound propagation and environmental audio are exceedingly primitive -- footsteps can be heard halfway across a map with almost no roll-off with distance.  Sometimes they don't even correctly play from the correct right/left channel, reversing at times.\n\n4. Very little enemy variety, and what there is is mostly cosmetic, beyond humans can be knocked out, robots can't.  No real differences in behavior, detection ranges/styles, etc.\n\n5. Tools are mostly pointless, as the AI is blind and brainless.  I beat the game without using any tools beyond throwing a few coins to try to distract enemies (they really don't respond much to them).\n\n6. Minigames for hacking/lockpicking are, once again, an awful idea -- if I need to take an action frequently, do not make me play the same tedious minigame.  The real source of tension is the risk of getting caught while I spend the time taking the action, a minigame is not needed and is something I'm just going to grow to hate doing, and savescum if I fail.  Keep it simple, Looking Glass and Ion Storm got it right.\n\nBottom Line -- Neon Struct would be a laudable find if it were the project of an amateur developer posting their personal projects to itch.io or the like, and would warrant feedback to the creator to continue growing their skills and encouragement to keep working and keep posting.  But unfortunately, it's a $20 game being sold on Steam as a professional product, and in that circumstance, it's not something I can really recommend buying, not when there are much better stealth games out there.  Pass on this one and go buy Thief 2 and Deus Ex (the original, not the remake), and slap some high-res texture mods on to pretty them up a bit.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503484258, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503484258, "recommendationid": "34434840", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524943", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 80, "total_reviews": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
