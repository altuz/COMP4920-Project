First off is Map design. There is some maps which really shouldnt be in the game. Its those pesky square formed maps. More precisely its those with sharp angles between planes. Its nice that the edges are soft but it doesnt really solve the problem. When you use a camera which is using perspective projection theres bound to be angled planes which cant be shown. That is fine as long as they arent adjacent to the plane you are on.  Because that creates situation where you go from one plane to another and get insta killed from enemies who you couldnt see or predict they were there. For example I shot to plane I plan to go to and I expect there arent any there but right when I go there spawns one and I get instakilled. This is the second problem spawning enemies. This is less of a problem and more of a difficult aspect of the game. The problem is that enemies spawn and you happened to ignore it and where were it spawned and got killed. Its a bad feeling knowing enemies can spawn right under you and you cant help it for example if you get swarmed or something else. Luckily you can deal with it with a limited blast. I think the better solution would be to make it not possible for example by delaying or make the spawn pushable. If you think this is wrong tell me why? If you are of the same mind tell me if there is something else which is also bothering you?", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506813636, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506813636, "recommendationid": "35357356", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502982", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 548, "total_reviews": 607, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 59}}
