If you did, this game is a modern version of those games mashed together. The controls for the game are awesome, and the graphics are very nice. The game feels really polished, I haven't noticed any bugs or glitches yet. The only thing I would wish for that the game doesn't include is online co-op, everything else is spot on. Challenging and fun, everything this type of game should be.

Lots of your little ship getting blown up/smashed/crushed like the tin can that it is. Lots of \"wait, we're trying to fly a spaceship through what?\" Lots of that sinking feeling when you realize that the maneuver you're supposed to pull off to get to the next level isn't even remotely close to being a sane thing to do in a spaceship. Lots of that awesome feeling when you manage to pull it off anyway, followed by despair when the levels abandon any pretense of being dangerous but essentially neutral and start actively trying to eat your ship.

Cave-flyers were made popular by indie game developers from Finland in the eraly 1990's with numerous titles in the genre. If you played the game Subterrania on Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, you will love this game.\nThis game makes everything right down to the last detail. The physics engine is what really puts this game on the map though. Physics affect everything from ship handeling to shots bouncing off walls and enemies falling down when shot. It's a bloody hard game because the physics engine makes it hard to navigate the ship without crashing into walls. It's also a very detailed game environment with tons of details that makes every map seem different even though it's mostly caves. Even the smoke from the booster rockets reacts to physics and bend around objects.\nPut short it's a hard, beautiful, detailed, fun game that works regardless if your play session is 5 minutes or hours.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429123572, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429123601, "recommendationid": "15389758", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504729", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481396985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 181, "steamid": "76561198044177223", "num_games_owned": 269}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Really good retro shooter action game. I'm sure the comparison has been made before but it reminds me of the old 8 bit game Thrust which appeared on various platforms and of the 16 bit title Oids. The game works really well with the xbox controller although it takes a while to get used to controlling the ship. Worth the effort though. I like the way the background text appears as you play and the reverse thruster is a nice touch as well.\nRecommended.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419157448, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1419157448, "recommendationid": "13493621", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.989362", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1474066895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 21, "steamid": "76561198036045507", "num_games_owned": 17}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The combat isn't very good or thrilling, I was interested in making sick trecks through caves a la Affordable Space Adventures but with more of a precision technical element than anything else.
