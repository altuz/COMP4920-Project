To be less polite, Basketball Pro Management feels like a lump of carbon that has a long way to go until it turns to diamond.\n\nOn the surface it has many of the FM features - right down to a 3D(ish) game engine. The problem is that they all feel 20% finished. It took FM many years to reach the stage it's at now, and I think the developers of Basketball Pro Management 2015 are trying to reach the moon before they learn to walk.\n\nFast Break Pro Basketball (and college basketball) remain the best basketball simulators on the market.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427357800, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427357800, "recommendationid": "15057270", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540387", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1424163598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 409, "steamid": "76561198037138077", "num_games_owned": 244}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm a huge fan of basketball and I love management sims like Football Manager so this was an easy buy for me. I have played it for about 10 hours now and I've reached the conclusion that though it is imperfect, it is an excellent sim. This is a game that should attract a fanatical following and the community (like in FM) should improve it by adding content such as new tactics.\n\nWell done stuff:\n\nUnbelievably they have all the exemptions (except the injured player exception) correct.\nYou can balance out the play time and get advice from the coach. You will want to intervene here or the coach will try to play an older guy that is a star for 40+ minutes against even bad teams.\nYou can add plays and call them. This works really well if you have a bad defending but fantastic 3 pt specialist. You can make sure he is on the perimiter, drive a player to the paint and toss the ball to one side of the court to draw off guards, and then funnel it to your player on the 3 point line. It works really well.\n\nYou'll want to change your database to the uploaded ones with real player names in them. It is uploaded by users to the forums.\n\nRough edges: \n\nThere are a few small player management issues such as number of players in the off-season. I get the impression that teams don't have strategies for tanking if they are already eliminated which helps rebuilding.\n\nI'd like to be able to scout upcoming draft classes.\n\nThere are some calendar issues with the game (for when a trade can be made).\n\nWhat it's not:\n\nIt's not NBA jam. You don't have an immersive gametime experience (when they are on the court). The graphics - even in 3d mode - do not compare to playstation etc. The focus of this game is what happens off the court (though you also have a part of the game for calling plays which you need to beat strong teams.)\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll in all it's a great game. I'm super-satisfied with my purchase. Right now it's 40% off so if you love the NBA and sims you should grab it.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419148379, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1419148379, "recommendationid": "13491470", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511239", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1426374697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 578, "steamid": "76561198080401140", "num_games_owned": 28}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a terrible game. As a veteran of sports management games such as OOTP, Football Manager and others, I was looking for a basketball management game where I could act as coach/gm.

The interface is terrible, navigation terrible, and whoever translated this game into enlgish did a piss poor job. The trades and free agent portion is rudimentary at best, the salary structure uses the right terms, but its all wrong in so many ways you just have to see it to know. The game interface is ridiculous. Basically the only thing you really control is subs. Sure you can call plays and make plays but it isnt how you think. You dont call pick n pop or iso and the players look for oportunities based on this play. You call a guy to do a certain thing, then the a/i does only that thing. There is no intuitive reacting or taking advantage of blown defense. If you call for kobe to drive the lane, that is the only thing the computer will do, kobe drive the lane. Kobe triple teamed? oh well, you called for him to drive the lane. shot missed. When you click for a called time out, the wistle doesnt blow next time you have possesion, it may not blow for 2 minutes.
