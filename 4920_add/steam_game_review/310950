I've played it a lot but I've struggled with it horribly. \n\nCons:\n-Capcom's business model, they'll go as low as it's needed to squeeze every dollar out of you.\n-Too many 50-50 situations, especially when a character was knocked down and he's about to get up. The game needs a refreshing 3rd option at least in wake ups, to make the game less basic. Characters like Laura and Mika are especially annoying to play against because of the 50-50 system.\n-The netcode for lobbies works horribly for some countries/ISPs, and this is mainly why I stopped playing this game. The game either works perfectly (with people that are somewhat nearby), or is completely unplayable with the very same people, depending on if the lobby set was randomly assigned to work from P2P or not.\n-Matchmaking and going from one ranked/casual match to the next is slow. Even having fiber optic I've had to wait more than 10 minutes to find a match some times (looking for connections of 4 and 5 bars only).\n-They intentionally made some characters look ugly to force you to buy (with real money) their classic costumes (check Akuma and Ibuki).\n-You cannot play keyboard vs controller. You can play 1-player modes with keyboard if you want, but if you want to play 2-players local, you're forced to have 2 controllers.\n-You can't assign the keys to whatever key you want in your keyboard without an external program, however, you can change what each button does from within the keys you're forced to use.\n-When the game updates, you have to download around 10 gb.\n-When you go to the stage/character select screen, instead of feeling happy for finally being able to play the game you bought, you'll feel punished because there are so many stages/characters that are locked.\n-Fight money (in-game currency) was planned to benefit Capcom, not the players. I'll explain myself: it's impossible for you to buy all the characters, all the costumes, all the colors and all the stages even if you play 24/7. In fact, you wouldn't even be able to just buy all the characters if you played 24/7.\n-Capcom's support, even though it's fast to answer, is not very helpful, and they can be disrespectful at times.\n-Some of the character's faces don't really look like how the characters were in the past games. It's sad because some other characters like Chun and Ryu look so beautifully done.\n-Story mode is: movie, fight, fight, movie, movie, movie, fight, fight, fight... you get it.\n-Objectification of some of the female characters. There was some objectification in SF4, but it's gone to the next level here.\n\nPros:\n-The fighting system is very accessible in comparison to the previous SF games, especially at the time of doing combos.\n-Crush counters are very pleasant to land. Some people take crush counters as a negative, but in my opinion they're a welcome addition.\n-VTrigger system replaces Ultras from SF4.\n-Crossplay between PC and PS4.\n-You can play as many of your favorite old SF characters (many with ugly new designs though, if you want the classic versions you have to pay extra).\n\nI suggest you go buy some others of the fighters in the market, you have Killer Instinct, Tekken 7, King of Fighters 14, Mortal Kombat X, etc.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506965552, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506966248, "recommendationid": "35424422", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502178", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507103565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2499, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8782, "steamid": "76561198072670540", "num_games_owned": 73}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The games has mixed reviews and a lot of hate from the Fighting Game Community but if you are just getting into fighting games and like the competitive aspect of them is a really good game, lots of tournament to watch online, resources to learn the game and individual characters and an active community making online matches easy to find.\n\nOn the other hand if you want a more solo experience the game is really lacking, there is no arcade mode, the story mode and survival mode are really boring so that only leaves you with character trials and vs CPU wich is not enough in my opinion to justify the purchase.\n\nSo if you want to start your salty journey to become a world warrior this is a good start.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506885604, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506885604, "recommendationid": "35393610", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501992", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506977788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 344, "steamid": "76561198057573903", "num_games_owned": 33}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Even though I really enjoy playing this game, whenever I start playing I face up with crashing issues all the time (win 10).

Ruined by careless optimization/porting, freemium content, and design direction.\nNot worth $60 CAD. Only worth if <$20 CAD.\n\nAs a beginner who is entering into the fighting game genre, I would not recommend this particular version of Street Fighter. The delay from your attacks is only obvious after you have played a more responsive game like Skullgirls. IMO playing this version actually has a negative effect of making a noobie spam his attacks hoping the response will go through.\n\nGameplay:\n[+]Combo System\nGreat if you can pull it off. I do enjoy the difficulty of having more strict inputs compared to skull girls and having to learn what moves can link together.\n[+]V-Skills\nThe V-skill addition is enjoyable. It adds a uniqueness to each character. Particularly in my case I enjoyed Juri's dash and Ryu's counter.\n\n[-]Input Delay\nAs you have probably read from everywhere, the input lag is very noticable and really inhibits the joy of this game. Imagine playing a MOBA game of around 60ms, you click and theres clearly something wrong, but you can't put your finger on it until you realize the timing of the game is clearly mismatching from what you expected.\n[-]Story is subpar\nFor those who enjoy the singleplayer part. The story is not very interesting. It is alot of build up that gets nowhere and alot of repeated character match ups. Furthermore, there are no cutscenes but there is voice acting, instead you are treated to a story-board style, barely colored, 'cutscene'. If this was the style Capcom was aiming for it heavily falls short compared to SFIV. Otherwise, I would write it off as Capcom cutting the funding/focus on this portion of the game and simply doing only a below-satisfactory job. (C- at best.)\n[-]Freemium\nI am bias towards these type of marketing strategies. If the game is going to include DLC content that cost money, the base game better be cheap or full of content. SFV is neither.\nI find it rediculous that the base game, with so many bugs for PC, is priced at around $60 CAD ($40 USD) (at the time of my purchase). Additionally, the new characters all cost additional money and the 'ingame cash' you can accumulate is hard to come by. You have get a few 'dailies' that reward around 100, and you get some for winning ranked matches, You need a whopping 4000000 or some huge amount to actually buy a character. (It is possible to get around 2 characters for free if you finish all the story possible, repeating the story DOES NOT reward the ingame cash again). If Capcom really wanted to charge for characters, the base game should've at least been priced at around $30 USD. \n\nTechnical:\n[+]Netcode\nIn most games I've played, there is no noticable 'lag' if you wanna call it that. Of course, it is quite hard to tell anyways thanks to the input delay, but overall gameplay is consistent.\n\n[-]Terrible Optimization for PC\nThe game itself on steam is quite terrible IMO. I run a triple monitor setup and I CANNOT alt-tab. If I do the game will eat up all my memory (Win10, GTX980, i5-3570K, 8GB RAM for those who are spec-obsessed). I believe I am well within range of running this game and this issue occurs on low-spec mode. So I can only conclude it is a coding issue on the developer's part.\n[-]Fundamental Bugs\nIf I do a combo challenge, then exit to training mode and put in some inputs, this results in the game crashing from a memory violation. I figure its a coding issue as well since I can't see why this would be due to specs (still occurs when ran as admininistrator).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505026903, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505041177, "recommendationid": "34855050", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502476", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497801490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 10020, "steamid": "76561198003607086", "num_games_owned": 386}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Unfinished trash.

MvC, Injustice, MK (blah blah blah) and you realise how stiff and held back it is and you just can't have fun. It's not fun, it's all about competitive nonsense. I love competitive in games like TF2 and maybe MOBA games, but there is NO casual option for games like this.\nAnd you can not possibly call this flaming bullshit a \"story mode\" it's 3 level one bots with 2 lines of pointless dialogue beforehand. \n\nThen you have to realize how many of these games try to rely off of sexual appeal to stay alive. (Don't even get me started on how stupid Mika is in SFV, her story is literally nonexistant)\nGames like skullgirls and DoA are literally playable porn. If it wasn't for kids jerking off all over it they would have been completely dead within a month.  Streetfighter is starting to go down that path as well as the other franchises.\n\nIn the end all that really happened is I suffered through hours of learning different fighting games and practicing every frame in them just to realize I just accomplished nothing. Especially for this games price and lack of content, I couldn't give this a recommended review if there was a gun on my head.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507159168, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507159285, "recommendationid": "35482345", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500432338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 389, "steamid": "76561198195670315", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Chun li thick.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505688961, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505688961, "recommendationid": "35034848", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501713", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1597, "total_reviews": 3175, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 1578}}
