However, I don't think it's a game for mass audiences. \n\nThe key aspect of LoA is that it is a STRATEGY game in the truest sense. Not strategy a la real-time-strategy games that in reality emphasize tactics over strategy, this game is about coming up with a grand overarching plan, sticking to it when it's working, modifying it when it's not, and coming up with new ones when your old plan gets blown out of the water.\n\nCombat is very simple: Two armies meet, time passes, and people die. The victor is determined purely through strategic-level elements: How many troops are on each side of the field, how rested those troops are, how good those troops are, and what magic influences the field. I appreciate the change of pace.\n\nOne reason people might want to not buy LoA is that there's only one real campaign right now (plus a tiny tutorial campaign which doesn't count) and it doesn't seem like there's much replay value after you beat that campaign, and once you understand everything the campaign's not that difficult.

It is a very hard and challenging game. Think about USSR at -41 when Germany assaulted it. Soviets struggled in defensive war at start, until tides turned. Thats what is going on here as well. \n\nAt start your mission is unity \"allies\" under the same flag. While doing that, you need to defend land against hostitle and superior force. Slowly you gain power by recruiting more cities under your control and winning battles (hopefully). The game has good re-playability possibilities as there are different ways to achieve these things. For example, if you recruit a powerful king on your side, it will end up to a side quest. Which takes your attention elsewhere, while you are already busy by defending your territory. You also have few wizards under your control. They are good in battle, but can also be used in quests, hunting artifacts and treasures all over the map!\n\nA simple and quite good made UI may look strange, but it offers you just what you need to enjoy the game. \n\nWell worth 3.74e (holiday sale)!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419533650, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1419533650, "recommendationid": "13594030", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526696", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462337181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 166, "steamid": "76561198041440851", "num_games_owned": 214}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "First off, I want to say this could have been a very good game.

You play the game a few times, until you finally pull out a win against the odds... and thats it. \n\nThe game comes pre-packaged with a single senario (not counting a short tutorial one teaching you the basics of play), and once you beat that senario you have zero reason to play again. Now at 4.99 its hardly a great loss, and you probably got a couple hours of enjoyment out of it, but still. For a game with so much potential its sad to see it fall so flat. Supposedly the game was suppose to feature an editor that let you make and play your own senarios, what was given was a confusing and unhelpful web page with a ZIP file. So instead of a smooth in-game editor, your stuck with a clunky text editor that most non-coders won't be able to master in a reasonable time frame.\n\nSo if you don't mind paying five bucks for a couple hours of entertainment, then this is for you.
