Too many issues with mechanics, gameplay and AI. (As far as I can tell this is the exact same engine as Battle Mages, maybe an expansion, but has zoomed in story segments with third person over the shoulder view. Kind of like Spellforce)\n\nI can see how this could had been an awesome game back in the day. It is too dated to be really worth sinking so many hours into, would take a lot of patience to escort squads through all the small scenarios, micromanage them and deal with the AI issues. You need to be very finnicky with your mouse to get the AI to respond and often you need to spam click for them to constantly repath for best route and adjust to moving circumstances of battlefield. Best just move along to something more modern.\n\nKind of a Real Time Strategy version of something like Age of Wonders. You get your warlock that is off map and your units which you have to guide through a linear-like progression, get loots, do quests, kill monsters, go to town. Minimap is beautiful and makes navigation fairly easy. Everything is instance-based real with with a fully fledged campaign. Controls obey standard real time strategy standards and camera is fluid. Pathfinding is extremely dumb and units get stuck on each other constantly. This is somewhat made up for by the mage abilities which have more of an opportunity to play out when yours and the foes artificial intelligence just bottleneck together somewhere. However there was no music whatsoever playing out and the audio felt empty. Much like the visuals which despite being acceptable were not very immersive.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503990510, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503990548, "recommendationid": "34570582", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500223", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
