It's a fun flight sim with a lot of missions to do. \n- Some people might not be able to run this game properly on modern machines, but that's fixable with a little bit of registry editing, setting the correct settings (Like choosing Hardware TnL in options app), and downloading some extra missing files (link in comments).\n- I highly recommend setting the control method to \"E-mouse\", with inverted Y-axis (Makes it behave like an FPS).\n\nIf anybody has any questions about how to get this game running, comment on my review your questions, and I might be able to help you with it. I'm running this on Windows 8.1, with x8 Anti aliasing at 1280x720@60 FPS and all settings maxed (Trying to figure out how to get 1080p, at the moment).\n\nTL;DR If you ignore the outdated visuals and the hassle to get it properly set up the first time, this would be a fun flight sim for you.\n\nEdit: Released an app that fixes issues with the game. http://steamcommunity.com/app/311100/discussions/0/1471966894873092057/", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412212791, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501313893, "recommendationid": "12320601", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564820", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442488521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 776, "steamid": "76561197997300511", "num_games_owned": 301}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": 0, "review": "There I want to tell a lot about this great game.\nBasically this is standalone addon for original Echelon game a futurstic action/VTOL-simulation set in same universe and period but from another character perspective. The game features decent flight model which makes you feel of flight and inertion, advanced damage model, a lot of detailed ground, naval and air units and buildings with their own damage models. There many types of aicrafts and weapons to choose. The game is unique by being realistic at some point Sci-Fi vtol sim. The game locations is large, the whole continent is featured here.\nThe story/campaign is good, long and even non linear at some places, the fully and nicely voiced dialogues (yeah with yelling commander etc.) also.\nThe graphics of original Echelon (2001) was next gen for it's time, but in WindWarriors not really much changes.\nGame mechanics have a lot similarities to MechWarrior series just you control the aircraft there.\nSadly this game didn't got any sequels (forget about operation matriarchy) so the story is incomplete due publishers counted this type of games as not profitable.\nThere is campaign coop and nice multiplayer with gamemodes involving teamwork and just fun deathmach, the bad thing it was using Gamespy. (the russian comminity still run server, but it reqiure custom patches) Unlike most of harcore sim games this is easy to learn but hard to master, in multiplayer (really!). There more action than fight with controls of your machine.\nI would recommend this game if you like open locations, Sci-Fi VTOL, atmoshpere (in both meanings, game take place only on planet) some hard missions to challenge your skills, epic and dynamic battles and unexpected turns of a plot.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413579721, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421167538, "recommendationid": "12530596", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536105", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1419714339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1114, "steamid": "76561198040735060", "num_games_owned": 100}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It is as old as great.
