This is one of these games you shouldn't expect much from, and you rather play them because they are as bad as they are. In this game, the first level is in an apartment building you are supposed to escape from, but I didn't even make it through 2 floors, because the level is too crowded and the health is too low. Then I had the fun experience of realizing that there is no automatic checkpoints, and that the entire intro cutscene plays  everytime you start again. Meaning, that you basically have to start the game from the Main Menu every single time you die. \n\nAfter utilizing the games console and a few commands, I managed to be unbeatable, yet, either none of the doors work, I was running in circles, or the level is just broken. After a while I eventually made it to the next section. After taking more hits than I expected to be tolerated, I realized that I didn't have godmode anymore, and upon my respawn I was back in level 1 because I forgot to create a save file when arriving Level 2. From that point on I never managed to reach Level 2 again.\n\nTruly an amazing experience.
