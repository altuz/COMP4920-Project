If you were a fan of the first two chapters of Doorways, prepare to be surprised...sorta.\n\nFrom the offset it's got the same atmosphere, the same tension running throughout that made the first chapters stand out. Alongside this it has more traditional horror moments, putting this game somewhere between Chapter Two and Amnesia: Dark Descent in terms of play. Throw in some slightly more natural, less force-scripted, dialogue from Thomas Foster (that's YOU) and you're onto a winner.\n\nBut, the game does take a turn for the worst in the puzzle repetition. While the first real set of puzzles are basically split in two and repeated, it's forgiveable as the experience is new for the game (you'll know what I mean when you play it) and tense throughout. It's a constant threat, or it feels like it. But the second puzzle feels more lax and easier - just repetition without the fearful tension to make it ignorable.\nSadly this isn't just a one-off. I've not completely finished the story yet (couldn't find a certain something...), but what I assume to be the final puzzle/area is another case of repetition. I personally found this one the worst, as it had no tension and became a total grind of finding things and trying to figure out what to do with very little actual indication. I spent 50 minutes solid running around this bit pointlessly...without revealing too much, except puzzle initials, I hated the X-R bit.\n\nBut still, it's a solid game and so far it stands up. The price is arguably a bit steep, I completely agree, but this game is still damn good. It's enjoyable and it has a good share of spooks and jumps. I do not regret my choice of buying this.\n\n\nIf you want to look for yourself, here's a playthrough of the first part of the chapter with more following imminently.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE2W-4q1ot4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411036896, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1411036896, "recommendationid": "12137429", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507825", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1410995196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 73, "steamid": "76561198027519418", "num_games_owned": 272}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "2", "review": "It's hard to justify even $7 for this.\n\nI really liked Chapter 1 & 2. Chapter 3 starts off just as strong! The scares were decent, the atmosphere was nice. This chapter features a lot of chase sequences, like the room with the giant statue in chapter 2. The first two with the first \"monster\" are really cool. The game has a very unique way of showing you help messages instead of using pop-up dialogue boxes, which is really cool. It adds to the stress of running away from the \"monster\". The story is pretty standard of this series, and the recap at the beginning of the chapter clears up some of the questions from the first 2. What confuses me, though, is in chapter 1 the main character barely remembers anything about what's going on, and now he seems to know exactly what is going on. Just weird, not a huge problem.\n\nThe game changes with the second set of chases, however, and instead of being kind of fun and a little creepy, just becomes tedious. You are basically in a big semi-maze, and you have to collect a key from one part of the maze to get an item that you need in another part of the maze to get through the end of the maze. (I don't want to spoil the whole thing, that's why I'm being so vague.) Essentially, this boils down to running around boring cave hallways, finding a key, running back to open a door, going through that door, getting an item, running back to the place to use the item, just to go find a different key and do it again. It's monotonous, and the \"monster\" chasing you during this time could have been cool if you didn't spend so much time doing everything. It's so tedious that it stops being scary 5 minutes into this section.\n\nI didn't finish the chapter because of the section after that. The game just released, so I will go back to it eventually, but I'll explain why I didn't finish. The puzzle is either completely unfair and stupid, or I was missing something from the low brightness or my own stupidity. You have to arrange x-rays in a specific order, but where you find that order I have no clue. I ran back and forth through this part of the level about 10 times, not finding anything new. I had a frozen key to a door, but there was nothing to melt it out. There's a door that's locked with a numpad, but I didn't find a single clue to help open the door except for maybe some gibberish note on the wall that I couldn't make heads or tails of. Eventually, I got frustrated and ran around holding the frozen key, I jumped down a staircase, and one of the rooms was pitch black. I thought maybe I did something to trigger a change in the environment, so I stepped into the room. As I stepped in, I noticed some lights above me, and I looked up as I realized I was falling through the game. Somehow, the room had shifted upwards while the rest of the level stayed at the same position. This resulted in my continuous spawning underneath the level. I couldn't even access the menu to quit the game properly, because the menu appears sort of as part of the level I guess. I had to force quit the game.\n\nAll-in-all, the game starts out as good as the rest of the series, then quickly descends into monotony and poorly designed puzzles. Maybe the ending of the chapter would redeem this, but I won't know anytime soon. I wouldn't be too mad if I had paid $3, but for $7 this was really disappointing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1410996156, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1410996156, "recommendationid": "12133875", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503767", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452708537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 429, "playtime_forever": 236, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "num_games_owned": 1511}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "\"Oh, my God!  What...what is this place?!  WHAT IS THIS PLACE?!?\"\n \n   Think that's a tad melodramatic?  Well, if you're gonna buy this game, you'd best get used to it. \n \n   In Doorways: The Underworld you play the single most hysteria-prone supernatural-investigator-of-evil-people's-minds that you will ever meet.  Even after being chased down narrow, bendy, all-but-completely-dark tunnels by fucked-up dudes who look like they just stepped out of a Clive Barker novel, he's still prone to jump-scaring HIMSELF with the comparatively mild sight of a clean-picked skeleton or two.  Seriously, the guy is kinda crazy:  He talks to himself persistently, asking more silly questions than a six year-old child being raised in an Eastern European brothel, and they're all completely rhetorical because apart from the odd tortured, animalistic guy with a wheel in place of a pair of legs, HE'S ALL ALONE.  \n \n   I mean, if the first sign of madness is talking to oneself, then the second must surely be skulking about in unfeasibly dark places when you're as unsuited to scaring yourself as an incontinent schoolgirl with a rare heart condition.  This game's approach to scares brings two words to mind:  \"Heavy\" and \"handed\".  In roughly that order.  Having said that, it IS quite genuinely scary at times, almost in spite of itself.\n \n   Proceedings get off to a particularly poor start, in any case, with a sub-Amnesia style bit which succeeds neither as \"stealth\" nor \"pursuit\", and yet BOTH are integral to getting through it.  It's a bit trial-and-error to say the least, and I for one nearly gave up on the game there and then, not even ten minutes in.  Fortunately things DO get better from there - at least until the heavily glitch-ridden finale - and there's actually quite a lot of really good stuff in this game if you stick with it.  I certainly wouldn't recommend it, however, to anyone just \"discovering\" the horror genre for the first time.  There's every chance you'll just throw in the towel with frustration, and never bother playing another horror game for as long as you live.\n \n   The first Doorways game (Doorways: Prelude) somehow turned minimal mechanics and an almost total lack of regular, mobile \"enemies\" into a strangely compelling and satisfying experience.  Somehow, by adding more typical gaming mechanics, this second entry has done itself a bit of a disservice.  With a bit of luck I'll find that by the third and final game in the series, the devs have ironed things out a bit, and consolidated the best aspects of the first and second game into some kind of harmonious whole.  I have faith:  Saibot Studios are far from stoopid or untalented, they just need to give themselves a bit of a kick in the arse from time to time. \n\n   Verdict:  8/10.\n \n(PS Nice little \"homages\" to Outlast and Penumbra in the sewer section.

However, the time trials area after the hospital interrupted the flow and became tedious very quickly. Time trials themselves are not necessarily bad, but for a game that relies on psychological horror, they need to be used only a few times at most, and making them too difficult and too overcomplicated only leads to frustrating the player and ruining the carefully crafted atmosphere that made Doorways popular.\n\nCase in point: After exiting the operating theater, you end up in mazelike corridors with a map and the flashback ability. You now have to do time trials where you need to hit the lever and run back to a doorway and go through before the timer runs out. Now, while it started out somewhat challenging, it wasn't too difficult or complicated. It worked with the atmosphere alright, and if it had stopped here, I'd be giving a more positive review.\n\nNo, first, the map was purposefully made to be useless. You cannot run with the map in a readable position, so running to beat a seemingly endless stream of time trials meant running through confusing mazes on memory. But the big mistake here was trying to combine the Flashback ability with the time trials. Flashback slows down time, which is absolutely necessary for the later time trials. However, it also summons the monster, which appears very nearby, with the possibility of appearing on any side of the player, including right in front of them.\n\nSo, how do you time it so the monster doesn't instantly kill you? Is it based on where you stand? Maybe, but when you've got a ridiculous time limit to meet, a map you can't use, and a constant need to keep reactivating flashback, beating the time limit and escaping the monster becomes pure luck. As I've already said, they threw way too many mechanics together at once in these trials, which only made the problem of the game having too many time trials already worse. The atmosphere that Doorways relies on was runined.\n\nI understand that challenge is important in a game, and the team tried to do something new and challenging with the time trials, but they don't fit with the atmosphere of the game, and honestly if the developers had given a skip button for the time trials, I would've gotten a greater feeling of satisfaction from clicking that button than I would've gotten from actually beating the time trials for real. That's the point where challenging becomes tedious, which doesn't belong in any game, Doorways especially.\n\nAnyway, the first few levels might make fans of the series happy, but once the time trials start, the game as a whole is likely going to turn into a disappointment for them.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411809172, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1411809172, "recommendationid": "12257246", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496464", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480282324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 222, "steamid": "76561198181651195", "num_games_owned": 66}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "One of the most boring and annoying games I've played!
