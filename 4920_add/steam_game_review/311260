For veterans like me now is the time to help the devs and get the game on track and the way we want it to be. I love this franchise, it may even be wierd for me to say this but I love this game too.

Should definitely mention that it is Early Access and as the devs said, there are bugs and placeholders so if you're looking to buy into this Early Access be aware of that. I think, aside from being a fan of the previous titles, buying into this EA is mostly to give feedback to the devs as testers. The game is going to be sold at a lower price during EA and raised to full price once the game is released ($50/$60USD?)\n\nGraphics are a upgrade from Guild 2, however, the priest class is missing from the game. Will update if devs are going to add or not. The character voices are.. Not good, lol, sound a bit like robots reading a script. Game's UI is rough.  MP is currently not playable, devs are still working on it should be ready for release hopefully. In the current build, theres still a lot missing from Guild 2, looking at the [url=http://media.thqnordic.com/The_Guild_3/The%20Guild%203%20Early%20Access%20Roadmap.png]roadmap[/url], hopefully this fleshes the game out, I really hope they add more interactions with buildings, doing things inside it, etc. GolemLabs needs to add more to this game gameplay-wise even more things not listed in the roadmap before I consider it better than Guild 2.\n\n[b]FOR NEWCOMERS TO THE GUILD SERIES[/b]\n\nThis game is essentially manage your dynasty as you try to gather wealth and power in Medieval Europe. You start a business (farming, manufacturing, etc) and eventually try to run for a political office. The game right now in Early Access state is a bit rough to play and if you don't know what you're doing you will probably be confused. My guess is, if you have money to spare or know youre going to buy this game, go ahead and grab it while it's discounted before full release. If you're on the fence I'd suggest just waiting til full release and to get a full taste of the game rather than it in it's current EA state.\n\n[b]Final thoughts[/b]\n\nOverall, how they go about this early access will really decide if they make or break the game, are they going to go Divinity 2 route and do Early Access right or fumble along and ruin the series? As of right now, game is too risky for a buy and but give it a few months in early access. I'd say mostly for fans of The Guild series it's a cautious buy. If you're new to the series I'd definitely say sit and wait on updates. I feel most of the negative reviews are people not really understanding what Early Access entails or even bothered to read what the dev had to say about the early access build so I wouldn't put much stock into these reviews.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506448257, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506450242, "recommendationid": "35226705", "language": "english", "votes_down": 71, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.771035", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507086883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1296, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1296, "steamid": "76561198060410779", "num_games_owned": 114}, "votes_funny": 20, "votes_up": 662, "comment_count": "58", "review": "[h1]Steam really needs to enforce some minimum standards for Early Access games.

Unfortunately, in 6 years* of development, the game is nowhere near ready for EA. If the devs believed this game to be in a playable state they were deluding themselves. \n\nThis is what the developers said this EA release was, vs what it actually is:\n\n\"...we're nearing completion and balancing/polishing the game...\" - game is nowhere near complete. Requires much more than balances and polishing - large gameplay elements are missing. This release** is a sandbox Alpha test at best.\n\n\u201cThe only differences will be those made due to feedback from the fans, and of course final fixes\" - The ONLY differences? I certainly hope not (unless they are counting on the fans to finish coding and building the game themselves, like they did with The Guild 2)\n\n\u201cEarly Access is fully playable but in need of balancing and (performance) optimization.\" - Outright lie. \n\nAll I could do with my character was buy a business and craft the same items over and over. No trade routes meant that I had to micro manage production by sending my transporter to the market to buy resources for my business constantly. If I stopped even for a few minutes, my business would run out of resources and production would cease.\n\nI couldn't get court anyone, get married or, you know, build a dynasty.\n\nI couldn't upgrade my business to craft more lucrative items.\n\nAlmost every option and action I clicked was broken/not working.\n\nThe UI is awful. It looks older and is less user friendly than UI from The Guild 2 (a game over 10 years old)\n\nAI pathfinding is terrible (have they copied and pasted the pathfinding from The Guild 2? Characters are still moving along the ground without moving their legs and getting stuck walking into buildings... this is 2017...)\n\nI could go on and on about what is missing and what an EA game [b]6 years in development[/b] should include as an absolute minimum, but I'm just going to release this review unfinished and hope for the best.\n\n\n[b]EDITS for clarity/correction:[/b] \n\n*Game has been in development 3 years (going by announcement Sept 2014), not 6 years.

And considering the state of Steams Early Access environment right now, I lost even a little bit more faith in what was happening, despite the Guilds 2 bugs and shortcomings, the game I played for many years was a game I grew to love, and was hoping to see Guild 3 capitalize on those problems and give us a better, more matured game.\n\nNow, in the game's current state, we do not have that more mature, more polished game, not by a long shot, and in my opinion, we saw it regress in a few areas. But that does not mean I have lost hope on the game, no way, while I usually do not like to review Early Access games, because many times I find people reviewing the game not on the actual content, but on performance bugs and things like that. Which, by no means are not important to take note of and notify the developers, but these are things one should expect from a game in alpha or beta stage. So, for this review, I am going to do my best to all review the actual content of the game, the real nuts and bolts, and talk about the functionality of the game that I did like, and the things I did not like.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I have yet to set a precedent on doing positives or negatives first, but I feel like this is a video to do the negatives first.\n\n- Maybe the first thing that really grinded my gears about this game is that you no longer buy your titles, you know from moving up from commoner, to yeoman, to citizen, and so on. Now this is done by just an arbitrary amount of your own output, for example, when I made enough daggers I instantly just jumped up a whole new class. I\u2019m not sure why this irked me as much as it did, but I just did not understand why they changed this. It also just does not make any sense, getting new titles should have stayed like how it was in previous games, you needed to go into the town hall and purchase the new title. And this made a ton more sense, no one was ever going to just come out of the woodwork and hand you a scroll giving you a promotion just because you had a stockpile of daggers in your house. If that was the case, every doomsday prepper would be the mayors and land barons of whatever dirt mound they called home.\n- My next negative about the game is that even though this is a new game and new extension of the Guild series, we did not see any new classes and we did not see much of an improvement in the way of new professions. In fact, the Guild 3 paired down a lot of those, removing things like being a priest, or a miner, or a lumberjack, all things have been stripped from the game and are now only controlled by NPC\u2019s. \nSure, a couple things have been added like the assassin guild and the parchment maker, but otherwise there wasn\u2019t anything groundbreaking or fun here to be seen.\n- My last negative about the game is how you no longer level up how you did in the Guild 2, instead of leveling up and choosing new actions or different perks that would help your character in running their business or excelling politically, many of these things can just be bought now as actions. This depends on what kind of store you own, but as long as the Khajit has coin, you can by it. I was pretty disappointed in not only that but also the new skill tree they added. It is just so bland and not engaging, it is just such a bland and linear skill tree, while Guild 2 didn\u2019t necessarily have a true skill tree, it felt much more diverse than what we have now.\n\nOkay, I\u2019ve done enough ragging on the game, let\u2019s talk about some of the positives now.\n\n+ They added and expanded upon the societies, or guilds, as they might have been called in Guild 2, and this is something I was very excited to see, I\u2019ll admit that in the Guild 2, the actual purpose of the Guild itself was pretty uninteresting and it did not bring a whole lot of dynamics in the game, that is very much different now for Guild 3, and I think that anyone who puts the time and the elbow grease into the game will be able to see that, especially since the societies expand beyond just whatever profession you are in.\n+ I love the \u201cpoor person\u201d mode that they added, where you start off as a commoner that is honestly pretty destitute, you have a ramshackle house on the outskirts of town, with the goal of hopefully getting your dynasty into the bustling city center, and expanding your commercial empire, this takes time and I don\u2019t think the devs have smoothed out the whole dating thing very much yet but I know this is a gamemode that I will be spending a ton more time on.\n+ I\u2019ll admit that I first was not a fan of only being in one city, but when I realized that the maps might just have one city in them for now, the sprawling towns or subdivisions around them adds a ton of character to the game and you will operate in that city. As I mentioned above, I\u2019m eager to see my character pull himself out of poverty and into the middle and upper class, like any good capitalist would want it to be.\n\nVerdict: Man, this game is ROUGH around the edges in it\u2019s current state. And I could not in good conscious recommend it to someone who is looking to get into the Guild series for the first time, but if you are a long fan of the series and looking to support its development, it is worth it to buy and mmmmmaybeeee play, but maybe also better to sit on the game and let a few patches come out, fixing a lot of the gameplay issues. I could make another 10 minutes long video just me bitching and moaning about the bugs I\u2019ve encountered but with a game like this I know what I was getting in for, so I cannot knock it for its obvious bugs. But I have to be real in that while I will recommend in the game, in its current state I have to give it a  \u2156.\n\nLink to video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq6YVV8lqTs", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506701160, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506701194, "recommendationid": "35302983", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584835", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506455200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561198030965719", "num_games_owned": 182}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 91, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Buy this game in this version if you:\nA.

It is ridiculously buggy with a horrible user interface, crazy learning curve, terrible balance and often forces you to restart the game many hours in due to bugs; but despite all that it was still such a new and interesting concept that we have always been willing to play anyway. Especially considering that we knew The Guild 2 was released in such a terrible state because some stuff happened with the developers and they were forced to release it before it was done.\n\nWhen we heard that they were making a new Guild game, we were ecstatic. \n\nWhen we heard the same guys wore working on it as the original and that they\u2019d actually be able to finish it, we were even more ecstatic.\n\nWhen they said that that they would not use a single shred of code from the old, buggy game and were rewriting all new code in a new engine so that not a single bug from the original game would return, we were happy.\n\nWe knew it would take a long time to release during their announcement in August 2014, when they said, and I quote, \u201cOne thing is for certain: the developers have learned their lessons and do not want to deliver an unfinished game. So: better to wait for a bug-free game. We have great patience, since we know it will pay off.\u201d \n\nWe were happy with that. Better it be bug free than to make the same mistakes as the original. They said \u201cNow under a different publisher, THQ Nordic, there is more time and funding to do things right.\u201d\n\nThey did a preview in 2014 of the game, and stated that it would be released in 2016. Early for a preview? Yes. Believable timeline for completion? Yes. Totally acceptable.\n\nThen they put an announcement of the game up on Steam in October 2015, and announced the boxed version on Amazon. Clearly, it seemed to us, the game must be on time for its promised 2016 release. \n\nThey offered the boxed version on Amazon for presale around April 2016. We bought it. In 2016. Clearly, the game was coming out soon, as promised; especially since the release date they put on the Amazon purchase was soon in 2016.\n\nThen, they moved the release date out. In September 2016 they announced at Gamescom that The Guild 3 should be released in early 2017 instead of 2016 as promised.\n\nBut, that didn\u2019t happen either. They changed the Amazon delivery date on our purchase to some other date in 2017, and then finally changed it again to some months later December 2017. \n\nNow they\u2019ve changed the release date to 2018.\n\nNow, they\u2019ve deleted all of their news articles where they posted release dates to us, but we have had at least three release dates that didn\u2019t happen. And these were exact release dates; not random semi-permanent dates. They kept pushing it back. \n\nBut, fine. We wish they didn\u2019t promise a date that wasn\u2019t achievable multiple times, but fine. As they said, they didn\u2019t want to release it buggy; and we didn\u2019t want them to either!\n\nSo, when the most recent release date came, they decided that instead of pushing the date back yet again, they would do an early access release. They said that they did not need the funding from an early release, but that instead they wanted players opinions. It seems clear to me that this was just a knee-jerk reaction, and a bad one. \n\nMy husband and I wished they wouldn\u2019t do an early release, because we were afraid of exactly what happened.\n\nThey announced, regarding the early release: \u201c..this version is fully playable.\u201d Again, on Steam, they say \u201c\u2026 is fully playable but in need of balancing and (performance) optimization. Participants can expect minor and few major bugs, that we will fix during Early Access.\u201d It is not fully playable, in the least. The bugs are such that you cannot perform even simple tasks in the game. It is not even partially playable. This is an outright lie.\n\nOn Steam itself, they say \u201cAs we're nearing completion and balancing/polishing the game.\u201d The game needs far more than balancing and polishing. It does not even have a solid base. \n\nOn Steam, they say regarding early access, \u201c\u2026we assume a duration of at least 4-6 months.\u201d This game is nowhere near 4-6 months from completion. As I said, it does not even have a solid base to grow on.\n\nRegarding their earlier promises that they would not use a shred of code or resources from the old game? Then why are the same bugs rearing their ugly heads? And why, in the early release, do we have the same ugly user interface from the original? The same voices. The same images. Maybe these are placeholders? But that\u2019s not a good sign to those of us that are afraid this is just the Guild 2 again.\n\nAnd their promise that they wouldn\u2019t release a buggy game? Well, they did, and they just slapped the words \u2018Early Access\u2019 on it to pretend that it\u2019s okay. This is specifically against what they said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about us wanting the game to fail. We want it to do well! We loved the predecessor and we want to love this one! But, I\u2019m sorry, that does not mean that you recommend a game to people if the developers are clearly making bad decisions and not being honest with themselves or us about where they are with this game. It\u2019s not in early access stage. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s a fact.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506716096, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506889971, "recommendationid": "35310955", "language": "english", "votes_down": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580107", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506463741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 100, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 100, "steamid": "76561197988200449", "num_games_owned": 456}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 231, "comment_count": "12", "review": "[b]NOTE: This review will change as development progresses. Once it has reached a state which I consider to be playable, I'll change the review. This review is intended for those who wish to play an incomplete - yet playable - game.[/b]\n\nFor now, hold off on your purchase - there are many, many things which need implementation or fixing, even for an early access game it's a little surprising. The reason I'm giving a negative review, despite hoping the game gets better down the road, is simple - I cannot recommend it in its current state. No, it's not just because it has bugs - it's in early access, of course it's going to have bugs. However, I do expect early access games to have some standard of quality. I think they need to be at least somewhat playable - the core of the game being somewhat functional with missing features or placeholder assets / audio, along with a lot of minor bugs, a few major bugs and poor optimisation to be ironed out is fine by me for early access. Some documentation on how one should play the game in order to test it effectively is welcome (but not needed).\n\nIn this game's current early access state however, it is nowhere close to that - the core game is completely unplayable for more than 12 minutes. A line needs to be drawn on what's acceptable and what is not for general release to the public, both for the consumer's and developer's sake, as the reputation an early access game gets can also have an effect on its reputation during release. The developer should have known this and not caved into the fan's demands (people have been demanding for the past year for the devs to release something, no matter what state it is in, which is wrong) - it will give them a quick buck in the short term, but it may have dire ramifications long term, which is a shame.\n\n[b]MAJOR EXAMPLES OF UNPLAYABILITY[/b]\n\n[b]1. [/b]Moving characters who have been travelling around for more than 20 seconds will eventually be sent into an irreversible 360 rotational spin - that spin can have him/her go off the navmesh and you cannot control or interact with the character anymore. This doesn't just happen to yours, but to every character on the map - hundreds of characters will be endlessly spinning into the sky, and the streets will be deserted as those agents won't arrive and despawn at their destination to allow another to spawn.\n[b]2. [/b]Pretty much any complicated action or process likely causes a crash (e.g. marriage, upgrading, saving / loading etc). You won't progress far, even if you don't have the spinning-flying character bug. Yes, early access is meant to find and iron out crashes / bugs, but not to this extent. \n\nIf you wish to support the developers or assist their efforts in bug fixing (like I have - I really want The Guild 3 to be a good game hence my purchase and time spent so far despite its unplayability), then by all means get it now.

Let me show you:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWHAT THE DEVELOPERS HAVE TO SAY:\n\nWhat is the current state of the Early Access version?\n\u201cEarly Access is fully playable but in need of balancing and (performance) optimization\". \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOff the bat, the developers have lied to their ENTIRE player base. The game is NOT playable AT ALL. Don't try and sugar coat your product with irrelevant screenshots and misleading development updates. Why must you mislead us? Is it because you don't have faith in your game? Or is it because you don't plan on finishing it like other games that have chosen the EA route?\n\nMost buildings from the previous games are not in this one.\nYou cannot enter buildings and see the interior.\nFrom what I can tell, most of the abilities that were available in the previous games are not in this game.\n\nThey made it seem like you have to grind your way from a peasant, to get a higher rank in society, but that does not feel like the case. It seems exactly the same as the last game, with less stuff to do. Then again, it is early so maybe they will add more stuff to do. Just the lack of content that was available previously seems strange, since they did say all the game needs is bug fixes and polishing.\n\nMaybe I'm being too harsh, lets keep reading:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nApproximately how long will this game be in Early Access?\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t set a fixed end date as this depends heavily on you, but we assume a duration of at least 4-6 months\".\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgain, after seeing what progress they have made with my own eyes, that \"assumption\" is absolutely innaccurate. I don't know why they would even assume any dates at all. They knew what they were dishing out, and they know it is going to take much much longer than that to fix the issues in the game now. \n\nThe main thing that upsets me about the game is that it feels like it's going to need a lot more than just \"bug fixes and polishing\" to make this game GOOD.\nFrom looking at all tech trees and all the content currently in the game, it seems like they have taken the great content from the previous games and either completely changed it or made it worse.\n\nDon't even get me started on the UI. They should have just kept the previous one; maybe they would have been able to work more on things like the fact there IS LITERALLY NOTHING TO PLAY.\n\nHow are you going to state that this is playable, but have literally nothing for users to give feedback on. Want my feedback? Give me some content to give you feedback on. Don't give me nothing and expect something back.\n\nWant some positive feedback? I like the screenshots. The screenshots are nice.\n\nI'm not worried about bugs and polishing, those things are to be expected from any EA game.

I am currently playing this game and doing my best to report bugs and make positive changes to make the game better, as it is incomplete and pretty rough.

I think Golem Labs did a good job in the past, and this title is going in the right direction, but it is too incomplete in my opinion for an acceptable Early access game that most Steam gamers are willing to tolerate.  Most people have demanded refunds.  Only the true fans and faithful are hanging around and showing support.  So the buyer needs to be aware of what they are walking into, and why I am not recommending this title to strangers.\n\nThe good news is that the game is being actively patched and expanded on.  THQ Nordic has this slated for a 2018 release, and that is likely to be pushed back to early Q2.  So there is time to right the ship.\n\nThose of you who loved Guild 2, or are fans of SuperPower 2 and Golemn Labs, you are more than welcome to buy the game and support the dev team out.  The game does not, at the time of this writing, have enough content to complete a dynasty game of your choosing.  Robber class isn't fully implemented, if at all.  Handicrafts and Artisan are about the only reliable career choices.  Many of the menus are place holder, most business management features like trade routes and inventory management do not work / not impletemented.  Economy is not working.  It's a mess.  However, you can play the game and make some things, sell some things, get married, join a government position.  However, character interaction is very limited.  The game feels super empty.  There are no AI that try to abuse power to get rid of you.  No real challenge or point to the game yet.\n\nThe graphics are improved compared to G2, but not by a lot.  Things are almost the same, but look a tad cleaner.  The animations are still rough, or not working right.  So again, this game needs a lot of work.  It is nowhere near ready for release, so be warned.\n\nSo in summary, if you are a fan, buy your copy, help out, make recommendations, let them know what you want.
