While I realize that it is not perfect, I personally find it to be an enjoyable way to spend my time. I will list what I find to be the Pros and Cons below\n\n-----PROS-----\n\n- It isn't pay to win. You buy the game once, you have access to all the features it offers, and never have to buy anything for it again - there isn't even an option to buy anything with real money - you want something in the game, you work for it.\n\n- Friendly Community I realize that there are a few bad apples, but that is true of any online community. The vast majority of players I have found in Naval Action will do there best to help newbies get acquainted with the game.\n\n- Awesome Graphics I realize that this one is subjective, but I think that the Graphics in this game are amazing. They also can be tailored to fit a wide variety of Computers/Graphics cards. I used to play this game on a AMD radeon HD 6570. I turned all the graphics settings down to minimum and got around 20-30 FPS. I have since gotten a newer gaming rig with a Nvidia GTX 1060 3GB, and I can turn almost all setting up to max. The game looks beautiful now, and I still get like 70 FPS.\n\n- Vast Open World. You can sail all the way from the Bermudas to panama if you want - and if you have the time (see cons below) and are free to visit as few or as many ports along the way as you like. In each port, you can trade goods, and buy different ships. You can also establish bases and trading depots in ports. There are no time limits or quests or anything like that, (though you can take on specific missions if you want to get more XP to level up faster). \n\n- Many different types of ships, all with beautifully rendered 3D Ships. Ever dreamed of sailing an Indiaman through the Carribean, (or even a fleet of them) and role-playing a merchant in the late 1700s and early 1800s? what about re-enacting Pirates of the Carribean as a pirate, preying on merchant ships full of loot, and fighting other pirates? now, with this game, you can live out those dreams in a giant open world online game.\n\n-----CONS-----\n\n- Game is still in early access. This means that there are bugs, and some of them are fairly severe when they occur. Most of them can be fixed by rebooting the game though.\n\n- Steep learning curve. This one may actually be a PRO for some people, and a CON for others. If you are the type of person who likes arcade-style ship games (Think World of Warships in this case) this isn't the game for you. On the other hand, if you are a fan of simulation naval games (Think Silent Hunter 3 in this case) you will probably enjoy this game. It is fairly accurate in its physics, decently accurate in its map placement (Though this varies on server population), and very accurate in its ship models. \n\n- Devs that, while friendly and helpful, seem to reset the servers/conduct server wipes more frequently than they probably should. This one is the biggest CON for me. I don't like working to get a nice ship, and a good amount of game money and XP, only to lose it all on a reset. While the devs do provide redeemables to get XP back, and Full-Scale XP and gold wipes are fairly rare, they are still more common than they should be in my opinion, and rather annoying.\n\n- No system in place to protect new players from experienced ones. This one is a problem, and while most of the community is friendly, some ofit is not, and these players team together to steal things from new players who can't adequately fight back. As of now, these players are not punished, and there is no system in place to prevent them from doing the same thing again in the future. Fortunately, these types of players are rare.\n\n- Some in-game nations have a language barrier. Want to sail for Spain? learn spanish first, as many of the spanish players are actually spaniards who speak little to no English. This means that Spain tends to lose out on the game map, since they have fewer players and fewer new players join them, since few of them speak spanish. This same problem also applies to the French Faction. Want to sail for France? You guessed it, learn French first, and many of the French players won't speak English to you even if they are able to.\n\n- No Time compression for long voyages. This one tends to put off a lot of people. The fact that sailing from, say the bermudas to Panama actually would take you days is modeled in this game. While there is a very limited type of time compression (your ships go faster in the open world than they do in battle) it is very limited, and not really adequate. While you can log out after sailing a certain distance, and log back in later and continue your voyage, it is likely to be boring, as for most of that time you will see nothing but water, sky and the occasional seabird.\n\nAll in all though, I like this game, and reccomend it to anyone who likes History, Naval Warfare, or just simulation games in General.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505166478, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505166478, "recommendationid": "34890862", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499426", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504771146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 655, "steamid": "76561198033922758", "num_games_owned": 56}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I dunno i find it too complex UI, getting started getting going. ill have to spend 100 hrs just reviewing videos to figure out the UI.
