I could easily hit 60 fps with decent graphics on a sub par gaming system. \n+ Great controls and shooting \n+ Lots of side missions \n\nThe Average:\n+/- VERY short game, if you don\u2019t care about replays or achievements\n\n+/- The entire game takes place in one large area, making the game feel like a glorified tech demo.\n\n+/- If you don\u2019t know much about Metal Gear Solid then this games backstory can be very overwhelming. Even before you start the game you can listen to a whole bunch of audio files to give you more backstory about the game and everything going on. It feels like watching a tv series half way through and you are trying to figure out all the characters and plot lines and have no idea what\u2019s going on.  \n\nThe Bad:\n- Given the vast amount of graphical and gameplay options it was a bit strange that there was no volume options. \n\nConclusion \nI wouldn\u2019t recommend the game at full price and wait for a sale before purchasing. Fun while it lasts but if you don\u2019t care for replays or achievements you will be left feeling disappointed.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504731444, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504731444, "recommendationid": "34783080", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528823", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440967577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 93, "steamid": "76561198009687529", "num_games_owned": 207}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great start to TPP and got me into metal gear 8/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504799595, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504799595, "recommendationid": "34797047", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512334", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507162504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 291, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 291, "steamid": "76561197983206748", "num_games_owned": 440}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I cant recommend this purchase as [b]you will get it for free[/b] when you buy [i]METAL GEAR SOLID V: The Definitive Experience[/i] for the [b]SAME PRICE[/b].\n\nStealth game wise, its great.
