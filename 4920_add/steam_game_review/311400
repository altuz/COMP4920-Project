The Ai is absolutly horrid, they never crash and look extremely robotic since they move mostly in a straight line,\n\nFlaw 2. For a racing game, this map is pretty small, and is not very realistic.\n\nFlaw 3. Why is there a massive bridge meant for an extra city for a small island? It's extra buffer space for the \"racing\" part of the game.\n\nFlaw 4. I've never seen a more glitchy game in my life\n\nFlaw 5. It is really unoptimized and the minimum requirements need to be much higher\n\nFlaw 6. It couldn't hurt to have a soundtrack to the damn game other than Kevin Macleod?\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n*PROS*\n\nPro 1. Its a free roam and you can choose your own cars\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n*REVIEW*\n\n4/10 - Glitchy, laggy and annoying most of the time, but you can try to pass some time off it.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498246531, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498246531, "recommendationid": "32695139", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521411", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498586981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561198039224313", "num_games_owned": 41}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This game will not run properly.

My mother said to me- \"Don't ever smoke, please don't put your family through what your grandfather put us through.\" I agreed. At 20, I have never toutched a cigarette.
