This truly does its predecessor justice, giving that fantastic risk-reward system and adding so much more to it. There are some aspects of the game that are easy to exploit (using Confusion on the Worm boss makes the fight ever-so easy, especially when I know recharges are around the corner), but even with that, the game provides a good challenge and requires you to put both your platforming skills and rogue-like decision making skills to the test. I especially like the addition of the pacifist system. Normally the choice of \"To fight or not to fight\" comes down to whether or not you can gain more than you lose, but in this case with many fights being winnable without much or any loss, a reward for avoiding the easy massacres is tempting and very worth it. The story itself is also simple but very befitting; so often do games tell of the great hero that overcame evil with the dozens of game-overs in between never even being acknowleged. Knowing that each failed attempt is simply another step in the story makes me even more anxious for the next attempt.\n\nI look forward to seeing what comes out of Nerdook Productions next.

Freeing a hero from their cage doesn't transform your player character into that hero, but instead releases the hero into the game world to fight alongside you as a friendly NPC. Luckily, your player character is no longer the powerless vanilla jump-man from the original either. In a system that, yes, is a lot like Rogue Legacy's, you start each game choosing from a trio of characters generated with different statistics, traits and equipment. You can unlock new character options through achievements and in-game merchants.\n\nMy main complaint about this new system is that the AI heroes can sometimes be quite unhelpful, particularly the paladin breaking blocks you'd rather leave intact and the archer, who lacks mobility-based powers, getting stuck and being unable to contribute to the battle.

At first I was looking at that screen thinking there are three set character classes to choose from. But then I realised that the characters themselve are randomly generated. Yeah you can't pick and choose exactly what you want, but it is still really really cool. With procedural level generation you obviously have variety in the stages which is good. Occasionally randomly generated terrain can seem hard to navigate or get through safely, but it works pretty well overall.\n\nI liked the way the game looked. Some of it's really cute. I like the way you pretty much just wave your sword around like a feather duster when you attack and the happy expression on your characters face when you beat a boss. I liked the spiel before character selection about the prophecy and how every hero thinks that they are the chosen one but most of them die during their adventure. I think that really goes well with a game that has perma-death and where you take control a new hero after each death. The music was really cool. It and the sounds effects brought back memories of older console games like the Super Mario Brothers.\n\nSo yes, I reccommend this game.
