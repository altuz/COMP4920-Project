Big turn-off.  Acually, you can manually go and re-bind your controller buttons onto the inputs on the keyboard through the launcher, takes a few minutes but it is possible.  However, this is not \"full controller support\", I would barely even call it \"partial\" support.\n\nThen when you actually go to rebind your keys you realize there are only 3 buttons: jump, switch fire/ice, and slide.  You hardly even need a controller since you can't even move your character freely.  That's not a huge issue, though, the game was designed in a certain way that does not require movement.  You just walk along with the world.  Does the world ever speed up?  It seems so slow it's boring.  More like the \"walk\" of your life.  Sure you need time to think about what to do, and slower = easier, and it probably gets faster and/or more difficult later on, but initially it comes across as pretty lame.  Imagine Super Mario Bros except you have someone else holding down the button to walk and it is your job to jump.  I would much rather have the ability to RUN, like actually FAST, but the screen moved at a minimum pace, and was rewarded for running faster than the game wanted to go.  Having very little control over what is going on is a turn-off, definitely.  It becomes a game of rock-paper-scissors very quickly.\n\nSometimes, though you can get a really really bad game and it is still enjoyable if the leaderboard is up to par.  This way you can show off your achievements of torture.  Does this game have a good leaderboard?  NO!  It barely has one.  What I would have liked to see is this:\n\n- see your rank globally\n- see your rank among your friends\n- browse through all the users' scores freely\n\nInstead, we are given a list of the top 10 scores in the world.  If you are not in the top 10, you don't appear ANYWHERE.  Oh, and those scores are super high already, on the first day, so basically forget they even exist (and since this is a simple game, expect them to be hacked pretty quick).  \n\nSo the leaderboards are basically non-existant, the gameplay sucks, the controller support is a lie, did I miss anything?  I'm not even going to go over the empty steam repository issue yesterday, mistakes happen.  Is the game worth $2?  Hm.  Sort of.  If it were a bit more polished maybe.  Give it a few months for the developer to fix all of these problems.

Very fun and easy to pickup. However, whilst progressing at higher speeds I've noticed that some patterns of the multipliers just make it literally impossible to get all of them, thus losing your whole multiplier (you will only be affected by this if you're pushing for top 3).\n\nIf anyone who made this game sees this I'd be happy to record some gameplay and point out which patterns I think need to be changed OR you could maybe make missing one multiplier more forgiving, for example, instead of losing the whole multiplier, just cut the multiplier in half from say 50 to 25 instead of just straight to 0.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424138023, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424138121, "recommendationid": "14508294", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504720", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439211069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 13, "steamid": "76561198160570311", "num_games_owned": 152}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's really dull.

Yesterday it wouldn\u2019t even download because of a dev issue, they forgot to put the file in. It said download complete but it didn\u2019t have anything to download. Now that I've played it it has unresponsive controls, it also clams to have  full controller support it doesn\u2019t. Sometimes you randomly switch back to fire for no reason and the hit boxes are just messed up. It's NOT early accesses, if it is they should say that and not put it up till they spent a lot more time on it.  There are better free flash versions on those bad gaming sites that they pass off for little kids. I love the idea of switching back and forth between player types, in fact  I made a game that you do just that when I was about 15 for a class. I did it the night before it was due took two hours with the free version of Game Maker. The art work is just the same block over and over again. And the sound it's just not that good.

Nice visual presentation with a very catchy song. Controls could be tighter and it would have been nice to have controller mapping. The basic fire and ice swap mechanic works well. The only major downside is some of the pickups are poorly placed making it very easy to lose your combo multiplier without feeling like you could have prevented it. For score chasers this is a pain. The leaderboards with friends option is a nice addition. Overall its a good, simple breaktime game worth a few bucks.
