However, this is definitely not a game to overlook in the Assassin's Creed franchise. AC Rogue takes place during the Seven Years' War and acts as a sequel to Black Flag, as well as a prequel to AC 3. \n\nThe basic story is that Shay Cormac sees first hand how dangerous the American Brotherhood is and fears they're destroying the world they wish to save. Shay is then betrayed by the Brotherhood and finds friends in the Templars. Together, they attempt to tear down the American Brotherhood before it's too late. The overall story is absolutely amazing! This is definitely one of the best things going for Rogue. The story is unique and not really one we've gotten in any other AC game. It provides perspective on the franchise. Personally, I think this is the best story we've gotten since the Ezio trilogy. \n\nOne thing that fans were upset with when this was announced was that this game is only 6 sequences long (with an epilogue). I don't really consider this a negative aspect though. Sure, it's the shortest AC game (besides Chronicles, but who cares about those?). A story doesn't have to be long to be good, it just has to cover everything it needs to cover and not throw in useless stuff just to add length. Rogue does this well. \n\nA story is nothing without its characters, and this game has a great cast. For starters, the main character, Shay, is a great character. His struggle and story are fantastic and very entertaining. The other characters joining him are all pretty darn good, and you get to see familiar faces from Black Flag and AC 3, along with new faces. None of the characters seemed out of place and they all were well-voiced. \n\nIn terms of game mechanics, there's nothing really new. The game's naval combat is pretty much exactly like Black Flag, but this isn't a problem since Black Flag had some amazing naval combat. Your ship, the Morrigan, is a lot more maneuverable that the Jack Daw and it has 'puck guns', but other than that, there's not much of a difference. You can fire canon balls at ships to either sink them or incapacitate them. Once you stop them in their tracks, you can board the ship, take out some fools, and decide what to do with the ship. You can either repair the Morrigan, salvage the ship, or remove your wanted level. The wanted level is determined by how many ships you sink. If you sink enough, a bounty hunter ship will come after you. These are usually about the same level your ship is and are easy to take down. Ships with higher levels than you are, of course, harder to take down. You can also upgrade your ship with loot collected from, well, looting. \n\nBesides bashing up boats, you can also stab some soldiers. The combat is pretty much Black Flag's combat. You can counter hits, shoot people with pistols/a rifle, stab people with swords/daggers/the hidden blades, and so one. One new addition to the weapons however is the air rifle. Despite it being a reskin of the blow dart gun in AC 4, it's pretty cool! You can put guards to sleep or make them go berserk. Later in the game, you get a grenade launcher added onto it, which is fantastic. Guards are also nothing really new. You have your standard soldiers, snipers, swordsmen, and the big brute guys. Basically the same line-up from AC 4 and AC 3. The game isn't really challenging, but then again, most AC games aren't. (Sure, there are more difficult parts here and there, but it's nothing some grinding won't cure)\n\nSince this is an open world game, you can travel to numerous ports, attack forts, and explore. The map is pretty darn large and there are numerous places to explore (including Sleepy Hallow!). The game looks pretty great and ran very smoothly. The graphics aren't next gen like Unity, but they get the job done. The soundtrack is also great, but the main theme is basically Ezio's Family. \n\nOverall, there are those who don't like the fact that this game doesn't do much of anything new with gameplay mechanics, or like that the game is about 10 hours long. Look past this and just enjoy the story and the characters. I definitely recommend this game! Check out the previous ones first, but this one is definitely one of the best AC games we've gotten since Revelations.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505613437, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505613437, "recommendationid": "35011726", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631029", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506489281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 124, "num_reviews": 194, "playtime_forever": 124, "steamid": "76561198012934956", "num_games_owned": 503}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's basically Black Flag, but much better optimized & not as good graphically.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506460776, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506460776, "recommendationid": "35230542", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530655", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506747334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1102, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1102, "steamid": "76561198027780996", "num_games_owned": 24}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A damn good Assasins Creed game but an even better 17th century naval combat simulator.

Worth picking up if you enjoyed Black Flag and fancy some more\n\nI feel Rogue was a bit overlooked given it was released around the same time as Unity. Like Black Flag, Rogue carries on with the pirate theme this time taking the setting to the New York area and North Atlantic. As I enjoyed all the pirate related stuff from BF I really enjoyed more of it which Rogue has plenty of. It also improves a bit on BF with new weapons such as the really useful dart gun and less annoying missions like the eavesdropping ones from BF. \n\nThe story is also pretty good with the main character Shay, who starts off as an Assassin, turning his back on the Order and joining the Templars. Its actually quite refreshing to get the Templars perspective and the game is better for that.\n\nOnly downsides is some of the voice acting. Shay is supposed to have an Irish accent but what we get is an \"Oirish\" accent on par with Tom Cruises effort in Far and Away. It's brutal. Another character seems to go between Scottish and Russian. It's hard to take the story seriously at times when you have this unintended comedy.\n\nBut that aside Rogue is a great entry to the series and it didnt get as much attention as it deserved.If you enjoyed Black Flag then Rogue is well worth a try.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506027519, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506027519, "recommendationid": "35113825", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505167", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506974059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 682, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 682, "steamid": "76561198058485174", "num_games_owned": 135}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great AC game, combat is clunky as always.
