Like that game, you end up in Fairbrook to... learn responsibility. This time, though, you are pursuing the boys. Trent, Jacob, and Steve return from the previous game (which I guess assumes Steve didn't win any of the girl's hearts), and a new guy, Ryan shows up (more or less to be the voice of reason in the game). Some of the features of the prior game have also been streamlined.\n\nThere are nine endings. One for ending up alone, and two for each hero. A normal ending and a special ending. The only difference between the two is that one you have $400 in your wallet at the end of the game for the specials.\n\nIt is a nice game for those who like the type (Winter Wolves doesn't disappoint).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492822856, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492822856, "recommendationid": "31286333", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513889", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "total_reviews": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
