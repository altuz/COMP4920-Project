You will have several runs terminate on one floor\nbefore you finally, satisfyingly, break through to the next.\n\n\nCons:\n- Variety of bosses, enemies, and rooms is somewhat lacking\n- Many of the unlocks are gated so far down the line and take so much time to unlock (hunting quests) that many players will never see them\n- One poor balancing decision: Boss Armor\n          Bosses can only take a certain amount of damage per second, meaning uber-powerful low ammo guns which seem to be meant for bosses are less effective, as each shot may cap its damage under potential. While the game is very well balanced, the one in 100 run where you should be steamrolling is kept somewhat out of reach.\n\n\nUltimately, Enter The Gungeon is the best rougelike I have ever played, and had me squeezing in a couple of the 15 minute to 1 hour runs in after class last semester. The bits of story and personality in the game are very entertaining and the moment to moment gameplay is enormously satisfying. High level players will learn how to manage their resources, know what risks to take with chests, and know boss patterns like the back of their hand. If you enjoy the gamefeel of spelunky, the variety of Binding of Issac, and fresh, lighthearted personality that celebrates video games, EtG is for you.\n\nDodgeroll is about to release a new update which will likely keep me playing another 60 hours. Pick it up while you can.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504833243, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504833243, "recommendationid": "34805730", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532519", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506959315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 369, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1712, "steamid": "76561198078784788", "num_games_owned": 303}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "3", "review": "God, this game is [i]fun[/i].\n\n[b][i]Enter the Gungeon[/i][/b] has unlocked the precious secret that makes games undying classics: when stripped down of all extraneous details and frills, the core gameplay that lies at the heart is goddamn GENIUS. The most basic element of the game, the simple acts of dodging bullets and shooting enemies, is a source of pure joy that never changes. It doesn't matter if you're fighting against the last boss or against the lowliest of grunts. It doesn't matter if you're using an all-powerful god-tier weapon or a piddly crappy little pea-shooter. It's always fun, it's always challenging, and it's always engaging. The game is built on a rock solid foundation, and it only gets better from here.\n\nOf course the game doesn't just rest on its laurels and call it a day. There are a dozen little elements that elevate this higher than a standard bullet hell smup, and encourage smart strategic play. The two new gameplay designs that makes this game a bit different are these: you can press a button to literally do a dodge roll, and you can flip tables to use them as cover. Combined with the traps scattered among the rooms, and the clever enemies that can actually use all those things against you, it all results in adrenaline-fuled fights that you can't just go blindly in and except to win. There are also a few mechanics that just make life easier, like the fact that money flies toward you when you finish a room, that guns gradually reload when they're switched out, and how you can easily teleport to various rooms including the shop and boss chamber. The whole experience is streamlined to make things as convenient as possible for you.\n\nAnd yeah, you're gonna die. A lot. And I mean a LOT. Like seriously, I'm not kidding, you're gonna be looking at that death screen a whole lot of times so you'd better get used to that. But you know what? That's fair. You were too slow, or too careless, or you just couldn't keep your cool what with all those bullets flying at you. In the end you KNOW it's  your own damn mistake you died, and that makes it easier to swallow. [b][i]Enter the Gungeon[/i][/b] may be unforgiving, but it's never ever unfair. And it allows for some very concrete and very rewarding growth of player skill. Every hour you spend playing makes you tangibly better, till you can flawlessly defeat the first boss that gave so much trouble early on with just your starter pistol.\n\nThe game also has vast amounts of content. All roguelikes offer technically infinite playtime thanks to the procedural generation of the levels, but [b][i]Enter the Gungeon[/i][/b] also has [i]goals[/i]. It's not enough to complete a run. You can complete a run with all four characters, and then you can do it AGAIN after unlocking a special item, which can only happen if you bring certain items to a certain character, which will take more than one run to accomplish, oh and did I mention all the characters you can unlock? There are NPCs that sell you extra things whether it's before or during your run, NPCs that offer challenges and their consequent rewards, secret NPCs that unlock other secrets that lead to playable characters.... There are so many secrets you can encounter and explore, from mini-bosses to shortcuts to whole new areas, that it absolutely guarantess you're going to be spending a lot of time with this game. \n\nAnd it also adds more satisfaction to your early playthroughs. Sure, getting to the last boss is a far-away dream that maybe you'll accomplish someday in the future, but hey if you're lucky you can find a nifty new character on the floor you are right now. Yeah, not being able to progress past the second floor is frustrating, but you've beaten the first boss enough times to unlock extra weapons for your arsenal with all those credits you slowly earned. There's a feeling of genuine progression, which is really encouraging.\n\nAll this would have been enough to make [b][i]Enter the Gungeon[/i][/b] memorable, but the cherry on top of the delicious sundae is the game's charm and personality. The story mixes cool concepts (You're after a gun that can kill the past! How awesome is that?) with really ridiculous ones (A giant bullet hit the castle and turned everyting into bullets. Just roll with it.) and somehow makes it all work. I often found myself smiling when reading item/enemy descriptions, and the cute pixel art made the quirky characters even more entertaining. Simply put, it's all very charming and endearing.\n\nThe last thing I want to touch upon is the guns. So, this isn't a kind of game a la borderlands, with millions of weapons ranging from great to utter crap. Instead there's a (relatively) smaller pool with better quality available. All guns can be useful, even the jokey gag ones, and some have surprising effects or synergies with other items. You'll usually only encounter one or two guns on each floor, and you're encouraged to save the big hitters for the bosses, but honestly you have enough freedom to follow any strategy you want. Remember, while RNG and luck can definitely make your life easier, they're not actually neccessary for beating the game. It's all skill based.\n\nTo sum up, the game is incredibly fun and perfect for its genre. If you like roguelikes and/or bullet hell smups even a little bit then stop what you're doing right now and go buy [b][i]Enter the Gungeon[/i][/b].

It looks, feels, and sounds good. This game have II polish.\n\nThe gameplay is like every other roguelike: go from room to room, and shoot things. Do this for 5 floors, and win. Very standard to the formula. But it does this so incredibly well. Sure it doesn't do much of anything that's really innovating, but what it does makes it rank up with the greatest roguelikes, such as Isaac, Nuclear Throne, FTL, and Necrodancer. It doesn't exactly take the top spot, but it sits perfectly up there with the games that pioneered ideas. For a roguelike that doesn't do anything super new, it's impressive that it can take that spot.\n\nThe slow pace can either kill your interest, or keep your interest. You thought Isaac was slow? This is slower. The floors are huge, most enemies take 3+ hits to kill, and a completed run takes an average of an hour long. If you came to this from Nuclear Throne like I did, this is a glaring issue. BUT I do think Isaac players will feel right at home here. I eventually got used to the pacing, and actually enjoy it now. Not every roguelike needs to go the speed of sonic the hedgehog, and this game proves that.\n\nThe balancing \"issue\" is all based on what you think of it. The key drops are rare, the ammo drops are rarer, and you could be starving for materials if you aren't careful. IN MY OPINION, this issue isn't an issue at all. It makes you think before you make a choice, instead of just buying and unlocking everything in sight. Many people will have a problem with this, but that may be your fault if you aren't using your resources wisely.\n\nThe last topic is the difficulty. This game is DIFFICULT. It does NOT play nice, so if you expect to steamroll through this bad boy, you are going to have your dreams crushed in your first few runs. DO NOT purchase this expecting something easy, Gungeon is up there as one of the more/most difficult in the genre. All I can ask is, know what you're getting into before you play.\n\nI give Enter the Gungeon a solid 9/10.
