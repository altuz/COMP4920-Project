While at first I had to get used to the feel of the 3D graphics (especially after that abysmal Escape from Monkey Island game) and the mechanics of Telltale Games' gameplay for a Monkey Island game, I started enjoying the game the further I went and was eager to get on to the next episode. The puzzles in the game are great, which really makes me wish Telltale Games would go back to this style of gameplay compared to the choice driven gameplay for their current games, which honestly are starting to become quite dull. The story is pretty good and the new characters that introduced to the Monkey Island universe are just as fun and favorable as the old characters. There is a hint that a second season was supposed to come into play, but I'm guessing when Telltale Games went to work on other games and started going with their choice driven stories, they put this one on the shelves, which is a shame because I would've loved to play through a second season and continue the adventures of Guybrush Threepwood. Well, maybe when they tire out on The Walking Dead and Minecraft, they'll hopefully come back to this hidden gem.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/eP88w1fNPz8"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499430197, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502841", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33341175", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198142054178", "num_reviews": 63, "last_played": 1499096432, "num_games_owned": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 394}, "timestamp_updated": 1499430197, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I always forget how much I like this game in comparison to other Telltale games. \n\nEpisode 1 is a nice introduction to the season.\nEpisode 2 is my favourite episode, because we get to meet Morgan LeFlay.\nEpisode 3 is pretty decent. I like the Brotherhood, but the manatee mating ritual puzzle can be a little tricky (why won't she love me?!).\nEpisode 4 is a little \"meh\". I enjoyed the court section and that thing that happens to Morgan (the sound design is really good in that section). On the other hand, the sponge feeding quest was confusing and needlessly fetchquesty: it didn't seem like the plot was advancing anymore. I also did not like the final scene - I like the idea of it and what it leads to, but the way in which the plot twist is presented feels lazy and uninspired.\nEpisode 5 has an interesting location and I also really like LeChuck's viciousness in this episode. However, the final battle is really annoying. I wasn't very satisfied with the resolution to this game, it felt a bit anti-climactic. (They were probably also hoping to make a second season.)\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty decent season. The puzzles aren't as hard or roundabout as in the original, which is a good thing in my opinion, and the story is kinda nice. What I like best about this game are the characters, especially Guybrush, Elaine and Morgan, as well as the Ghost Pirate LeChuck in the final episode. The dialogue is top-notch.\n\nI also recently played The Secret of Monkey Island for the first time and noticed a lot of references from that game had been woven into the plot of Tales of Monkey Island in an unobtrusive way.

I played the original as a kid back in the early 90's, and every game since. This latest game really stands up well as a great addition. I thoroughly enjoyed it - great puzzles, great story and there's a great depth to the characters. One feels engaged with them and invested in what happens to them. The dialogue and voice acting is superb - I enjoyed every moment of the performances. The puzzles are well thought-out and make a lot of sense. The way they are designed and the manner in which they get you to mentally connect the different aspects it quite satisfying.  Great job folks! Please make another one!!"}]}
