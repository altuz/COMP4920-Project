Too short; the itemization is shallow and not interesting. The town meta-game is wholly unimportant to an otherwise un-inspired rogue-lite.  The strategy is lacking and every dungeon feels about the same. There is no reason to change weapons or armor other than to see a different animation.\n\nDefinitely worth $3. Not at all worth $15.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505351825, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505351825, "recommendationid": "34940098", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518344", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 106, "total_reviews": 130, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 24}}
