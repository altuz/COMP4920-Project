It plays great, i like the fighting style, and that it's not obscenely flashy like some fighting games. The only real downside is the way dlc costumes are priced in groups. i'm not paying 35 dollars for a group of costumes i don't want, just for the 1 or 2 that i do want. But in the end, the core game has enough nice costumes that this really doesn't take away from the game itself.
