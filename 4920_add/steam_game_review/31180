The game has been banned in Afghanistan but able to download and play if we set settings to Pakistan.\n\nGame puzzles are not too difficult once you visit all areas.  Humour is good in places.  I not sure if mermaid or merman but after using googlings I find that they are voiced by Caitlyn Jenner.  I still not sure if mermaid or merman.\n\nTry not to play game in company of Alpha Dog big brother or old fashioned Auntie.  They stone you for this game."}]}
