Circuit is exactly that, Srint is A to B and Coin Race has you searching the map for randomly sporning coins. At the end od each race you win money that can be used to unlock other tracks or can be saved up to by coins.\n\nCoins are used to unlock other RC Cars or mod them by changing the colour or wheels or the arial. Getting coins can be either fun or a grind depending on your point of view as it takes quite a while to aquire them.\n\nThe graphics are basic but suitable for this budget racer. The only fault I noticed was occasionally the wheels clipping through the floor. One other perculiarity I noticed is that the wheels are not actually attached to the vehicle. While this in no way spoils the game, it just look strange when the cars flip over.\n\nControl is by either keyboard or game pad. Controls are not changable so your stuck with what is. I use the gamepad and steering, accerate and brake are all on the left thumbstick. Dual thumbsticks would have been much better, or at least the option of.\nThe gamepad only controls the cars though, not the menu. So mouse clicking is also a must.\n\nThe cars themselves sound and handle like toy electric rc cars from the local toyshop. So don't expect any Pro racing here. Weapons are also included, Missles, mines and a speed boost.\n\nThis game is a fun single player ( no multiplayer ) rc racer with weapons. Its a budget game but does what it does pretty well. As long as you don't expect to much from it its worth the asking price.\n\nGood, well done.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437170590, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437170590, "recommendationid": "17098337", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513596", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437164647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 148, "steamid": "76561198107886496", "num_games_owned": 132}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "-This is a cute game.\nGreat for a five dollar price tag, but lacks multiplayer.  \n\nAfter a few minutes I found myself yerning for some split screen or LAN action.\n\nThe IGC is okay, but Coins should be easier to get without waisting time in a specific mode. \nthey should be rewarded after the completion of a race.\nMoney is useless until you get 250k then you can turn it into 5 coins, which is reasonable since money is easy to get.\n\n\nOver all this game is good at what it does. \nIt just needs multiplayer and more maps.\nI suggest opening it to the workshop if you dont feel like making more maps.\n\nIf you are bored and want something to pass time, this is a decent cheap game to do that on.\nBUT\nIf you are looking for an in depth RC racing simulator with tons of maps, this isnt for you. however there are quite a few vehichles so yay to that.\n\n\nOpen this bad boy to the work shop.\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437160022, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437160022, "recommendationid": "17096035", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502199", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444009860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 202, "steamid": "76561198152612867", "num_games_owned": 25}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Hilarious fun.
