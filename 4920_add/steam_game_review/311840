However it is much less customizable than Zoo Tycoon, which is disappointing. You can't decide on what colors or theme you want your park to have, or how really how you want the exhibits to look. Everything is pretty much dictated for you, there is not a lot of customization. It is also not very user friendly. It is hard to tell exactly what the animals and customers need to be happy, and I have trouble knowing where everything is without labels. Additionally, I cannot run this game except on the lowest graphics setting, which makes it much less enjoyable. The baby penguins look like walking, uncooked chicken nuggets. Overall I would not recommend this game. It's a waste of money in my opinion.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494133300, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494133300, "recommendationid": "31596302", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505150", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 11}}
