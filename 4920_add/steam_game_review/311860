By the time you reach endgame locations with beefcake enemies you will find out that you are severely outlevelled. Like LVL50 instead of 70+. Then you find out that enemies here and 10 locations (and 20 levels) before give pretty much the same amount of XP, same low amount of it. Then you find out \u2014 in a guide \u2014  that you were supposed to revisit some locations to get a special type of character for an otherwise empty  fourth slot, and now you have to level that character as well. Useful equipment is almost nonexistent, which doesn't help.\nI can see a lot of work that devs put in the game, yet it's not enough to keep struggling with a playthrough.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501535888, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501535888, "recommendationid": "33936201", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "total_reviews": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
