So I will make my comparison based on that.\n\nFor the most part, the stick controls are correct. It does feel like a real excavator. So all my skills and nuances translated perfectly into this simulation, albeit a few changes. The controls for the tracks, however, don't feel right because of the right shoulder used as a modifier. It just feels weird pressing that then the sticks. \n\nThe digging aspect seems nominal at most. You don't see every grain of sand going into the bucket due to game engine limitations so its mostly graphically and mathematically simplified. What it doesn't do is (1) sloping, (2) bucket grading, and (3) platforming.\n\nSloping is important because you need to have certain trenches at a certain angle of repose; an angular ratio between its verticality and its horizontalness. Most common sands are good with 1:1 ratios, wetter stuff could be like 3:2 and it matters greatly because of the chances of a trench collapse. The game doesn't do sloping very well, nor does the sand contour with the bucket at all, so you are left with pregenerated, precalculated sloping angles that it thinks sand can do.\n\nThe bucket can't grade those slopes either. All the bucket does, on its back side, is bump into the sand (even with just a tiny windrow) or bounce off it. Even the bulldozer got stuck on a simple windrow. Not very realistic... which is fine, but I prefer the ability to manipulate sand to my needs.\n\nPlatforms are one such need. Most times, ground isn't always level. In gravel pits, you dig and dig and dig until all the sand around the machine is gone. And each time you grab a full bucket, you already chancing to tip over unless you have a stable foundation to dig from. Even then, depending on your counter weight, you might tip if you grab wet stuff when fully extended and perpendicular to the tracks. \n\nSometimes you gotta fix your foundation or slope yourself up it before grabbing. And when you're done, you gotta get off the foundation (which is probably a platform by then) which is no safe feat. Sometimes you gotta make a platform to get up on to grab the fill. The game doesn't let you spear into the sand to pull the machine, nor does it let you push the machine up or down the hill. Nor does the angle of the machine's tilt matters, you dig without worry of tipping.\n\nThe camera controls are wonky and it's weird operating from third person. I don't know whose idea it was to have the horizontal controls of the camera to spring. That was just an idiotic design decision. You need the camera to follow the bucket or look where you need to without these interferences.\n\nThe other machines (loader, truck, and dozer), kind of follow the flaws of the excavator too. The dozer can seriously do without the right shoulder modifier being pressed. I also noticed that there's no vertical tilt or horizontal angling on the blade. It's just a raise and lower dozer blade. (Might be a feature exclusive to D4 Cat dozers though). This makes the final grade an annoying task not because of the top level, but the sloping can't be done very well or at all. \n\nAnd as I said previously, it stops dead on a simple windrow. In the real world, even a small D4 bulldozer can cut through gravel like its butter. Here, the game doesn't do that. \n\nNo real comments about the front end loader or the truck. Ultimately, I think the game is only fine as a simplistic digger only game. It does not have the additional nuances I wished it did have. I recommend it only as a taste of heavy equipment but nothing more serious than that.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492870712, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492870712, "recommendationid": "31297857", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533410", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 29, "total_reviews": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 18}}
