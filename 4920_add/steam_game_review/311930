It's really responsive and the visuals are cool. It feels good to get better and better at manipulating the games physics.

I played the VR version for a straight hour before I had to get off and review it on Steam. Many VR players are looking for polished content and Tinertia delivers. \n\nIt is like a mix of Rayman Origins and Super Meat Boy. It is incredibly fast paced and the artstyle looks amazing in VR. It has a great soundtrack and the game has a great atmosphere all around. This game isn't a push over and the difficulty ramps up nicely. \n\nI didn't notice any slowdown or issues in VR. This is an incredibly polished experience and I highly recommend the game! If you enjoy traditional platformers, then this is a must buy for VR!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498620854, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498620854, "recommendationid": "32908445", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504288", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "total_reviews": 39, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
