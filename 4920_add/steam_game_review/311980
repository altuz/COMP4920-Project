The overall premise can be summed as reverse Xcom, you play as an alien force stumbling upon an already habited planet yet seeking to colonize never the less. Starting off with your humble dropship and ten workers, it is your job to survive and thrive in an hostile world. Overall in its inital steam release status, I'd say that Isomer is a very promising game. Currently I feel as though the foundations for a great base building and exploration are present though the content may be too barebones for some. So far I've noticed four diffrent unit classes, a wide array of generated structures for the player to explore and various different building blocks for the player to use. However the selection of middle and late game structures don't seem to be implemented. For example you can build your base to the extent of its layout with lights and lifts to different floors, but there are no doors present in the game nor any sizeable modules and things to fill up these rooms apart from soils to contain reasources. \nCheck out my Let's Play below!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7VcA1f11R8", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405116980, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1405140784, "recommendationid": "11189956", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549421", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1406461378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561198009843797", "num_games_owned": 367}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Still no updates and in May now....
