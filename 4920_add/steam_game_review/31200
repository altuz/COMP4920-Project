As with that game, I will say that this is a very linear game, unlike their later attempts. If you're expecting the same choices and branches, you will be disappointed.\n\nTales of Monkey Island is... different from the older Monkey Island games, holding a very strange position in the franchise. This is, I suspect, the first game that wasn't made by LucasArts. Many of the people from the original games are involved, but there is a strangeness about the game that wasn't in the others.\n\nThe graphics aren't bad. If you've seen any other TellTale games, you'll know what they're like. The art direction is reminiscent of Curse of Monkey Island which is no bad thing. Voice acting is top-notch as always, with Alexandra Boyd, Earl Boen and Dominic Armato doing splendid work as Elaine, LeChuck and Guybrush. Music isn't bad, with some eerie voodoo music tied in with the usual Monkey Island themes.\n\nTales of Monkey Island, however, seems to rely very much on shock value, going to places where none of the previous games had gone to. The humour is still there, as are the quips and the fun puzzles. But it's darker, particularly the final episode, and while it did its job in shocking me when I first played the game, it's a bit jarring now that I know it's coming (and I'm in a position to compare it with Curse of Monkey Island).\n\nTales of Monkey Island is significantly better that the Remastered versions of the first two games (which I returned because of how uncanny valley I found the graphics), but not as good as Curse of Monkey Island. I'd rate it at about the same level as Escape from Monkey Island, which I rather enjoyed, but found a bit frustrating because of the inventory controls.\n\nThere's a pretty blatant sequel hook at the end, I wonder if anything will ever come of it. I have yet to see TellTale bring out a second season of any property."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492365412, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492611", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "31183519", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197974299727", "num_reviews": 56, "last_played": 1488496423, "num_games_owned": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 267}, "timestamp_updated": 1492365412, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Episode is early draft from The People v.
