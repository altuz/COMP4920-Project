So this game was a real treat. You get to murder millions of birds in a quest to avenge your brutally murded pa at the hands of the devil birds.\nGOTTA KILL EM ALL!\n\nMiniguns, shotguns, rifles, pistols, whatever it takes, KILL THEM ALL!!\nAnd collect the gold coins some of them drop so you can buy better guns.\n\nA short game, but very enjoyable and hilarious redneck humor. One of those games you pickup for a buck on sale someday to have a fun evening of laughs.

The gameplay is also far too repetitive and the mid to late game boils down to simply holding the left mouse button down and aiming wildly due to overpowered weaponry. Bird Assassin isn't really a funny game per say but it certainly isn't serious, you spend the 30 mins to an hour the game offers colecting different species of bird you've shot in order to deliver to and feed your family. Not a bad premise for a simple game but nothing gameplay wise really changes level to level and the only sort of progression is your gun unlocks which are all cheap and relatively easy to aquire. The game also has a heavy focus on platforming to the point where the majority of my deaths were due to not noticing something barely next to me on the floor which didn't feel very rewarding when I had to restart the level. Shoehorned bonus levels and no other mechanic besides shooting, jumping and healing make this game far simpler than it needed to be. The music is basically non-existent and the cries of dying birds and endless gun discharges gets annoying as hell even if it is for just a half hour. The game is definitely worth the asking price of $2 since it falls in to the category of a short mobile title or something along those lines, but in my opinion it's just not worth the time as I think you can find something less repetitive and of more substance even in this price range.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497756623, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497756952, "recommendationid": "32525438", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498160", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 143, "total_reviews": 158, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 15}}
