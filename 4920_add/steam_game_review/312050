Playing this was frustrating. There are a lot of puzzles which, even using the hint system and looking up a solution... I don't get the logic. The controls are frustrating on keyboard and mouse, as you get to try and click/drag to gesture in directions to make things happen... and the detection for what you are doing is spotty. It only does cardinal directions and there's no control customization. It's point & click & pray.\n\nThe first game has a better mystery, although a bit QTE heavy. It's a bit weird to have a lot of the CSI elements handwaved away by a magic computer analyzer, but then have the \"whodunnit\" boil down to filling out the paperwork in detail in the form of multiple choice quizzes. And recreating awful sketches of individuals... without hints. Even referencing a picture on a wakthrough, I botched 1. That's... not good.\n\nAnd it ends with a bit of a cliffhanger, of course. And the studio is utterly defunct. I've had better times with hidden-object games. It's currently on sale for $2. If you're hard up for a night or two of frustrating control and math-heavy moon logic... I would not recommend paying more than that.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487282738, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487282738, "recommendationid": "29971850", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509054", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1455910618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1275, "steamid": "76561198034252997", "num_games_owned": 1021}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Cool noir atmosphere, music, world remind me of The Longest Journey. Awesome characters, voice acting is one of the best in video games. Red Johnson is so hot! QTEs are horribly implemented: you must use your mouse to perform various movements and that don't work most of the times.\nGameplay is very repetitive and puzzles are too difficult. I hope if the third part will be released then it will be more close to classic adventure than to collection of fucking hard puzzles which make me insane.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456001690, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456002226, "recommendationid": "21349070", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504322", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1410185166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198012384185", "num_games_owned": 609}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Got 10 minutes into the game and coudlnt continue, really annoyed that i paid for this. \n\nThere are no options to change graphics settings your stuck with what they give you, you cant rebind the keys and the game seems to have alot of quick time events.
