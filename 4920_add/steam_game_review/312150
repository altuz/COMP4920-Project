This review is based on only two games that I've played in, so people who have played Wild Warfare for a lot longer than I have will probably be able to form a better review than the one you're reading right now.\n\nThis review has been slightly edited in regards to the game now being free to play but many of the issues still stand currently.\n\nI've found Wild Warfare heavily reminding me of arena-shooters such as Unreal tournament, and that in itself brings back many happy memories, memories that I hope to make in Wild Warfare. Unfortunately there are a few issues in the current version of this game that prevent me from outright recommending it to anyone, and I hope these issues get fixed soon (or at the very least tweaked to be a little more bearable then they are now).\n\nStarting with some of the pros I found in my short playthrough:\n\nMap selection in Wild Warfare is small, but the maps do feel nice and and are well-designed (for the most part, there is one exception with the current CTF map with jump-pads at the back of each base, which makes for relatively quick captures and seems to be very infuriating to players, going off by what I see in their discussion board). The maps aren't too large as to make finding other players impossible and there are several jump-pads around the maps, which speeds up travelling around these maps significantly, so you shouldn't be without someone to shoot at for long in a game.\n\nThe music in the game sounds nice, the artwork in the game is cute and inviting. Not much more to say here (mostly because I know next to nothing about music and art).\n\nOne of the things I especially liked was the fact that when you level up, you can get keys to open crates, which makes a huge difference (to me, anyway). I really hope this stays, as it offers some customization options for free to play players, which this game is supposedly going to be, though I don't see the option for free to play on steam yet (Though it seems you can play a browser-based version for free at Hyperhippo.ca).\n\nOne thing to note to parents looking at this game: Yes, there is no blood and gore or foul language, so if for some reason you want to introduce a young one to shooters, then you probably want to pick this up. Bear in mind though that this isn't accounting for any foul words that may come from strangers online.\n\nHas a decent variety of game modes with another on the way it seems.\n\nSeems to perform well on computers that have low specs (I have one terrible rig, so finding games that run on it is a blessing).\n\nOnto some cons I found while playing:\n\nWhat you see is what you get on your class. There are currently three classes in the game, and each has a different weapon; The engineer has a wrench, the heavy has a minigun, and the striker has a burst assault rifle. That's it. That's all they got. Weapon selection is not very big at this moment in time, though it does make it relatively simple to easily glance at a furry critter's hands (paws, for those that want to get technical with it) and look at the only weapon they have.\n\nBullet speed is slow, which slows down the pace of the game quite a bit for the firearms at anything beyond 'medium-range', which may not be a particularly bad thing as it encourages you to get closer to land shots easier, but a slight increase in bullet speed would be welcome.\n\nThere's no way to crouch in the game, which I didn't find as too big a deal since weapons don't have any recoil at all, but it's something to be noted.\n\nYou can't make your own servers at this time.\n\nThere are exploitable bugs and glitches that can seriously break the flow of a game (there appears to be an auto-firing bug, which happened quite a bit for me), which I hope are fixed soon.\n\nServers aren't the best, you'll see players floating in the sky and you can get hit by the engineer's wrench when they're a few feet away and nowhere near melee range. You won't have to worry about the servers, however, unless you can find a game with people. Not many people are currently online at a time, so it'll take awhile for you to find a server with people playing on it sometimes. However, with the game now being free to play, I expect a few servers with people in them, so perhaps the game population will increase in due time.\n\nClasses aren't balanced at this time, with the heavy being underpowered, the striker being balanced, and the engineer being overpowered (at least, when it came to CTF, unsure of how the engineer performs in the other modes).\n\nWhile not a con, something I'd like to bring up is competition from other games. When reading about the game it sounds quite a bit like Team Fortress two, doesn't it? It even has hats. Yes, I'm aware Team Fortress two doesn't have vehicles but otherwise it seems like it'll be very much the same. Wild Warfare also references Team Fortress two through an achievement, so it's safe to say that they are at least aware of Team fortress two (then again you'd have to be under a rock not to). While I don't expect it to ever overtake Team Fortress two in terms of popularity, I do think it'll at least get a stable community of players, especially since it's also a free to play game that has a slight Team Fortress two vibe at first glance. I'm looking forward to how things will turn out!\n\nWell, that's about all I can say from my two games worth of experience. As stated earlier I cannot recommend the game in its current state, however I do enjoy playing it and would like to in the future. I can't give a definite answer to if you should buy this game or not, but currently, I am content with most of the things I see, and I only hope this game gets better.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406060708, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1409895084, "recommendationid": "11366004", "language": "english", "votes_down": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482143", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1434581345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 78, "steamid": "76561198040971585", "num_games_owned": 1100}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This gets a recommendation from me, but with an asterisk. This is an incredibly fun, addicting, and hilarious arena style first person shooter. Each animal is essentially a different class, the bear is a big lumbering enemy and has a heavy machine gun and lots of health. The raccoon (my personal favorite) is pretty quick and has a 3-shot burst rifle and half of the bear's health. The bunny (which is terrifying to run into) is the fastest of the classes, can double jump, has the least health, and is melee only. The classes play off one another really well and feel very balanced, the maps are well designed, movement and combat are very slick and feel very smooth... But now I have to talk about that asterisk.\n\nGetting into a game is next to impossible, you need to have friends who will buy and play this game with you or else you're going to have a tough time. Not only that, but my friends and I had issues joining the only server with players on it because every time we would try our games would freeze and crash. The game feels pretty bare-bones at this point in development, and if nothing else is done with it I find it kind of hard to recommend. However, if the developers keep on working on the game and actually finish it then I can't recommend the game enough. This game has insane potential, it's just good old fashioned FUN with a competitive edge.\n\nAnd a message to the developers, the game's options menu is kind of... Unfortunate. Particularly in the audio department. Rather than having an on/off switch for the in game sounds and music, a slider for each should be implemented. I loved playing with music, but when I had it on it was too loud for me to hear my friends so I had to turn it off.\n\nTL;DR - Very fun game, needs some work.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1407968164, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1407968164, "recommendationid": "11694238", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1409999058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 89, "steamid": "76561198124900616", "num_games_owned": 124}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "More Unlockables please!
