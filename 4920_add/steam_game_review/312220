First Try of this game.[/h1]\n\nThe video can be found here:\nhttp://youtu.be/aJYyVaQo71o\n\nNow on to the written part, shall we:\n\nAfter reading 2 positive reviews about this game before it's official release, I thought I might give that game a try to review and chose it as my first game to review. \nFirst things first, the spelling and the line breaks are off in a big way and makes reading the story and the \"tutorial\" really hard. Speaking of the turotial... Let's put it that way, I've seen better, but in this case the screen at the beginning of the first level is enough, because as far as I've seen(level 3) there isn't more to the game than that. \n\nWhich leads to the next point: The tutorial can't be toggled on again, in case you want to look up something. Speaking of toggling things on or off, there is no options menu whatsoever. I didn't even find a config file of some sort. \nThe lack of an options menu also leads to the problem that you can't put the game in borderless fullscreen mode, which is a problem if you move the mouse a lot, as you tend to do in a twinstick shooter. Because when you go out of bounds, the game locks your last input and keeps on doing that until you click back into the window and take over control again. The same problem is, when you click the application frame and move it around(which I know is not intended to happen, but still it's more or less the dev's fault of not putting a proper fullscreen mode into the game...\n\nSo far we've covered the basics, let's go into the game. The combat is simplistic to say the least. You move using WASD and shoot with the left mouse button. So far so good. That is what I expect from a shooter like that, but then we come to the spell system. The spells are numbered 1-8 and put into a toolbar just like in a MMO. So your basic instinct would say: \"1-8 are the hotkeys, right?\" NOPE, you have to left-klick the spell and right-klick the direction you want to release it towards. That is not intuitive to say the least.  \nWhat is unintuitive as well are the hitboxes. In the video you see some situation in which the hitbox of a tree is bigger than its sprite and blocks my shots this way. Also the hitdetection is kind of random. Sometimes your shots just float through the enemies and deal no damage whatsoever. \n\nLet's talk about enemies then. The enemy design is simple until the stage I've played. When enemies have special abilities they use it at random. Bosses have random attack patterns as well, which can lead to unfair oneshot kills.\nSpeaking of random, the powerups as well as health globes spawn at random, so the game can srew you over pretty badly.\n\nOne thing that is good in this game is the soundtrack, but that is the only thing to praise from the sound perspective. The soundeffects sometimes are absolutely destroying the good music. Especially the explotions sound just like someone shoved a microphone into a dryer and turned it on.   \n\n\nSo there's one final question which is also the tl:dr of this review: Can I recommend the game? And I have to say: At this pricepoint, definitely not. \nI would buy the soundtrack seperately for 3-4 Euros, but if I were you I'd wait for a 75-80% sale on the game and maybe then I'd pick it up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405371170, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1405371465, "recommendationid": "11237217", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502496", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421984796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 38, "steamid": "76561198028728905", "num_games_owned": 102}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is actually a great and fun game, but the only problem is that there is no pause/exit buttons once you start the game.
