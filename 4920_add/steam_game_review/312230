There's only two actual puzzles, if they can be called that, concerning turning generators on by adding certain amounts of voltage without going too high or too low, and putting a tank of liquid nitrogen into a cryosleep tube. That's it. Everything else hinges around searching the ship to find pages and audio logs.\n\nCombat is very unsatisfying. You get a charge pistol, and if you can find either, a submachine gun and shotgun. No resource management or reloading, just keep clicking until stuff explodes. Enemies are basic and uninteresting. It's kind of like Receiver except without any of the things that make Receiver fun and interesting.\n\nThe game gives you no direction at all, which is a good thing, and though the ship is laid out well and you'll naturally drift from one part to the other as you bring the ship's systems up one by one, it's ultimately pretty small. There's absolutely zero replayability value. The endings are unsatisfying and uninteresting, offering you no answers or explanations to the events preceding your arrival.\n\nThe story is paper thin and pretty much EXACTLY as it's laid out in the trailer. There's nothing more to it than that.\n\nThis is a game that gives you an hour or two of playable content, with no replay value and no staying power. It does some things well, namely just giving you a situation and letting you explore it at will, but the only appeal to the game is its mystery. Going in blind is the only way to enjoy it.\n\nIf you really, really want a brief sci-fi experience that has you unravelling an (admittedly shallow) mystery and exploring a derelict space ship, then buy this game. Ideally, buy it for $2, maybe $3. If you want anything more than that, and any kind of staying power out of this game, then don't buy it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506184954, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506185058, "recommendationid": "35158334", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505938406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 187, "steamid": "76561198008105245", "num_games_owned": 675}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Spirits of Xanadu", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505934216, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505934216, "recommendationid": "35090259", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 102, "total_reviews": 131, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 29}}
