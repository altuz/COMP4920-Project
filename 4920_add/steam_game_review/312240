While the games controls are solid and the gameplay functions, its just not the type of game that will keep your interest for too long.

The levels are linear and the enemies definitely not the most difficult I've ever seen in a game. However everything works and no bugs make it a nice little game to shoot a bit around in. The story, as seen by the name of your main enemy ;), is not to be taken too seriously with its over the top writing but is at least coherent. \nDon't expect to play it for many hours but in the end for the \u20ac0,98 that I picked this up it is well worth its money.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448583896, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448583896, "recommendationid": "19297805", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505546", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429165513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198178818537", "num_games_owned": 11}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "3", "review": "this game sucks waste of $3 it makes the protagonist GOD like of all names this is the most aethiest game evar", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438203548, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438203548, "recommendationid": "17287786", "language": "english", "votes_down": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441376", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1479649989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 290, "steamid": "76561197970845706", "num_games_owned": 4289}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great fun all round and a nice nostalgic feel for veteran shooters like Commando, Ikari Warriors for example. It's a very straightforward vertical shooter with plenty of guns and explosions! Graphics and sound are functional enough and it's very easy to pick up and play. The macho voices are deliberately cheesy and had me thinking of 80s action movies!
