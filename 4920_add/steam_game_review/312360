Great historical simulation; they've done their homework on geography, history, and troop composition.  This game will teach you the horror of war from feeding your troops and keeping their magazines stocked to drafting new 18 year olds to man the trenches each year.\n\nThe game accurately characterizes the leadership challenges faced by the lesser powers and the hopelessness of the Western Front.\n\nHOWEVER, getting the stupid, clunky, 100 year old AGEOD engine to function is a war of attrition in and of itself.  I have now spent 4 hour trying to get the August 1915 turn to resolve without an error, apparently inherent to the AGEOD engine.  If you have more than one disk drive that you use, DO NOT BUY ANY AGEOD games!!!!!!!   The turns in this game take 100 years WITHOUT the stupid errors.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491871565, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491871565, "recommendationid": "31070043", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511728", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484885936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 100, "steamid": "76561197984116734", "num_games_owned": 63}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fucking hard.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495607145, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495607145, "recommendationid": "31929874", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485714", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500624199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1173, "steamid": "76561198049429946", "num_games_owned": 26}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "4", "review": "I wanted to like this game.

Playing the central powers is like, impossible, and I had it on easy!\n\nThe austrians are completely useless because the russian numbers are ridiculous, and the serbian army is nigh-unbeatable. And as germany, a successful takeover of belgium is incredibly hard, and once you finish, you barely have enough troops to guard the border.
