Although the rule set is blatantly diffrent and the voice acting on the verge of corny, I feel like the enviornment is wonderfully '40k feeling' immersive.

It is NOT Panzer corps in 40k setting, as they changed the mechanics:\n- No free replacements (they always cost XP, even the automatic end-of-mission ones): I had an elite infantry unit defend a choke point, killing multiple units, began the mission ~350 exp, finished with >500. But as it took losses, after replacements it was down to 380. So all that experience was in fact lost.\n\n\nCompared to Final Liberation, I really hate thgat all of a unit's weapons are fired at once, at the same target.
