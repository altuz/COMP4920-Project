Very easy to play, much less complex than Panzer Corps. Manual tells you nothing, there's no tutorial. There are hints in Frontline: Road to Moscow before you start a battle, which basically tell you how the game works, but not in this game. Instead you get a pop up occasionally explaining things. Not very obvious how things work at first but I'm picking it up quickly. No fog of war, so you can see where all the enemy units are. Definitely seems to be a \"wargame lite\" designed for casual play, but strategy is still needed. There are several combat mechanics and special abilities that aren't obvious at first. These need to be explained better. I've already had several units wiped out. Well it is D-Day after all...\n\nGame is not very polished. Starts in a window (press Alt+Enter to fill screen), no resolution options (although it's running fine in 2560x1080), graphics are pretty but not very sharp. Found a couple of bugs already, landed some units and they've retained the landing craft icons (so I'm now moving and attacking inland with landing craft). Also the frame rate is insanely high (up to a totally unnecessary 1000 FPS) which was straining my graphics card, but I fixed that by running Bandicam in the background to cap the framerate to 30FPS. I've reported these bugs. Knowing Slitherine they'll be fixed. Warhammer Armageddon had the same frame rate problem and they've fixed that in the latest patch I think.\n\nEarly conclusion: Pretty looking turn based wargame. Quick and easy to play (but with a certain hidden depth that isn't obvious), would suit casual players who don't want too much detail. A few bugs at the moment, but no doubt they'll be fixed. It's no Panzer Corps, but it would be unfair to expect too much at this price point. It seems like a fair price for what you get.\n\nUpdate: I've been playing this for a little while now, on and off, and I'm getting to like it more and more. It's really quite enjoyable. I haven't encountered any major bugs yet, and the landing craft icons disappeared after reloading.\n\nAnother Update: Airstrikes are definitely overpowered, in the sense that you can do as many as you like, you're only limited by the points you have to spend. But I have a ridiculous number of points, so I can do as many as I want each turn. It's making the game way too easy, I can just bomb everything to oblivion and I don't need to attack with my ground units at all. In fact I've been purposely not using it just to give myself a bit of a challenge. This really needs to be addressed. Just like there's a limit on how many units you can buy, there should be a limit on how many airstrikes you're allowed each turn. Having maybe 3 or 5 airstrikes max each turn would solve this problem.\n\nAlso, nearing the end of the first scenario, it locked up. It's done this several times before but it usually only lasts a short while then you can continue. This time I was unable to continue and lost all my progress. Obviously this should be fixed too (I'm using Win 7 64 bit), but as a safeguard, an autosave at the beginning of each turn would be nice.\n\nAt the moment, you can deal with these issues by imposing a voluntary air attack limit on yourself each turn, and saving (save and quit) each turn, just in case of an unrecoverable lockup, even though it's a bit of a hassle to reload each turn.\n\nI still recommend this game, but it's more of a cautious recommendation now, on the assumption that these problems will be fixed. You might want to avoid rushing into a purchase until they are.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418249100, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1418316697, "recommendationid": "13310395", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560542", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1420392850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 124, "steamid": "76561198050750229", "num_games_owned": 16}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Basically it's a piece of crap.

Supposed to be a patch floating around but I couldn't find it. \n\nThat being said, it's five bucks so I didn't expect it to be on a par with $50 new releases.
