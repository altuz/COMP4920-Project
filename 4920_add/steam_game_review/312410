You will need a media player and your own songs. The author really needs to go back and add the themes from DF2 and 3 along with volume controls as the machine gun sound is very overbearing in this one just like DF2.\n\nNo Keyboard control for the map, no pausing with space, no hellfire with F and no keyboard scrolling. I actually had to map the mouse to a joypad so I could have fast scrolling with the left hand on the maps. Everything has to be done with the mouse in DF1. This is another thing the dev could easily fix for this game since he has Defense force 3 engine finalized he just needs to go back to this and 2 and touch it up. HE is still selling these on steam so theres no real excuse.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504969878, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504969902, "recommendationid": "34839603", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502982", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "total_reviews": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
