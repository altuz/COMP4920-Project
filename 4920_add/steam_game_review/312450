You can see that by the time I have into it. But it has the WORST AI of any game in the genre I have ever played. Not in terms of strategy mind you, in terms of performance. After the first few turns or whenever there are more than 2 dozen or so units on the board, be prepared for 5-10 MINUTE AI turns. This has been an ongoing problem with the game that the devs have been unable to address, to the point were I play a table game or read a book between my turns. Good luck trying to tune performance BTW, setting everything to low does nothing. Turning \"off\" weather effects doesn't even work, they just come back automatically regardless of toggle setting. Until the performance issues are resolved, I can't recommend the game to anyone.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504847402, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504847402, "recommendationid": "34808249", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520892", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504673682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 71900, "steamid": "76561197968571832", "num_games_owned": 663}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This has become my go-to game for when I want to play a strategy game, but don't want to invest a dozen hours into it... which, as it turns out, describes the conditions under which I want to play a video game at all about half of the time these days.\n\nOoB is challenging without being punishing: You can play it in a self-imposed ironman mode (i.e., no save-scumming!) and still just about manage to complete most (but usually not all) of the optional objectives across an entire campaign.  The campaigns consist of about a dozen well-varied scenarios that each take an hour or so to complete.  The campaigns themselves also sport an impressive variety for a game of this type, featuring theaters often ignored in WW2 strategy games.  What other game features campaigns focused on the Winter War in Finland, the \"Forgotten War\" in Burma, and the Battle of the Atlantic, in addition to the standard German/Japanese/American land conquest campaigns?  What's amazing is that most of these campaigns each have their own distinct flavor.\n\nMechanics-wise, the game is reminiscent of Panzer Corps and by extension, that game's inspiration, the venerable Panzer General (which happens to be my all-time favorite strategy game).  It's pretty standard tactical turn-based combat, to be sure, but what really makes it shine is that the same engine integrates land, sea and air combat seamlessly -- better so than any other turn-based game that I can think of.\n\nLike its predecessors, OoB gives you a \"core force\" that you shepherd between the scenarios of a campaign.  You're constantly faced with the choice of whether to reinforce your existing units with veteran troops (thus making them more effective), upgrading them with the latest technology, or buying whole new units.  The fact that the choice is often agonizing is a pretty good indication that it's a well-balanced system.\n\nI've now played through most of the campaigns at least half a dozen times.  As long as I keep having an hour or so to spare now and then, I'll probably be cycling through them many more times before I tire of it.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504608639, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504608639, "recommendationid": "34753914", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517082", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507181076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1544, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 28558, "steamid": "76561198007669286", "num_games_owned": 257}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "buy it  or the emu will  peck you bum", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506833967, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506833967, "recommendationid": "35363990", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502240", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506147314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 153, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 12484, "steamid": "76561198059904799", "num_games_owned": 336}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Order of Battle is best strategy game and Winter war is Very good dlc like it very mutch.
