The story builds, characters are introduced, and if you haven't played previous games, you won't understand the backstory.\n\nYou can never have enough Sam And Max. However, I will say that Season 3 is the weakest of the 3 seasons. Its still good, it just isn't as good as 1 and 2. \n\nThat being said, Season3 boasts a large improvement to the game graphics engine. Better models, clearer graphics, more animations and cut sequences, help the story along.\n\nI do feel like the addition of the \"Devil's Toybox\" mechanic was a bit annoying. You essentially end up with two different inventory systems - one for Sam and one for Max. It does add some depth, but can also be really annoying, since a lot of Max's abilities are PoV and it really took me out of the Adventure sort-of game when this happens.\n\nEven so, its still very funny, and if you're into adventure comedy games, it doesn't get much better.
