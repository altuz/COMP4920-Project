Now imagine being almost invulnerable while charging, as well as being able to destroy blocks. By now you should feel very mobile and with new exciting combat-options to explore.\n\nThis fun can be combined with up to three friends in four different, yet equally entertaining modes of competitive multiplayer.\n\n\nWhile this game isn't heavy on content and extras by any means, it really struck me and my friends by its quality: the gameplay feels fresh, well balanced and highly dynamic, the presentation feels coherent and quite stylish, the menus are very easy and effective to navigate.\n\nIf you like your games to to be fun, direct, unique and with a little challenge, you should get this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1408474004, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1408474087, "recommendationid": "11783718", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511699", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1408873235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 703, "steamid": "76561197975527329", "num_games_owned": 414}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The single player has some of the best gameplay I have ever seen!
