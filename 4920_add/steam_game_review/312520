Videocult has managed to bring together something completely unexpected, fresh, and oozing with soul. After the endless barrage of randomly-generated riffraff resulting from the inception of The Binding of Isaac, Rain World dials it back and transports you to a fantastic, lovingly-crafted, and dangerous world rife with wonder.\n\nAs with most games, the first thing you\u2019ll want to do is go digging through that options menu. After but a moment, you\u2019ll come to realize that the game\u2019s maximum resolution is 1366x768. Wait! Don\u2019t let that act as any sort of deterrent because even with this limitation, they managed to elevate pixel art to breathtaking new heights that I didn\u2019t believe was possible. The game\u2019s trailers provide an extreme injustice to its artwork, animation, and effects, and it simply must be absorbed firsthand to understand what they\u2019ve spent over the last half a decade to accomplish.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve managed to shake off the stars in your eyes, you\u2019ll soon find yourself abruptly tossed into a morose, tense environment that\u2019ll have you scrambling for survival right from the get-go. No punches are pulled when it comes to setting you up in the mood of the atmosphere. The soundtrack synergizes incredibly well with your surroundings to create the perfect ambiance, but it\u2019s not overbearing, it\u2019s controlled and the pieces only arrive precisely when they so need to.\n\nYou won\u2019t find any tutorials, except for the scarce guidance of an otherworldly creature that only supplies you with seemingly esoteric instructions. There is no leveling up, no upgrades, and no perks of any sort. Your only tool for getting you through this damning ecosystem is by learning the lay of the land, interacting with the world around you to unravel the knowledge required to get you from one safe zone to the other.\n\nGetting by is simple, find enough nourishment through your daily trek and then return to your only point of refuge, your den, before the destructive forces of the rain arrive. However, getting through means you\u2019ll need to dig deep and brave the unknowns to move forward. This world is very much alive, and the creatures that prowl the landscape are ruthless; all living things must eat. From one day to the next, enemies are placed throughout the world, sometimes, in a spot none too ideal. Misfortune may have you suddenly snatched up in the jaws of a common, or unfamiliar predator, but for many more situations, you\u2019ll need to use wit and intuition just to survive a small encounter. You may catch a few lucky breaks, but there's no other satisfaction like the true progression allowed here.\n\nDon\u2019t get too comfortable, danger is around every corner. Right when you think you\u2019ve avoided death, you\u2019re frantically mashing buttons desperately trying make another quick escape. And just like that, you\u2019re back to start of the same cycle because you were too busy struggling with trying to make slugcat move the way you intended. The controls here begin as an obstacle in and of itself. Master them, it takes patience and finesse to slither your way past becoming another\u2019s lunch. To the more attentive players, there\u2019s a repertoire of hidden moves for you to boast which will come in handy for making a last-minute getaway.\n\nThis game is [i]not[/i] love at first try, a relationship needs to be built up over time to break through that initial, bitter exterior. But once you do, you\u2019re rewarded with an experience unlike any other. It\u2019s a land begging to be explored, dense with surprises and secrets anxious to be discovered, and it gives new meaning to games as an artform. This team\u2019s passion and vision are shone through brilliantly and it just might be one of the greatest journeys you\u2019ll be thankful you ever powered through.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504606247, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504606247, "recommendationid": "34753357", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534145", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507080894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 728, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3538, "steamid": "76561198064105773", "num_games_owned": 78}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Recommended if you like challenge.\nRecommended if you like cute slugcats.\nRecommended if you like scary abominations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely recommended if you like condensed chaos.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505831401, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505831401, "recommendationid": "35065500", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518452", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506920042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 911, "steamid": "76561198024218344", "num_games_owned": 204}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1]You\u2019re a slugcat. You\u2019re nothing. You should already be dead.[/h1]\n\nRain World looks to be set in a fairly commonplace videogame post-apocalypse at first. Wild vegetation grows from mysterious structures, the skeletons of skyscrapers scratch a grey sky, and living is neither convenient nor fun. Except in Rain World you\u2019re a slugcat and the apocalypse it must endure is among the bleakest and most punishing I\u2019ve ever experienced. You\u2019re not punching trees to build abodes, you\u2019re not meeting warring survivor factions and buddying up, you\u2019re not grinding for a nice pair of trousers. You\u2019re just surviving, by a thread. And it\u2019s hard to do that.\n\nIt\u2019s a platformer and a survival game, but neither of those categories are a neat fit for Rain World\u2019s peculiar brand of misery. Although Rain World stands apart as one of the most alienating and difficult games in recent memory.\n\nThere\u2019s little to the game. You\u2019re a slugcat, wrestled away from its family and plunged into a decayed urban dreamscape plagued with erratic, free-roaming monstrosities that want to eat you. As a slugcat you\u2019re close to the bottom of the food chain, but not rock bottom: you\u2019ll need to eat bats to survive, or more accurately, eat in order to hibernate. Hibernating can only be done in hibernation chambers, and one must have at least four units of food in order to use them. These chambers are infrequent, with each rest cycling to a different season in-world. Seasons work like a ladder: hibernate without dying, and you\u2019ll move up. Die, and you\u2019ll move down. This process is agonising, but I won\u2019t spoil why.\n\nOh, and the reason you can only hibernate in chambers is because they\u2019re waterproof. As the name implies, there\u2019s rain in this game, and like virtually every other damn thing in Rain World, it kills you. Each life, or hibernation cycle, is timed: if you don\u2019t get anywhere meaningful in the allotted time, such as another hibernation chamber (for which you\u2019ll need to be well fed for), then you\u2019re DEAD.\n\n[h1]You\u2019re a slugcat. You\u2019re nothing. You should already be dead.[/h1]\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot more to learn about how Rain World works, but I\u2019ve already said too much. The game only explains how to eat and how to hibernate, otherwise you only have the guiding hand of a cryptic yellow ghost, which you\u2019ll probably try to kill and eat early on, as the game refrains from telling you that it's there to help.\n\nOn that note, the early hours of Rain World will annoy anyone without steely patience: slugcat\u2019s traversal feels cumbersome and it's terrible at jumping, but once you get a feel for what this game is trying to do (make you feel utterly disempowered) it will feel less like bad design and more thematically appropriate.\n\n[h1]You\u2019re a slugcat. You\u2019re nothing. You should already be dead.[/h1] \n\nAnd yet, there are small problems with traversal that are hard to ignore, like you have when three glowing numbskulls pursuing you for nourishment.\n\nRain World requires improvisation and smarts, and there\u2019s no way to trick it into being easier.\n\nThe early hours are taxing, and in all honesty, it continues to be taxing. It\u2019s not relaxing. It\u2019s not a game to wash away your daily worries with. But the variety of the world\u2019s barren landscapes will keep the determined pushing on, and the seemingly insurmountable challenges are, well, surmountable, but not thanks to 'tricks' per se. You just have to be smart about it. You have to learn\u2014and then very vaguely know\u2014how to survive. \n\nYou have to accept that sometimes you\u2019ll be unlucky. Is that too demanding? For the vast majority of players, I expect it is. For those with the time and patience, Rain World will prove unforgettable.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because, often, it is unfair. That is the core of what Rain World is about: failure.\n\nI recommend this game to the players with a plethora of patientce.\n\nIt's a hard game to learn.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505107693, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505108257, "recommendationid": "34877135", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515344", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506788680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32076, "steamid": "76561198368125569", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "When I first got this game, I could only watch the scenery and hate the controls, and I never made any actual progress for a while because I knew absolutely nothing about the game.

Seriously, there's nothing else like it. Every aspect of the game: the sound, the art, the gameplay and world design are nothing short of excellent.\n\nI could write an essay on everything I like about Rain World, and in my opinion, the game is virtually flawless (besides a couple bugs here and there). That said, the game is kind of niche; not everyone is going to enjoy it, so rather than rant about how great the game is, I'm going to explain what kind of experience to expect from this game.\n\nThe central idea of this game is to simulate an ecosystem that you are actively a part of. All of the creatures interact with each-other, you, and the world as a whole. The AI is quite advanced, for example: each creature has their own opinion of you and will react to how you behave. It is actually quite fun to just watch all the creatures AI interacting with each-other. If you're a fan of emergent gameplay, this game has a LOT of that. Another cool thing about this game is the procedural animations, they're quite impressive and I haven't seen another game attempt them on the scale that Rain World does. They look silly sometimes, but that is a part of the game's charm. The procedural animations combined with the dynamic AI make the game (and ecosystem) feel very alive.\n\n[h1]Things you should know about Rain World:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]This is a slow burning game;[/b] it requires some patience from the player. You cannot brute force your way through this game; it requires slow and thoughtful decision making, with quick responses to emergent gameplay.\n[*][b]The main gameplay focus of this game is survival before anything else,[/b] treat it as such.\n[*][b]You will not always make hard progress;[/b] sometimes you will spend an entire cycle just scouting ahead before even attempting to proceed to a new shelter.\n[*][b]You should not be concerned with \"beating\" an area (getting to the end):[/b] rather, you should be concerned about \"mastering\" the area: learning the specifics, nuances, and layouts of each individual area(In other words, learning how to [i]live[/i] in that area!)\n[*][b]This game's progression is primarily player-focused:[/b] your character is the same at the end of the game as when they started, but the player will be significantly better than when they started out (In other words, the game requires you to learn and develop your own skills)\n[*][b]The game uses RNG, but your success will rely less and less on it as you get more experienced.[/b]\n[*][b]The AI is quite advanced and you should treat it as such;[/b] if you are aggressive to a specific creature, it will remember that,  it might even tell it's friends. Likewise, if you're nice, the creature will be less aggressive towards you and might even help you!\n[*][b]The controls are not bad, you just suck.[/b] I know, I know, that's pretty blunt but it's true; slugcat can be very precise and quick if you actually put in the effort.\n[*][b]Most deaths are your fault;[/b] it won't feel that way when you start(trust me I know!), but as you get more experience you will start to agree.\n[/list]\n\nIf most of that sounds good to you, then I would highly recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506750545, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506750935, "recommendationid": "35324366", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507169053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1302, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2509, "steamid": "76561198258098883", "num_games_owned": 88}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I never thought I'd beat this game, for a while I almost completely gave up on it.

The game world is fascinating - it holds mysteries and stories that are being told by environment. Inhabiting this world creatures are interesting and diverse.\n+Music is rare - most of the time it's just ambient noises. But when it does starts playing in certain rooms or during certain encounters, it's always great and suits the situation perfectly.\n~Procedural animation means that it will take some time to get used to controlling Slugcat. But at the same time, controls are responsive and there are a lot of movement techs that players can discover (I'm not talking about unlocking abilities). The controls in this game may prove to be an issue for some people.\n~The games does not explain almost anything to players. Exploring the world and moving forward will take a lot of experimentation, observation and wit. But unlike some games that love to hide information from players just for the sake of it and punishing them with trial and error, Rain World encourages curiosity. To a reasonable degree of course ( \"What will happen if I throw a rock in the face of this big and mean-looking lizzard? OH GOD I REGRET EVERYTHING!\" ) There will ALWAYS be signs of danger, if you are paying attention. I never encountered cheap traps or bullshit deaths. Just remember to be observant and listen to your little friend - hologram worm (or whatever that thing is).\n~The game is a constant race against the clock - to do all your business during the cycle and get back to your safe spot and hibernate to wait out ruthless rainstorms. Different cycles, however, have different duration. So, again - pay attention and everything will be fine. Some people might not like the constant threat of time running out.\n-There is no difficulty selection at the moment.
