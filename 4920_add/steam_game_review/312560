It certainly turned out to be a fantastic game, but nothing like what I expected.  It's an action RPG, but that's about where the similarities to Ys ends.  Xanadu Next focuses much more on dungeon crawling and exploration, and the atmosphere is relatively dark.  Much of the story and world history is revealed through texts you find hidden in treasure chests throughout the game, some hidden quite well.  I found it incredibly addictive to search every corner of every dungeon looking for secrets, hidden treasures, and discovering more of the game's lore.  The level-up system is very open ended, giving 6 points to allocate to your stats however you please for each level you gain.  The game guides you with equipment stat requirements, so it's pretty hard to mess up your stats, but there is also a level-down option in the case that you want to level up again and redistribute your stats.  The game uses mouse controls, which I'm generally not too fond of, but it functions well and even adds a bit to the feel of the game, so it's not so bad as I expected it would be.  This game was a great surprise for me and is a really amazing experience.

It's actually based on the PC version and has nothing to do with the apparently very stripped-down port to that ill-fated handheld.\n\nIt's a bit of an odd duck, control-wise. I used a controller, but it seems like it is also designed to be played with a mouse and keyboard like a traditional diablo-style game. Although, it's heavily based around precise movement, so an analog stick may be the way to go.\n\nThe dungeon crawling is fine, but the surprising thing is the writing. There's not a ton of it, but it's way better than it has any right to be.\n\nMore of an interesting historical relic than a true classic, but worth playing nonetheless.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505970999, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505970999, "recommendationid": "35097900", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505968", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499407209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1652, "steamid": "76561198113143138", "num_games_owned": 5}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "You cannot miss it!!!!!
