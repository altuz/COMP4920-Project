Do I recommend this game? Not at full price.\n\nPeople talk here like it's \"Like Final Fantasy Tactics or the Fire Emblem or Disgaea\". Well they are not completely wrong, but they are not right from another point of view.\n\nEverything I will say, is according to my playthrough (2 floors cleaned 6,5 hours played on hard difficulty), achievement analysis, and screenshot analysis.\n\nLets talk in numbers.\n4 Floors.\n5 levels each.\n20 levels (game stages total).\n\n3 \"starting\" professions.\nWarrior upgrade goes like x3 (second) x1 (third) = 7\nArcher goes like x2 x3 = 9\nMagician goes like x2 x2 = 7\nSo it's 23 professions to choose from, not bad huh ?\nYep but this are the all the enemy you will encounter in the game (+3 plot dolls who just useless but have high HP).\nThere are no more enemy types in game.\n\nNo gear. Trere are NO items or potions. No inventory. Just skills.\n\nThere 6 types of magick. Guide staits that Fire->Lightning->Water->Fire and Dark->Light->Star->Dark. But trere is no elements on the characters (exept buffs), so for the most time it is just like \"hit the mage with fisical, hit the warrior with magic to win).\n\nDifficulty ? \nTotal maximum of your characters are 20.\nIn batle you can use 5, with no replacement.\nThere are 10-15-20 enemies, you should fight with 5 of your dudes.\nNo item difference, no profession difference, no skill difference ever. Plus you often start in terrible position (like group separated). Of course it's difficult, but it is just \"zerg rush\" you see.\n\nHere my playtime with it if you need more proof.\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/drobodur/c/5712990\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/drobodur/c/5712997", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418999096, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1418999096, "recommendationid": "13449896", "language": "english", "votes_down": 60, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692180", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423402343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1568, "steamid": "76561197993471534", "num_games_owned": 458}, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 140, "comment_count": "2", "review": "In short: It's a semi-competent SRPG with some odd design choices, grindy and tedious progression, and charming but weak characters and story.\n\nRather than giving a comprehensive review and nitpicking about the lack of available resolutions, or how there are typos and broken tags in the game text, or how the character art was seemingly drawn by little Billy, age 6, using the GIMP's default brush and burn tool, I will focus on my biggest gripes with the game.\n\nThe UI could benefit from mouseover popups that tell you in detail what everything does. None of the attributes have any kind of description, you have to open the manual for that. You can't easily hover over (de)buff icons to see their effects, you have to either check the manual again or open the caster's status menu and scroll through the skill list for the description. But how long does the buff last? The game won't tell you.\n\nWhenever a unit dies, it leaves behind a body that occupies the tile. The reason being that there is a resurrection spell in the game, even though you won't actually see it until the last few stages of the game. Since many of the levels contain small cliffs and narrow passageways, it makes moving your troops forward a pain, and in some cases impossible due to their slow movement and jump values. This makes the already weak melee units even weaker.\n\nDifficulty is good for the most part - until the very last level. The final boss fight requires either very high levels, or very specific tactics to counter magic nukes.\n\nThe AI is poor. Often it only ever attacks the unit closest to it, even if there are vulnerable targets available. Occasionally the AI backs away to cast buffs even if it makes little sense given the situation. AOE casters pay no heed to their allies and will mercilessly harm their allies and possibly even themselves if it means scratching the player's full HP tank a tiny bit. The AI seems to ignore the player's reaction skills entirely, a very useful weakness to exploit during the final battle where a single AOE nuke can wipe out the entire party.\n\nYour units' starting positions depend on what party slot they occupy. This is usually not a big deal, but there are some maps where your party is split and placed on the different sides of the map. This can lead to a quick defeat if your fighters and supporters are not evenly distributed.\n\nMost importantly, the game is tedious. The story isn't very interesting, you only get bits of the story during the first and last levels of the current floor. Dead bodies quickly clutter up the battlefield and limit possible moves, forcing you to clean up the remaining enemies by moving your ranged units up while everyone else attacks thin air or buffs a rock just to level up their skill proficiencies, and this takes forever. I would highly recommend setting battle speed to its max value from the options menu.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423404493, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423468526, "recommendationid": "14387420", "language": "english", "votes_down": 28, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643266", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1419901823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2131, "steamid": "76561198156602981", "num_games_owned": 188}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 33, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I had a really enjoyable time playing this game. It's not that great, but it's not that bad either.\n\nIt has a good variety of skills and classes, which makes up for the lack of items and equips, giving room for many different grouping strategies. \n\nThere are some challenging maps, that will require some \"grinding/training\", making it barely impossible to clear it in one go.\n\nThere are some issues (such as a childish plot and simple graphics), but the greatest let down is the AI, which is very simple/weak (even in hard mode). \nThe enemy's motto is basically: \"just marches towards your closest foe and hit it with whatever you got\". \nAnd that's bad, especially with mages. Don't be surprised to see enemy mages trying to have physical duels against your strongest warriors. Also, when using area skills, they won't care about friendly fire.\n\nOverall, this is a simple yet playable game.

I was hoping on first look that it would be a lighter, but still interesting, PC replacement for one of my all time favourite games Disgaea, or at least on par with something like Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. However the combat system is as basic as I've ever come across in this genre, with very little strategy involved, and poor AI. Perhaps the latter will develop later in the game, but nothing I've seen leads me to believe this will be the case. The storyline also seems very lacking, which wouldn't be so bad if there was anything to the rest of the game.\n\nCharacter and party customization is limited to a fusion system which again is very shallow. The art style is decent, nothing special, and the partial controller support is pretty poor, refuses to map the majority of my controls (on an Xbox 360 pad, so not a case of obscure tech), and is just a headache to use, having to switch between controller and keyboard/mouse in the middle of each characters combat action... really, just don't bother with it using a controller.\n\nThere is a serious lack of this style of game on the PC, which has always disappointed me, and this game does absolutely nothing for me as a fan of this genre. In the same price range you can get Agarest, which is a far superior offering to scratch that tactical RPG itch.

However it was not, and it does not hold up in the current atmosphere of SRPGs available on Steam or anywhere else.\n\nIt draws a lot of comparisons to FFT, but for all the wrong reasons.  It's a basic SRPG that needs very little instruction (which is good because it offers absolutely zero) and has a wide array of classes to choose with promotional trees.  This was interesting, but within the first few hours you will find yourself already dismissing entire classes due to their uselessness, and favoring mages instead.  The skill leveling system was also interesting, as individual skills level up with usage, but that goes for defensive and reactive abilities too, which are obviously not easily controlled by you.  This leads to some major grinding needed.\n\nTo level up the way you'll probably want to, you need to revisit previous stages.  The stages are the exact same layout as your original fight, and you have no way of choosing your own troop deployment or where they start.  It makes the high level of grinding needed in this game even more unenthused.  Read some of the posts and guides on the forum here, some of the suggested leveling methods involves beating the 3 enemies on the very first stage over and over again...  That's just not fun.  \n\nThe story is kinda meh.  I didn't get far and nothing about the story made me want to see what the next stage had going on.  \n\nIf you like PS1 era SRPGs I would suggest Brigandine, Tactics Ogre, Vanguard Bandits etc as far superior options.

However, this game does bring about its own little tactical twist. If you're a huge fan of melee characters, you might not like this game as much simply because it's much more challenging to use them than ranged characters (or if you like challenges then ignore that point). Mages definitely shine here, as they do the most damage and allow you to burst rather quickly.\n\nI feel like the game is a bit underdeveloped, where the developers were in a rush so they just released it without more thought. It is a gem however in which that you don't really have to grind too much for an RPG, but it's just the right amount for you to be ok with as a casual gamer. Many unique features like fusion are set up. Don't expect gear, or items or such from a simple fresh turn-based tactical game like this.\n\nIn short, this game is definitely worth the buy to try (not full price), it offers a fun, tactical positioning, game where each unit matters (since you only use 5 per stage).

If you like Final Fantasy Tactics or the Fire Emblem series you'll feel right at home with this game. A few very specific things about this game are a bit problematic for veterans of the tactics type of games however. (Keep in mind some of these issues are only on HARD, and if you pick the normal difficulty you'll be fine against a few of these issues.)\n\nYou don't get you place down any of your units at the start, everything is just kind of preset based on where you have your various girls put into slots, so slot 1 always spawns in the same spot on level 1-1, etc.\n\nTheres no items. This isn't a huge problem however except for very early on in your gameplay, just because you start with only 3/5 character slots filled, level 1-1 is you vs 3. at the end of 1-1 you get a new girl in your party, which gives you 4 girls... level 1-2 is your 4 girls vs 8 (or 9 I don't remember), so unless you get really lucky with RNG or you will need to rerun 1-1 just to get your 5th girl slot filled. \n\nTheres no gear of any sort. The way you get powerful is based on leveling skills, which is also how you evolve your units into different classes. (I like this system but it can be confusing at first) \n\nThese issues are only really a problem in the very beginnings of the game, and they become non-issues after about 1-3, but I wanted to touch on them so you know what you're getting into and to tell you to NOT QUIT just because it is hard in the beginning, it gets better.\n\nOne small gripe I wanted to talk about with the game is that the controller support is a bit meh. The pre-game launcher could only detect like, half of the buttons on my wired xbox controller, like I couldn't get it to find my D-pad so I have to use my stick which can be a bit annoying. The other EXTREMELY annoying thing is that for some reason after I have input an action into the game, if I don't want to follow through with that action, pressing the cancel button on my controler doesn't actually cancel the input. I have to right click with my mouse in order to get it to cancel, but every other time I can cancel inputs just fine with my B button on the controller, not sure what that's about. \n\nOverall this game gets a 9/10 from me, just because of the simple controller issues, Gameplay itself is an easy 10/10 for this game genre. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418942356, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1418942356, "recommendationid": "13437603", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514687", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432755019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 616, "steamid": "76561198026923485", "num_games_owned": 269}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "lets start with the pros:\nthe dialogs are funny.\nyou can change the difficulty, on hard, it can be challenging, on easy, a mission is over quickly.\nyou can fuse unneeded chars to give your main fighters a little powerup, although its limited to 30 times and because the number stays with the fusion, you have to plan careful which chars to fuse.\nthe artstyle/graphic  is nice.\nyou can customise which skill each char can use.\nthere are twenty-something character classes,each with different skillsets.\n\nthe cons:\nthere are only 4 floors with 5 missions each.

It is very fun to play.\n\nIf you are looking for a SRPG easy to understand, simple, childish & innocent... the game worth. It gaves you approximatelly 35-40h of fun if you don't try to get all achievements and just \"beat the game\".\n\nIn the counterpart of this game, there is no optional things. You just fight \"stages\" until you end the game. No optional quests. Just passing stages as an old plataformer game. As any other good SRPG, you can grind to find out different jobs and skills. Sadly, it has to be replaying stages, since as I said, it doesn't have optional things. Just stages.\n\nSome people mistake this game comparing it with FFT (since it have jobs and stuff like that). I can tell that if you expect this game to be as good as FFT, you are wrong. It is a good game, indeed, but FFT is a masterpiece.\n\nThe art is nice, but as many other Japan games, it had a lot of girls, and in this case, a lot of lolis. This may disagree with some other players, but I actually enjoy seeing fantasy/innocent/beautiful SRPGs. There of plenty of \"War themed\" SRPGs in the market, so I kindda like this \"change\".\n\nThe story is simple. It looks more a tale for kids than a story for adults. Well, just looking at the art it gives you an idea that the game is pretty much childish. You won't see knights or archers bleeding until death. \n\nSo, if you are looking for a simple and childish SRPG, I totally suggest it but if you don't, you should really look another SRPGs in steam.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460756199, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460756408, "recommendationid": "22437710", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500428", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452292394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 387, "steamid": "76561198023473562", "num_games_owned": 355}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "UI and controls are a bit clunky, graphics aren't exceptional with some sprites looking pretty bad, voice acting is a mixed bag but the gameplay is fun enough and the design has at least a bit of charm to it\n\nnot the hardest nor the most complicated turn based strategy game but still fun nonetheless, buy it on sale", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452292633, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452292633, "recommendationid": "20407364", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502644", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 35, "total_reviews": 52, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 17}}
