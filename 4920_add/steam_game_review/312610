This port is pretty bad! I didn't even go into this expecting much.\nWith official ports you simply have to accept that it will be subpar to other alternatives, that's just how it is. But sometimes they can be almost good! Sadly, that was not the case here. I had no problems playing the actual game, at least.\n\nFirst off, the game was only able to map about 50% of my controller's buttons. OK. That's to be expected, I can work with that. At least there was an attempt at DirectInput support.\n\n[u]Video options[/u] are a letdown. Scaling can be set to [i]nearest neighbor[/i], or [i]bilinear[/i] without any form of prescaling. Needless to say, neither option is very attractive.\n\n[u]Sound[/u] is not emulated correctly. This shows most on the various beeps in the game, and the music not being able to keep a stable tempo.\n\n\nAs for the actual game... I'm kinda biased against arcade games, so there's that.\n\nThe game, like most arcade games, will eventually throw everything it has at you and say \"we want more money now\". If you don't know what's coming ahead of time, chances are you'll be putting in a lot of credits. The port features an \"infinite credits\" mode, however.\n\nThe controls aren't terrible, but they're not good. Whose idea was it to make fire+jump the self-destruct command for vehicles!? Completely baffling.\nSometimes it's harder than it should be to turn around.\nThe original game doesn't have autofire, the [u]port adds an autofire[/u] however. I can't complain - my sore gaming wrists are happy to see this! Remember to stretch, kids.\n\nThe game lags quite a bit... [i]the game is laggy by itself[/i], but I'm no Metal Slug expert so I can't say how much of it is poor emulation.\n\nUltimately, it's a somewhat fun and short run n' gun hampered by being an arcade game (my own negative opinion of arcade games, as mentioned earlier). The game features splendid 2D art, which looks less splendid after the port does job.\n\n\n[u]I wouldn't recommend Metal Slug X.[/u] The port is not very good, and I personally can't recommend it for the gameplay either (which isn't to say it's a downright bad game).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506900732, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506900732, "recommendationid": "35399303", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509403", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504981653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 124, "steamid": "76561198039619705", "num_games_owned": 4881}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This reminds me of Contra.  That's a good thing.  There's some nice level variety across the 6 missions.  My favorite is the level with the mummies.  I appreciate that the playable characters are half male and half female. I appreciate the little differences between them - like the guy with the boxing glove melee.  I found this equally enjoyable in both single and multiplayer.  The gun variety is nice.  The limited ammo balances out the fact that some of the weapons are overpowered. The normal gun is a bit weak, and I'm not sure it's possible not to die in some places if that's all you've got on you.  It's a nice touch that there are some vehicles and transformations. The enemy variety (combined with the level variety) is enough, I think.  I particularly like the aliens and mummies. and some of the boss battles.  A full playthrough of the game takes about an hour.  There's some replayabilty simply because it's fun.
