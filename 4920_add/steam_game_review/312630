I wanted to close the game and gave this game a negative review. I forced myself to play a little bit and i changed my opinion from the total negative to neutral. There is no neutral rating, so i chose positive.\n\nPros\n- There are heroes. You can take up to 3 to battle. There are total 9 heroes. So you have to choose\n- RPG system for heroes. Level up your heroes and learn skills. There are 16 skills for every hero. The most of them are passive, but you can unlock new active abilities. Yeah, every hero can take 2 abilities to the battle. So, you will have 6 active skills in the battle. It's quite interesting.\n- Beside skills, every hero has inventory with 4 slots. You can buy better weapon, armor, etc.\n- Cool effects for death\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=925601480\n\nCons\n- The game is really really slow and there are no game speed settings. The first levels were boring and with no possibility to increase the speed it got me angry. The further stages are harder and more interesting, so it got no so critical.\n- There are no difficulty settings. I think, the game will be hard for the most of the users.\n- The explanation of things is bad. There no tooltips for icons, skills and even for towers. Nonsense. I couldn't understand almost everything during the missions. Yeah, there is an encyclopedia in the game, but I am sure everybody like to learn things directly in the battle.\n- The strategic potential of the game is really low. I agree, there are 3 types of damage/armor and you must use proper towers for every level. But, it's really unclear which armor type has an exact monster. Towers don't have any abilities (I am sure for passing first 7 stages). \n- The past of mobile. There are counters for the ressurections of heroes (40m). WTF? There are lot of grind in the game, because you need better weapon and higher level team.\n- The graphics is angular. I am not a big fan of that.\n- Music is forgettable. Sound design is average.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=925601439\n\nSo, it's more arcade game than strategy. It has a lot of minuses. I would prefer to play this game on mobile, because there are a lot much more better TD titles in Steam. I even couldn't finish the game, because the gameplay is slow for me. But the game is polished, no bugs were found. It has some fresh ideas, so i can't give this game a negative. Actually, my review is closer to neutral, but there is no such option.\n\nIf you are OK with it, you could this game a try.\nI can recommend OTTTD to buying on a sale with 75%+ discount", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494756812, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494758077, "recommendationid": "31744570", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561044", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 45, "total_reviews": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
