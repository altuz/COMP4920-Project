Weapons are the same.\n-When you die, you only lose a life.

I would probably like to cover a metal version of the boss music.\n-Cannot choose different screen resolutions. Only windowed or fullscreen\n-Cannot change audio level. Would be nice to control music, speech, and sound effects.\n-Cannot change controller button layout. Note that I've only tried with a controller and not keyboard.\n-Cannot turn off flashing screen at full power or at least curtail it. It's nice but it can get distracting at times.\n-Having 5 weapons gives it a Thunder Force feel. The power up system feels like Darius.\n-Would be cool to have \"Options\" (as in a little buddy who shoots/rotates/follows).

That is a good thing. It's the first old school shmup I've played on Steam that actually feels oldschool without being too simple. While the enemies are fairly basic, they are better than similar games at this price point. The weapon switching and power up system is the highlight of the game design. They are well balanced for various play styles. Switching on the fly and strategizing is excelllent.\n\nDifficulty: It's difficult, but not that bad. It's much, much easier than something like Strikers 1945 or Ikaruga. Using no forcefields, on the first play through on the hardest difficulty (Psychopathic - 1 life) I made it to the end of the third stage. It's suitable for people new to the genre. Thankfully, it's not cheap.\n\nControl: I played with the keyboard and it was okay, except for when I got to about speed level 5 it became a hinderance. A slowdown button would be helpful for navigating bullet fields.\n\nSound: The music is good. The sound is decent, but occaisionally a bit repetitive. The voice samples for the weapon switching are at the perfect volume and sounded awesome. \n\nWhat is missing:\n* No score keeping? For a game that places quite an emphasis on score, it is a strange, glaring omission.\n* Slow down button.\n* A more difficult, extreme difficulty to satisfy the veteran shmup players. \n* Sound control. The laser effects can grate after awhile.\n\nWhat would be nice (but, hey - it's a solo developer):\n* Score-based challenges. \n* A few different playing ships.\n* Online score competitions.\n* More enemy types (down the road). \n\nOverall: It's good. It's not perfect, it's a bit clumsy. However, It's worth the pricepoint and a good oldschool intro to the genre for new folks. Support the dev and hopefully the game will grow a bit to meet it's potential. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1409357264, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1409357264, "recommendationid": "11914953", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496467", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423148928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 53, "steamid": "76561198036795830", "num_games_owned": 50}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really fun game that is a steal at only \u00a32", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411151924, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1411151924, "recommendationid": "12151541", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501429", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462003592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 130, "steamid": "76561198009768621", "num_games_owned": 625}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Played this at a Games convention back in May this year.
