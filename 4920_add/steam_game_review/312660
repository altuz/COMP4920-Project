The player controls the same character from the previous game, Karl Fairburne, on another mission to defeat the Nazis. I enjoyed Sniper Elite 3, which I played for the first time recently, and this sequel is better is pretty much every way.\n\nThe good\n\n-\tMaps for each mission feel larger and more open. The switch from Africa to Italy has resulted in more attractive scenery (lots more green), as you fight through the streets of small towns, and the surrounding countryside.\n-\tStealth mechanics remain the same as before. You can use silenced ammo, crouch or go prone to stay out of sight, and use loud noises to mask your rifle fire. My favourite mission features an artillery cannon, which the Germans have set up on top of a bridge, firing at regular intervals. I spent ages laid on top of a hill, getting another headshot every time the cannon went boom, while other enemies were completely unaware of my presence.\n-\tWhen you get detected, you can still go loud, and adopt a run and gun approach. Guns feel enjoyable to fire. You can carry a sniper rifle, SMG and pistol as well as various grenades and mines, which gives you plenty of options to deal with each fight.\n-\tEnemy AI feels more natural, compared to SE3. It takes enemies a bit longer to pinpoint your exact location, but once they know they\u2019re under attack, they\u2019ll stay alert and search for the player for longer before giving up.\n-\tThe franchise\u2019s signature slow motion x-ray kill cameras are more ridiculously gory, with your bullets sending bits of bone and internal organs flying all over the place. And if you ever get tired of seeing them, you can turn them off.\n-\tIt took me 11 hours to finish the single player campaign, which is significantly longer than SE3.\n-\tControls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.\n-\tI didn\u2019t suffer from any bugs or crashes.\n-\tMy framerate never dropped below 60 with most settings maxed at 1080p (i7 6700K @ 4Ghz, 16GB ram, GTX 1080 8GB vram)\n\nThe bad\n\n-\tThere\u2019s more of an attempt at telling a story, as you can talk to members of the resistance before each mission, but none of these characters were interesting. A major character has an exaggerated-a comedy-a Italian-a accent-a which-a was-a kind-a of-a distracting-a.\n-\tThere\u2019s a wide variety of guns to choose from, however the way you upgrade them kind of forces you to pick one early and stick with it. Upgrades are based on in game challenges, for example get x kills to upgrade damage, but they\u2019re tied to each weapon. So if you switch weapon, all of the upgrade counters for that new weapon will still be at 0.\n-\tI also don\u2019t like how the weapon loadout screen lists all the DLC weapons even if you don\u2019t own them, almost like the game is shouting at you \u201chey, buy this DLC!\u201d.\n\nThe recommendation\n\nSniper Elite 4 is a really good game which should appeal to most shooter fans. If you enjoyed the previous game, you\u2019ll definitely enjoy Sniper Elite 4. If you haven\u2019t played the franchise before, you could jump straight in to SE4 without feeling like you missed anything from a story point of view (although SE3 is still a good game, worth checking out).\n\nIf you\u2019re only interested in single player, I would suggest waiting for a 50% off sale, however you might find value in a higher price if you want to put some hours into multiplayer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506103926, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506103926, "recommendationid": "35134238", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537018", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494591014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 905, "steamid": "76561198148385124", "num_games_owned": 83}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's absolutely awesome, not very long but it's very fun and a bit of replayability too, such snoipe much nazi", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506449250, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506449250, "recommendationid": "35227037", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507133422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1924, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 36840, "steamid": "76561198218822855", "num_games_owned": 14}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fantastic game that gets better every time you play", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505199008, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505199008, "recommendationid": "34896201", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503826716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 281, "steamid": "76561198343617648", "num_games_owned": 43}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Law-abiding sequel, the overall feeling still worthy of this special bar ~\nThe game is mainly burst eggs, oh, no!

If this was the only Sniper Elite game, I would give it a thumbs up.  But these reviews are meant to be a guideline, a comparision, and a easy way to seperate games from other similar ones.  \n\nI give this a thumbs down because, quite frankly, it is not better than Sniper Elite 3.  Does it give you the satisfaction of exploding testicles with high powered ballistics from 300 yards? Yes, it does. \n\nThe issue I have is that you lose emersion with the horrible voice acting, stupid goals, and retarded AI.  All of the fun stuff that this series has done well IS ALREADY IN SNIPER ELITE 3. The story and acting was actually better in that one as well.\n\nSo, if you are just getting into the series and haven't bought 3, do so. It's cheaper and just as (if not more) fun.
