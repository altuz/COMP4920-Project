Population: Puzzled...\n\nOh, the snow-framed sign might read Scoggins, but this sleepy hallow blends the mind-altered mysteries of Twin Peaks with the folksy charm of Fargo. Thus, the secretive residents might try to kill you, but they'll offer you a bowl of 'hot dish' first. Hot dish all around, you betcha!\n\nThough unfamiliar with the source material, I found the pencil-shaded animation to be charming (especially in the many awkward close-ups). This style allowed for a wide range of facial reactions, fueling both the humor and the horror. Yup, horror, in a puzzle-themed point-n-click. The jump scares are legitimate, appearing unexpectedly and rattling both the player and our puzzle-loving protagonist.\n\nWhich brings us to the puzzles themselves, arguably the weakest link of the whole experience. Puzzle Agent presents a variety of challenges, ranging from jigsaw and rotating tiles to math and logic problems. However, the difficulty doesn't curve, so much as occasionally blip. While several of the optional puzzles (marked with blue) require real contemplation, the main quest is progressed though mostly low difficulty fare, padded out with busy work. The good outweigh the bad, but having jigsaws as two of the final four puzzles is the most whimper of notes to go out on.\n\nIn the end, Puzzle Agent does justify its current $5 price point. Its roughly 3 hour runtime is packed with entertaining dialogue and surprising twists, if marred by the occasional clunker of a puzzle.\n\nReplayability is sadly nonexistent, with static puzzles and no decision points to reconsider. Even a perfect (hint-less, mistake-free) run does not alter the ending, though the second walkthrough was worthwhile, now armed with the knowledge of upcoming jump scares... which still got me..."}]}
