Also the UI could be better, like when you want to rotate a piece, the rotation buttons appear in the corner of the screen, whereas they'd obviously belong right next to the piece. The AI also isn't too stong but in the higher levels it will punish you for obvious mistakes.\n\nThat being said, it's a solid game that I can recommend for chess & laser fans. And get the DLC too, the Beam Splitter does add nicely to the complexity.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503011843, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503011843, "recommendationid": "34317079", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505738", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504848227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 324, "steamid": "76561197960781830", "num_games_owned": 209}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Good thinking man's game, similar to chess in many ways, but much more complex.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504204538, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504204538, "recommendationid": "34640779", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502719", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 50, "total_reviews": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
