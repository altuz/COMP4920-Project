This is a terrible slapped together remake of that legendary game. I can forgive the sub-par, late 90s 3d models that got no upgrade for PC. I can forgive the semi-locked, terrible frame rate that dips to 15fps in some battles and maxes at 25-30ish in others. I can forgive the fact that hardly anything was improved or optimized for PC over the 3ds handheld version (I can barely forgive that... mind you).\n\nWhat I absolutely cannot forgive? That the devs were SO incredibly lazy that they left the original viewing distance of the overworld and dungeon maps zoomed in as they had to be on a hand held system. Seriously. Look at some pics of the screenshots of characters walking around. There is NO zoom feature. You literally have to check the map every 3 seconds because you can't see the landscape around you.\n\nThis is one of the laziest ports I have ever played. I wish I could get my money back for it. Good job, Square! Not that it surprises me. You used to be the kings of the RPG world and are now barely a shell of your former company. Please. Do NOT buy this horrible port. Get an emulator and SNES version of FF2 or any way you can play that version. This PC version is absolutely horrid and should be deleted from Steam.\n\n1.5/10 (the 1.5 is simply for the nostalgia provided by the music in the game, the actual game gets a 0)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506739016, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506739016, "recommendationid": "35320079", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511629", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503006328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1356, "steamid": "76561198060022443", "num_games_owned": 135}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "A really good game, I am not done yet since I love to take my time and do every little special event in these type of game.
