Common gameplay features include getting one-shot by a common enemy because you suck at dodging, playing a confusing Japanese card game that you're too lazy to look up the rules to, drinking LOTS of sake, beating up random passerby and forcing them to become slaves in your dojo, melting down thousands of z-tier weapons to get enough scrap metal to upgrade your poopy katana into a big boi katana, [strike] romancing lolis [/strike] helping out the british consulate, sneaking into the women's homes and making magic happen, kicking children, and enduring HARDCORE BDSM. \n\nAlso there's this chick named Melinda Megamelons. You can't go wrong if you're game has a character named Megamelons.\n\nDELICIOUS TIME.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505614691, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505614691, "recommendationid": "35012009", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508350", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 554, "total_reviews": 702, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 148}}
