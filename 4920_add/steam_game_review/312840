We will venture into story through playing a several heroes: a guy, who make a murder and couple of detectives, who searched him.\n\nMost time of action scenes in game will be Quick Time Events. If you dont like QTE and you dont have any type of gamepad - I better not recommend to buy this game (in mine 16-en I was playing in this game with my older brother on keyboard - he press left circle and got the right, cause he can't do it alone). Always feels a pain to make good screenshot during amazing scene, cause 1 mistake and you have to play damn portion of game till savepoint.\n\nSoundtrack of the game sounds really nice.  Most symphonic tracks, which was created by Angelo Badalamenti perfectly creates atmospehe and reflect emotions of the main characters of the game. Also includes couple of tracks written by Theory of Deadman.\n\nSometimes I replay this game, during some years cause of nostalgia.\n\n[h1]Masterpiece of 2005[/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506887330, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506887371, "recommendationid": "35394395", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514026", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504907391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23, "steamid": "76561198415740179", "num_games_owned": 14}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great for David Cage memes\n10/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504909877, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504909877, "recommendationid": "34824442", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508953", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441393560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 103, "steamid": "76561198022292799", "num_games_owned": 151}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a good interactive game, with a good story.\n\nBack in the day, was one of those let's-try-something-new games that went out.

The QTEs are a nightmare, even on easy. Good news? You can fail many of them and keep playing.\n\nDON'T MOVE OR I'LL SHOOT!\n\nThese words echo through your nightmare as well, as you will hear them many times in the painful stealth missions. Bad news: you can't fail these.\n\nTHIS IS WHERE MY STORY ENDS...\n\nThe times you fail for real, you get to hear these words. Actually, his summaries are pretty cool.\n\nSO\n\nI love David Cage games. Beyond 2 Souls and more especially Heavy Rain are up there in my list of all-time favorites. And yes, his controls suck more than a vacuum cleaner in a black hole. But the story and choices are what makes Fahrenheit one of the best games of its time. Storytelling, music, humor, it's all very well executed in this game. Play on easy, idk how much it actually helps, but it's worth a try.
