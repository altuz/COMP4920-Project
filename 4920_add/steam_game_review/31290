I have a warm spot in my heart for the Back to the Future franchise and I was enthralled as soon as I dove in. Yes, Back to the Future: The Game isn't as fast-paced as I'd like, but it's brilliant done. A well-told story from a different point of view. This isn't Back to the Future in a game, it's a different story, in a different time, with new (and old) characters. Each episode ends on a small cliff-hanger and I always wanted to find out what happened next. \n\nEach episode is about 2 hours long, maybe less if you don't get stuck in various places as I did. More than enough gameplay for a brilliant gaming session. \n\nI did find the controls a bit wonky and frustrating, but that improved with each episode (I guess as they improved the mechanics). \n\nHighlights include an appearance by Michael J. Fox and other actors from the original series. \n\nIf you're a fan of the Back to the Future Universe, then you won't regret pikcing this one up."}]}
