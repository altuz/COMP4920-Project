I am giving it a thumbs up only because it has a 26% approval at the time of this posting. So yes, this is a pitty thumb. I'd give it a 4/10 so it's not great but not the worse thing in the world. It is not worth $10. I got it on sale for $2.50 but I'd try to get it cheaper if I were you.\n\nAs others have said, this is a board game. I see they removed the 4x tag that was on when I originally bought this game. You move pieces around to capture systems that give you resources you can buy ships with. There's no research. Several of the achievements don't seem to be functioning but that's not here or there.\n\nCons:\nLimited unit selection. Build cheap units until you run into the other races, then switch to the most expensive ships you can build, repeat.\nWhen playing against other generals of the same nation they appear to have the same color. It is terrible trying to find the enemy when they look exactly like you, same color and all. I'd say this is the worse con of them all.\nNo notification during battle. It would be helpful if there was a zoom to lost planet feature. \nCard system needs work. You can turn this off though so it's not game breaking.\nBland settings in game maker. You are stuck with a checkerboard pattern. That's fine for an option but there should be other options that change the shape of the field.\nToo far zoomed in. You can fit only five planets at a time and there's no mini-map. You can zoom out but as soon as you click on a planet it zooms in terribly close.\nScrolling would randomly stop working. The HUD would just stop responding and you have to hit esc and move the mouse in the other direction to get it to work again.\nTeam battles are broken. I haven't tested this personally but other reviews have said that you can't win if your ally gets the victory conditions.\n\n\nPros:\nStable- game never crashed which is what I expected from such a low rated game.\nUnique - I've never played a game like this. \nStory- There's a background story to everything in the game. It seems like they were going to make a campaign but changed their mind. Game probably would have been a ton better with a campaign.\nQuick or long games- At the time of this posting I've done 4 games, lost one due to cards, won two small ones and then one a massive game against 3 on free for all. It gives you a lot of variety in the game length. Now if only you could edit the rules of the map more.\nEasy to learn- No tutorial in the game but it's not really necessary. Game can be picked up and played immediately.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495859498, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495859498, "recommendationid": "31988261", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471963", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "total_reviews": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 25}}
