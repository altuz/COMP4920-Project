They do really bring to life the time and place these battles actually happened. Not to mention the tanks... beautifully modelled and animated. \n\nOn the other hand, the completely unrealistic force sizes in battles (like what is supposedly a division-level assault being led by like three platoons simultaneously over a frontage of 3 kilometers) and weirdness in the UI and the mechanics drove me away. I bought the games because I like the setting, I like that there's people out there crafting games about this period and I appreciate jumping into these battlefields, but not because I enjoyed maneuvering platoons on a battlespace big enough to accomodate a battalion or two.\n\nBut something has changed, and oh boy, defnitely for the better. \n\nSince the release of the British module for their Tunisia game Graviteam has introduced the concept of \"battlegroup\" at the operational layer... which means that now you can command a battalion (plus supporting armour and artillery) in a battle. Graviteam's efforts at improving the AI and UI now pay off - these very sophisticated formations and SOPs now fit into the context of maneuvering realistically sized, combined arms forces... \n\nThese Ukranian geniuses have brought about the Holy Grail of tactical wargaming. Namely, a game that achieves at the same time, all of the following: a meaningful operational layer like that of Close Combat the Longest Hour, intellectually challenging tactical engagements with realistic orders of battle and, most importantly, plenty of support (by having an AI that can actually can be delegated the minutiae of maneuvering and organising attacks by fire and movement) to manage all these formations so the game is playable and you receive information in a manageable volume and timely fashion.\n\nRight now only two operations (for the Shilovo DLC) have been converted to the Battlegroup system, and I look forward to see progressively the other operations converted too. Play through these, and you will get to experience the most realistic portrayal of World War 2 fighting I have seen on a computer war game.
