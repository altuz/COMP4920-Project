The world map has hundreds of city sites you can build on, and each city can interact and trade with others. Each city you build stays there, and you can use its surplus resources to develop other cities, or contribute to megaprojects.\n\nThe economy is balanced in such a way that although you could build a self-sufficient city, it is more productive to specialize  in some group of industries and trade. So you end up making rural agricultural towns, polluted industrial centers, busy office hubs, beautiful tourist spots, etc. Each place has a character and a reason for being.\n\nTrade between your own cities is completely up to you, without any buy or sell prices. You could send electricity from a more successful city to a struggling one for free, or also choose to send something else in return. For more conventional trade, there's the off-world megacorporation, which you can buy and sell resources from. The prices aren't very well thought out there, it's obvious the devs ran out of time. But the result of that isn't too bad, it just means many things are not profitable to sell and many things are not worth buying, which is somewhat reasonable even if it sometimes feels awkward (what do you mean I have plenty of oil, but exporting it actually loses me money?!). If you want an export-based economy, you have to figure out what you can make cheaply.\n\nThe maps are very large, compared to some other city builders, and although I never ran into perf issues, others reported them for very large cities. Of course, nobody forces you to build a massive city either, so if you do run into problems, you can just do another city nearby and ship resources between them.\n\nThere are some bugs and awkward UI that takes a little getting used to. You do need to save, because crashes do occasionally happen, especially if you have a lot of mods.\n\nAnd, yes, in all fairness, there isn't all that much new in XXL compared to XL, but I personally feel the extra megaprojects content was worth it (got it for $15, which is more than the current full price), and the whole point is moot anyway if you haven't played the older versions, so don't let the bad reviews based on that deter you from trying it. \n\nIt's the best city builder game there is, as far as I'm concerned.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504998476, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504998476, "recommendationid": "34848747", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503931", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505284350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 510, "steamid": "76561197993403835", "num_games_owned": 666}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Q: Is this a copy of the previous games? \nA: I don't know i never played them.\nQ: Is city skylines better?\nA: Yes it is.\nBut for people with a slow computer/laptop who are tired of waiting 10+ minutes for city skylines to load and even then have huge frame drops, this is the game to get.\nIt's quite a solid city builder game and the fact wheter it is or isn't a copy of a previous game with a few more maps only affects people who have bought the previous version of the game.\n\nI just bought it today and only played for about 3 hours yet i can see myself playing this for quite some time (at least untill I have saved up enough money to buy a new pc and play city skylines again).\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505109617, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505109617, "recommendationid": "34877420", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503245", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507088739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3026, "steamid": "76561198086496634", "num_games_owned": 33}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Poor car drawing when the road connected to highway, cars disappear.\nThe traffic system aren't good.
