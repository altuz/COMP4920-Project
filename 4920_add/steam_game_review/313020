I bought this because it was on sale for like 50 cents or something and had been curious about the genre for a while. \n\nIt's sort of an illustrated choose your own adventure. It is exactly as the title implies, you have to make decisions, and for certain decisions, you forfeit part of your soul. Sometimes it works out, other times it doesn't, or so I assume, otherwise this would be a terrible game and story if you said \"No\" to everything and that was the only way to have something good happen. \n\nFrom what I gather, it's basically a beautiful Jessica Rabbit looking devil trying to trick you into selling your soul. Unless something good comes from the soul gamble, I kind of fear that the entire game will just be you selling your soul, having bad outcomes and then the end. But I obviously have not complete the game yet, so I'm sure there is a better way to win than just going with the \"boring\" choice. \n\nIt's well drawn, although not my particular taste in art, I cannot deny the artists technical ability. However, the drawings lack soul. They're great drawings, but they don't really feel like ART. \n\nMaybe I'm seeing this through the specs of witnessing a new genre, and it really isn't as good as I think. One thing is for certain, this game has officially hooked my interest in the genre. I'd love to play similar games, however, unfortunately teh only ones I have seen are all anime dating simulators, and while I don't have an issue with anime (I actually quite enjoyed a few of them) I don't want to play a dating simulator. So if anyone reads this, and can recommend a good game in the genre, I'd appreciate it. \n\nNow, the reason I recommend this game? It's cheap. You can relax on your couch or bed (assuming you have a wireless mouse), read the story and click your choices. \n\nHowever one thing makes no sense, considering you're literally choosing answers from multiple choices, is that there is no controller support. Literally all they would have to do is allow you you to use UP, DOWN, and ONE face button to select your choice. Kind of stupid that they didn't include it. \n\nBut I definitely recommend it. For it's low price, it's worth getting a couple of hours of enjoyment. Too many people expect to get 3000 hours out of a video game that costs less than the price of a movie ticket, and that's just silly. So buy it.

I wasn't that wrong. .\nThis game's choice of art style is good for an interactive graphic novel. I really like how the characters were designed with their own movements according to their personality\\ responses ,that does make this novel come to life compared to some, although..  I personally prefer a different line in drawings,it is appealing;in its own way.. and so to each, their own. \n Now.. not so pulled in by the story and its characters, as much as I wanted to.. that's not to say that it's\\they're  bad written or boring ..'course I can see why some folks are inclined to think that.. And to add, I haven't finished it yet.Not to be too harsh, but it's this kind of story that makes one want to put it aside and continue it some other time. ..I don't regret buying it, for the price.. and I'm sure I will find the time to finish it. \nSo,so far, it's on this scale of tastiness to make me want to eat it.. eventually.\n\nEdit:\nVery short story. A snack. Liking the idea behind this game. But they could have invested more time into the story..    A lack of connection. There were some tidbits here and there, that were enjoyable.
