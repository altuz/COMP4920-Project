Same strech of background with the same trees reused constantly, character design for protag and foes dont make sense. You hav to shoot blue balls at countryside animals that fire back at you with lasers. The voxel thing brings nothing to the table, the implementation of it is minimal art direction. Jumping is very bouncy and fast. Targeting with blue balls is not possible just shoot forward, making the use of jump+attack even more frustrating to perform. Very generic and uninspired.
