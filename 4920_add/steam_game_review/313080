Do you want to try to rob it? Then BEWARE, ADVENTURER ! BEWARE THE CONTROLS AND THE SLUGGISH MOVEMENT OF EVERYTHING ON THE SCREEN !\n\nThe main problem is managing the actions you want to engage. Your goons are kinda like Sims, they can either do the right thing or completely fail just because of stupid behavior, like standing over a bag of money instead of grabbing it, disabling the ability to pick it up for smarter criminals of your crew.\n\nYou may end up in ridiculous situations where you're in a hurry because your smash&grab went wrong and guards are trying to arrest you. \n\nImagine the scene : You give N\u00b01 the order to go and get the money. Same order for N\u00b02. N\u00b03 is asked to pick up a note and N\u00b02 must keep a guard in control with a gun on his forehead. Here's what happens : N\u00b01 & N\u00b02 put the money in bags, the bags are now on the floor. N\u00b03 doesnt pick-up the note, but instead, tries to open a door you don't have a key for. N\u00b04 stays in front of the guard which is getting a little less intimidated every second.\n\nN\u00b01 & N\u00b02 are standing ON the bags but cannot pick em up because bloody garbage, N\u00b03 is sad because the door won't open and N\u00b04 dies because you couldn't manage to save the entire  kindergarten you're managing in this heist. Result : You rush on the screen to try to give correct commands to your characters, which move incredibly SLOWLY and sometimes do the wrong thing over and over.\n\nConcept is super cool, but the gameplay is clunky, frustrating and not so rewarding.\n\nSorry Sharkpunch, but it's too much for me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498430420, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498430467, "recommendationid": "32791618", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526239", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496971589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1476, "steamid": "76561198052010244", "num_games_owned": 175}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "ON THE POSITIVE SIDE this game is actually pretty good. It feels like Door Kickers but robbing people instead of saving people. It takes a minute to understand the controls but you can get it. So why did I give it a negative review? well...\n\nON THE NEGATIVE SIDE this game could use just a little more love from the Dev team. On day one the game crashed on me 3 or 4 times. Whenever I would place explosives the game would crash. Okay so no explosives, even then if something happened the game didn't like it would crash. I kept telling myself, \"If the game crashes ONE more time I am going to uninstall.\" after about 4 more crashes I finally gave up.

Some of the more challenging heists demand a certain degree of planning and preparation, if you're to perform a flawless getaway. \n\nWhilst this game has a lot to offer, it is considerably undermined by some awkward controls and regular crashes that occurred at the most frustrating of moments.

Some gameplay mechanics such as hostage system are fresh and very intresting and rewarding to use. Each heist lasts from 5-15 minutes on initial playthrough, and you cannot save during the heists. It adds to the tension, and I personally wasnt annoyed by the lack of mid heist saving or didnt find retrying a failed heist a chore. Usually the hardest parts of the heists are in the beginning of them as well, so you really dont need to be afraid of losing 15 minutes of time with every attempt.\n\nWhat is a shame though, that some minor errors plague the game, that make it frustrating for many I believe. What is even bigger shame is, that the developers could have fixed these issues very easily, if they just were willing to give up some of their ideas  (ie. just remove the friendly fire, since the AI is too stupid to make the mechanic work). The game also has a memory leak, and will crash after an hour or so of continuous play, so better quit and restart the game after each succeeded heist.\n\nNevertheless, the game is still a fun tactical action/puzzle game for the ones  who can handle some small but irritating bugs in it.
