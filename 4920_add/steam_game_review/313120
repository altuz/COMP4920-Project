I bought into the early access based on the unique crafting and all of a sudden a 180 degree change in direction for the game means it's not even a feature anymore.

Clothes are pre-damaged in the crash cutscene, massive amounts of clipping when holding items. It's horrible and clunky looking, and took the graphical presentation and polish back about ten steps.\n\n- Boss battles... seriously? The survival and crafting part of the game are completely unfinished and become totally uninteresting after a pretty short period of time, and the development focus is on boss battles.

I like adding new things to the game, but they really need to work on the bugs first. When there is a bug, you're stuck with it for months until they release a whole new patch that either ignores that bug or makes it worse. For example, a while back, there was a bug that made it so you could only cook one food item over a campfire. If you tried to put another one over it, it would just cook forever. The only way around this was saving and quitting then rejoining. Rather than fix this very problematic bug in the next update, they chose to ignore it until a later update. Fast forward a few versions and they made the water extremely choppy. Not like a normal choppy water. I mean that if you paddled, your camera would bounce all over and you couldn't see a damn thing. This made traversing shark infested waters damn near impossible. Then they include a map editor. While a really good concept that could enable players to make and share great islands, it instead is buggier than the game and causes extreme lag if you're near an island that has a bit too many objects on it. Not only that, but each update breaks older maps so any downloaded map would not work for different versions of the game which would render those maps completely useless. The least they could have done is put up a workshop page for islands, but instead you have to sift through dozens of discussion pages to find a map that ends up not working for your version.\n\nEach update they release, while interesting, just breaks the game more and more. For every problem they fix, they create 3 more. It's a shame because the game is a really good concept, but it's just so damn broken that it's virtually unplayable. Keep in mind I can run Skyrim on Ultra graphics with 200 mods with no lag, but then I get severe FPS drops in this game if I decide to move.
