There were a lot of mixed reviews but I thought I'd try it anyway. I liked it. It's much like other point and click games. The story was interesting, the graphics were good and it wasn't short. Without giving away anything, the only thing I was disappointed about was that someone else in the game that deserved justice, didn't get it. It's a fun game if you like point and clicks. I'd recommend giving it a try if it's on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499845431, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499845431, "recommendationid": "33473908", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501650", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502008126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 927, "steamid": "76561198032600765", "num_games_owned": 47}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A great little game.  For sure, the pace is slow, but I felt this was appropriate.  The story is very much about the characters, not random objects.  I enjoyed the setting and atmosphere.  At the end, I could happily have played another game featuring Leonardo.
