I endured it. This product fails in almost every regard.\n\nThe graphics and animations are terrible, they look barely better than the original Playstation.\n\nThe sounds are generic and often are implemented wrong. In the level where you [spoiler] destroy 12 cent's sports car [/spoiler] the baseball bat makes a clanging sound even when you miss. On multiple occasions, I've heard enemies death sound effects when I plant explosives or pick up extra health.\n\nThe controls are terrible and you will die repeatedly (or at least more than usual) if you do not rebind them. The down button crouches, but the up button makes you crouch and move forward. Jump and melee are 1 and 2 for some inexplicable reason.\n\nThe combat is mindless and unfair. You just aim at an enemy and open fire with your infinite pistol or machine gun until they die. You will take hits from the enemies no matter how good you get. The game hides instant death traps behind foreground objects, and I have had humvees drive through walls and kill me.\n\nIn addition to ALL OF THIS, the game is glitchy. As I said before, humvees will occasionally drive through walls and kill you, falling off a building can crash the game, and I've even been hit by a humvee through a wall and ended up outside the play area. I was promptly run over by a humvee that drove through a building.\n\nIn short, this game is terrible in every way. Every way except its enjoyability. For some strange reason, I found an odd charm to it. Its story was as cliche as possible and the gameplay really shouldn't have been fun, but it kind of was.
