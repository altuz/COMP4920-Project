The feel man!\n\nThere are some minors problems that could easily fixed by the DEV at that point and they don't so I guess they don't give a f.. at this point.

It gives you at least 12 hours of playtime. The graphics, sound, and atmosphere are very nice. It's mostly easy to control too. I often had trouble getting the inventory wheel to appear. I found that I'd have to face in particular directions to get it to appear for some reason. If there were things in front of me, it tended to not want to show up. The only other issue was that I got pretty consistent brief graphics stutters every 10 or so seconds, especially if I was outdoors. Even with all of the graphics settings low, it was doing that, and I have a 1080 Ti. It didn't keep me from wanting to play it though.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504812864, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504812864, "recommendationid": "34801148", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502895", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506592418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1402, "steamid": "76561198089479274", "num_games_owned": 62}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this game in v r wow oustanding", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504602058, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504602058, "recommendationid": "34752517", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497573", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482869073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 502, "steamid": "76561198049638163", "num_games_owned": 56}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Bruh this shit is spooky at times and the puzzels are a pain at times but the graphics are pretty good and there is a story with depth and detail.
