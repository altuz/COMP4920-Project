It's not uncommon to have to click on a object 2-3 times to get the game to recognize that you've found something, which is pretty much a no-no when you're dealing with achievements awarded for minimal clicking.  The design of the story can also be prety frustrating here, and it's not intuitive compared to a lot of their other games.  Also, the achievements are a little lacking compared to A.M.'s other games... there's no tier of achievements tied in to the mini-game that substitutes for the hidden object scenes.  Perhaps most egregious of all though, is the fact that several of the objects in pictures are literally hidden COMPLETELY behind other objects.  No recognizable piece of the object sticking out, literally the ENTIRE object is obscured by something in front of it.  Which means in several of the hidden object scenes, you're going to end up just randomly clickling around hoping to find the object behind other objects.  If you want a great hidden object game, check out Enigmatis 2, Nightmares From the Deep: The Cursed Heart, or Abyss: Wraiths of Eden.  All three of those games are much better in their design.  Even Clockwork Tales, a smaller effort, feels of a piece with those three, and the sequel to Nightmares From the Deep, while not as good as the first, is certainly worth playing.  Time Mysteries 2 feels like it was designed by different people, from the cut scenes, to the structure of the gameplay, to the hidden object scenes themselves.  It's a bit frustrating when played after the standards set by those other games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406988986, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1406988986, "recommendationid": "11521059", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575887", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1407053560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 546, "steamid": "76561198063574735", "num_games_owned": 4883}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 31, "comment_count": "1", "review": "You play as Esther, a lady trying to learn more about your lost family after you receive a letter from a distant relative that suggests you to investigate an old mansion, which is, of course, full of mysteries.\n\nDuring your adventure you'll come across multiple hidden object scenes and puzzles of all sorts of difficulty. The hidden object scenes are nicely drawn, but it's often hard to find the objects because they're quite well hidden and undistinguishable from the others. Most scenes come with a color palette containing many shades of gold, orange or brown, and these can be incredibly difficult to complete. Nevertheless, there is a hint button that recharges almost instantly, in case you get stuck.\n\nThe novelty that this game brings is the travel device that allows you to travel to important moments in your family\u2019s past, and the actions you do will alter the future scenes. The device also serves as an incredibly helpful map - you have different symbols for the rooms you need to visit (those that have incomplete actions), for the unexplored rooms and for the scenes that change due to actions in the past. It also serves as a fast-travel device, even within the same time.\n\nI found the game very enjoyable and interesting, but I wouldn't recommend it to people that are beginners in this genre because the difficulty of the hidden object scenes will probably set them back.\n\n[quote]More reviews on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/lillyscorner/curation]Lilly's Corner Curator page[/url][/quote]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1407055083, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1453061286, "recommendationid": "11531579", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532918", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1407532061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 667, "steamid": "76561197974247947", "num_games_owned": 147}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A good quality game of its type:\n\nThe Artifex Mundi engine is very good, puzzles all good with a lot of variation.

TM2 is a solid P&C/HOG with a decent story, 'okay' graphics, and acceptable VO (btw - I'm referring to the voice acting and not lip sync, which is often off). Mini games were the standard fare. I enjoyed the art and the upper-moderate difficulty level of the hidden object scenes. Also, know there's no storyline continuity lost by passing on TM1 and starting with TM2 (i.e., you won't be lost in the story by starting with TM2). The game played well on Linux Mint 18.\n\nThe main issue I had with the game was regarding the high degree of backtracking required (which I don't [i]necessarily[/i] consider a bad thing) in context of the configurability of the difficulty settings (two choices: Regular Mode or Expert Mode).\n\nI prefer to play these types of games without the active areas being given away by sparkle (or otherwise indicated by anything other than cursor change on mouseover). To achieve this in TM2, you set the difficulty level to 'Expert Mode'. So far, so good.\n\nThe issue for me came later in the game when I wanted to see the map locations of the scenes with available actions (which requires you to be in Regular Mode - which turns the sparkle back on). As many reviews note, there's a lot of backtracking required in this game. And although you often know which items are required next, much of the time those items' location is not deducible, nearby, and/or apparent. Once you have all the levels and scenes opened up, there becomes a somewhat overwhelming number of possible locations (and many times there's only one action available at a time in the whole game). So your choice is to systematically backtrack the entire game (scene by scene - area by area) to find the required item in that one - just now made active by your most recent action - hidden object puzzle or switch from Expert Mode to Regular Mode to see the next available action (and then switch back to Expert Mode to turn the sparkle back off). This became tedious for me and I found myself wishing the devs had made the difficulty level more configurable.\n\nI get that this issue stems from a personal preference and may not bother anyone else. But I thought I'd mention it as it was the main negative I experienced. Besides that, I have no problem giving this game a recommend.\n\nPS I almost exclusively play offline.

Entertaining, in a way. I had already played a similar one and, for the price (I got it on sale, of course) it wasn't bad. Hidden object scenes are beyond boring, but I knew what it was before I bought it. Also the mini-games that you can escape to are boring, but that's not so bad either.\n\nNot so cool that you can't save your game, then go back and correct something or do it better; the game saves its own progression and puts you back where you were everytime you log back in.\n\nWhat unleashed my fury:\nI finished the game and started the bonus adventure, called \"Save Esther\". I was in the doing a puzzle and decided to close the game to continue later.
