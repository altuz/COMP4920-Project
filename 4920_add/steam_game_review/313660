One of the best roman games i played, and on sale with all dlc its not that pricey. The game is largely about logistics, since you don't personaly fight the battles yourself, but has a lot of strategic depth. It also has just the right about of scripting to keep as acurate as possible to history, without feeling railroaded. However, if your expecting a top notch graphics game, or something more sandbox like, then this is not for you. \nAs for performance, this game has never crashed for me, it lags if your really zoomed out on the map", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500405591, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500405591, "recommendationid": "33636390", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505882", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504034278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 620, "steamid": "76561197965447908", "num_games_owned": 74}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Edit: Pass this game by, the 30 day turns ruin the game and the only purpose they serve is to artificially help the AI. There needs to be a mod or DLC that changes the turn length to a week or so might make this game believable.\n\nOld review -\nBoring and generally a bad design, but it gets points for trying. There are so few real (non-RTS) based strategy games, you could give this one a try. The game is complex and deep, but, by far, the biggest challenge is overcoming the game design. DO NOT PLAY FOR HISTORICAL ACCURANCY. The names, dates, and locations are accurate, but the game play isnt. Ai runs single units around like mice, 30 day turns are used to help AI seem smarter, senarios are made with pre-planned outcomes (no what-ifs). Some of the senerios play out as if it has scripted AI. If the senario wants the AI to get to a town, your army will stop moving. In my current game my army is plotted with a 28 day move up only moves one zone per turn just so the AI can get ahead. IF my army is limited in some way the game should not display my total move as 28 days.\n\n I would have returned this game, but I am over the time limit. I recommend people to play for 30 miuntes and if you have ANY doubts, return it without a second thought\n\nEdit #2: Most importantly, the game is unrealistic and feels broken because of the one month turns. You can have an enemy army on the other side of a river and you decide \"I will attack\". It might take 2 days to cross the river. Once you end turn you will waste 30 days to start the battle. If the enemy retreats one zone, you are 30 days behind. The Ai will detatch units and run them around your flanks and run across a dozen zone before you can even engage one of their units. No general in history stuck to a one month plan no matter what. This alone makes the game unhistoric. In one of my turns I was determined to use all of my 30 days of my turn and I ran my army around in a circle. This was one of my single greatest turns because I caught so many 1 and 2 unit armies that the AI made. \n\nIt is unbeliveable to think that Caeser would say -\"Ok troops we are going to march North for 30 days.\" Sergent says -\"North Sir? The scouts say the enemy might be on our west flank.\" Caeser replies - \"Well we will march for 30 days and see what happens after that.\" THIS WHOLE GAME IS BUILT AROUND SEEING WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 30 DAYS HAVE PAST.\n\nThe game does not make it clear what is important and what isnt. And things that are important are not emphasized. The UI is a pain and is not clear. It took a bit of reading in the maual to figure out the \"build\" button was actually a little Eagle figure that looks like UI artwork, not a button. I just count that the UI has about 56 differnent elements and all of them look like boxes or buttons, execpt two. WHY JUST THOSE TWO?  Its like they got toward the end of the design then saw the UI looked ugly without art work, but simultaneously realized they needed two more buttons. Game designers - \"Hey lets throw the players a curve ball and make these two artwork pieces actually buttons! PROBLEM SOLVED!\"\n\nWhile playing the first campaign after the tutorial, I have got to a point where all of my armies are immobile (\"not active\" in game terms) and I cant move anything, and the game does not make it clear why. Obviously there is a reason, but darned if I know it. It is bad when I have to fight 6 armies in this campaign and I cant move any of my own.\n\n\nEdit #1: Forgot to mention how hard it is to read the text on some of the windows. Tiny black text on medium gray background. I cant tell if it is the text reading or the game that is giving me a headache.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503955524, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504026631, "recommendationid": "34562577", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504636", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "total_reviews": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 11}}
