I initially thought the girls all looked a bit similar but its quickly clear that each has a deliberately very different personaility from each other.  You get to be their hero - and why not.

So I played on hard... well the SECOND mission it is not possible to surivive until TURN 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! with simple luck, and getting that luck seems to be about a 50/50 chance.\n\nbecause it is only the second mission means there are no particular stategies you can do to survive longer, it comes down to nothing other than iff the enemy hits you or misses on their turns.

Then I was bored and decided to play it again. I had a great time. What an intense ending.\n\nThe art is poor, though to be fair this is a free indie game. There's not many event CGs and most of the times you just have a background and characters in their standard standing position behind the dialogue screen, whose speaker is hard to follow because the name and the dialogue are separated so far apart. If they changed the dialogue box color for each character, like brown for Ava and red for Asaga, it would have been much better.\n\nThe gameplay is... laggy? The attack animation is very basic and takes quite long, and I skipped them a lot, but there's no transition or anything. When you click to skip an animation, the screen pauses for a second and then you're already on the next phase. There's no sliding to close the scene or screen fading out to black and opens up to the next scene. This is particularly annoying during the enemy's turn as you may want to skip a lot of enemy's animation.\n\nThe voice actors are alright. The dialogues aren't voiced and they only speak a few lines during battle. I especially like Ava's voice actor, but Icari's out-of-nowhere tsundere lines are simply horrible.\n\nSo why did I give a thumbs up? It's the well-written story. The conflict the main character is having actually feels rough, heavy and difficult. It's not a story about choosing which girl to date or anything cheap like that. It's about what kind of leader you want to be. You have a ship to protect. Your morals and professionalism are crossing each other, and the romance just makes it even harder. I only care for one of the girls, but maybe that's just me being me rather than the other romance being poorly written. The story builds up to an AMAZING ending, I'm telling you.\n\nI won't spoil anything, but GOD DAMN I'm glad I chose the right option (for me) on that final choice.
