Sure, \"walking simulator\" is the pejorative some like to sling, but that misses the point. It's about discovery. Discovery of the story, the history, the characters. So if you come at in from that angle you'll probably enjoy the ride.  For such a small team the developers deserve much credit for creating a very polished game. The graphics, textures, animation, shader effects, and sound design are comparable with much larger outfits. However it's not without its weaknesses. The puzzles are a mixed bag. Most are \"find the missing piece\" or \"match the picture\". But some had me searching for ever for that less-than-obvious missing piece. One in particular had a pretty obscure solution that I only managed to \"solve\" by intuition and luck. And another felt like they had designed a bigger puzzle but then turned it into a simple \"missing piece\".\n\n[b]In summary:[/b] decent story-telling puzzler with a few rough patches. It's short (about 8 hrs for me, and I explore [i]everything[/i]). But well done for an indie game.

Anyway, My save file says 4 and half hours? Feel Free to check my Achievements, I have completed the game with both endings.***\n\nThis game is 100% PURE Lovecraftian Goodness :D I have been waiting a long time for a new game to pay so much attention to detail and source material as this one does. If you are a fan of Lovecraft's Cthulhu Methos, or just \"Out There\" type Horror and Story Telling, then look no further, you have found your current destination.\n\nI was very much prepared to start running and hiding as some due to the description given on the store page, but to be honest I used these mechanics very seldom. The game is more of a Walking (Run to speed things up)/Puzzle game. Normally I'm not a fan of puzzles, but these were presented in a way that worked very well, and was not to difficult after a moments reflection. Now, you CAN Die. There are a handful of parts were running is necessary (a very nasty area were you are being chased by multiple ... things, immediately comes to mind. I have read that most people had their only real progression issue with this area, and rightfully so. I was fortunate enough to get past it on the first go and didn't exactly realize how much I lucked out until reading discussions on this area after the fact. Pure Luck.).\n\nHonestly, I wish the running for your life parts (they are very few) were not in the game. Just the story, exploration and general visuals/hallucinations would have been more then enough to make this a solid experience with out the sudden \"Oh, Lets run away now... no really its not a hallucination THIS time, Run!\"\n\nI can go on about the references this game offers, I could talk for hours on why I feel this is one of the best Lovecraftian games I've played since .... well since recent memory anyway, but that would lead to spoilers and I think I have babbled enough about how awesome this game is. So, lets just get to the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros :\n*Deep Lovecraftian Storytelling, taking place a few years after the events from one of his more famous works \"At the Mountains of Madness\"\n*A pretty tight narrative. I tend to get annoyed by to much monologue in games, but this one sets a very nice tone and was quick to get to the point as you progressed.\n*ATMOSPHERE! This game is overflowing with it. From the moment you select New Game the creepy and all to ... alien environments grab hold and you find yourself wanting to stop every five feet or so just to take it all in.\n*Multiple Endings and Collectibles with Back Story. These kind of things always make for an enjoyable replay. Note, I have both endings but haven't found all the collectibles yet. (Maybe Steam will update my play time next run.)\n*True Horror. No Jump Scares. This game sets a tone. From the moment you start, you feel that you are being either watched or are simply just some place you were not meant to be. The creatures are mostly telegraphed but this doesn't take away from the tone or the atmosphere. If anything it gives you a moment to realize what you are up against.\n*Great Level Design. Its Unreal Tech so yeah we know its pretty, but what Im talking about is how the levels are pieced together. The environment just flows as you progress, much like the story itself.\n*Lovecraft. Lovecraft done right, with respect to the source material. This in itself is a Major Plus.\n\nCons :\n*Its kinda short. Like I said I beat it in about 4 hours and change and was able to reload the last area to get the alternate ending. This will come in handy for replays sure, but the story was so good. I do wish it had been an hour or so longer.\n*The Chase. Maybe ... two or three times that I can think of, you are in any real danger. You spend so long doing the puzzles and following the story and admiring the environment that when it does eventually happen, your a little stunned as to what to do. \"Run away you say? What button was that, I haven't used it the last hour or so...\"\n*(This one is more of an opinion) No Native VR. If any Horror Game out there should have been in VR, its this one. The atmosphere is practically begging to be as immersive as possible, and it succeeds, largely. However, VR support would have made it sooo much more then what it is. I used VorpX drivers to play the game in VR. Its not a perfect solution but it does work.\n\nHope the Review wasn't to dull and that some people found it helpful. Ill be doing a second run probably tonight, the play time according to Steam is .... annoying my OCD to say the least.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505655375, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505661413, "recommendationid": "35023672", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501112", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505059108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 683, "steamid": "76561197974824013", "num_games_owned": 271}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pure awesome game!\nI really recommend it even if you aren't familiar with the lore!
