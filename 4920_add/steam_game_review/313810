You'll explore and fight enemies. Unlike most action platformers, this one focuses more on fighting. Which is strange because there are not that many enemy types. You fight rats, rats with bombs, gorillas with axes, gorillas with maces, (teenage mutant) ninja turtles, crocodiles, and various animals and plants. But then you have the most difficult enemy, the camera. This is most easily one of the worst cameras in any video game. In tight spaces you're definitely fighting it. Aside from that, combat doesn't have much variety and feels like a chore for the most part.\n\nExploring is mostly just doing what the game wants you to do. Platforming has the same problem that combat does, in that you're fighting the camera a lot trying to not fall into pits. Pits are strange because falling in one makes you go back to the last checkpoint instead of just losing a heart, so if you fall in a pit during a fight, you'll have to do the whole fight again (and your health is what it was when you fell minus 1). Puzzles are mostly finding a number of cat statues (seriously, why so many cat statues everywhere throughout the world?) to continue, and they're not incredibly hidden.\n\nI also had a problem playing on a 144Hz monitor. With vsync on, the game strangely ran at 93 FPS constantly. But animations are at least somewhat tied to framerate, as cutscenes were always messed up for me. Characters ran too far and were obviously not where they were supposed to be, and right at the end of the game, there was one hazard that I had to die to the first time because the sped up animation made it kill me before I could move. Luckily the game lets you skip cutscenes you've seen, so I just did it again and skipped that so I could actually progress. So it was nothing gamebreaking, just really annoying.\n\nAnother thing that really irks me is the target audience. I thought it was for children. The main character is a kid and is pretty terribly voice acted, and the theme and appearance is mostly happy (excepting the whole being conquered by an evil race of gorillas) and cartoony. But it has quite a bit of cursing in it, which makes you wonder who this game is for.\n\nOverall, this is a very forgettable game. I'm not sure why they remastered it honestly. It doesn't do anything new or do anything the best, so you're missing absolutely nothing at all by not playing it. And it's not the most fun game ever, and I'm sure I'll completely forget everything about it in a month.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498101163, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498101163, "recommendationid": "32633188", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513931", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 36, "total_reviews": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 19}}
