It is a nice idea, but poorly executed. This review contain bits of the story that you would comprehend by playing it.\n\n[h1]Where it shines[/h1]\nAs I have mentioned before, [i]See No Evil[/i] has an awesome idea behind: the majority of humans have decided to cover their eyes to hide themselves from the evils of the world, and you are a Seer - a person that decides to keep their sight, and therefore you are persecuted by the society. Enemies will hunt you through the sounds you make - and eventually, by your scent -, and you can activate or deactivate walls by screaming or by the sound of your footsteps. Great, isn't it?\n\nAlso, you find more about the story through the narrator every time you complete a level, and they have done a neat job with the voice acting.\n\nIt's great to add that this is a cheap game and I've seen it more than once on a 90% sale.\n\n[h1]Where it fails[/h1]\nHitboxes in this game are weird, so you'll see yourself hitting a lot of walls and then having to restart the whole puzzle. Talking about the puzzles, loads of them are unrewarding; I almost never felt that I had thought of something unthinkable, most of them involved only timing and running through places that looked like bug exploits.\n\nIts achievements are all over the place. Some of them demand that you walk through every single leaf or piece of paper in the whole chapter, and this can easily bug and make you repeat a bunch of levels just so you can get it; others would require you not to die a single time during the whole chapter, and this would end up being extremely frustrating.\n\nEven though the voice acting is nice, the Seer's voice isn't. His screams are hideous and playing with an headphone will easily give you a headache.\n\nThe Seer is slow, so a few easy levels end up taking forever to be completed. And the game is really repetitive, I was never able to play more than an hour at once without getting bored.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[i]See No Evil[/i] isn't a bad game, it just isn't as motivating and well executed as I wish it was. I can't fully recommend it because of the flaws I have pointed above, but I am sure that people can enjoy it more than I did.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500140979, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500235141, "recommendationid": "33564949", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519339", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504356447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 508, "steamid": "76561198120530775", "num_games_owned": 219}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game is good.
