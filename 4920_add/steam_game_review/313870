The setting is nice and the background art is really well done. However, the 3D modeling could use some work as well as the animation. It isn't smooth, but if it were an old game, it would be forgiven. The voice acting and jokes are really good but it just takes up a lot of time within the game. You really should give the option of skipping dialogue, especially after we've heard it. \n\nAs I said, it isn't the worst, but it's not the BEST. I was interested in the story and the art was really well done in the introduction. As for the gameplay, it could use some work revolving around typical point & click games. Let us skip dialogues, give us a button to access inventory, and make the characters move a little bit faster. With those alone, this game could be more tolerable.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498458620, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498458620, "recommendationid": "32802927", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514426", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504932691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 713, "steamid": "76561198138063885", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Beautiful game, I loved it, except for the part where some of the courses of action were so unclear that I had to look up a walkthrough.
