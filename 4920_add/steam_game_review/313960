There is a section where you ride moving platforms through an insta-death laser-wall maze. The plaforms periodically flip over and the bottom side hurts you. This is not even close to fun for me. After a couple dozen attempts at this, I decided life was too short and put the game away.\n\n (** end spoiler **)\n\nTo be fair, I am, let's say, a \"seasoned gamer\" and may have lost my edge over the years.

I [i]didn't[/i] and we'll come back to that, but let's pretend I did.  The very first thing I'm treated with is an unskippable cinematic (I use the term loosely) about something I have neither the patience nor emotional investment in to bother commiting to memory.  The cinematic looks like something a particularly talented teenager, or maybe a professional designer who has really under the pump and just flat out didn't care, might create.  It goes for so long that I had time to reflect on it's nature, and post to Twitter about how games can do many things that film cannot, but creating animated shorts of dubious quality is not one of them.  This is not hyperbole, [i]this is something that actually happened.[/i]  And the unskippable cinematic that I didn't care about was still rolling.\n\nOkay, we can stop pretending now.  What I really did at the attract screen was select \"Options\" to make sure there wasn't anything selectied that would cause my five year old laptop to melt onto my thighs.  And also check out the controls.  I'm going to type this next bit in bold, because if there is only one part of this review anyone reads I want it to be this: [b]move left and move right are mapped to the Q and D keys.  Jump is mapped to the Z key.  Every time you try to remap a key, the game crashes.[/b]  That's right, the game [i]defaults[/i] to a hand-pretzel position for the three most basic functions of a platformer.  I've played guitar for 20 years; I'm used to working my hands into and out of pretzel positions, but no.  I am not going to play a game this way.  I dug around the game install directories for a config file or some such where I could manually configure the keys.  Yes, it's there, but instead of calling the keys by plaintext values they are called by decimal values.  At this point I decided that instead of remapping the keys this way, my time might be better spent plucking my nosehairs or throwing darts at the refrigerator.\n\nThis game might be completely awesome, and I will never no because it is basically unusable.

My favorite part of the entire game would have to be the music in it though, and if I could make a suggestion to the developers, have the soundtrack for sale, because really... it's WELL made.\nThe most downing thing about it is the combat, it's got the same problem as many other games like it... there's no feel of knockback or even hitting the creature. It's just you swipe and you hope that it does damage to whatever you're swiping at, and likewise for the hitboxes of your own character. There's just no FEEL of hitting or being hit. Obviously if you're going for a non-gory approach, you could have the character just explode into a field of those little... orb things that I can't remember the name of :L\nAnother thing is the talents/skills system: It's very cool, but at the same time, it's so completely generic. I like how the orbs can be used for practical purposes like double jump and attacking twice or sprinting, but when you have a tiny little increase like +20% health? It's just not even worth putting in the game... or you could make it +100% health but the curve increases dramatically.\nThe last thing is, you guessed it, the graphics and animations. The 3D look of the models gives a distinction between foreground and background entities, but not all things follow this distinction. An example I can think of is there's this kind of plant enemy which looks any other plant, in the background not looking suspicious at all, and yet it shoots at you. Heck it took me a bit to even realize what was shooting at me. Then there's the absolutely awful platforms and ground... It's so difficult to tell what can be stepped on and what can't in this game. Above all that though is the actual style of animation. It looks so bad it's like a little 6 year old was using a model maker for the first time. FOR THE RECORD THOUGH: I thoroughly enjoy the art of the backgrounds and the title screen and such; it's really well made.\n\nNow I know I'm recommending the game, but I'm doing it for the sole reason that I think it's worth the 5 dollars they're asking for it. If it were any more, say 10 dollars or something, I'd say no to this thing faster then a damn hedgehog on wheels :P", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405486056, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1405486056, "recommendationid": "11267221", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509522", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1409255891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 405, "steamid": "76561198052769237", "num_games_owned": 534}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game would be good if it worked reliably.

It's not something I would tell most people to buy, but there is a certain type of person who is going to be all over this.\n\nThe closest comparison I can make for this game is the Valley Without Wind series, but it's not nearly as deep (or interesting, if you ask me). This game is about ten times jankier, though. I shit you not, this game really feels like it was made by aliens, or some rudimentary AI with Game Maker or a similar creation toolset. The default controls include, and I am not kidding, Q to go left, D to go right, X to jump, and S to crouch. The text was clearly written in French and probably machine-translated for the English release. Massive amounts of the art assets don't match, with some being bright and pixellated, others being more subdued, and others still being 3D or a pastel style or... it's jarring, and makes it incredibly hard to tell what's a threat and what's environment until you've blundered into something. Bosses seem staggeringly untested - the first was a massive HP sponge whose health bar ticked down a single sliver at a time whenever I hit him in his weak spot, until he suddenly died about 1/3-1/2 into his bar in an explosion of health powerups. Similarly, my attack seemed to have a weird ghost-range on it, as did some enemies. That might have been due to the upgrade system though. Also, I'm just going to throw this out due to the genre it's in: don't make lava or some surfaces instakills. Plenty of this genre rewards slipping or taking a risk by letting you pit damage rates against your health and see if you can get a new powerup or some kind of item from it. This game just goes \"screw off and lose your cash, sucker\".\n\nHere, though, is why I am giving this a positive review and suggesting you try the demo to see if you're the target market: it's a Metroid clone with a bizarre tacked-on skill system and Souls-series-like currency for upgrades that you lose if you die but can regain if you get back to it... etc. Where it gets friggin' insane is the fact that things which you would expect to be powerups in any other game (double jump, health upgrades, dashing, etc.) are now skills on a tree which you spend your \"energy\" on. But then there are random powerups you find as you go, like a longer-range attack. There's also a choice of protagonist at the beginning of the game for some small tweaks in stats, although I didn't try the second to see if they had a different story. It's not like I was going to understand it in any way. (I cannot stress how poorly the game's English translation is handled. Multiple times it gave me directions or orders which were just entirely incorrect, if not opposite of the truth. Check your map, not the dialogue.) Some of you are going to see the issue in the above: this makes sequence-breaking or exploration something locked to grinding, given that a lot of your traversal powerups are locked behind massive gates of currency costs, and not your finding them. \n\nHere are things the game does well, however: save points double as fast-travel, the game allows you to leap from the air for more creative platforming at times, later upgrades on your skill tree like short-range teleportation or the jump height boost allow for early areas to become quick jaunts on revisits.

Didn't use much else for conveyance after that. It took quite a while before I put energy into any skill tree that would make me a better fighter, but enemies can be skipped mostly and do not yield as much energy as exploration. Early bosses are doable without combat skills and the fights themselves are pretty interesting. Some felt like a bullet hell at times, or just hell. I cheated against that secret boss by teleporting back to a checkpoint. It took a long time. Trying legitimately I never got past its second phase.\n\nIn the very final area, if I went from the bottom east to the bottom west the background would suddenly become black and my character and enemies would be flickering and if I kept walking I would fall through the floor eventually without being able to teleporthax back, so I lost some progress there. I tried it three times, and it happened every time. Going west to east was fine though. The screen also froze randomly at times for a few seconds but that has been happening with everything I do lately so.. yeah.

I thought it would be a fun little explore-the-world and gain-new-abilities Metroidvania type deal, which it is, but only by technicality, I suppose... also, minus the fun part.

After spending a decent amount of time figuring out a configuration that worked for me, I was ready to go.  I found myself wandering aimlessly for a bit, finally started making progress, experienced an in-game crash, and beat the first boss. I found myself bored by the experience. But the big thing that made me decide to abandon this game was when I realized that you needed the mouse to aim projectiles at enemies and, therefore, using a gamepad wasn't a very good option.\n\nLack of fun factor aside, the game has some pretty graphics, albeit with varying artistic styles of different objects that clash quite abraisively. It also has some decent music. All-in-all, the merits are too few for me to recommend this game.
