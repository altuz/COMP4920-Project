Created by a lone developer, it's stripped down to focus solely on the combat -- a couple paragraphs of story, simple but functional graphics reminiscent of an uprezzed Unreal, no need to unlock moves, no bloated combo lists, no puzzles to solve, no RPG elements, just room after room of different configurations of evil robots to hack to bits. \n\nFortunately, the combat system stands up to the weight placed on it. You play some sort of robotic samurai, and can use a mix of standard melee slashes, special moves that work well against unshielded enemies, and powered attacks that cut through shields better but drain an energy meter that you also need to use for rocket dashes. The rocket dashes are one of two main defensive options -- they give you a lot of speed and maneuverability, but no invincibility frames so you have to make sure you actually get clear of whatever's attacking you. The other defense is a parry that blocks any melee attack and chains into an EMP blast retaliation that breaks shields and stuns the attacker, but a missed parry leaves you stationary and vulnerable. There's no scoring system, but effective play has a nice satisfying flow to it, and using all the available tools to pick apart varied groups of enemies is quite fun. It's especially nice to feel yourself getting better at the game when a particular encounter has killed you a few times and you go back and wipe it out with ease (I probably had a dozen deaths on the final boss before going unscathed when I finally beat it).\n\nMy biggest complaint is the controls not being remappable -- they're functional for the most part, but have some odd choices that took a long time to get used to (lock-on on LT, parry on X, attack on Y). Besides that, some enemy configurations wind up a bit heavy on passively running in circles while waiting for an opening to go on the offensive. \n\nIt's a nice, tight 3 hours (for me at least, playing on normal and getting a few game overs during that time), and ends right when it's explored the combat system and before devolving into excessive repetition. A real steal at $1, a bit more of a gamble at the standard $5, but if it clicks for you it'll justify that price. If nothing else, I'd at least recommend putting it on a wishlist for the next sale or watching for it to show up in an indie bundle.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435803480, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435803480, "recommendationid": "16836784", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539799", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487657677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1172, "steamid": "76561197998943420", "num_games_owned": 772}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Proxy Blade Zero is a simple yet satisfying robot swordfighting game that rewards quick reaction times and knowing when your attack opportunities are open (this aspect feels similar to melee combat in the Souls games - at least for me - as most of the time you can't just run in and mash the attack button). The combat feels good and pulling off a good string of attacks/dodges without being hit is challenging, yet fun. New enemy types have appeared frequently, enemy groups are nicely varied and it doesn't pull many cheap tricks either. Music is great, fits the tone of the gameplay very well and the visuals are done well too. It's not the most detailed look in the world but the animations are good, the robots look good and the lighting/attack effects have a bright, vivid design. If you think this game isn't worth $7 ($5.60 on sale) because of the way it looks then you're a baby, in a big budget cinematic game it's fine to expect top of the line visuals because the story and graphics have to make up for the linear, rote gameplay. This isn't one of those, it's a gameplay focused game. There's no filler, it's just you and the other robots trying to kill you. The only negative I can really think of is the length. Granted there is hard mode and the combat could warrant another playthrough so you'll definitely get your money's worth. Also there are too many pointless achievements (beat a mandatory level, kill 50 of X enemy, dodge 100 times etc).\n\nAddendum:\nI'm sort of disappointed in the amount of boss battles but it's nothing big, it's just that with how fun they were I would have loved to see more of them. Loved the voice acting and filters though, they fit perfectly, weren't too cheesy or trying to be funny and gave the bosses some personality. I'd personally buy a sequel or expansion with more stuff day one if that ever came about.\n\nLast edit:\nI played this on an f310 controller, I can't comment on how it plays with kb+m.\n\n2016 edit: It actually seems to play better with mouse and keyboard, feels more direct and makes fighting without locking on more viable (faster camera movement etc).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406812794, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1477301661, "recommendationid": "11491396", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519645", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1407462502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 86, "steamid": "76561197997598105", "num_games_owned": 314}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 35, "comment_count": "12", "review": "This game doesn't quite feel like it's a finished game, just yet. I'm uncertain if the developer understood what kind of combat system they were making.\n\nSee, while the greenlight page and the developer's blog both made suggestions that it's a similar breed of game to Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, it really isn't. The gameplay ends up being a balance closer to Ninja Gaiden, where one spends much of their time kiting enemies to leave one vulnerable enough to actually deal some damage. Between the wide area attacks, and large enemies with uncounterable (though not unblockable, as I first thought) attacks, and projectile attacks, almost every enemy in the game encourages the player to stay away as defense. This in of itself isn't a bad thing; it can lead to hit and run tactics, which I had initially tried, only to realize that it's near impossible to do so.\n\nExcept, the tools the player has aren't built for kiting, or for hit and run. They're built for dueling. One on one fights against enemies with complex patterns. The parry/counter system is actually fairly well implemented. The player has full ability to defend against melee attacks, and end a batch of them with a counter attack to reverse momentum a bit. It still needs some fine-tuning, because the larger enemies (such as the hammer guys, or the gun-type's melee attack) seem to have the parry window mistimed. No, where the game actually starts to fall apart is the dashing. It's unresponsive, with what feels like a 5-10f startup, it has a limited duration, and because it has a \"special attack\" associated with it, The player can't use it to reengage with an enemy. Especially since the dash attacks are the only attacks you have that can't be canceled with a parry. What this means is that the attack the player is supposed to be using defensively, to wear down enemy armor, is only useful AFTER the shields are down. The player can't dash in and out of range, because the startup is so long that the player will not have moved out of the way by the time the attack lands, assuming they're dodging from reaction, and not trying to predict when the enemy is going to counterattack. It means that the grenades end up being far more dangerous than they should be with the huge window you have, because the player can't use the only way to escape its range in time.\n\nI have other minor gripes with the combat, such as not being able to parry from the counter animation, which means that seemingly open windows for counter attack are actually just a chance to get wrecked. The player can parry from the parry's cooldown, but it can't parry from the counterattack. The overdrive system doesn't actually require variety. It's VERY easy to max it out using only the normal attacks, which I'd eventually resorted to, for reasons I've already stated. Lastly, the game has some minor issues communicating thus far. I didn't realize the grenadier enemies were different from the first enemies I fought until I saw both in the same fight. They have the same animations, and since both the initial weak enemy and the grenadiers have red heads, they look identical. The only visual difference they have blends into the background. The range of a grenade is illustrated by the red circle that initially appears around it, but when it explodes, the game shows nothing, except the player getting flung away. Only the player is thrown away, I should add. I presume it's an attempt to keep the player from using grenades against the enemies that threw them, except that similar tactics are specifically designed for use against the gun enemies when they appear.\n\nDragonsix, or Ben L. Grauer, whichever you would prefer: Redo how dashing works, or Rebalance the enemies for the combat system you actually have. Now, I'm far from an expert, and I can't very well crack open the code and see how well the changes I'd make would work in practice, but I do play enough action games to have some sense of what works and what doesn't, and why. Make the dash FAR more responsive by letting the player cancel into it. Maybe not let them immediately cancel out of it, but at the option to at least cancel into the dash would mean that a surprise grenade can be dealt with in time. In fact, you might very well be able to make the window tighter without interfering with the gameplay. Either remove the dash attack, or make its supposed anti-shield properties far more drastic. The player shouldn't have to worry about accidentally doing a dash attack and being unable to parry because of it. Don't punish the player for being risky, punish them for failing to take advantage of near misses. Other reviews have made suggestions of being able to parry the lasers from the gun enemies, and while that sounds pretty awesome, being able to dash in and out of the line of fire sounds far cooler. Take your pick. Tweak the overdrive system so that it actually requires variety, while you're at it.\n\ntl;dr - Either let the player cancel into the dash so that they can take advantage of it in short bursts, or tighten up the parry system. I'd recommend the former, so you aren't wasting the mechanics you have. Tweak your visual designs so they communicate better.

However enemies are frequently in groups in small areas with little opportunity to fight. Even on easy, this poor balance made the game feel more difficult than DMC on hard.

But I think it's good.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/0-vnPIHXpyM\nhttp://youtu.be/T80pxMECUfo\nFor me the experience of this game was as described, the difficulty is pretty hardcore. You have to be able to react instantly in order to block attacks, with certain enemies there is only a specific window of opportunity during which you are able to damage them. You only have a relatively small amount of health which does not regenerate and you seldom come across extra health. The first boss encounter was hard for me, but it's sequence of attacks appeared to be very scripted. So you can basically learn when to parry and when to attack by rote, but that obviously can take a lot of trial and error which it did for me. I died a lot using that method lol. Another reason that this game was hard for me was simply because I kept pressing parry instead of attack and vice versa. I need to play more to get used to the controls and I'm also probably just not used to the Xbox 360 control. As well as that this is not a game that's ideally played when you aren't fully alert e.g. not after just getting up like I was when I first played. I don't think it helped that I extra slow witted instead of my regular slow witted today lol. Anyway I've actually kept playing and now I've got the hang of the game, it helped to put it on easy difficulty. I got to the last boss which is pretty damn hard. I got him down to like 25% health but then it became even more difficult! I came close to the end but I think it'll take me another full session just to beat the last part of the game! And that is in easy difficulty... One little thing to mention I think that boss is supposed to be able to know you off the platform where the battle takes place. However when my character was knocked out of it he just stood in midair instead of falling. It was an amusing moment =)\n\nI thought the game looked not just decent but good. Yes the models are made up of basic looking polygons and it's not 'AAA' graphics. But I looked up the developer DragonSix and apparently it is a one person team and that this is their first completed title. So I think they've done a pretty good job. My favourite thing was seeing the projectiles that the final boss shoots at you flying past.\n\nI think that the gameplay itself is solid.To me personally fancy (best word I can think of right now lol) graphics just do not matter to me.

X is your Parry. Right Trigger is your glide (a \"dodge\" that isn't, but which is used AS a dodge, if that makes sense). That's pretty much it (and then there is a Lock-on with Left Trigger and another button that cycles your targets, but I never use it). \n\nAny enemy that has a Shield can attack while being attacked. A button-masher this is not; you must be discerning in when you do what. Most actions can be cancelled into other ones - still, the game is very hardcore and very punishing of the slightest mistake. \n\nWhen you encounter a new sort of enemy, the first battle with them is a 1v1 so that you might learn of their techniques. Very quickly, the rooms will mix and match the squads; each battle is challenging in its own way (to be clear, there is no randomness factor, except in the drops). You will die. A lot. \nYou start with 3 lives. Every time you enter a new room, that is where you will respawn. Enemies can drop Health and Lives - don't count on it. Once your lives are exhausted, you start the entire mission over. \n\nEvery aspect of the game is so simple - the main point of the game, the combat, is so rewarding once you can get into the groove of things. It's pretty amazing: Proxy Blade Zero is built around a methodical approach to combat, yet everything about it is so hectic; from watching your Battery Power (used while Gliding) to the stance of the enemy you're focusing on, to rushing to spin the camera around so that you can get a better feel for what you're facing, all while having to react within fractions of a second...

There's no getting around that the graphics are pretty barebones, the environments are often empty and repetitive, the story is basically nonexistent despite being organized as a campaign, and the way you move around the level has a sort of \"my first 3D game\" feel (a series of disconnected rooms with non-animated \"doors\" that are essentially teleports). However, while these make the game feel a little unpolished, they don't make it bad. Many professionally-developed 3D games felt the same way, before developers had the experience, money, and tools required to make the kind of games we usually get today. And many of those early 3D games were still very good. This one is too.\n\nWhat this game delivers is very simple and challenging reaction-based combat. You have only a handful of options - a dash, a parry/counter, and an attack button that can be modified in two different ways to create combos. There are no extraneous gameplay systems, and on top of that, there's no scoring or experience systems to let you know how well you're doing. Instead, enemies deal high damage and there's a limited lives system (rare, these days) so you'll know you're doing okay by the fact that you're not dying. Past that, the distinction between getting by (constantly running and taking potshots at the enemies) and playing well (using your combos as much as possible while perfectly countering your enemies or dashing just out of attack range) is immediately obvious, and playing well is so much more efficient and satisfying that there's rarely a need to try to cheese the AI until you're one hit from death.\n\nThe key design element that makes this game more than a simple combat engine - which otherwise would absolutely devolve into an endless series of boring fights - is the intelligent way the developers introduce and combine different enemy types. Very rarely do any two serious fights feel the same. While some threats are clearly bigger than others, enemy damage is so high that no enemy be completely ignored, and while you deal damage in a small area of effect, your ability to actually lock down groups of enemies that aren't all of the weakest type is virtually nonexistent (unlike some other games, your counter only staggers enemies that were actually attacking you, not all enemies in range). Therefore, you have to quickly and intelligently choose how to approach the group in front of you and which targets to take out first. Fighting a group of enemies that must all be countered is very different from fighting even one such enemy and an enemy that can stagger you when you try to counter, let alone fighting either group while also dealing with enemies that can counter your own attacks or attack from range.\n\nProxy Blade Zero isn't perfect, and probably has limited appeal for a big chunk of people on Steam. People who aren't used to this level of difficulty aren't going to like it, and people accustomed to the way the vast majority of modern games work - with multiple overlapping gameplay systems, well-managed checkpointing rather than lives, or expansive, cinematic storylines - are probably going to be confused by what anyone sees in it. But if you miss simple games designed by small teams to experiment with what you can do with a simple concept - and can handle the lack of polish that frequently accompanied that - Proxy Blade Zero does pretty much exactly what it sets out to do, and is easily worth the low asking price. I can't remember the last time I played a game like this; most developers can't resist at least throwing in leveling and loot systems, and while it's impossible for me to tell if they're only missing here for development reasons, I hope DragonSix keeps this basic design sensibility in mind if they ever make a sequel.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449651501, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449652386, "recommendationid": "19579484", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511271", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442117060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 32, "steamid": "76561197986685988", "num_games_owned": 255}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun little game, well worth the 97 cents I paid.

The parry window is generous, so you don't have to be a royal guard nutter to apply but you absolutely must fight smart.\n\nIt looks a little rough, yes, and is certainly not flashy, but if you watch the videos or get the demo on XBLIG you will certainly taste the craft and effort that went into the combat. There's a real, honest, though-out combat system here and I daresay that it certainly manages to be more interesting on a purely combat-systematic level than Metal Gear Rising. (Not to knock MGR, I love it dearly and it wins out on glamor, satisfaction, excitement, and bosses, but... really, the mook combat in that game was parry parry parry parry slash at giant HP soak enemies parry slice QTE. PBZ is much more grounded but the enemies just do so many more interesting things here in a gameplay sense.
