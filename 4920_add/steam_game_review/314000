You can do all kinds of trick shots. Graphics are very nice. Unlocking the full version is definitely worth it. I do have gripes, but overall I give this game a positive rating. My gripes are:\n\nNot enough unlockables that I like (full version). I had everything I wanted unlocked within a few hours.\nIt's crashed once on me since I bought it, thru 12 hours of game time. I was mid-game.\nControls are not adjustable and I don't like their setup. I've made many shots on accident.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499057651, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499057651, "recommendationid": "33167686", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506633", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1455045674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1720, "steamid": "76561197971079218", "num_games_owned": 916}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Bad game, bad company.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496768809, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496768809, "recommendationid": "32223691", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487642", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 90, "total_reviews": 123, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 33}}
