Everything seems to work, and work well.\n\nThis is a very simple to learn RTS, with good level design (thus far), a pretty good base mechanic, and a brilliant art style (literally and figuratively, the lighting is a bit intense).\n\nThe basic premise is that you control a constantly-spawning highly mutable lifeform, and by taking and holding various points around the map you gain access to different sets of abilities for your units. Basic units spawn at a constant rate, and the biggest challenge lies in determining what to turn them into and where to attack. Resource management boils essentially down to \"how long do I wait before expanding\", which is a simple enough thing to measure.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\nAs I've said, the art design is excellent. Seriously, everything is pretty clear in its function at a glance and the game looks gorgeous.\n\nIt's got a really intuitive interface. Even novice RTS players should be able to pick this up and figure out just about everything extremely easily.\n\nSpeedy matches aren't something I'm used to in any RTS. It's nice to be able to knock out a quick game or two instead of an hours-long slog sometimes.\n\nIt's quickly engaging, and the additional features that are supposed to make that even better.\n\nThe downsides:\n\nIf you're looking for something with a lot of depth, look elsewhere. There aren't lots of resources to juggle, there's no campaign, it is exactly what it appears to be.\n\nIt's really heavy into micromanaging units for a sizeable portion of each game. Towards the end it can get a bit more macro, but misplacing half a dozen guys (not tough to do) can have pretty dire consequences early on.\n\nMomentum is massively important. This isn't a negative thing necessarily, but it becomes pretty clear pretty quickly who has the advantage in a battle. It's possible to come back if you're behind, but there's an obvious tipping point.\n\nYou can't control units while you're zoomed out. That's a bit of an odd design decision and I'm sure there's a reason for it, but it's a little bit frustrating.\n\nAll in all this is extremely well done, and for the price you seriously can't beat it for entertainment value.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424159345, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1424159345, "recommendationid": "14511061", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526723", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468245388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 411, "steamid": "76561198098302160", "num_games_owned": 171}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's an early access game.

Brought to us by indie developer tinyBuild Games, also known for the satrical \"No Time To Explain\".\n\nThe idea is simple, take over all control points on the map before your opponent can. Control points are broken into two basic categories,  spawn points that slowly spawn new troops up to a maximum of five at a time, and evolution points which allow you to morph your creatures into various upgraded forms, like a strong crab like creature, a long range laser canon, and speedy scouts among other variations.  You are tasked with controlling your flow of new units while strategically choosing which path to take and which upgrades to use and balance everything accordingly. All actions are controlled by a simple click of the mouse, and a side panel gives you a brief summary of units available, and selected, and you can use waypoints to help automate some of your troops to specific defense points or upgrades to capture.\n\nBoth offline and online modes are already included in the most recent build. The offline version features a fairly good A.I. which can challenge new comers to the game and is a good way of getting acquainted with most of the unit types, and general gameplay. Multiplayer of course is where a game like this shines, as adapting to a human player's differing strategies and changes of pace are where the real challenge and fun is. With the recent addition of leagues, and ranked play, you can easily lose hours to Boid.\n\nGraphically Boid's 2D graphics are simple, yet colourful and make it easy to identify unit types by their shape, as well as identify enemies. Winning and losing spawn points is shown graphically by quick flashes of light on the screen to give you a quick clue that you may need to investigate elsewhere. The submerged aquatic setting is full of life, and the lighting effects give great depth on what is otherwise a flat world.\n\nAvailable now on the Steam Early Access program at a measly $3.29 CAD, Boid is a steal for anyone looking for an easy to pick up, but competitive RTS. One that is being well supported by the developer with regular updates and improvements.\n\nwww.micbemac.com", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437944073, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1437944073, "recommendationid": "17241372", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502518", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468787064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 644, "steamid": "76561198067127926", "num_games_owned": 60}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "That's a perfect game if you want to play some dynamic rts, but do not want to spend more than 10 minutes for one play session. \nDecent balance.
