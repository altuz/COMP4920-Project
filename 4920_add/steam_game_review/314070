So it was sure that i was going to try this title eventually, which a finally made and damn i made a good decision. Because most baseball of our current era did forget the most important thing that baseball is, the way to be creative when being on bat, on base and on fielding.\n\nPro:\n- Possibility to be creative with our play style.\n- Remind me a lot the game Ken Griffey Jr. on Super Nintendo.\n- Ego system that permit to gradually learn the mechanism\n- Intuivity of the control\n- Divertisity of the way using our control\n- The coaching system\n- The pace of the games (not too fast and not too slow)\n- The atmosphere\n- The fun\n\nCon:\n- No online multiplayer\n- Customisation is very limited\n- The absence of pratice and homerun derby mode, only exhibition and season.\n- In season mode to change the ego, you must quit your season change the ego then continue your season\n- Music is repetitive (suggestion: adding the possibility to use a CD or MP3 player ingame)\n- Missing info about distance of stadium which would be useful about the way to make our line-up depending where we play.\n\nA very good game, with little flaws but pretty much sure the next Super Mega Baseball (SMB2) gonna overcome this!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499982286, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499982378, "recommendationid": "33512744", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507732", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507184888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4143, "steamid": "76561197991624276", "num_games_owned": 156}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Hey! Look! It's Enrico Pallazzo!\n\nThe umpire animation for the Demoralized acheivement references The Naked Gun and that alone is fantastic and I would give the devs a solid high-five if I could. But silly big-heads and charicatures of big-city venues and big-league mannerisms aside, this is very legit arcade-style baseball and strikes a great balance between its learning curve/skill difficulty and its accuracy as a silly/fun baseball sim. It's basically the NBA Jam of baseball games, and it's 100% worth your time if you're looking for casual sports goodness. \n\nOne note on mechanics: conceptually, the 'mojo' stat is a bit hazy at first, but it's basically 'how does this player respond to high-pressure situations' and as your difficulty goes up it becomes a pretty significant wildcard that can influence the outcome of a game, but as a beginner at lower difficulties you can safely ignore it without consequence.\n\nGreat game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503822882, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503822882, "recommendationid": "34524098", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504907", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505095310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4819, "steamid": "76561198070557073", "num_games_owned": 77}, "votes_funny": -1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Warning: This is my first review, so I might strikeout.\n\nSMB is an absolute grand salami! \n\nI've loved every minute of every hour, from the quirky voice-acting and cartoonization to the quality gameplay and mechanics. It can be a casual tandem or verses game with a friend or a challenging Ego 99 season-mode game. If you're into analytics, this game offers a myriad of statistics, player upgrades (that you must use wisely), and player customization. The difficulty system (called \"Ego\") is well-balanced, always offering a harder game if you so choose. Hitting is smooth and does a solid job of simulating real baseball hits considering angles, ball speed, etc. Pitching is similar to most baseball games with a retical to aim for. This is just a quick (and incomplete) summary of the positives.\n\nSome things I would like to see improve: \n\n- A more in-depth season mode. I'd love trading to be introduced and multiple seasons and save files, but I understand the constraints of this request. \n- Baserunning could see an improvement. I sometimes accidentally mash the 'A' butotn to skip and have my player tagged out. But that's more of an impatience thing. \n- I wish there could be a 'Be a Pro' mode, but it doesn't really suit the nature of the game.\n\nHonestly, I can't wait for SMB 2 to release in September and the prospect of future Super Mega Sports Games (think Hockey, Basketball, Football, etc.) has me a super mega fan of this franchise.\n\nIt's important to note that these devs are based in Vancouver, Canada (woot!!!) and have a tiny team, but I hope they are able to expand with the release of SMB 2 and have the franchise take off. \n\nOverall, I fully recommend this game to players looking for both casual and challenging baseball simulation. Definitely worth the price, but you could wait for SMB 2 and the accompanying improvements.

(It's a joke lol, both of them are really fun to play.) This game has some really dope graphics. The character designs are nice. The fact you can see character's emotions, whether frustrated with smoke coming out their ears, crying, or sweat dripping from being nervous when it's bottom of the last inning or there's one out left until the next inning begins is really something you don't see in baseball games. The easy controls made for very intense matches for someone like Muse, who's a beginner in gaming, against Evil. This game is a great pick-up-&-play kind of game.

The simulation is good, the music is awesome(Very catchy), and you get to customize every person on your team right down to their eye color! But there's one downside that's easily fixed. This game is one of the hardest games I have ever played in my gaming history(And I've played some really hard games). And, this has been stated in some other reviews as well, but the catchers in the outfield know EXACTLY where to stand to catch the ball. So it's very hard to get fumbles in the outfield so you can claim some serious bases. But, otherwise this game is awesome! I love all of my team members, the game does a really good job with the player's expressions and emotions. It's like each and every one of my team members has their own personality! The batting simulation is good, the pitching simulation is good, the baserunning simulation, is okay. The baserunners run VERY slowly. It's really hard to claim bases as well. Sometimes, when you're trying to get the ball, and you have two guys trying to get it, one guy will be about to get it, then it switches to the other guy, and you're running in the wrong direction.

I was looking for an authemtic true-to-life baseball game on Steam and it didn't seem to be available. But this game was garnering decent reviews and the sales price was fine, so I bought it. And I love the graphics even though they have nothing to do with a true-to-life sports game. They're all from the Sunday comics. And when they're in a tough situation, they sweat, they pound their bats they get looks on their faces. Love it. Hey, baseball is supposed to be fun, and this is a fun game. Teams are made up of guys AND gals. Its not multimillionaires in pinstripes. I think of this game in the same vein as watching a minor league baseball game, and that's not bad at all.\n\nI'm using a keyboard and there are a lot of complaints about that. Yeah, some of the instructions are poorly thought out and the keys don't respond very quickly. But that's what exhibition games are for, to learn the layout of controls. And if you google keyboard controls for Super Mega Baseball, you'll get a pdf page with all the keyboard controls. My biggest wish is that there was some way to save games in progress rather than go a full 9 innings.\n\nEDIT: I've now played 1 full \"season\" and the controls are simply awful. For example, with auto-fielding (the default), bases empty and my team pitching...a ground ball is hit to the shortstop, who picks it up and throws it...to 3rd base. And this goes on and on and no way around it. Shesh. For 4 bucks, whaddya expect? If you spend more...well, its your money.\n\n2nd Edit: I've discovered it also doesn't follow MLB rules. As the defense, I've had a man on 3rd with 2 out. A ground ball is hit to the second baseman, who tosses to first base for the 3rd out - but the runner from 3rd base scores - WRONG!
