Frayed Knights.\n\nIt is one heck of a good game!  It has it's pros and cons though.  But I beat it, and here is what I think.\n\nLet's get the bad stuff out of the way first.\n\n1.  Items and spell descriptions - Some of these can be totally wrong (I'm looking at you Peel Armor and Potion of Resist Disease), so it can get confusing.  But once you figure out what they are, it isn't bad.\n\n2.  Quick spell slots - Only 3?  That's right.  So most of the time, you'll forget about your other spells.  That is a pain.  I'd suggest priniting out a spell list for yourself.\n\n3.  Stars - Though this mechaninc is neat in itself, losing it when you have to quit the game because of an emergency or something else while in battle ... and you LOSE all the stars you got?  I can live without that.\n\n4.  Skill descriptions - Some can be pretty easy to figure out while others?  I still have no idea what they do.  Eh ...\n\n~~\n\nBut the story (which I was very sad to see end) was great.  There was a few twists in there that caught me off guard, and my dad and I had a few discussions over dinner on what we thought was happening and who the bad guy/girl was.\n\nI did a Let's Play of the game on my You Tube channel which you can check out here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMRlAJ5VsPJWTIk-cWHFKiUyr4sgxy_Ed\n\nAlso, I did a bit of research, since at the end of the game, the party had hinted at a second one in the works.  I found this page on the creator's blog http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=7763 which was back in 2014.  I tried contacting them about it, but no luck.\n\nSo if the developer reads this, I hope you continue to make Frayed Knights 2!  Arianna, Dirk, Ben, and Chloe are all ready to continue their adventures.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495563157, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495563157, "recommendationid": "31922028", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
