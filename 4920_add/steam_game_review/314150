However the main controls are delayed if they register at all. Single button clicks work fine but any combination combos like jump kicks or elbows you can forget about using. \n\nIf it wasn't for the poor controls these games would be perfect. In the current state, do not recommend buying.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504915814, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504915814, "recommendationid": "34825696", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502753", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 100, "total_reviews": 186, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 86}}
