Of course, it still has setbacks in the realism department and internal coding constraints like being stuck in 32-bit rather than 64-bit architecture remain.   A plus is, it runs on older computers which makes for a great nostalgic return down memory lane or if you're new to flight sims, makes for a great first low cost sim.

I know thats a terrible review but ANYONE thats been playing Microsofts Flight Sim's can tell you they have a Special charm to them which makes it easy to pick up and play.  The controls can be very simple or hard, But never in my opinion Arcade like.  Fsx STILL holds its weight even today IMO.  not many other Sims can say that.  Im an avid gamer and i love simulators of all kinds.  But once a year or so when you dont havbe any games you feel Like playing, I always find myself going back any flying my Favorite flights.  Through the mountains in BC or that tough weather flight with a big plane and a small run way.  FSX Is aways there to take up your times when you have nothing else.

Unlike games like Xplane, you can use ANY USB controller/joystick you want, plug in as many as you want (As long as you have the amount of ports, that is) and you can add stuff like radio stacks and even a hardware GPS. I dismantled an old joystick and used a potentiometer (axis) from it for homemade rudder pedals and I was able to easily program it to work as a rudder control, REALLY EASY! The missions are also a lot of fun too, with Tutorials and challenges. The Multiplayer is awesome (Apart from the microphone support, which isn't too good), you can fly with other players and do so much fun things!
