Yes, the fact that it gives you the age of every playable character and each of them seems to be no younger than 15 is a bit weird - but it's an anime game, you just kinda have to put up with the vague undertones of pedophilia.\n\nHow does it play? Well, it's a side-scrolling shooter. I'm biased, because I like my shmups vertical, but if this is your kind of game then this has to be one of the better ones. In my view it was a little slow going and there are a couple of gimmicky mechanics which the game could do without, but its still a solid bullet hell. Unless you're a fanatic of the genre it's safe to give this one a miss, but it's still a good game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498259880, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498259880, "recommendationid": "32702198", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492358", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 82, "total_reviews": 83, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
