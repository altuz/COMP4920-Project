As such, it is a much rougher visual novel. However, the basics of their future success are there. The premise here is dark. The world has succumbed to climate change... in a way unexpected by early 21st Century scientists. It now rains all the time... everywhere... which has got to make the cities a bit waterlogged... Especially a place like London, since if the polar caps have melted most of the modern city would be underwater...\n\nYou, Luke, have suddenly had a strange android named Tanya enter your life... quite dangerously (we'll skip the one achievement where you don't meet her). Now, you have to figure out what to do with her... your relationship with Helen... and with your employer who happens to be doing... something beyond the pale.\n\nThere are 24 endings, so take your time and find them all.

The sound quality is scratchy; each recorded voice varies in quality. I find a number of lines to be overwritten, containing unnecessary information where it could have been worded differently or simply shortened to give a better meaning, and this is coming from someone who enjoys a good lengthy novel. It gives off the feel that characters are overplaying their part. Speaking of this, I disagree having the main character read out description and scenario lines like a narrator. Throughout the whole thing was off for me, as you can\u2019t disable voice alone\u2026 so its either deal with this or play a silent game and lose the feel for it completely. The story is very slow to get into and various paths have you feeling like you're heading to one end anyway, I became more bored than intrigued within 5mins of playing and found myself ready to go play something else. I was highly intrigued by the story concept of this game but with so many elements lacking I simply cannot recommend it. This is honestly a terrible throw together of a VN. For someone who normally loves VNs and Futuristic Cyberpunk games, I thought this was a little gem, till I played it. Still if you can get it on sale it may be worth the purchase.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499369424, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499384252, "recommendationid": "33321750", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 21, "total_reviews": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 11}}
