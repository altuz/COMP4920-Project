In my opinion, it breaks this game. There are sections that require precise navigation, and the controls lack the precision to perform those tasks. Additionally, while the game does have some controller support, it still requires a mouse to perform specific tasks. This game also needs full controller support for both Playstation, Xbox, as well as Aftermarket controllers. \n\nThat said however, I can see that the team behind this team have both a good concept as well as great artstyle within there game. I like the Tesla vs. Edison idea as well as the elongated body artstyle. It should be also mentioned that the backgrounds(2d worlds) featured in the levels also look very good. \n\nOverall, At initial release I can't recommend the game. However, if the controls were tighter and the game featured full control support, then I would definitely consider giving this game a second chance.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411946082, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1411946082, "recommendationid": "12283340", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592586", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440436394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 260, "steamid": "76561197984708662", "num_games_owned": 1248}, "votes_funny": 10, "votes_up": 106, "comment_count": "7", "review": "Fresh style, Original story, and the all important Battle of the Millenium, Tesla(Poor Immigrant Inventor) Vs Edison(Corporate Sponsored Douchebag that you think invented the lightbulb).

Right off the bat, the game has no intuitive feel to it. Most of the few levels I could deal with was fighting zombies, but the way you do so is that you effectively grab one zombie in your gun, then shoot that zombie at another. There's a whole realm of issues with that. First of all, there's a long animation of the zombies coming out of the ground before they can be interacted with. Then there's that when you do use this, the zombies bounce straight back at you so if you're remotely close to the zombie you're shooting, you end up getting hurt by your own shot. \"That can easily be avoided by not being close to the zombie\" you say. Well, the field of view is so small, and so much of this involves narrow platforms, that that is an incredibly difficult thing to pull off. Plus, there's a max range for the gun, so it limits you to relatively close quarters combat with something that is distinctly not close quarters suitable.\n\nThe view is also a huge issue because it means it is extremely difficult to see where you're trying to go, especially leaping from ledges, as a large part of the time, there are jumps that one makes just presuming there will be something to land on when you get there. This could be forgivable if not for the fact that it seems like the terrain is semi-randomly generated, and so each time you die, you end up in a new landscape so you face the same issues time and time again, rather than at least being able to learn the particulars of the level.\n\nThe game has, theoretically, checkpoints, but with how poor the level design is, it feels like there should be more checkpoints. It also should correspond much more to events, as, for example, you find a pigeon to help you, but that's in the middle of a long stretch with no checkpoints, so finding that, going on a ways, then dying meant having to go get the pigeon over and over again, rather than having a checkpoint where one finds the pigeon in what I'd consider a more reasonable manner.\n\nIf this game is on sale at it's full price, don't buy it.
