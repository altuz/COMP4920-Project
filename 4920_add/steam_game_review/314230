This game has serious potential. \n\nDon't even worry about hardware requirements: you can lower the resolution (not size of the window, the pixel count) to actually be an 8 bit game. Every graphics setting is togglable. \n\nThe gameplay is absolutely fantastic. The story and the lore is wonderful. It has the pros of AAA games (large open world) and none of the drawbacks (shoving every detail in your face). \n\nThe spaceship centered gameplay/movement/combat is superb. Nailed it right on the bullseye. \n\nThe score compliments everything so well. The combat theme gets your heart pumping even faster in the already intense contention between you and that squadron of enemy ships.\n\nThe out of spaceship combat... is in development... but the movement and the scale of planets gives you a feeling of euphoria as you uncover supply drop after supply drop.\n\nThe spaceship customization I only used for a huge deck where I could see the massive expanse of space around me. It's breathtaking, even in a low resolution.\n\nTL;DR: Those few hours you may spend on this game might be short, but they'll be quite enjoyable.

As of right now, you can literally build the interior of your entire ship, and the game comes with neat ways to customise existing textures by altering colors, and customisable lights.  Flying the ship is fun and intuitive, even though it has no inertia dampening, it's easy to control.  The only thing that DOES get annoying is the clutch.\n\n  The story is entirely optional.  You can fly around wherever you want, although being limited in the beginning to an asteroid field if you don't progress in the story.  The logs you can find are entertaining, and well written, as well as being in an easy to read font, especially as someone with minor dyslexia.\n\n  Planet rendering is fast, with decent heightmaps and terrrain that doesn't get too ridiculous in shape.  Atmospheric lighting looks brilliant, and the art style of the game itelf is pleasing to look at.  Planetary textures aren't too shabby either, and the lighting from ship spotlights or the players flashlight has a really nice distance, and quite a large area of illumination.  One of my favorite features is the holoscreen, which lets you turn any room on your ship into a viewing area, foregoing a standard cockpit view, though I suppose the pilot station fills that role.\n\n  The ship interior customisation is very similar to Doom Builder, if anyone reading this has ever used it.  You can make up to 7 floors, although 2 are quite tiny.  The interior space is quite large, you can make your ship a maze, a small cube and an airlock, or, if it suits your style, a rather phallus shaped cockpit \"wink wink.\"  It's an easy to use system, with a decent amount of options.\n  \n  Combat is a bit easy, but I think it is mostly because of the really slick control scheme.  It's very easy to get your ship to do what you want it to.  The combat will likely get more diverse too, and the ship guns and even the fps guns, limited as both are, feel good to shoot.  The devs update relatively frequently, and the game is by no means dead.  They even comment on reviews!  Furthermore, they even try to help with issues a player might have.\n\n  The UI is easy to read and clicking on things is crisp and responsive.  Performance is nice and smooth, with tons of graphical options to suit your needs and preferences.  The controls are concise and well developed, there doesn't feel to be any artificial smoothing or acceleration, which is a welcome change from all the games with forced smoothing, accel, or even, UGH, negative acceleration.\n\n  TL;DR, if you like space exploration and combat, pick this game up.  This is 15$ that is well worth it IMO.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506340541, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506340541, "recommendationid": "35201238", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500017", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502478566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2042, "steamid": "76561198085489092", "num_games_owned": 101}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A great little game!
