Negatives:\n\n- Many weapons are too weak, have useless fire patterns or their rate of fire is too low. Picking these up is actually a death sentence.\n- Poor level design. Some levels (especially stage 3) don't contain enough space to manouvre while being littered with objects.\n- Poor enemy positioning.\n- Hard to avoid enemy attacks because they'll fire the moment they pop-in while having a short distance between your character and edge of the screen. \n\nI would like to see a sequel adressing these problems because using the jetpack is fun. Get Sinclair's Fist Slash or Alien Splatter instead, those are way better.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501337550, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501352652, "recommendationid": "33881648", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506512", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 41, "total_reviews": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
