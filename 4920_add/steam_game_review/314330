Unfortunately, it hasn't aged well. The graphics are exactly as they were about fifteen years ago. The sound effects haven't changed. The music is mediocre at best; the voice acting is atrocious and sounds like it was recorded on a $10 computer mic. I could have looked past all that, except as I've just discovered, you need to BUY (seperately) a CaravelNet subscription to get access to the 25,000+ levels advertised in the game description. It's not super-expensive, but I already feel like I've shelled out more than this game is worth. I highly don't recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502331119, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502331119, "recommendationid": "34137197", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492134", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
