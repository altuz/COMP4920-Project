It can be summed up with, i've had a blast with this game thus far and am eagerly awaiting what i think will shape up to be a detailed,  unique and interesting take on strategy/3rd/1st person gameplay. The incoming updates (that we can see- helpfully their are 'coming soon' tags on certain buildings and units- will increase its depth and scale and allow for full-scale rampant warfare.\n\nSome key 'loves':\n\nThe Setting- One faction in thus far (and i haven't really poked around much for longter-term hints and notifications on what's up next) and i love the style and 'lore' i guess that they seem to have- cyber-demons..rocking concept, reminds me very much of 'Sacrafice' or 'Atrox' (Ironic being this game could be argued to be  a blend of the two concepts!), so the devs clearly have a vivid imagination and a very 'dark' take on their game-world. Something which frankly is awesome. \n\nThe 'flow': The ease of transition between stratgy mode and first/3rd person is awesome. Its clean, its simple- its what makes this game for me honestly. Its interesting too that instead of the unit being a 'vanilla' one, those you direct control (and it really is/will be 'any' unit) become a slightly more upgraded version- larger and with 'hero' abilities- like being able to jump, jet pack etc- kinda like a mobo hero, plus of course the basic attacks- this adds something a little extra to the take, that other 'mixed genre' games lacked. The leveling of your 'controlled' chap also can have a big imapct on the tide of battle- but of course you can't be everywhere- and this is where the strategy is important.\n\nStrategy- at the moment its limited due to only a few unit types being available, but the bones are there for something great on the strategic front- the maps, taken from the current one in play are very large, there are also 'neutral' critters (A hive in fact) who one way or another can have a major impact on the battle- annoying travelling armies, but also in a major way if you work out how to manipulate/use them effectively ;). Player Controlled characters are game changers usually- though not 'gods' and can be relatively easily taken down by units- what's more as i said they can't be everywhere at once- two pronged attacks and luring etc are great ways currently to add drama to the typical war of attrition of most strategies- defenses are also a thing...and are scary, providing control over areas of importance where you like. \n\nDownside really is that there is currently particulalry one very effective strategy- to amass artillery chaps (awesome design) and cover them until they get in range of the rival hq- 5 or 6 i've noticed can insta-kill it, eliminating that faction- now this only works as said before due to most units not being out and released yet, the balance will definently change with the addition of counters, more defenses, wider bases, air units etc.\n\nAll in all so far this is a game i'm very interested in. A massive well done to the developers- mixed rts/3rd person games are one of my favourite genres, and one sadly neglected so its great to see one done well, and with a bright future ahead of it.

I bought it for $15 which bumps it up to a 6/10.  While I probably won't play it again until I get a better video card, it's certainly just as good if not better than other active RTS games found on Steam, which isn't saying much because there really aren't very many active RTS games on Steam.  I only had to wait a few seconds before it matched me against someone in multiplayer so that's good.  It seems that the resources are self-generated by your main building, so I don't believe there are any resources to harvest on the map so that's a bit disappointing and limits the strategic scope of the map.  My 1GB video card barely meets minimum requirements and so the screen freezes every 7 to 10 seconds for a split second which can get kind of annoying but I'm not entirely sure if it's because of my video card.  I have 16GB of RAM.  The graphics reminds me a bit of 2004/2005 and doesn't seem very 2017ish.  The concept is A+ as I love the RTS concept with the ability to take control of a hero on the ground.  The game in its current state has some build options greyed out and says it'll be unlocked at a future date.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489264262, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1489264262, "recommendationid": "30455753", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496456", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489274997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 22, "steamid": "76561198203870672", "num_games_owned": 63}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "SO FAR SO GOOD, has a great concpet and they had new factions with there own uniqe units", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489275074, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1489275074, "recommendationid": "30458617", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495626", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
