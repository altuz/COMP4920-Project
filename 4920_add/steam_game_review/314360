It was like this for me during every single section. You character is only able to take a few hits, healing is not easily obtained and there is not a large amount of room for error i.e. to make jumps, neutralize and avoid hazards. You have to patiently time your maneuvers really well and in the boss battle which I encountered you only have a split second to react to everything it does. I went through a LOT of trial and error to progress through the game. I found this frustrating sometimes, but it was challenging and good fun.\n-----I found that I needed time to get the hang of the stance mechanic. For example when you attack an enemy,  you are switched automatically to the strength stance. But often I forgot to switch back to the green agility stance and would fall to my death because this meant that I could not make some jumps. Occasionally I sort of scratched my head and wondered why they felt it necessary to have this mechanic in some cases. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing overall, it\u2019s just different. I did like being able to switch to a stance to run faster and jump higher.\n-----You gain new abilities as you progress, by the time I finished playing I\u2019d just acquired the ability to activate slow motion. I think that was kind of cool.\n\nI think the game looks quite good. I like the sound effects. This game brought back fond memories of the old side scrolling Donkey Kong games.\n\nI recommend checking this game out. At the rate I was progressing through it should provide five or six hours or so of gameplay. I feel that the time you can spend on this game is mainly because of the difficulty. Not because of the actual number and size of the levels. If it was easy I think the stages would actually be short. The way it is, is not necessarily a bad thing. I think it\u2019s acceptable for a game is challenging rather having physically long levels. I\u2019d rather play a game like that than something easy and unsatisfying.\n\nClick [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SatanovichZ1/videos]here[/url] for my YouTube gaming channel", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1408162251, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1408506024, "recommendationid": "11733996", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513307", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1413599345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 126, "steamid": "76561198080892017", "num_games_owned": 54}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Good game.\n\nI've played and really enjoyed the gameplay.\nU'll die a lot and the bosses are though, but the learning with mistakes is worthful. \n\nThe art is beatiful and the songs make u turn up the volume!\n\nCongrats guys!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414520467, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1414520467, "recommendationid": "12671749", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496516", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1409433467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 291, "steamid": "76561197974340347", "num_games_owned": 286}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Achievement asked me: \"Can't you swim\"?\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://youtu.be/F1cItQzLYeQ", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1408858915, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1408859233, "recommendationid": "11842703", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480190", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
