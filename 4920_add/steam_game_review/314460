Before you waste your time with the \"helpful\" reviews, most of the \"helpful\" positive reviews for this game have very little time spent in the game, when one of the biggest detriments to this game is the completely repetitive nature of it.\n\nThis is without a doubt one of the biggest disappointments for a smash bros type game I have ever seen.  There is no difference between any of the characters except how they look as the only thing you do is either jump or use a power-up.  There is no such thing as a \"move\" in this game, which is a complete insult to the genre.  Both the control scheme and combat are completely terrible, as even with the so-called jokes for \"power-ups\" the game devolves into who can jump better.\n\nWhat makes the awful control scheme even worse is the complete lack of any option to change it whatsoever.  Think of the game as Smash Bros with absolutely no moves, on items and jumping on your opponent's head.  The closest comparison I can make is Towerfall Ascension, only without the arrows or the map overlap.  The different game modes do nothing for the game either, as the gameplay does not change.  Yes, the game does offer a significant challenge, but it is completely repetitive and dumbs down the genre to such a point that takes the entire amount of fun out of it. \n\nThe challenge mode is a joke, the first level is literally sitting in the top right corner waiting for enemies to jump into you.  90% of the strategy in this game is to get the high ground and camp it.  Even as you progress farther, it still remains exactly the same kind of thing, even though the maps and available power-ups will change.  Every single \"challenge\" comes down to the same thing: find the right way to cheese the map with the high ground and avoid getting spawn killed.\n\nFor a genre that prides itself on having complexity of combat, this game is an utter disappointment from its incredibly dumbed down three-step approach: 1. Take the high ground. 2. Hold the high ground.  3. Win.\n\nTL;DR: If you're looking for a good smash bros type game on Steam, this is the opposite of what you want.  This game is a waste of money and a joke for the genre, as it is without a doubt the worst game of its type I have ever seen.  If you made the mistake of wasting your money, just idle to get the cards and never touch the game again.  I wasted more time than I should have on this piece of garbage to see if it would get any better as time went on... it only got worse.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411330918, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1411335508, "recommendationid": "12179637", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544507", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1408665992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561197974258870", "num_games_owned": 109}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really fun game.

I really do. But I just can't.\n\nFirst off, the mechanics. You jump on heads. Once in a while you get a power up that does one thing, or another. It's like a hyper-nerfed version of Smash Bros, with uninteresting blobs instead of the beloved Marios and Zeldas and Pikachus. I'm not lucky enough to have anyone to do local multiplayer with, and there is no online, and maybe singleplayer is just a really bad representation of what Jamsouls is, but a game centered around jumping on people just doesn't do it for me.\n\nSecond off, difficulty is not something I often complain about in games, but this one's just too hard. It's hard to the point of just not fun. Think about the arcade games of the 80s, and multiply it by fifteen. It took me almost an hour to beat just the first level, and when I finally did there was next to no satisfaction. \"One down. Do I want to keep going? No, not really.\"\n\nIf you really, really, really like hard games where less than 10% of the players can be bothered to finish the first level, you might like this one.
