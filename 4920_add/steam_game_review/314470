I'm an old school games lover, I know the developpers wanted to make a game for nostalgic players, but this one is too... rough. \n\n+ It's a cute game, but...\n- Everything is random, there is no logic in character creation (every characteristic can reach 0 or 100%, so your characters are quite chimeric, not really sexy...)\n- Pixel art is not convincing, graphics and game play are quite poor. Monster design is terrible.\n- Game is very repetitve, as its cute but sad OST. Exploration and loot are not motivating.\n- Expensive for such low content.\n\nI gave up finally, spending too much of my time exploring, not really understanding where this game could bring me. \n\n(NB : I think pixel art should be used in a clever way. It should not be an excuse to put poor graphics and textures.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502045789, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502045789, "recommendationid": "34066519", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517795", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 56, "total_reviews": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
