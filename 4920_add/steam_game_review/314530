If you have 11 Euros and don't know how to waste them in the most useless way, buy this game.\nThere's no survival, except for the boredom you have to overcome to play this more than 10 minutes.\nTheres literally nothing to do in this game, besides collecting parts that are all over the place and are found within 5 minutes. then you have to search for the weilding table, connect the wing parts, install them onto the plane and yep -> you're done with this game.\nIn this state of devopment it's clearly a nope and looking at the concept of this game I don't expect more to come.\n\nThere's not even a day/night cycle, of you haven*t eaten a long time and your food-meter is down, you fully recover from one banana and so on.

Is 28 July 2015 and still have yet to play this.  No response on forums.It is like having no kids and no interuptions for the weekend, then realizing you are out of lube.\nAdded 18 June 2016\nI think this game has been abandoned.
