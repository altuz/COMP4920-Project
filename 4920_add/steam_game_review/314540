Loading Screens - on PC the game starts up in a mere 3- 4 seconds. Wii U it takes almost 15 seconds.. even being at 720p while 1080p on PC.\n\nProblem #2. Better Controller on PC - The Xbox 360 Controller is a little tighter than the Wii U Gamepad does in some parts But if you use the Pro Controller while playing it feels better. \n\nProblem #3. Glitches on Wii U - Certain very weird glitches on the Wii U version happened to me alot. One of them was when touching a certain part of the sky leaves would be falling. Leaves only fall from a tree in the game but there was no tree insight or close enough. PC Has no such problems when you go through a tree leaves fall and looks good.\n\nProblem #4. Cheaper on PC than Wii U - PC version only costs (as of 10-26-2014) $6.79 while on Wii U it charges you another $1.00 for tax while still being $7.99 so over $9.00 for the game. Nintendo please stop charging for TAX on a game Steam Sony and Microsoft do not charge TAX on anything on there stores please stop charging for TAX.\n\nOtherwise fun game very easy but anyone can play it and think of Little Big Planet and Paper Mario mashed together. \n\n8/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414333077, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1414333260, "recommendationid": "12642213", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522452", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486271725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 64, "steamid": "76561198091335675", "num_games_owned": 48}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Paper Monster Recut recut harkens back to a simpler time. That time was when every game wanted to be the next Super Mario. The is not inherently a bad thing. There's monsters to jump on coins errr....buttons and paper clips to collect.  A very nostalgic blend of running, jumping and discovering hidden areas. The contolrs are tight and sometimes require precision jumps but hey it's a platformer, right? The look is a blend of Sonic's Green Hill Zone, Super Mario level 1-1 and Little Big Planet.  It's simple, it's charming and it's like your favorite pair of jeans. Sure they have some holes and the legs are fraying at the cuffs but they fit and they still lookl preety cool.
