And there\u2019s a distressingly large selection of games in exactly that genre, so that is high praise indeed.\n\nIn \u201croom 13\u201d you are given a minimal amount of instruction, with the exception of making it clear that playing with a mouse and/or keyboard is tantamount to near instant death. The player starts in a room with a weapon, and very quickly you are assailed by many varieties of what can best be grouped into \u201cthe undead\u201d. And not 1980s undead, but 21st century \u201cdarn near fast as you\u201d undead! (And just SO cute!) You have a limited amount of life and ammo, but there\u2019s generally enough of both health and ammo to be found and collected. And you can find melee weapons such as pipe wrenches, hammers or crowbars (or you may pull one out of the head of some of your victims.) Melee make quite excellent weapons, in no way secondary to projectile weapons, but they wear out quickly. Killing in \u201croom 13\u201d is just about as fast and bloody as any I\u2019ve seen. And just as quickly you will need to collect the gobs of flesh and brains before they dissipate.\n\nIn addition you occasionally notice a sort of breathing lung machine to be collected, and when you have enough of them you have won the round. At that point the player gets a brief respite from attack\u2026..and choices to make.\n\nCertainly, as a beginner the choices are simple. The immediate goal is to gain the ability to advance. As such, all you\u2019ll want to do at first is survive. As you do, and cumulatively kill more undead (\u201ckill more undead\u201d. Hmmm\u2026), you gain \u201cfaces\u201d and weapon parts. Faces and weapon parts are awarded for rounds won (but not likely as a beginner) and the number of dead. Each face has a set amount of life and perhaps a specific unique skill. Having more life and further skills is the key to the choices I mentioned earlier.\n\nOnce you clear a level, a door will open to the next room. The choice you have is \u201cdo I go through that door, or continue fighting in this room?\u201d The reason to stay is you will be given the option, for a few seconds, to open boxes in a rapid search for weapon parts to build the most powerful weapon possible, from parts awarded as mentioned above. Then and only then will it be feasible to move on to the next room\u2026IF you manage to stay alive for the entire next round, so you can take that more powerful weapon with you. This is not an easy game, but not stupid, crazy hard either. And SO MUCH fun!\n\nThere is far more to this game than in this brief description, but if this doesn\u2019t get you interested, I suspect nothing will, since perhaps you think this just isn\u2019t your type of game. But, in full disclosure, I would have said the same before I began playing. (I was swayed by the stellar graphics and the low sale price.) For five minutes or five hours, an excellent game (even at full price.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447809574, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1447886156, "recommendationid": "19138097", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527557", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462654086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 133, "steamid": "76561198035560545", "num_games_owned": 3140}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The mix of whimsical hand drawn style and gore is easy on the eyes and helps distract from the hand cramps of constant restarts. \n\nRoom 13 is a fast paced arcade experience filled with giblets, gun mods, and face collecting. With little direction given to players outside the tutorial, they are tasked with tearing apart waves of the undead in an arena style setting with guns that are limited by ammo, and melee weapons limited by durability. This means that avoiding and dealing damage is tricky and puts players constantly on the move up and down stairs. After each wave some piles of boxes and supplies pop up that can offer players gun mods, pickups like medkits, or a surprise zombie that could ruin a good run. \n\nThe mods can alter gun stats as well as how they behave, like the chaser gun part that makes bullets track down enemies, or the motorized arrow launcher which allows you to pick up the arrows after use. Surviving waves and obtaining mods unlocks mods that later have a chance to appear in boxes between waves.  After surviving a few rounds players will be able to carry secondary weapon that is also customizable. There are lots of mods to unlock, and while some are flat upgrades (like stocks that increase rate of fire), the finer parts of customizing are fun and keep runs fresh due to the random nature.\n\nAnother reward that keeps the game moving are the faces. The mask unlocks come in the form of 2 types of unlocks: a more forgiving tally of cumulative rounds survived, and the other masks are unlocked by surviving a certain number of rounds in a single life. These masks all come with a certain health amount attached as well as an ability such as eating enemies, releasing toxic gas, or charging across the screen. They are fun to collect and allow players to try out new strategies and push themselves to earn the next reward. The one small complaint here is that the masks seem a bit imbalanced: the earlier masks mostly have lower health and less potent abilities than later masks that have more health and powerful abilities.\n\nIn its current state there is only the arcade mode to get new masks and unlock mods, and it is a fun experience worth picking up. With only 2 recorded hours I have unlocked a fair bit, but the later mods and masks are still very far my reach and I am having fun hitting quick restart. The levels, each housing a different trap that hurts the player and enemies, are fun if not a little bit too much alike. The early access page states that there will be more levels, a story mode, and bosses, among other bits of content which should make this a stellar title. The developer also interacts quite a bit with community and is transparent and constantly bouncing ideas with everyone, which is always nice to see in an early access title\n\n*Will update with major updates or full release", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462655610, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1462656271, "recommendationid": "22851657", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508274", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495745636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1351, "steamid": "76561198102776069", "num_games_owned": 115}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "When I saw [i]room 13[/i] in the steam shop, I knew it was going to be at least something different.\nI did not expect what I got though.\nThe game is increadible.\nIt manages keep you coming back again and again.\nThe gameplay is solid and brutal, the art style is fun, and the music score is dead on with it eerie ambiance.\nThe only thing that holds it back is the occasional bug, but the developers are activlely trying to fix them, so they should soon not be a problem at all.\nI strongly recomend this to anyone who enjoys arcade-like gameplay and zombies.\n\nEdit: Despite what most people say, the controls are not that bad.

Shoulder-charging over ammo/health/batteries collects them, but not the gibs. \n[b]This review was negative (2 of 5 people found it helpful), but since it seems that most of my qualms with the game have already been addressed, *Thumbs Up*[/b]\n\nHowever, I still wish we could shoot vertically somehow. Not straight up, as it might be reduced to some sort of twisted version of Space Invaders (why I only mentioned \"diagonally\" in the original review), but to have to either wait under a staircase or a ledge for the enemies to get into range (watching your back in the meantime, no doubt having to retreat into a throng anyway) or to try and jump so as to have them in-sight of your horizontally-inclined KillMachine (no doubt landing in a throng)... still am \"jezt teh sux.\" Along with that precarious platform suggestion, 's'just my input on the Early Access.\n\nI did not intend for the original tone to be harsh, though it may have come across as such. I appreciated the game before and can actually recommend it now; I couldn't then, not for lack of want, but because my conclusions and conscience prevented. \n\nApologies and gratitude to DTownTony\n\n==\n\n\nOriginal Revie:\n\n\nI was actually very excited to play this. \nThis will probably be downvoted because I'm \"jezt teh sux.\" \n\n\nFacts that detract:\n* You can't shoot diagonally.  \n* You can't shoulder-charge up stairs (if you actually manage it (as I THINK I have), you'll probably just end up charging off that level). \n\nPersonal qualms:\n* KillMachine upgrades are random drops in crates.\nThere are lots of duplicates. Before starting the game, you can visit the Arsenal - \"These are what spawn between rounds.\" Might as well not even show us that if we can do nothing with it, or have each component able to be viewed only when we collect them.\n* The sizes of the characters (er you and the grunt zombies) are such that the standard three-tiered stages could easily be six-tiered... if jumping was sacrificed... unless we could jump up through the levels. Jumping is hard enough to do as it is; trying to leap over enemies almost always fails, and trying to bound onto the higher level while on the stairs hardly ever works either. So it'd be no big loss.\n\nContradictory as ever, I feel like the levels are too cramped (as in \"There's (\")never(\") a way out,\") but suggest that cramming each stage with more levels would fix this... Precarious platforms that would collapse over time might work; I can appreciate how \"hardcore\" the swarms are, but when the only \"defense\" (as there's never enough ammo) is the unpredictable shoulder-charge... \n-(could have those platforms be as unpredictable; they might give way at random times - either after you jump off (thus smashing enemies below you) or while you're on it (decimating your health); have the chains holding them up be vulnerable to enemies' attacks)-\nThat, coupled with the inability to shoot diagonally, it takes no time for to have bodies falling and glomping onto you. The very sudden spawning of enemies (above, below and at the edges) - other than reinforcing \"There's no safe place,\" - often results in half health disappearing before action can be taken.\n\n\nThe game is basically:\nFind an exploitable spot in the map, sit on it while you defend yourself. Only move when you get swarmed or need health/ammo. Struggle to get to that aid because (using a controller, even) either a few outliers will be out of range of your shoulder-charge (so you actually rush into those enemies' attacks) or you miss the stairs because you didn't have the stick angled just-so. It doesn't seem feasible to constantly be on the move, what with (y)our tendency to miss the stairs - because it's rare for there to ever actually be a more advantageous position, reflexes notwithstanding (ammo withstanding).\n\n\nI mean... you're paying for the art. The game[i]play[/i] is par, nothing more (if not less)([u]at this time[/u]). \nI won't request a refund in the hope the game will actually become worth the money; because I appreciate the art enough; because maybe I'll be able to better reckon the game (\"git gud\").\nI can't recommend others to get the game, because I doubt many others would be as appreciative of the drawings; to own a game that (though, perhaps, \"fun\" to play (at times)) is so basic that it could easily be replicated in a Flash game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435629015, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1436677572, "recommendationid": "16800723", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502675", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439539159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 238, "steamid": "76561198040652187", "num_games_owned": 223}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Only played this for a short while yet, but I already know I'm going to invest a lot of hours into this game!
