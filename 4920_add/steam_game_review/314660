Such a good graphics, and have more options call one then one worker to follow you. In oddsyee you could't do that. I really love it, the only bad thing the controlling a bit weird then it used to.

If you've played the original, you'll remember how important crouching right next to something dangerous like a meat grinder and moving quickly is. In New n Tasty, pressing left doesn't just turn you around, it moves you slightly in the direction you pressed. For a game based around precise movement, this totally ruins the game.\n\nTake, for example the first secret area, whre there are a series of meat grinders and a lever to control how fast they move- standing next to the lever, if you pull it, crouch and turn left to face the meat grinder, you then die as Abe moves slightly into the way of it.\n\nUsing the steam controller was also frustrating, as the default config refused to work until I switched to a community one and back and enabled an Xbox config option in steam's big picture settings. Having analog movement where you start moving slowly as soon as the analog stick is moved even slightly mean getting under the fast meat grinders in the first secret area is pretty much impossible, too.\n\nOnly a few minutes of my time were actually playing the game, most of it was trying to get the controller working.
