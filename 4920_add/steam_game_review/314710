I played through most of the game on xbox one and got to the final boss. I never played megaman before this but tried the first game afterwards, and I see similar difficulties and well it felt like they had similar playstyles. I enjoyed the challenge of the game, of having to bring the game into the realm of muscle memory succeed in some levels. It felt like if you were good you could get through it in a smooth pace.

cheap level design? unbalanced boss weapons? useless boss weapons? you know what that sounds like? megaman fucking 2, the best megaman game there is according to me and 90% of the megaman classic fanbase. megaman had instant death everywhere, and the metal blade pretty much destroyed everything including bosses, the buster became obsolete when you got it. and then you people that love that game for it come and complain about instant death and the sword weapon on this game. its ridiculous, 90% of complainers are either upset that that infamous commercial knew about their high school life or they aren't megaman fans. \n \nrant aside, if you aren't a megaman fan i definitely don't recommend this game, everything that was good and bad about the classic megaman games are present in this one. if you didn't like the nes games you wont like this. \n \nfor megaman fans that aren't biased though this game is great, its got the pick-up-and-play, addictive, fun challenge of the classic megamans with the faster pace of megaman x. its even faster paced really, dashing through enemies makes the game extremely fast and action packed, and the dash is extremely precise too, you can stop it at any time and even change direction, its like the dash from megaman x on steroids with more control. each time you kill an enemy with the dash you gain weapon charge for your special weapons and sometimes you gain a power up, the most useful of which is the one that allows you to fire through enemies and objects. this power up is always around when you need it for multiple enemies or for firing at something through walls. always try to kill enemies with the dash, ive seen several videos and reviews where people complain about how the levels arent designed for weapons, powerup and dashing, but then say the level design is bad because they don't have the powerup they need for something because they werent dashing to kill enemies. level design is extremely dash centric, sometimes you need it to make jumps and alot of times it can be used to reach hidden secrets or shortcuts. \n \nalso (short rant) why do people complain about the game being a megaman rip off and then complain about how they have to dash instead of just jumping and shooting, do you want it to be megaman or not? make up your mind. and then on top of that you complain about calls stage because the dash isnt damaging and have to jump and shoot, are you kidding me? do you just want the game to be bad? \n \nlastly the bosses, they're all pretty unique in terms of fighting them. they also have personalities which is a nice change from the classic megaman series. they even interact with beck, they're like a group of siblings essentially. as for the boss battles themselves they're pretty challenging. usually when i run through a megaman game i beat all the robot masters with just the mega buster just because i don't like how easy all of them are when you use their weakness. here thats not really an issue, they still provide somewhat of a challenge when you use their weakness(still not enough imo but thats the point of having weaknesses, i like the mechanic i just like having a challenge better) if you use only Becks default gun though they are very tough, even more so than at least half of the classic megaman robot masters, when you beat them that way you really feel accomplished. \n \nthere are some technical issues however, well just 1. if you play the game for more than 2 hours or so it'll start to slow down, no idea why. just restart it every couple of stages and you'll be fine. it only caused me trouble once, which did annoy me. \n \noverall its a great game and a fantastic successor to classic megaman, it does every thing megaman did and more, its fun challenging addictive and rewarding. if you play it unbiased as a megaman fan you'll love it. for people who arent megaman fans id suggest going and playing 1 or 2 of the nes ones first if you hadn't already or waiting for it to be on sale just in case, megaman like games arent for everybody \n \n7/10 \nit'd be an 8 if not for that one technical issue.\n \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504820631, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504820631, "recommendationid": "34803167", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499025", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 359, "total_reviews": 655, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 296}}
