This game has stunning graphics, and that's about all the positive I can say about it. \nAs a hardcore Daedalic fan who owns every single point and click game from them (me and my brother share libraries) I am really let down by the simplicity of this game. It's really dumbed down and simple compared to the other games. \n\nI cannot say anything about the story since I didn't play through the whole thing. It seemed interesting when I played it. Even with that in mind, I couldn't bare playing through it because of how ridiculously unchallenging the game is.\nIf you're buying this expecting a true Daedalic point and click with puzzles and actual thinking you'll be disappointed. \n\nI understand this is all subjective and this is only my personal opinion. I hate to see more of their games following this trend.\n\nTL;DR\nThis is a movie, not a game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500457537, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500457537, "recommendationid": "33648041", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520980", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501600207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 276, "steamid": "76561198014435327", "num_games_owned": 4269}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Silence is a bit closer to a Telltale-style game than a classic point & click game.

English voice actors all did a good job.\n\nPuzzles are quite easy and you shouldn't really have any problems with them. If you need, there are hints on the screen that shows all active areas.\n\nThe game seems to reference the previous game from this world, The Whispered World, quite a bit.

This is the worst PNC game I've played in a long time. I tried to keep playing it and it's like they took everything that was good about The Whispered World (prequel) and threw it away to make this. The story is minimal - at least from the 2 hours I played - and there are no real puzzles because they show you where anything you pick up is supposed to go. You don't even have an inventory so you're only dealing with one item at a time.

[spoiler]And even though it left me an emotional, sobbing wreck.[/spoiler]\n\nThe puzzles I found far too easy, however. This is coming from someone with almost 20 years of experience playing Point & Click games, so take that with a grain of salt, but it was easy.
