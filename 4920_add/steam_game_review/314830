This could go up to 12+ enemies and at some stage it could be hella annoying trying to wait out each turn, especially having to endure the annoying buzz, deathblow animations and sound of the fucking annoying insect troops. The Lv4 freeze spell helps you clear the board fast, but with the unfortunate side effect of slowing their animations to half resulting in longer wait time between turns.\n\nYour dialogue choices will affect your companions' strengths and affinities. Certain dialogue cues will either turn them good or evil, and some choices have effects that will benefit their combat abilities (e.g. help your mage rediscover his ambition to rule, and his spell power/regeneration/resistance increases).\n\nCertain enemies/prisoners will reveal their secrets via the right dialogue choices. Keep a lookout for hints that will help you make the correct dialogue choice, my only gripe is sometimes I know the correct answer to persuade a prisoner, but I do not know whether which dialogue path the answer is hidden in and there is no \"Return\" option (you get 3 options when integorrating prisoners - Intimidate, Lie, and Make An Offer - which can be pretty confusing).\n\nKinda like the choices we can make during the ending; would be nice if the developers throw in some vids to show us the effects of our end game actions and their impact on the citizens.\n\nOverall, pretty decent game to pass time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501526611, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501526611, "recommendationid": "33933385", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511023", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500842140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1134, "steamid": "76561198060301780", "num_games_owned": 229}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The protagonist is interesting, and it is a good game, however:\n.
