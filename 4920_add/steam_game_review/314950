It is in Early Access so there's a lot of time to add content.  I jumped the gun and bought it, but kind of wish I had waited for more content.  It is very creepy and atmospheric, so I am not complaining.\n\nThe Single Player (SP) portion of the game is only one spectre chasing you.  Got some good scares out of me so far! lol  The SP game mode is very short at this time.  Game time depends on how you play the game.  I found out that you can just turn your back on the spectre and walk away to avoid death in SP mode most* of the time.  (*She will eventually get you! lol)  IMO, they should just respawn you somewhere else in the house instead of game over when you die, so you don't have to keep starting a new game!  It kind of makes it Rogue-like, so that's cool too.\n\nThe lighting, graphics and atmosphere are superb!  I anxiously await to see more content in the near future.  Multiplayer (MP) gameplay I suppose is like hide & seek.  I haven't tried MP, so I shouldn't really comment.  Also, I don't have a VR unit to try..  I believe the VR gimmick is one of the game's strong points.  That and MP for sure!  I can see a lot of fun in MP!\n\nThe sound is done really well.  You'll hear whispers and other creepy noises that create a ghostly atmosphere.  The spectre's scream is enough to make you jump out of your seat and see her in your face!  It's a pretty good scare if you come around a corner and she is right there!\n\nIf you have a VR unit, this may be a cool game to buy though.  It has got some of the best graphics I have seen in a VR game so far IMO.  The spectre is cool looking, but the mansion is rendered beautifully!  I find myself looking around at everything with my flashlight.\n\nThe developers are very active and fixed some bugs within a few hours that I reported!  I recommend this game to people that like to scare other people, or people that like to be scared by ghosts! lol :-)  If you have a VR unit, this may be a must buy game.  The game does have great graphics and is very atmospheric for sure!!! \n\nI does work on my iMac so I am happy about that part of it! lol  Here are my system specifications: Apple iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8, Journaled HFS+ Extended file system.\n\nPros:\n+ Very scary atmosphere\n+ Great lighting and graphics\n+ Some good scares in a dark and spooky mansion\n+ The game keeps me coming back to explore more of the mansion\n+ The game runs great on my 4 y/o iMac running OS X 10.6.8\n+ Developers are very active with their community and fix reported bugs quickly\n\nCons:\n- The game has some bugs\n- The spectre is too fast, making the game end too soon in SP\n- You walk too slow and cannot run in SP mode, only MP mode\n- SP mode is very limited and gameplay is short sometimes\n- You can just turn your back on the spectre and walk away to avoid death in SP mode", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415322134, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1415333492, "recommendationid": "12823338", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506522", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477698408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198036154061", "num_games_owned": 184}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Literally can't play the game.

On the surface, Spectre is very similar to many other recent survival horror games; you wander around a dark, creepy environment, with nothing but a flashlight to guide you. Along the way, you're stalked by a spirit that kills you for looking at her, meaning your only tactic is to turn tail and run anytime she gets near. Instead of finding eight items to win this game, you just need one; the camera. Find it, snap a picture of The Spectre when she's right in your face, and you win.\n\nAs this game is still in the early stages, more content will certainly be added later, but for now, the game is rather bare. I found no story elements, nor any explanation for what The Spectre is, although they may have been there and I just missed them. There are also a few issues with gameplay; sprinting doesn't work in Singleplayer, and the 'Use' and 'Open Door' commands don't seem to have a purpose yet. Again, more is sure to come, but if I were involved in the development, I'd prioritize expanding the map; I beat the game in 18 minutes, and that includes three deaths, and general wandering.\n\nWhere this game really stands out is in the atmosphere; the mansion you wander through looks fantastic, and there aren't too many indie games that can compare to it. It could benefit from a some more rooms, maybe even a whole new floor, but it's a strong foundation. The Spectre also looks pretty good, although I sometimes have trouble telling if the jerky way she moves is by design or a bug. The sound design also stands out, and while I admit it's a bit generic as far as this kind of game goes, it still does its job of setting the mood quite well.\n\nWhat has the potential to set this game apart from the rest is the multiplayer feature. As of this review, I've yet to find anyone to play with, but it seems like it would be a more polished version of the Garry's Mod gamemode 'Stop it Slender', with one player being The Spectre, and the rest trying to locate the camera. To me, this seems like the game's biggest selling point, but as of right now, the servers seem to be dead, with nary a player in sight. This is the main reason I recommend this game; the multiplayer feature seems like the idea that this game was built around, but there just aren't enough players yet, and it seems like the game isn't living up to its full potential.\n\nI've also not tried the VR mode, so if that's a big selling point for you, you'll have to look elsewhere to find out if it's any good.\n\nSo, anyone who's on the fence about this one, consider a few things: \n\n1. Do you enjoy games like Slender and SCP Containment Breach?\n2. If yes, have you ever wished you could play as Slender Man/SCP-173?\n3. Are you willing to help work out the various kinks present in all Early Access games?\n4. Do you have at least two like-minded friends who might be willing to play as well?\n\nIf you answered yes to two or more of those questions, then Spectre may be worth your time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415396023, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1415396023, "recommendationid": "12834416", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498845", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429874576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 64, "steamid": "76561198047597918", "num_games_owned": 563}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This surelly is a beta.\nBut it is playable.
