In some areas is surpasses Hearts of Iron, such as start dates, as well as complexity of the economy. It is hard to find a great game like this, that will let you start at almost any date (1914(With DLC)-Future). This game is truly in my eyes amazing. Look up a few videos and you will see how complex it is. What is even better is that you can enjoy this on a low spec computer unlike other games. There are few developers which limit the updates to the game (Yes there are some things that are buggy or you may want to be changed, but the devs have limited resources and are working on it), but they are super responsive and actually listen to the community. I waited for almost a year until it was on sale, and that was a mistake. If you are a fan of this genre, you need to pick up this game right away. Don't make the mistake I made, and be prepared to lose hours of your time in this great game 10/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506394754, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506394754, "recommendationid": "35214742", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503053", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506599055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2109, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 4837, "steamid": "76561198035635524", "num_games_owned": 181}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really addicting and cool!

First of all it does not take into account the NATO alliance. And I find forming alliances even with friendly nations daunting. And when war does break out I have neutral nations shooting at my forces?? Not very realistic. \nThere are too many pop ups to keep track of. As the game goes along events happen before you get a chance to respond to them. Often it is confusing. What does that mean? Oh. Yeah.
