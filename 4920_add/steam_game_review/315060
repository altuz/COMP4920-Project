Why force the use of mouse wheel? No idea and no real rationale behind it. Developers could have simply implemented the use of two keys for the same results. Or could have supported gamepad. Though luck: my computer is a laptop. Couldn't move forward in the game. Game specs don't specify that the use of mouse wheel is mandatory. Refund requested and obtained.

The presentation is nice and the fluid physics seem to be pretty spot on.  They react how you expect them to react and do so reliably each time which is important for physics based gameplay like this.  It seems like it would be a simple concept that would be difficult to find challenge in, but the levels do up the ante as you progress.  Very early in I was presented with a few that really had me scratching my head a bit.  But they weren't so difficult that I left the experience frustrated.\n\nMost importantly, the dev is very responsive to the community and you can tell they are very passionate about the game.  I had a small scoring issue which I posted about and got a reply within hours.  The bug was not only fixed within the week but followed up on in the comment thread by the dev to let me know.  It's a pleasure to support devs who are so active with their community and willing to fix things even when they can't replicate the bugs we're seeing.  It's a refreshing change from so many of these unfinished or bug-ridden games that release then wallow for months without updates.  Well worth a purchase if even just to support those qualities that we should be looking for in game devs.  It doesn't hurt that it's pretty fun to boot.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424706517, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424706517, "recommendationid": "14611878", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508260", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447932060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 263, "playtime_forever": 287, "steamid": "76561198074169975", "num_games_owned": 530}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Even if it's better than the first bloop, which had collision bugs, it's not really a good game.

This one is a really cool physics based puzzle. I like the way diffrent chemical behaves. But this game suffers with a bad UI design. There is no way to restart a level you will have to quit the game to main menu and the select the desired level.\nit is still a solid puzzle game which doesn't hold your hand (at all).
