You need either main hero or alive commander to control fleet.\n\n- Ai controls fleets in combat automaticly hitting their strongest targets and based on commanders personality either flee like chickens or take it like a man.\n\n- Commanders can die and will try to escape to other ships when they are losing.\n\n[i]Unique take to scouting.[/i]\n\n- Every  ship has  limited detection range and larger attack range... because this game has detection units.\n\n- Scouting is vital. Scouts allow you to shoot farther and recon new areas and secure sectors as beacons.\n\n- Dormant mode allows wide area fleets scans. You know what I mean when you try it.\n\n[i] Weaponising resourses [/i]\n\n- You can use stuff like gas clouds as minefields.\n\n[i]Factions [/i]\n\n- UNC  ( United Nations Confederation ) is an anti tecnology faction that uses \" safe\" tecnologies as railguns and missiles, being the \" standard\"  faction. Asia based.\n\n-SS ( Slavic Sirerians)\"the aliens\" : Use chemicals and bio weapons ( yes  chemicals and bacteria in space.) Are mostly male and somewhat ....manly. Slavic based.\n\n- NSAU ( North-South American Union)  : Is high tec faction that uses beam weapons, shields and .. this one was new to me check it out : Portable power generators AND mobile resource harvest buildings. America based.\n\n[i]Zone based space travel[/i]\n\n Fleets use wormholes to travel  splitting all maps in to sectors enabling tactical attacks from multiple sides or really nasty choke points. \n\nYou should REALLY read the story about why there are wormholes close to earth: http://foresightrts.com/wormhole-anomalies/\n\n[b]Background story and progression[/b] \n\n[i]Background story itself  is good, but its presentation..[/i]\n\n- You live on humanity's own mess up pile, they nuked their own planet, messed up space travel in worm hole experiments and fight against each other in the progress.\n\n-  Read  background story before you play the game, more of the stuff makes sence then. Voice acting being one of them. \n\n\n[b]   MEH aspects.[/b]\n\n\n[i]How the story is told. Is a huge potential meh [/i]\n\nSome of the charecter commendaries are confusing and then there is voice acting. There are tons of negative comments about it and it can \"Sound\" atrocious.. least till you  bothered to read faction backstories from the web page.\n\n- UCN is mostly asian based none of them have native english its just common language.\n-Slavic Sirerians have intented slavic accent.\n-NSAU , well they are english. If you want to hear english : check out NSAU\n\nVoice acting actually was on most part design choise, also I heard from Jeremy that most of the voice actors were Volenteers, this is a small budget game after all.  (update : He changed pug's voice now ! )\n\n[i] The Artificial intelligence [/i]\n\nYou really either hate or love this.\n\nI got my ass kicked when I commanded everything myself. I had to learn to \" let go\" in mass fights and let the ai do its job.  It's not clever enough to start entire sector wide campaings with blizzard level of magnificience but its good enough be left to handle mass fights IF you do not order them too much.\n\nI have seen ai do stuff like\n- Cautious AI commander abandonts its fleet and runs. \n- Clever one focus fired enemy commanders down\n- More ruthless one totally ignored defense positions and just blew generators to kingdom come.\n\nThen again I also saw this : \" Requesting attack to sector x\" .. my OWN base was on that sector. \n\n[i]Music and sounds[/i]\n\n Mostly background style music on neutral level, not something you'd want to burn on your harddrive and listen as separate ( As example age of wonder's sound track),  don't expect that, and the music's and sounds are good.\n\n[i]Graphical presentation[/i]\n\nApparently game was made by choise somewhat simplistic, to allow larger fleet fight. This means there is not much eye candy.\n\nNor eastern eggs, nor cards. Stuff like that is on works. \n\n\n[b]And now the \"why oh why\"[/b]\n\n[i] User interface[/i]\n\n I will first state that this is on rework apparently next patch.  Currently its complex.\n\n- Makers made the keybindings based on their own localisation, this resulted some farts like: repair key being altgr + 8 for eu player .  \n\n- Creating fleets and assigning advisors is clumsy.\n\n- It's hard to remove units from fleets and to add them to other fleets.\n\n-Fleet view at times doesn't view fleets but instead your main commanders face.\n\nAnd small stuff like that.\n\n[i] I want my skip button [/i]\n\nWhile they already added options to skip things there is no way to skip in game cutschenes yet, and seeing them half dozen times on retries can be a pain.\n\nYou can't skip end and defeat score screen either.\n\n\n[i] Steam ui hates this game [/i]\n\nStandalone game works fine, but run it in steam you have issues like game crashing on alt tab.\n\n[i] Multiplayer needs work [/i] \n\n Multiplayer is somewhat complex and well, de syncing on large games.\n\n[i] Simple design makes game bland[/i]\n\nNot much to explore in this game, it focuses on execution and battles so the space is just full of small stars, not much debris asteroids or things like that.\n\n[i] Polish in clarity needed [/i] \n\nSome things are hard to pick at, fleet locations, ally locations, you have to access minimap manually instead seeing it all the time but this is on works.\n\n[i] Tutorial sucks[/i]\n\nBut can be skipped !\n\n\n\n[b]Summary :[/b]\n\n\nForesight is a space game placed on era where humans have nuked earth and ruined space travel with wormhole experiements, telling story of Thomas Locke UNC commander who will see quite a bit duing the game.\n\nGame is simple on the eye with decent sound score and good but optional backstory accessable from webside along with three fairly different factions and playstyles, that relies on semi ai controlled fleets  that can be used to fullest in zone based combat areas.\n\n\nWhile having lot of potential, it currently suffers from few ui optimisation issues as well as background based voice acting.  \n\nThe game itself doesn't have fatal bugs.\n\nAs the game is now I'd give it 67/100 but it has potential to be  75-80 game and it will be, the dev's are very active, contact players and discuss their ideas openly.

So the map is separated in sectors like just 4 to. 20 or more.\nin each sector you can build a base to collect resources and they all are connected with wormholes. \n\nYou have 3 Factions here, 2 really on energy like in C&C, so no energy no turrets power and slowly production, the other is unique, they need blood banks. Not enough blood and you units start to lose Hit Points.\n\nUnits are like in Starwars Empire at War. So you can build from small scouts to huge Capital Battleships. \n\nThe Unique idea is here you must place fighter and bombers in bigger ships to move them around, like the Protoss Carrier, but you build them in Shipyard, not on the capital ship. \nLots of Corvettes, Gunship and other support ships are here too.\n\nWell best part is the unit limit, to increase this you must get a \"Fleet Captain\" on a ship, that you can assign ships to him. So you have like limit for 10 units, Assign them to the captain and now you can buy another 8 units and so on. \n\nSo if you loose a Fleet Captain you have like 18 Units and cant buy more units. Because you are with 8 units too high by the limit. Pretty interesting mechanic in my Opinion. \nIn most RTS its just some kind of house that is placed somewhere randomly. Here its you fleet commander. Story is challenging and interesting, the AI is like in Tiberium Wars, the game itself feels like an Space C&C. \n\nYou can by the way choose here the Tech Level like in Red Alert 1 or set the Amount of Start Resources. Like in Starwas Empire at War you can increase the game play speed, yes you have game speed controls here.  \n\nFor this game I can put my Hand in fire, an extreme good AAA Indie RTS game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444120710, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444120723, "recommendationid": "18351538", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489358", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468377981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15, "steamid": "76561198154876661", "num_games_owned": 2}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It will do", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468378031, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468378031, "recommendationid": "24287537", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485780", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445025207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 111, "steamid": "76561198061570988", "num_games_owned": 586}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "11", "review": "the good :\n+ Its an RTS with ok graphics (Older Graphics)\n+ It has a general feel of a futuristic world using the cut-scenes between levels to give you a little background etc.\n\nthe bad:\n- Voice acting is still HORRIBLE\n- For some reason Alt-Tab doesn't work properly , it might force you to close and re-open the game if you want to continue (Sometimes the mouse seems to not appear after you use Alt-Tab)\n- This time i couldn't even pass level 2 it was when i found the controls didn't seem to work - i couldnt create a fleet even after finding out what controls to use\n- Missing important information like how to create a fleet (it tells you to build 5 gunships in level 2 but doesn't give you enough resources - when you try to build , it says you have to create a fleet - but how ? , had to figure it out on my own)\n- After playing the game for a few hours i noticed the \"i\" button on my keyboard stopped working - i did a system restore with the only change being forsight un-installed (i literally did nothing else)\nand the \"i\" button started working again - i have no idea why , maybe the devs would want to take a look at this\n- Its also missing things you would expect in a game like tool tips when you place the mouse above the unknown resource that looks like a star - command points (what is it , how do you get more of it etc)\n\n\nOverall its an ok game , it has some nice ideas like officers controlling fleets etc\nit does remind me a little of Conquest: Frontier Wars - an older game i used to play\nit still has issues and i still cant say its a great game - needs more work , but the devs do seem interested in what fans have to say\nin improving their game - that alone might convince you to give it a shot", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1424763842, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417224633, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445027880, "recommendationid": "13132592", "developer_response": "Hi Shade,\n\nThanks for your review and opinions of the game. We've since made improvements as much as we can over the last 1-2 months or so. The game will continue to improve the way early access titles do - being released doesn't give us the right to just walk away, ignoring complaints and valuable feedback that could improve Foresight.\n\nTherefore, I'm kindly asking you to give Foresight another try.\n\nForesight isn't about micromanagement. It's made in a way so that you'll be able to focus more on tackling your enemies rather than to worry about production lines and build order.\n\nLet me put it this way: 3 points:\n1) Automation - Foresight reasonably automates typical RTS chores. We've further enhanced the game to make this automation even easier. The process of creating a fleet has been simplified further. Ships and fighters now take a safer route to your ships by default. All ships can enjoy being assigned to a flight path across the sector map.\n\n2) Fleets - Fleets extend your command. The fleet commander assists you by requesting for ships and directions. A fleet advisor helps attain intelligence via unconventional means, allowing your fleet to see what lies ahead. They're not a typical unit group which awaits your orders. The fleet commander will also perform some micromanagement as well. Though I'm looking forward to improving this part of the fleet commander AI in the near future.\n\n3) Strategic Relevance - it's in our game design beliefs that a good RTS should reward players for implementing the right strategy and battle plan. As such Foresight does reward you for performing flank attacks, rear attacks, ambushes, blitzkreig and blockade running (which checkmates your opponents). Many a times these battle plans have little relevance in typical RTSes - it's always one huge army vs another huge army. In Foresight, the largest navy doesn't always win. Spamming the largest ships may not always be the best solution.\n\nIn conclusion, I totally respect your opinions. They could be formed because our tutorials didn't do a good job or their voice acting was so bad that they make your cringe. My only hope is that you'll give Foresight another chance one day. Hopefully, you'll change your mind by then.\n\nThanks!\nJeremy\n", "language": "english", "votes_down": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488681", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1417722448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 443, "steamid": "76561198040161775", "num_games_owned": 79}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Very poor graphics\nInconvenient operating menu\nLooks like this game is 4-5 years old\n", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1424765614, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417251885, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1417251885, "recommendationid": "13137562", "developer_response": "hi nezdeshny, thanks for your opinions. \n\nHowever, I'm wondering if Foresight had been rendered correctly on your machine or not?
