I did purchase this on sale for \u00a31.04 which was a bargain but if I'm honest I dont think this game is worth much more, \u00a35 would be a stretch. \nThe puzzles are pretty simple, however there are many game breaking bugs within such as your partner somehow ending up in the same level as you, or they glitching through walls, and buttons to activate platforms for your partner not working. \nIt was very fun for me and my friends, to which we spent alot of time laughing at the glitches and raging at the do overs. \nI would definately recommend the game, however I wouldnt recommend it for the original price. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499194441, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499194441, "recommendationid": "33243458", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5}}
