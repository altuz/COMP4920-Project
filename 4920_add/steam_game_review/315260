It autosaves, when you die, you load your autosave and spawn a bit back before you died. And also, game has no Tutorial, which I LOVE, so the game is more hardcore. It includes some Tool tips thou. But, the complainers about no tutorial, what would make game interesting if there WAS tutorial and path arrows? I mean, game is about being on Lost Planet, trying to survive.
