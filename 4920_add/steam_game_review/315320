You're better off playing those. Even though this game does provide some choice (that could very loosely be called strategy) it is a really boring idle game that you actually have to pay attention to, just to click buttons. Not fun, nor interesting. You don't move around a dungeon, just fight random enemies. Adapting to new enemies sounds like a fun idea, but the way this game plays it really isn't. \n\n I bought this on sale...
