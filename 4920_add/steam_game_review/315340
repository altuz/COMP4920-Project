A.R.E.S. was already a decent sidescrolling platformer. This is simply an upgrade in graphics. minor adjustments to game mechanics, and the inclusion of more story (which is told through cutscenes). Besides those changes, the game is exactly the same as the original and does not merit the price that it was given at launch and still does not merit.
