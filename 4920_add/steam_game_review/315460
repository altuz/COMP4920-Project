How often do you see a developer taking that much time and sorting things out with a negative reviewer?\n\nPlayed on easy. As a new player on Easy, when you don't have to worry about getting upgrades before the first sunset, the game moves along at a nice pace. It's not a walk in the park especially at the beginning, but you're able to set up a solid defense and expand your zone of control outward however you like. \n\nThere's always a feeling of exploration and challenge - as you expand your base, there are more potential points that the creatures can attack. Likewise, if you get too carried away with exploring the wilderness or the subterranean area, you can end up not making it back to your base before nightfall. And then you're in big trouble. \n\nThe mechanic where only the monster types that you've killed during the day will hunt you at night is an especially good idea. There's time limit to anything, and no spike in difficulty that you as a player have not voluntarily decided to do.\n\nObviously in 2 hours I haven't finished the game yet, but what I've played is enough to be worth a positive review. Dig or Die is a good pickup.\n\nI'll leave my negative review here, so that if your opinion is similar to my original one, you'll know it's not as bad as it seems. The dev addressed my points in his comments below.\n\n**********************************************************************************************************\n\nOLD REVIEW\n\nJust not my thing at all. Died a few times at night, said the hell with it.\n\nWhy can I build a wall but not a light source? On a planet where you're spending a lot of time underground and monsters attack you in huge waves at night, a light source early on would be nice.\n\nWhat does the game have against doors? A block that lets me though, but not monsters?\n\nThose auto-turrets I'm supposed to build are expensive and complete rubbish.\n\nDig or Die might be alright if I really sat down and played with it and figured it out, but I haven't seen anything in the early game that makes me want to risk going over the 2 hour limit.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505588250, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505953055, "recommendationid": "35004576", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503037", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505760389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4872, "steamid": "76561198039110977", "num_games_owned": 194}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Well I NEVER go for these types of games but after 80+ hours in the 3 weeks since I purchased it, I can hardly say that I haven't already had my monies worth!!!\nSucked right in, it was great fun!\nBigger than I thought.\nBloody addictive!\n Totally recommended!!\n& I haven't even tried multiplayer yet :o)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505607351, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505607532, "recommendationid": "35010238", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504954", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506897788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1334, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1334, "steamid": "76561198287813055", "num_games_owned": 12}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "5 Stars.Best Music ever Great Gameplay Love the Physics.Great Game Highly Reccamended", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506192456, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506192456, "recommendationid": "35161149", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500559", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506247768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3543, "steamid": "76561198152689439", "num_games_owned": 47}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Such a good game, everything about it is great and it Isn't a terraria clone", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505771399, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505771399, "recommendationid": "35053595", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498090", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507175531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 169, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21926, "steamid": "76561198081946576", "num_games_owned": 20}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "ive had this game for almost 2 years ive been very satisfied  it is a good time burner and very fun\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506820450, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506820450, "recommendationid": "35359570", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500559", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507138624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 393, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 393, "steamid": "76561198414299532", "num_games_owned": 3}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "5 stars very addictive and worth the \u00a37.00", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506977548, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506977548, "recommendationid": "35428339", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502491", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502737524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3878, "steamid": "76561198212342684", "num_games_owned": 53}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Good use of 10$", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506810286, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506810286, "recommendationid": "35356191", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500559", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506398642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 39, "steamid": "76561198025014863", "num_games_owned": 135}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It has good gameplay and is rather difficult, however it is not worth $10.
