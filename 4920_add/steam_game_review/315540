The developers consistently go completely silent on the project, only to come back and make a new slew of promises that then go unfulfilled. When issues are brought up, they reference vague timetables that are never met and offer platitudes that do nothing. I want to like the game, but three years in Early Access is ridiculous, alongside promised fixes never coming. I'd like to play the completed game, but at this point I've given up all hope of doing that.\n\nI'd also like to point out that their discussions board was completely wiped at some point, wiping out any evidence of problems with the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502987166, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502987166, "recommendationid": "34310515", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495964", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "total_reviews": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
