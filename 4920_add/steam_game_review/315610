The screenshots looked really charming and the description really sold me. It draws inspiration from Zelda and Metroid, woohoo! So when it was on sale I immediately got it.\nAnd at frist, it seemed like it was the perfect game for me. It was a nice, dream-like fantasy world and I very much felt like I was a little kid again.\n\n\nSo Spud's Quest is a mix between a Platformer and an Adventure game. You jump around and pick up items to use at other points to continue in the story. There's temples like in Zelda and you gain new abilities like in a typical Metroidvania game. So far the game seems perfect for me. But there's a third title in the description, Dizzy. Which I've never heard of before. Apparently it was an Adventure title where you would pick up items and use them just like in this game. The only problem is, because it was an old game, you could only hold 4 items at a time.\n\nFor some reason, the developer of this game decided to not go with the time and limit your inventory to four slots. So at all times, you can only carry around 4 items. So when you find something new you think you might  need, you need to drop another of your items. Then when you actually need it at some point (or think you do) you need to head all the way back to where you dropped it. At first this wasn't a problem, but after some time it got really annoying. It doesn't help that there seem to be a ton of red herings which you don't actually need.\nNow some of you might be patient enough, but for me it was the reason to drop this game after the third temple (the ice temple). It just became too much of a hassle.\n\nAnother issue I had with the game were the enemies. At first, they're not much of an obstacle. The bats just fly around you randomly, so you can bascically can stand where you are and throw red dots (which is what Spud does as an attack). Sometimes they hit you and after a while you will be at low health. The only way I found to restore yourself is to pay for it with some NPCs placed in front of temples. It's actually quite tedious to go and get healed there. In my opinion, enemies should just have dropped health pickups instead of money to go and buy health with.\nSo the enemies weren't a problem, until SUDDENLY, you meet a new type of enemy, a kind of yeti. Which are way overpowered and caused me to drop down to low health A LOT. Which meant a lot of tedious running back to the healer.\n\nThe final straw for me was how buggy the game got in the third temple. The goal of it was to find babies and bring them back to the entrance. But carrying around the babies and throwing them was quite buggy. They didn't want to go where I thought the game wanted me to take them and in the end, the only way to beat this temple for me was to glitch them through walls.\n\nIf you don't think this (especially all the backtracking and the 4 item inventory) won't bother you, then please, get this game. It does play like a charming game from back in the 16 bit days and puzzlesolving can be quite rewarding.

It's very reminiscent of the old Dizzy adventure games and using simple SNES-like graphics which really do work very well with this kind of game.  There's plenty of things to do, lots of fetch quests to keep you busy, and hidden items that will have you tearing your hair out trying to find the last one.  It's an adventure full of traps and treasures like in the Indiana Jones movies.  All in all it's how games should still be as it's equally fun and frustrating at the same time and isn't using overpowered graphics like a lot of modern games do, and has lots of cheerful ditties.  It's a game all ages can enjoy.  I can't recommend this any more than this.  Buy it, you'll never regret it, and it's only less than \u00a36!
