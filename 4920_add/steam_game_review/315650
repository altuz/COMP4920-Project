But this gameplay is pretty simple. All you do is press the spacebar to play. Basically what you do is launch jellyfish and try to hit all the switches in the level. But to get the switches you need to hit the bouncy areas or use your jets, so all the gameplay is timing in when to press spacebar. So if your stuck you'll pass it as it is all trial and error. As you read the gameplay is casual, but is also very simplistic which can get boring for a long session of playing. Also, because it's only 1 button it limits the whole environment and cuts exploration.\n \nGraphics:\nThis game is 2D but the art style is pretty special and works well with the style of the game.\n \nControls & Smoothness:\nThere is only 1 button like I said before, though the game only needs 1 button even though it limits exploration. The game has a little bit of bugs though only a little. \n \nMusic & Sound:\nThe music really helped the art style and it wasn't full on either, it just set with the background which was good.\n \nDifficulty:\nYou can get stuck in this game pretty easy though as it is just one button it is just trial and error before you get all switches.\n \nFun Level:\nI found this game the most fun when you got through the levels quickly though when you get stuck and do trial and error it can get boring and make you want to leave.\n \nIn conclusion, this game is great in short bursts though when you stay and play you will get tired because of it's repitive and limited gameplay.\n \nPro's:\n- Great art style\n- Music works well\n- Some great levels which makes you think differently\n \nCon's:\n- Repitive gameplay\n- Limited levels\n \nScore: 6.5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1408878479, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446098976, "recommendationid": "11845307", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511995", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483730002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561198013386105", "num_games_owned": 414}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is super elegant, reminds me of golf in a lot of ways, 10/10 amazing, yet simple enough for a quadrapalegic to play with a jouse with a single button click being the only control in the game.\n\nTo the developer: Please make more games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1410045681, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1410045681, "recommendationid": "12005916", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498829", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1417464006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 57, "steamid": "76561197993841729", "num_games_owned": 382}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I like this a lot.
