As with  the other ford games, there's little to like about this game, with handling little improved and  although    the graphics are an improvement on  the 2004 and 2006 releases  (Ford Racing 3 and Ford Street Racing respectively), they are still sub standard to many other racing games released back in 2008 (for example Need for Speed Undercover, which looks amazing and plays brilliantly  even today) that said,  the recently released  Colin  McRae Rally    was released before any of these ford  games and is far superior to all three games and is only a pound  more expensive.  \n\nMy advice, either leave it alone, or, if you are determined to buy it, wait till the sales.  with 50% off,  it'll be less than a cup of coffee.  :)\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1410320225, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1410320225, "recommendationid": "12040101", "language": "english", "votes_down": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568116", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431434147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 220, "playtime_forever": 100, "steamid": "76561197988012862", "num_games_owned": 3564}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": "4", "review": "Fist impressions:\n\nDrives like bumper cars (seriously, you bounce off obstacles), with decent controls which you ought to get the hang of quickly.

Tracks- A lot of tracks to choose from, but not at the start.\n3.Career Mode- This mode is about doing events and unlocking tracks, vehicles, and game modes.\n\nCONS:\n1.Graphics- The graphics compare to the other ford games is awful looking.\n2. Barely any settings-  Audio settings and thats it\n3.AI is faster than you- I find the AI to be easy sometimes, (Ford Escape is the literally the most OP car in the game) But they will bump you constantly and literally make the damage mode impossible to win.\n\nI dont recommend this game, but I do recommend to give it a go.
