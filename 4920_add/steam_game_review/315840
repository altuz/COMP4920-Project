This make each playthrough interesting. The amount of hidden stuff in this game is baffling. \n\nYou will die a lot in this game, but personnally i find the deaths hilarious in their variety, once you know the most common traps.

I really do... The core gameplay has fun moments and the number of possible interactions between items in the environment during combat is impressive. However,  the development team isn't nearly as active and communicative as the team working on Dead Cells.\n\nFor an early access game, I don't necessarily need frequent updates to the game itself.
