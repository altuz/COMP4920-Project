Graphics and art in general is pretty good, even though there's not much variety of enemies/places. Music is pretty solid, but again not much of it. Story is pretty poorly written but the setting is solid so it could have been better, the interesting parts only start in the last 15mins of the game. I found characters to be particularily unlikeable, while the royalty characters tend to be pretty common in this type of game, they're usually balanced by having different point of views. Only Yliane provides a different point of view in this game out of the 6 characters, and her point of view is clich\u00e9 and always the contrary of everyone else so it becomes dull also.\n\n\nThe game suffers from a few bugs such as NPCs twitching when patrolling as well as some technical issues like the lack of proper resolution or keyboard+mouse support(can't click on most stuff, have to use up/down on keyboard to move through everything, can't Esc out of stuff but instead have to use the Cancel button etc, so definitely play this with a pad, not with a keyboard).\n\nDifficulty felt very uneven, with most of the game being easy, but tedious(combat against trash mobs takes about as long as boss fights when you get the large groups, but pose no real threat if you use a proper setup... nor do the bosses really). However here and there some spikes in difficulty, like the last boss which proved to be unkillable with the particular set of chars/skills I had, I had to reload a save and change my skill build to kill him(I don't mean I was dying, I meant it was a permanent standoff, with the boss simply healing for more than I could damage him and with no way to prevent it because his heal has low enough cost that draining him of stamina wasn't enough). On the other hand I feel if I hadn't played the setup I had(tank+healer+DPS), the game would have been a lot harder. Monsters seem to hit for stupidly high damage with very little ways to prevent it due to how restricted you are in your skill usage by the basic combat mechanics, so having someone who taunts and having someone to heal that character felt almost necessary.\n\nCustomization felt minimal, there's very little gear to use and most of it is very standard stuff so no choice there, there's skills and passives, but a lot were redundant or weren't balanced properly when considering their cost versus their effects. I feel most characters only had very few swaps to be used, and most of it was fairly obvious, they were mostly stuck into their primary role. Which isn't necessarily bad, but there just wasn't much to do in these. You give your healer a single target heal, an aoe heal, a way to remove debuffs and that leaves one skill only. And obviously the passives will be stuff that increase healing or similar, so no real choice there. Every characters felt built like that.\n\nI'd say the most negative aspect is it's basically not a full game, it's like the first act of a game. The price is relatively low so it's not so bad, but don't expect a great rpg, this is just the opening act, a teaser, and not a particularily appealing one. This is especially blatant when you have to make certain choices during the story that have absolutely 0 impact on this game's story. I assume they'll matter in the next game maybe, but that feels pretty bad.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504788021, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504788021, "recommendationid": "34793593", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500832", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 128, "total_reviews": 193, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 65}}
