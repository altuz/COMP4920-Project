The most innovative games now include some built-in ability to fail, so that you can fail in big and small ways but still find reason to continue playing, rather than old RPGs which were either far too easy or so hard they encouraged obsessive Save Game-Restore Game loops. One of Bravada's smartest decisions was to make it tolerable to lose your party members: each time one of them dies, you receive an item that can let you copy any unit you encounter, so you can replenish your army with copies of either your current army, or any foe you face. This lets you try on all the units in the game, and incentivizes a manageable amount of death within your army.\n\nCompare this to old strategy RPGs where losing a unit in a level gave you no risk-reward; it simply meant your army was weaker. Add to that many S-RPGs would give each character a minor storyline, and you essentially had no incentive to risk units, because if they died, you lost precious characters you had grown attached to. \n\nBravada has several challenge innovations like this woven into a deceptively \"lite\" feeling game.

However Bravada is more then just an RPG, it is actually rather more a (turned based) strategy game.\n\nStill, there is another twist, the levels only go forward, in a straight line and you can't go back. You can place your companions anywhere you want, but you cannot exceed 4 lines. If you move all your team moves in the same direction unless they have an obstacle preventing them to move that way. Your team can grow to as many units as you can keep alive, each unit has their skill (the more typical RPG class kind of skills) and you can't upgrade their gear (you can for the main character). Except when they level up, it is sometimes possible to upgrade them to another kind of unit. For example a healer can heal one unit or you can opt to advance him so that he can heal multiple people but ofcourse less health will be gained. Units only have a limited field of effectiveness, so it is possible that your healer can't heal another unit because it is out of range. It's up to you to arrange your team in such a way that every unit can do its job in the best possible way.\nEvery level brings something new to the table, that way these simple mechanics keep the game fresh.\n\nIt's a funny little game, it doesn't take itself too serious and this is notable in the story (a dwarf on a quest for a beard) and it continues this humorous tone throughout the game. So, in case you expect a serious game, this is not it. I know some people are turned off by these kind of games, and sometimes it can be overdone, but i never got that feeling here.\n\nMusic, sound and graphics are all very well done. Simple, but effective.\n\nI can recommend this game, it does what it does well. And if you manage to buy this in a sale it is super value for money, even though it is a bit short. I wouldn't mind a sequel at all.\n\nThe game works great on Linux/SteamOS, configure your Steam controller as a mouse and it works like a charm.
