The cutesy pixel-graphics combined with the small \"playing field\" make it very difficult to see. \n\nAlso, I tend to prefer it when there is not a tutorial, unless game mechanics are complex enough to warrant a tutorial, so the developers including the text \"tutorial\" with button instructions seems like an odd and unnecessary choice. \n\nAdditionally, the controls are not what I would consider intuitive or smooth. I had difficulty moving and jumping at the same time on many occasions. Jumping height and distance were not consistent, and the button layout for the controller is awkward. \n\nI'd consider giving this game another try if some of these issues are resolved.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455758077, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456874432, "recommendationid": "21286611", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558620", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446001455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 175, "steamid": "76561198104958135", "num_games_owned": 130}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An enjoyable platformer,  many of the negative reviews adress wierd controls and lack of controller support.  Both of these issues appear to have been fixed as you can now change the bindings on all controls and I was able to play with a wired 360 controller.\n\n[b] Good: [/b]\n-Music is fitting and enjoyable, goes very well with the game.\n-Art looks nice and there is a good deal of variety from world to world\n-Gameplay offers a good deal of challenge that gets more difficult as the game progresses, especially with the boss fights.\n-Unlimited continues, when you get a game over on a boss, you don't have to go back to the begging of the world, you start back at the beginning of the fight\n-Enemies and hazards vary enough to not become boring, the enemies have different attacks and mechanics, not just different appearances.  The hazards have set mechanics or timed patterns that make them easier to avoid once you learn them.\n\n[b] Bad: [/b]\n-Health system, this contributes a good deal to the difficulty of the game.  The coins you collect give you lives back when you get 100, but there is no way to get health back during a level other than dying.  Your health is replenished once you beat the level though.\n-English translations, the game was localized from Polish and many of the translations are very (possibly intentionally) goofy.  The story itself is pretty light so this is very likely, but it does take you out of the game a bit, certainly makes you laugh.\n\nOverall I would reccomend the game,  It will only take 4-5 hours to beat the game depending on how proficient you are at platformers, but there are hidden collectibles and achievements that add a bit of replayability if you're into that.\nAt 10$, it is a very good difficult platformer for people that enjoy genre.  On sale, the game is certainly worth picking up for someone who has a passing interest in a short, fun game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439583023, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439583023, "recommendationid": "17540144", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511189", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1457002874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 41, "steamid": "76561198013317980", "num_games_owned": 731}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "DISCLAIMER: This review is from someone who has minimal experience with platformers (both historically and currently).\n\nI am one of the few people on the planet who has no real opinion about platformers. I didn't play them as a kid so they hold no nostalgic feelings.  I've also never been struck by platformer-fever; I have no strong feelings on the genera whatsoever.  I have played a small number of platformers (Mario, Super Meat Boy, DK, Blackthorn, & does Spelunky county?), I'm not inexperienced necessarily but rather a combination of unfamiliarity with the genera and general apathy.\n\nWith all that out of the way let's focus on Top Hat.   I'm not sure how I acquired this game, but I installed it because hey, why not? After a very cursory glance at the reviews and it\u2019s % standing (62% positive) I assumed this was gonna be pretty lame.  Low and behold it turns out that Top Hat is a resounding \u2018decent\u2019.  I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I expected so much less or what, but I\u2019ve been really enjoying my time with Top Hat.\n\nTop Hat wants to be an NES game.  Everything about the aesthetic of this game screams 1991 nostalgia.  The 8-Bit sound is fun and the sprite work is solid.  It looks way too clean to actually be an NES game (there is far more detail in the environments & sprites than an NES game).  Regardless of the aesthetic not being perfect \u2018NES\u2019 the visuals are pleasing to look at and the sound is right there pleasing away too.\n\nI think what really shocked me about Top Hat was how it controls.  It works really well.  By no means is it Super Meat Boy perfect but it\u2019s accurate and reliable.  Even with my miniscule experience I\u2019ve played a few badly controlling platformers and have heard/watched about how many there are out there.  Platformer controls are apparently one of those things that\u2019s very easy to fcuk up.  I was surprised Top Hat controlled as well as it does. Because of it\u2019s mixed reviews I expected something approaching Digital Homicide levels of bad mechanics.  What I found is a solid and acceptable \u201cphysics\u201d system. My only issue with the controls is that the default settings for a gamepad are stupid and hard to get used to.  Luckily the devs N94Games are better than most AAA devs and allow full button mapping on the keyboard/mouse and gamepad.  TotalBiscuit would be proud.\n\nThere are two major, universal problems with Top Hat.  The first issue is the fact that even though it\u2019s fun and functional, Top Hat is absolutely unremarkable.  This game is like a piece of plain toast and butter.  A totally legit food item that doesn\u2019t taste bad in any way but there is no glamour, mystique, or excitement with a piece of toast.  It\u2019s just toast and butter.  Same with Top Hat.  It\u2019s a platformer that functions great and is engaging enough to keep me playing but at the same time it\u2019s not all that interesting, kinda safe/boring, and ultimately forgettable.\n\nThe second and more prominent issue is the price.  $10 seems way too steep for Top Hat.  A quarter that price sounds much more reasonable to me.  It just isn\u2019t exciting enough to warrant dropping 10 bucks on.  This is the kind of game you buy for $0.75 during a steam sale and then are pleased when your expectations of meh are surpassed with \u201cmmm\u2026.not bad.\u201d  \n\nSo what\u2019s the TL;DR?  Buy this game when it\u2019s on sale,  For me, the full price is WAY to high for something of this calibre. It\u2019s good, just not $10 good. If you can pick it up on sale I think it will surprise you with how competent it is.  It\u2019s most definitely fun, a slightly less exciting form of fun when compared with something like Rocket League or The Binding of Isaac, but, it is fun none the less.  Pop Top Hat onto your wishlist and next time it\u2019s on sale for anything under $2.50 grab it.  At that price this is definitely worth playing.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456999642, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456999642, "recommendationid": "21599620", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506762", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441838184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 78, "steamid": "76561198104367290", "num_games_owned": 945}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I bought this game today and I was playing it for 30 minutes, I'm enjoying everything:\n\nGameplay and performance: 8/10, very fast movement response, the only bad thing is:\n\nI notice a little bit lag/freezing every few seconds during the gameplay, It makes me fall from moving platforms and is very annoying.  :-(.

You have 3 seperate sliders for audio options. Apart from that you can adjust the screen size(which I would not consider resolution options). Last, but by no means least, you can rebind the controls for keyboard and controller. \n\nGoing into the game, the first thing I've noticed is that the dialogue is well translated and the jokes came across fairly well. The music is also quite good, the only minor complaint I have is that the looping of the music is a bit clunky. \nGameplaywise I have to say that the gunplay(if can call it that way) and the platforming feel nice. \nThe enemy variety and enemy design is simplistic, but it does the job. The bosses so far feel relatively underwhelming(the mechanic of the first one is easy to dodge, the second one is quite tedious to fight), but it might change later on.\n\nOne thing I'd like to add before coming to the conclusion is that one of the \"selling ponits\" of the game is \"Challenging. Really\". So far I have to say, the game is not that challenging. It is more the case that the game is unforgivable in terms of mistakes. Since there are no savegame slots, you will only have one savegame. Apart from your progress your current lifecount is saved as well, which can end in a mess when you are only on one life bevore hitting a checkpoint. I can imagine that it is getting frustrating when you hit harder levels(or even bossfights) with only one life left.\nThe question I suppose is: Is the game difficult, because it's genuinely difficult, or is it because of design decisions in terms of savepoints, etc? And in the case of top hat, I say, it is \"difficult\" for the wrong reasons. \n\nWith that out of the way we come to the tl:dr: Is the game worth it?\nIt is not a bad game that is for sure, but as I've stated above, I went about 1/3 through the game within 30 minutes, so you can say that your average playthrough will take you somewhat around 2 hours. And apart from Achievments and a higher difficulty levels there is not much replayability available. \nWith that said, I'd say it's a definite buy at a sale, but if you are desperate for a nice action plattformer, you might consider buying this game even on full price.      \n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406895439, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1406895439, "recommendationid": "11505465", "language": "english", "votes_down": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476363", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463580164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 51, "steamid": "76561198180958407", "num_games_owned": 27}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "i  didnt like it im sorry not worth it :(\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463687601, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463687601, "recommendationid": "23086748", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475986", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427161443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 43, "steamid": "76561198107212873", "num_games_owned": 193}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Whoever made this needs a lesson on game design, level design, and balancing.

The designs of the levels from what I can tell vary drastically. \n\nOnly fought three bosses in the game so far, the first is very simple, was kinda dissapointed, but they do get better in my opinion. \nHere's a video of one of the boss fights:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-qaIgwOHD4&feature=youtu.be\n\nAlso a variety of different weapons, such as a gun that shoots platforms, and a freeze gun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1407090614, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485230574, "recommendationid": "11537946", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508564", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "total_reviews": 18, "num_reviews": 18, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 8}}
