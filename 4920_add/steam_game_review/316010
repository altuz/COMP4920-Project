I don't know what Wizard's of The Coast does to miss the boat so hard. But I'll first put this review into a technical and then a business sense:\n\nWhat works about the game:\n-Bare bones, the game launches, plays, has a GUI and from what I've seen as of February, very little bugs. It's a smooth experience to start and once you get into the interface it's an enjoyable segue into the game.\n-The music as always is top notch. I have yet to see anyone lodge a complaint against the music\n-Fair art direction. The cards already have art that they have on file so it's hard to say that they really go out of their way with the art on the cards. However, the 3D cutscenes don't quite match the style of the cards and come off more as a Nickelodeon spinoff of Magic; which, depending on your preference, may be a good thing.\n-The deck builder that everyone's been asking for is here. People complain about it not featuring a 'search by name' function. But I truly don't care. If you can remember the picture it takes all of about two seconds. And even if you unlock all the cards, it doesn't hurt to give your other options a browse while you flip to the card you want.\n\nWhat doesn't work-\nNow, before I get into the blemishes, it should be said that I generally enjoy the game but a review in my book is to tell people whether or not the product is worth investing in.\n-The RNG. The point of the RNG being so poor is obviously an incentive to get you to buy more and more boosters. Hopefully with your own money. An easy way to observe this is to play the story mode decks. The 'challenge' often doesn't come from having a winnable deck and being forced to outthink your opponent's cards. It's redrawing, and restarting the duel over and over and over until you get a really good hand, (Hopefully with good draws afterward) and sometimes even then, some duels I found were almost impossible to win unless the opponent suffered from several bad draws.\n-The Free To Pay model. Now, as I said, I love Free to Play. That's an awesome step forward with games with a competitive environment. I'll talk more about that in a second. But the problem here is that in the competitive side of the game, there's a huge incentive put on buying better cards than everyone else. Keep buy buy buying and hope your RNG gets you better cards than the other guy. A little RNG isn't bad, it keeps things interesting. However, when the incentive is to force the player to spend money when they would rather play with skill, then it's a waste of development time as you'll be seeing diminishing returns on your usage of those features.\n\nWhat's just in the middle?\nWell, between good and bad there's a few things that just sort of fall by the wayside.\n-The free cards you earn are not very competitive.\nGrinding for better cards can be fun. However, it shouldn't be done in the multiplayer against people with better cards, or at the very least not left to RNG boosters. Not neccessarily saying that the cards offered from the story should be perfectly competitive, but at least enough (if you've completed the whole story) to be able to play against starting level duelists.\n-Lack of dynamic matchmaking\nAs far as I can tell, there's not really any matchmaking algorithms in place to match you with people at your skill level. You seem to be matched with just whoever happens to be playing. This results often in playing against other players with much better or much worse cards than you rather than someone who offers a challenge and a fun game.\n-Lack of players\nI don't know how many people actually play this game. But I'm judging that not a lot do from how long it can take to matchmake. I guess many people would just rather play the hard-format card game.\n\nWays to fix it really simply-\n1.) First fix and probably most important: specifically two modes that I think will make the game even worth installing-\n-Team battle: Basically, five players on each team (5v5) or (4v4) or (3v3) duel it out with premade competitive decks (similar to picking a hero in Dota, each deck has unique themes and abilities and once picked, can't be picked by the enemy team).\nThis is going to be the main draw of the game. Teams can use game chat to speak to eachother, and make tactical decisions. Suddenly there's a team dynamic, and it's even better than just playing 1v1 with a friend.\n-Free battles: These are the current gametypes but reworked. #2 will talk about how to improve this mode. These are duels using decks that you've assembled yourself using the cards that are in the game. However, there can be certain rules applied:\nLegacy, Modern, etc.\n\n2.)Observe functioning Free to play systems: perhaps some of the best and most marketably viable free to play models are actually on Steam. Team Fortress and Dota 2 come with their own brand of users and you take them or leave them. Magic is much the same. However to make Magic work as an online game, all the content of the game needs to be free and readily available with balancing patches to control the meta game.\nThe reason why this works: players can spend more time on the game getting better, and more competitive with the game. Switching the content you want to buy to cosmetic, makes the game more worth playing.\n\n3.) By switching the focus to cosmetic, people invest more time into the game. As they invest, they spend more. I hate to say it, but Dota found the magic formula. You spend X amount of hours and as X+fun=Financial investment.\nNow you may say, but that still applies to this game! However, consider that because it's also pay to win RNG, you've got to face facts and admit that you've also got, X+fun-(loss x loss conditions)=fincancial investment. The greater the amount of losses, the less likely that user is to spend money on anything in the game. Nobody except a very small handful of people with huge egos will buy boosters just to compete in a pay to win game. It's very niche. The rest of the people willing to buy are hardcore magic fans who are already likely to just buy hard copies of cards.\n\nUltimately Wizards is in no financial trouble. However, they are walking away from a lot of money with this particular online game. By tweaking their approach by a bit, their financial rewards could be greater.\n\nPlayers however, if you are a huge Magic fan then you'll love that the game is free to play, but may grow tired of the monotonous grinding for boosters and long loss streaks in attempts to get better cards with less frustrating outcomes.\nIf you're not a fan of Magic, but a fan of card games looking to install one on steam, then try it out.\nIf you're not a fan of Magic and can take or leave a card game, then pass. There are plenty of other, (better) free to play games out there.\n\nIf the game is updated to a state where it adresses some of its core issues, then I will happily update this review.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486656912, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486656912, "recommendationid": "29804571", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558772", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491353630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 24819, "steamid": "76561198006839107", "num_games_owned": 123}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 38, "comment_count": "3", "review": "I recently started getting back into magic after being inactive for around 15 years. However, other than standard tournaments, I don't have many opportunities to play against other players, so I figured I needed an online version of magic to practice. Magic duels is OK to get back into the mechanics and see what other people play, but other than that, it's a HUGE disappointment:\n\n- Insane grind. buying boosters as a poor kid in the 90ies (p2w in its pure form) was more fun.\n\n- Stupid deck restrictions: rares 2x, uncommons 3x (to keep serious players away or p2w low?)\n\n- Strange format: not pure standard, balance seems off ( banned smuggler's copter still being played, too many cheap removal spells...)\n\n- Terrible connectivity: connection losses all the time, dropped players get replaced by AI and most of the time, you have to beat the AI in order to not receive a loss, alt+tab is all it takes to get disconnected, possibly lots of room for exploits. Lags are so hard that often you can't hit the stop button to react to your opponent, which defeats the whole purpose of playing magic. \n\n- No possibility to interact with other players: no chat, no trade, nothing. Which might be wise, because...\n\n- The duels community equals the bottom of the magic community. You won't find many good matches, real magic fans are probablly somewhere else to be found. Often enough, playing a removal spell is all that it takes for your opponent to pull the plug and let the AI take over.... which surprisingly often leads to the AI coming back hard and winning a lost match... and then there are these assholes just waiting everytime as long as the timer allows (playing a land after waiting for 1 minute) to make YOU unpatient and disconnect, giving them a default win.\n\n- Always playing against the same decks. Right now: red burn, topters, green ramp, sphinx tutelage. boring.\n\n- The campaigns are a joke. The way they try to tell stories is just unworthy of the magic universe. It's nothing but still images and written dialouge, combined with a muted 90ies-style render-cutscene at the end of each campaign. And the stories are just boring. It rather ruins the unvierse for me...\n\n- Presentation is rudimentary at best. Graphics are just the cards, a boring table, generic FX like fireballs and lightnings... even tablets could do better. There is only 1 music track playing throughout the whole game and it will drive you insane after the 2nd loop.\n\nI honestly can't find a reason to play this other than getting a very blury first impression of what magic the gathering is and that it's probably best to stay away from it lol. Do yourself a favor and play real magic or Xmage. I honestly can't understand the people giving this a thumps up.

But sooner or later, you'll want to try it again.\"[/i]\n\n[h1]ACTUAL REVIEW[/h1]\n\nI've invested a decent amount of time and more money than I care to admit in this game, so I feel its time to give it an honest review.\n\n[u]Pros[/u]\n+ Teaches you how to play MTG, So it's a good game to pick up for new players along with returning players needing a refresher.\n+ Atmospheric campaigns that introduce you to each new set while also earning you coins.\n+ Game limits your collection and deck to only one mythic, 2 rares, 3 uncommon, and 4 common cards of any individual card. This creates an artificial buffer and prevents players with too much money/time from building crazy decks that will dominate the metagame. \n+ Finite amount of cards for each set, meaning eventually you will have every card in the set. With older sets going on sale every so often to help build your collection more quickly.\n+ 150 coin price tag is very fair for a booster of 6 cards. Winning a multiplayer match earns you 30 coins plus any bonuses for completing weekly and daily quests means you can unlock at least one new booster every day with a decent deck.\n+ Every set since Origins has been included, and they continue to add new blocks as they come out, with some card exceptions that would be too complicated to code in a vs format.\n+ All the fun of FNM, minus the smell.\n\n[u]Cons[/u]\n- Mana tapping system needs work, though there is a mana tapping key, often times it either doesn't work correctly or is just too clucky to use in the limited time you have to play your turn. Nothing is more frustrating than a match going sideways because the game chose to tap the wrong mana for you.\n- Game is very buggy at times, I had to leave a match I was winning because the game refused to unzoom a card and blocked my view of the battlefield. Another time, the game froze on the \"opponent watching animations screen\" and it cost me the match. \n- Game has been out long enough for there to be enough \"auto include\" mythics and rares between all the sets to make it frustrating to play vs battles at times. I've run out of fingers and toes for the amount of times I've seen \"Combustable Gearhulk\" in any deck that has red in it.\n- Game really favors the constructed format of the game, which can be jarring/frustrating for players that like to play limted formats like draft, sealed, and pauper. \n- Plainswalkers dominate the game. Some are pretty benign, but you'll see the frustrating ones enough to make you walk away from the game at times. (I personally haven't liked plainswalkers when they were introduced years ago, At least back then they were reasonable being 6 drops with something along the lines of \"+1: Target creature gets +1/+1\" not 4 drops with \"+3: Make game unplayable.\")\n- No In-game chat with other players. (I would probably get banned if we actually had this, I'm humble enough to know I can be a sore winner/loser.)\n-All the frustration of FNM, minus the smell.\n\nI really like Magic duels, but I also hate it just as much. I've lost count of how many times I've walked away from the game, never to play again, just to find myself back again in another duel 30 minutes later. I honestly think you need to be a little bit of a masochist to enjoy this game. \n\nIf you like MTG, you'll feed that itch with this game.

The game offers Skill Quests whenever you encounter a card with a new ability and guides you through a simple scenario where you get to see how that ability works.\n\nBy playing through the story modes and completing the Skill Quests you will accumulate a reasonable number of in game coins that can be used to purchase booster packs of cards for you to build your own decks from.  You can then venture in to playing against friends or matched opponents online, solo battles against AI, and two headed giant duels.  This is where the game does encounter some issues.  Playing solo against the AI is fine and you can earn more coins depending on the difficulty level of the AI player.  The online matched duels unfortunately has issues.  The matching is very poor and novice/new players with only a few cards/boosters and relatively weak decks frequently get matched against players that have either played for a considerable time and earnt a significant amount of coins, or bought coins in game and then spent them on lots of boosters and built fast, powerful decks.\n\nOverall if you take the game at face value and view it as a free to play game that will offer several hours of enjoyable gameplay working through the story mode without having to spend a single penny then it\u2019s well worth installing.  If you are looking for a challenging game that rewards you for spending a considerable amount of money to be able to purchase new booster packs and build powerful decks with a collection of virtual, digital cards then you may be better looking at playing MTG Online.

I had to give it a thumbs up, eventhough I kind of feel bad doing so...\n\nDuels is a very nicely done digital version of Magic: The Gathering. The overall appearance and designs look terrific, there is a vast amount of cards to collect and the interactive tutorials provide a straightforward introduction to the sometimes very complex game mechanics. The AI seems impressive to me (eventhough I can't profoundly judge this, to be honest, since I'm no Magic veteran...) Collecting coins to buy new cards and improving your decks turns out to be extremely addictive.  \n\nI can HIGHLY recommend this game for people who:\n- Want to learn how Magic: The Gathering works\n- Enjoy single-player mode \n- Don't mind playing dozens of hours only to get a slightly improved deck that will most of the time still not be able to keep up in multiplayer \n- Don't want to play dozens of hours but are willing to spend quite some money to buy new cards...\n\nWARNING!!\n\n--> However I can NOT recommend it entirely because of two significant shortcomings:\n\n- It is not possible to sync different platforms! You might want to play, say, on your way to work on a mobile device, which is of course possible. However, running Duels on a platform other than your regular one, you will neither be able to use already collected cards nor to save your progress (e.g. earned coins) to your normal account which makes it rather pointless.  \n\n- Most decks you face in multiplayer are insanely overpowered. Just forget using a deck which to a large extent consists of cards from the intro pack you get for free. It is of course possible to boost your collection with new cards, but to do so you will either have play 100+ hours to get some decent decks or throw an awful lot of money at Wizards (which is of course what they intend).\n\nAs my time and funds are limited, this is what kind of spoiled this game for me. However, you might still give it a try, since it's free!\n\nTL;DR: I gave a thumbs up - but on balance I still can't quite recommend Duels. As always with these kind of games you will have to spend quite some money / a lot of time to be able to really compete with other players.

I've been playing it since Beta. This game has some good ideas but poor implemenation. Unless you're spending money it's impossible to stay current.
