The further one goes and does well, the more he/she gets better weapons (like in Silpheed: The Lost Planet) and can edit up to four in prep for the next battle (Gradius)\n\nThe soundtrack has quite a catchy beat and is quite charming (like in Stage 3 on the Highway Zone, it's catchy!) as well as can get quite badass (like in Stage 2: the Supercell Area), and even up to how tense some bosses can be in familiar titles like Deathsmiles, Castle Shikigami, and Touhou (such as the final boss) adding a hint of sudden hard-rocking atmospheric music to a powerful climax of an opponent! \n\nSpeaking of which, the game has a fair difficuly curve as well, one can do quite well in the first few three stages and then it will challenge a/the pilot(s) of the Hangeki fighter(s) to how well he/she/they can fight. Stage 4 is where the action may kick up and become really exciting (in my oppinion). \n\nMake sure to learn how to utilize the fighter's weapon settings well, as the hostiles will not hesitate to litter the screan with lasers and streams of bullets later ahead of the game! There's plenty of lives and infinite continues regardless of not doing so well, so it's also very benevolent regardless of how strong the opponents later can be. Never give up. \n\nThere is ONE gripe however, beware of a sudden \"Out of Memory!\" error which could hit harder than the game's true last boss himself! \n\nOh but one last plus: Did I forget to mention that one can bring a \"wing in arms\" along the way locally? (There is Co-Op!) and this will make many of the fights much easier!

It has a very low budget appearance, which brings in the $10 price tag into question. What I've played of it is kind of easy thanks to a forgiving hit box and 20 life limit per stage. While chaining enemy kills and leveling your ship per stage to unlock and upgrade weapons is a somewhat unique mechanic for a shmup the overall experience is a bit mundane, even though there some neat weapons and the screen clearing Hangeki attack. The more difficult waves that shoot multiple laser attacks and mortars make the game a bit more fun at least.

Hitting enemies with your normal weapon, increasing combo, and picking up yellow dots increases your meter which are used to activate the crazy weapons in the video. \n\nWeapons go from weaker level one weapons with quick cooldowns to wave clearing level 3s.

For example, to make it easier to keep a combo (i.e. not miss) as you thin out the crowd, when you beat enough enemies in the current wave, you get a screen clear (the eponymous Hangeki) to move to the next. Also, if you do mess up and die or drop your combo, you do slow down, but you can get some of your gauge back by just getting the yellow thingies from clearing the current wave.\nTIP: pick up the yellow bits that dead enemies drop! They're the actual gauge juice. Move around a lot: don't clear one column at a time, else you'll have to choose between picking them up and not missing shots (and your gauge drains when you're not comboing).\n\nYou equip four weapons (out of many unlockable ones) at the start of a stage, on top of your autofiring base gun. Your power gauge can fill multiple times, and more powerful weapons cost more gauges - they're worth using, as they'll usually destroy enough enemies to appropriately fill the gauge back up. You use the weapons that cost 1 gauge more often (at least when you're new), but it's exciting to strive to keep your combo up for just long enough to get to gauge 2, and even more as you get better at it!\nBeating a stage or challenge gets you a new specific weapon to play with, and beating the par time on a stage gets you another weapon. Note that unlike many games with combos, it doesn't *force* you to keep a single huge combo from beginning to end of the stage - it just improves your time overall, there's no all-or-nothing score multipliers.\n\nI haven't fully grasped some mechanics, and the acceleration on your ship is a little weird for such a frantic game (though you also get dodge buttons), but it really felt like I was playing something new!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486429340, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486429340, "recommendationid": "29752466", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1408428986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 226, "steamid": "76561197987945573", "num_games_owned": 246}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'll tell it to you straight, Alien Invaders on extreme steroids.
