It also goes way beyond just being a \"Sokoban clone\" because the game world contains laser barriers, robots, remote-controlled interlocked obstacles, and you control several characters with unique abilities who are gradually added to the game as you progress through the levels (so far I've encountered the parcel picker, magnet, teleporter, jumper, and remote controller; UPDATE: the final addition is the hammer guy who can remove wall pieces, which adds yet another layer of complexity). The point of each level is to get your characters (and the parcel) to their destination spots, for which they have to interact and cooperate to clear paths and block (or sometimes destroy) enemies. Not every puzzle features all characters; you will mostly have three to five; sometimes you'll get two or more of the same kind (four magnets, two teleporters, etc).\n\nThe gamelogic and the rules (who does what/who moves in which way) are well thought out, consistent, and at the same time simple and easily learned. The puzzles, however, are intricate and quite a few of them will thoroughly test your brain power, and that makes this game awesome: Minutes to learn, hours to master.\n\nI recommend playing this game without looking up the solutions. Try hard and have patience - it's much more rewarding if you solve everything on your own.\n\n[h1]UPDATE: [/h1]Yesterday I reached Level 125 and then the credits rolled. I had a total blast with this game! The level design is simply outstanding. I enjoyed almost every level despite the high difficulty. I solved all the puzzles and never looked for help, and so it took me ages, certainly more than my logged time (I'm not always online); probably more than 60 hours total. \n\nThe game has a level editor and user levels too, so there may be more to discover. \n\nI highly recommend this especially to the patient puzzle fan who likes complex, pure logic puzzles. There is no timing, dexterity or controller skill needed at all, as e.g. in [i]Stealth B_astard[/i]. You make your moves slowly and (usually) cannot die by making wrong ones (you cannot step into lasers etc). However, you can make wrong moves in regards to finding the solution, and trap yourself in a dead-end, and then you'll have to restart  - which happens a lot! Cracking the toughest puzzles requires an incredible amount of trial-and-error, backtracking, and patience.
