You progress in the game automatically, but you have some choice that will have impact on further progress and results in the game.\n\n[b] Gameplay & Story: 4/10 [/b]\nThe story is a simple comic book one - you are the hero of the city that has to save it from the villains. At the start of the game you get to know, that you have 3 days to get enough clues about the big bad guys called FEAR and save the city. The clues you gather through investigating crimes, fighting smaller bad guys and using your super powers to get something more or less special. Some quests you encounter are not connected to the main story and are there just to keep you busy, but since you lose time to find the clues for the big thing, it means the smaller quests are still somewhat related to the main story. The dialogs are nicely written, some are funny, others are more typical for comis books but they all feel well integrated.\n\n[b] Combat & Challenge : 3/10 [/b]\nYou fight the villains in this game by simply selecting which attack to use in a fight. There are always 3 choice and they have different hit chances and do different damage to your opponent. Basically, you just press on one and hope to hit, so far I was never even close to lose a fight, so it seems they are made the way you always win. The game does not feel challenging at all, its more for casual fun gameplay.\n\n[b] Graphic & Interface : 6/10 [/b]\nThe graphic has a nice style and feels absolutely comic-like which is the goal of the game. Surely fans of older comic magazines will enjoy playing with this graphic. There are not many visual effects, but the existing ones fit the game nicely. The interface is simple but again fitting the game style.\n\n[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 6/10 [/b]\nThe progress is rather quick, especially if you are a quick reader. Most of the game you only read what is happening in the city and rarely choose which action to pick next. There are no mini-games in Appointment with FEAR, so after few playthroughs the game feels a bit repetative since the choices remain the same and are not reandomised. Overall the progress is fine though, since the dialogs and texts are not bad and quite often you will lauph or at least smile a bit.\n\n[b] Audio & Immersion : 7/10 [/b]\nThe music is pretty cool electronic and definetely serves the comic game with science plays a big role. The sound feedback in fighting and small animations was fitting the game really well and the stay in menus or the game was made enjoyable by the fine tracks playing in the background.\n\n[b] Side-Notes [/b]\n[list]\n[*]This game is single player only.\n[*]This game contains steam achievements.\n[*]This game has steam trading cards.\n[*]This game offers some replayability, since you can try out multiple hero powers and check different quests and crimes in the city.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Summary [/b]\nAppointment with FEAR is a nice comic-style adventure, which will offer you some fun moments and replayability. Players enjoying being a hero with super powers in a pick your adventure games, will definetely have some fun with this title. Most other players will enjoy few hours of gameplay, but most likely will figure out how to save the city once and after that, the game is quite done.\n\n\nI hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game.
