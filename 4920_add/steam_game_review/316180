Another nice feature is the ability to put one of five ghosts on available points on the screen to create shooting turrets or healing points that aid you in your battle.\n\nWhat is good:\n1. The soundtrack... its awesome and very well done.\n2. The difficulty. The game is hard and unforgiving like a good shoot em up should be.\n3. The ghost mechanic gives the game additional replayability as you probably will want to try a different approach on a  level you've already beaten.\n4. Varied bullet patterns. If you've played a few bullet hell shmups you'll be surprised to see a few quite well done and interesting patterns here.\n\nThe bad:\n1. Controls feel clunky. You either feel like youre not fast enough to dodge the onslaught of bullets or you use your dashmove and overshoot. This of course gets better with practice but right of the start controlling Poe (the main character) never felt quite right to me. To me it felt like the dash move was originally intended to make you invincible for a few frames but then they cut that feature out at the last minute.\n\n2. Gameplay. Despite having scrolling backrounds this is basically a twinstick onescreen arena shooter like geometry wars. Enemies spawn on screen and you try to kill them as fast as possible. Most foes take a ridiculous amount of damage though and often times fighting those bigger enemies feels slow and repetitive. At the end it all boils down to which ghosts to use at what point in the level and i didn't find this particulary exciting. Never before have i played a shmup in which destroying enemies felt so unsatisfying. They don't explode or scream or have nice death animations. Killed enemies just vanish without a sound.\n\n3. Graphics. Stylish but Cheap. Everything looks like a cardboard cutout and is barely animated at all. Think of old flash games. Disappointing.\n\n4. Content. Yes there are ghosts and relics(passive boosts) to unlock when beating the levels at certain difficulties but at the end of the day there are only 3 different levels. They change according to the music at higher difficulties but to me everything felt quite samy.\n\n5. The whole rythm affects gameplay thing. A great idea that fascinates at first but eventually shows its downside: It makes the game unpredictable. Pushing the \"shoot\" button to kill a near enemy but you are not shooting? Yeah, because the music at this very moment does not allow it. This wouldnt be that bad if you could actually predict the music and play accordingly but the whole soundtrack (as good as it is) sounds like some kind of everchanging rave/techno/remix stuff. Try to predict this. :)\n\nAs you can probably tell i do not like A City Sleeps. Compared to other shoot em ups its slow and repetitive, looks cheap and has not enough content to warrant its price tag of 14\u20ac.\n\nYoull be far better off to buy stuff like Crimzon Clover, Jamestown, Deathsmiles, Akai Katana or any other shooter from cave.\nThe only redeeming thing about A City Sleeps is its soundtrack.

It's nice to see a developer take a chance on such a obscure genre, that I believe is only really popular in Japan. \n\nThe gameplay is fluid and flows perfectly, the art is beautiful and each enemy stands out.

You play as a member of an exorcist organization, and must go into three people's dreams of increasing difficulty and destroy what is haunting them with the assistance of ghosts with varying powers, from healing to electric shocks. For the most part, Killing enemies isn't your top priority, it's surviving. after a set amount of time, most of the enemies just leave, to be replaced with different enemies. The only major enemies you want to take down first are the ones with health bars, and the bosses. In the first stage of each dream, you have a large amount of health, so getting through to the boss isn't too difficult, but when you advance to the more challenging stages, you'll be tempted to use the Mercy (healing) ghost, but don't. It doesn't heal enough to be useful and it dractically reduces your point multiplier. The other ghosts, however, do come in handy when you're in a tight spot. \nThe highlights of this game is it's music and it's art. I personally love the art style and can't get enough of it. As I said before, the music is amazing and worth playing for the music alone, even if you're not huge on the bullet hell thing. \n\nOverall I definitely think this is a must buy for any music lover.

It is tied to the beat of the music. While usually at a good clip, there are some spots where it slows down.\n* Not shooting isn't really an option. When you stop tilting the stick, a significant chunk of the music goes mute, which diminishes my enjoyment of the game.\n* Tied in with that, dual-stick shooting gets really old really fast when you can't let up.\n* No bombs. You have to earn your bomb by closing to melee range at hitting enemies, which turns your ranged attack into a melee one.\n* Doesn't feel good. I don't really feel in-control of movement, as the game feels too sluggish to warrant the \"only your core takes damage\" dodges that a bullet-hell shmup demand, and using the dash is an exercise in \"point in a general direction and hope you didn't point the stick one or two degrees off\".

The game might feel short to some people because it only has 15 levels but each level increases with difficulty the further you progress which adds more challenge to this game because, duh, it's a Bullet Hell shooter game, that's the whole point.\n\nIn short, I would give this game an 8.5/10. It's a great Bullet Hell shooter with fantastic art, music and gameplay.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419580694, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421472826, "recommendationid": "13606598", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1414716649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 292, "steamid": "76561198015216593", "num_games_owned": 653}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A fun twist on the bullet hell arcade game genre. The soundtrack is excellent and the power ups enhance the gameplay.\n\nMy only gripe is that the story is lackluster and the game itself is very short and there's only higher difficulties to play through. This can make for some tedium but it's still a fun and mesmerizing time. \n\nBe sure to catch this game on sale!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417968994, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1417968994, "recommendationid": "13270360", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "total_reviews": 24, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 8}}
