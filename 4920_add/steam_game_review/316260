Sadly, \"Universe\" lacks many other franchises characters.\n\nEDIT: Stars guage power level, and they apperently persist and stay with ther costume. I consider that an honest mistake because it's certainly not explained. \n\nGameplay is a brain-numbing objective based brawler where you do what the game tells you and beat up anything that gets in your way. Enemies are actually fairly sophisticated. They infight, they build traps, they steal objective objects and run away with them; This makes having a lot of enemies on screen extremely entertaining rather than irritating like other titles. Even though you won't see them the first time, there are models for every type of unit for every theme. Playing with a lot of friends will thus probably bring out the hardest enemies in the highest quantity. \n\nEvery area is composed of three stages. The third has a boss. There are three areas to a theme. You unlock costumes by completing each area, with many costumes being unlocked by simply replaying levels. \n\nAfter awhile you start to get bored of the uniform design of the levels. While every level tries to introduce new mechanics some of them begin to get more intricate. I call it a puzzle brawler because that's what it is, you lack alot of mobility other such games have. There are jump puzzles, and they tend to be very irritating as some manuevers the game expects you to do often have a high chance of making you respawn. Even with a few deaths the game rarely gave me any better than bronze while solo. \n\nGet it cheap, especially if you have friends that enjoy drinking. Buy a few packs of beer and drink every time you respawn, that'll make the game far more entertaining. The lack of real story and limited selection of costumes can be a drag, and the gameplay tries to be inventive but the core player abilities are just dull.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417939570, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1417999522, "recommendationid": "13264748", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493057", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452173581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 95, "steamid": "76561198123477273", "num_games_owned": 82}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Since i was like Disney Publisher , i loves Disney Franchise games...\nI dont much care the graphic \nbut story , extra , character , gameplay , co op gameplay will change everythings~\n\n^thanksdisney", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448792910, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448792910, "recommendationid": "19359210", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497872", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498318565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561198356540042", "num_games_owned": 7}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "the people look like calvin dressing up", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499201088, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499201088, "recommendationid": "33247759", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494191", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 20, "total_reviews": 27, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
