Simple stuff\n\nOutstanding Issues: Some texture glitching, low resolution, Xbox 360 pad buttons not well represented on screen. Co-op only detected player 1 as controller and player 2 as keyboard.\n\nReview: The whole point of it is for kids to play together, possibly up to four originally I would assume, and then whoever wins gets a trophy and whatnot, the game keeps flattering the player's ego, and reinforcing that they are doing a good job for doing basically nothing, its a little nauseating to see. \n\nCo-op is broken basically, unless you can convince one of the kids to use the keyboard and the other the xbox remote, two remotes would not detect at the same time at the appropriate screen.\n\nThe minigames are all in all fairly uninspired, there was also some slight texture glitches and the overall resolution of the game was poor. \n\nI cant say that the tales of mater were terribly entertaining either. All in all a very forgettable experience, that is way more janky than should be expected from such powerhouse name as Disney. \n\nVery disappointing product, buyer beware", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493455718, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506593598, "recommendationid": "31434998", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 6}}
