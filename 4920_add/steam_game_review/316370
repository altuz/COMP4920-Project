I played for an hour and requested a refund.  The tutorial island is terrible, the 'helpful' messages get in the way of your view, all inventories are unintuitive, what is clickable on the screen is impossible to tell without mousing over it.  \n\nThe very first quest had improper info.  Talk to the quest giver then open a door elsewhere.  Get to the door, says talk to the quest giver.  Go to quest giver, says open the door.  Have to Google to find out there was a key in a box that I didn't click on.  No need to talk to quest giver.  This is the opening tutorial.  If these mistakes are here, who knows what else is wrong.\n\nOn the opening island there is only 1 enemy.  So far the game seemed to be trying to explain how things work, but no tutorial for fighting.  So I figure out how to draw my weapon and begin fighting...which involves holding down left click on the enemy.  Seems fine, just like Diablo.  Figure I will get more moves later.  Nope, not fine.  Enemy doesn't die.  It's not like I have any skill I can use here, all I can do is melee at point blank range.  Enemy kills me with 2/3rds of it's life.  I respawn and attack again (Happily enemy doesn't go back to full HP).  2 more deaths and 5 mins later and it's dead.\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with the Cursed Weapon I was holding.  I found this weapon lying around, looked better than mine so I equiped it.  It's the tutorial, so what could go wrong?  Totally cursed.  Can't un-equip.  I couldn't even figure out why I couldn't un-equip until I saw a small icon in the top right of my screen saying I was holding a cursed item.  It should have said something across my screen when I tried to switch it out.  \n\nThen looting is terrible.  Want to mine?  No animation.  Just opens up a window with some ore.  EVERYTHING is like this.  Can't even shift click to put it in your inventory.  Drag and drop.  Or click a picture of a hand to get it all at once.  \n\nMap is fairly bad as well.  It's huge, as advertised, but ugly and hard to understand.  For instance, I wanted to un-curse my weapon.  I had to look up what a Shrine looked like on the map since it's not listed under the rest of the large icons that signify areas of importance.  Saw this complained about in another thread since I had to look this up to.  Got to the Shrine that would supposedly uncurse my weapon, but I saw no option to do so.  Accidently fell in the water next to it and died.  Submitted a request for a refund.\n\nI don't doubt that it gets better as I go, but I'm not going to waste time here.  I found Dwarf Fortress to have a nicer UI.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1447077835, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446783253, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446783266, "recommendationid": "18901982", "developer_response": "\"the 'helpful' messages get in the way of your view\"\n\nHelpful messages are here to show what is clickable, usable or of interest to the player. These messages are there to be read and most of  them disappear once you click on the object in question. For example, message above the well will disappear once you click on the well.\n\nAlso these messages explain what certain object is used for - wells for water recharge, oracle stones to identify items, god shrines for sacrifice items and remove curses, runes to unlock locked crates and chests etc.\n\n\n\"The very first quest had improper info.

If these\nmistakes are here, who knows what else is wrong.\"\n\nWe have changed texts few days ago to reflect this. Tutorial island has few simple quests, some of which are chained together. Mostly quests 1,2 and 4.\n\n\ntutorial quest 1: Arrival at the Docks (Taras Ras Balinos, Ship Captain at Sidis Tarea Docks)\n\n\"Today we have arrived at the docks of Sidis Tarea. Looks abandoned. No traces of people at all. Ship captain asked me to look around. Dockmaster's office is supposed to be to the east of here, near the end of the docks. That should be first place to search.\"\n\nShould be pretty self-explanatory. Go to the office to the east. It can be seen on the map since it's the first building you encounter. Once you enter the building, quest is completed and captain will give you next quest.\n\n\ntutorial quest 2: Preparations for the Journey (Taras Ras Balinos, Ship Captain at Sidis Tarea Docks)\n\n\"Everybody at the docks seems to be dead. Whoever or whatever did this might still be around. Or they went to Sidis Tarea next. Whatever it is, it looks it might be\na good idea to get some equipment - weapons and armors before I travel to Sidis Tarea.\nCaptain said there's a garnison barracks to the north. Dockmaster should have the key for the weapons room.\"\n\nNote the \"Dockmaster should have the key for the weapons room.\" part. Also, during conversation with the captain he says \"Weaponry is usually locked. Only two people have the keys to it - the garrison commander and the dockmaster.\"\n\nWhat you should do is just take key from the dockmaster's office and enter barracks. Also, toltip on barracks door is changed to tell you you should return to the dockmaster's office for the key. Just in case somebody misses quest log entry... and same during the dialogue with the captains.\n\n\ntutorial quest 3: Searching the Warehouse (Herbalist at Sidis Tarea Docks)\n\n\"Journey to the Sidis Tarea may be dangerous. Herbalist on the docks says she can create some healing potions, however she lacks dawnleaf, one of most potent ingredients.\nThere's a warehouse in the northwestern part of the docks. I should go and search it.\nI may be able to find some dawnleaf.\"\n\nJust go to the warehouse to the west and that's it.\n\n\n\"On the opening island there is only 1 enemy. So far the game seemed to be trying to explain how things work, but no tutorial for fighting. So I figure out how to draw my weapon and begin fighting...which involves holding down left click on the enemy. Seems fine, just like Diablo. Figure I will get more moves later. Nope, not fine.\nEnemy doesn't die. It's not like I have any skill I can use here, all I can do is melee at point blank range.\nEnemy kills me with 2/3rds of it's life. I respawn and attack again (Happily enemy doesn't go back to full HP). 2 more deaths and 5 mins later and it's dead.\n\nThis is regarding tutorial quest 4: Scouting the Road (Taras Ras Balinos, Ship Captain at Sidis Tarea Docks)\n\n\"Road toward Sidis Tarea lies east from the docks. It would be wise to scout ahead, to see if any danger lies ahead. If everything is ok, we could travel toward the city, and if not...\"\n\nWe have changed this. Now the Cultist in question is handycapped to level 0 with ~40HP. He can be killed while staying butt-naked with worst possible character created, without any skills or spells.\n\n\ntutorial quest 5: Journey to the Sidis Tarea (Taras Ras Balinos, Ship Captain at Sidis Tarea Docks)\n\n\"Strange cultists seem to be behind the attacks on the docks. We have to warn the\nauthorities in Sidis Tarea. However captain cannot spare more men to go with me\nso it seems up to me to find the road that will lead me to the city.\"\n\nJust click on the boat to end the tutorial.\n\n\n\"Perhaps it had something to do with the Cursed Weapon I was holding. I found this weapon lying around, looked better than mine so I equiped it. It's the tutorial, so what could go wrong? Totally cursed. Can't un-equip. I couldn't even figure out why I couldn't un-equip until I saw a small icon in the top right of my screen saying\nI was holding a cursed item. It should have said something across my screen when I tried to switch it out.\"\n\nAuto-identify cursed weapons is also added to the game. Each time you equip cursed weapon, it will be identified.\nJust as it says in the messages near the Oracle Stone or God shrine.

I'm loving this game! It reminds me a lot of Gothic (my favorite game) or Risen. Don't expect cutting edge graphics or animations.  The focus of the game is on story and exploration. The world is packed with stuff to interact with and to find and using your map is essential.  Yes, you can make bookmarks on the map.  The voice acting is great. Combat is OK; don't expect Grim Dawn style action combat. You don't actively block or dodge; combat is stat dependent. It can be a bit confusing getting started, just like Gothic was, but if you explore, everything is explained pretty well.  I also recommed watching the 3 tutorial vids and reading the manual.  Quests unlock areas of the game, so if you can't do somethng or somethng is blocked/locked, there's a reason. You can go do something else and things will work themselves out. There's minimal \"hand-holding\" in the game, ala Gothic. Quest givers don't have ! over their heads; you have to talk to people. And there's no \"Ta-Da\" when you complete a quest.  You have to figure that out yourself.  Did a merchant send you out to find a camp that was overrun by enemies and to recover a lost message?  Well, when you come on a bunch of ruined wagons and dead people, and you pick a message up off the ground, you can assume you solved the quest.  I can see spending very many hours in this game. The game really simulates exploring a new land pretty well. You have to annotate your map, you have to find stuff yourself and you have to figure out your route and your methods of accomplishing goals. To me, that's real immersion. The game is running well on my machine.   I've found only one annoying glitch, but Iggy is working on that and it didn't stop my progress in the game.  What game doesn't have a few glitches, at first?

I love all types of RPG games and Wave of Darkness is another one to add to the list.To me it came across of Diablo 2 mix with Sacred 2.  For an early access title, there is plenty of game contents to keep you going for hours. At the time of writing this, I only put in almost 5 hours but had no major game crashes or game breaking bugs to warrant any reason to stop playing the game.  With my GTX 960 I can run the game on max with some minor frame drop every now and then.\n\nThe combat can be a bit chunky but overall not to bad. The spell creating in great. After you created your spell, each time you cast it, it levels as well. There not to much in the way of skills as I can see yet but you do get attribute points in both character leveling and skills leaving. There are fast travel way points with in most locations.

I do. But it dies in a lot of aspects.\n\nIts basically the same game weve all played, but does it worse in a lot of ways. Youd probably enjoy your time more if you just up and bought Skyrim or Diablo or something.\n\n\"Can be explored in any way and whenever you want\" Funny then what are these hedgehog walls (which any functional being would have no issue climbing over or around) doing here? They arent any better than the invisible walls the game page says this game doesnt have. Oh yeah, and the cunning lack of invisible walls by using deadly deep water instead. \n\n\"Allows you to combine and experiment with different character classes\" Yeah, maybe when you get a fair distance into the game. But you might as well just resign yourself to Melee for the time being, because you dont have a choice when you start up the game, only difference is that melee specced stats are more useful at the start than magery specced ones.\n\nThats just the start of the blatant flaws this game has, not to mention it actually doesnt look as good as the screenshots above, even on max settings. Its like playing NWN again, but far less functional.\n\nNot worth the price, and not worth what i paid for it when it was on special. Maybe later if they fix some massive issues, but at the moment, steer elsewhere.\n\nThis game claims that its for the Hardcore Oldschool RPG fans. And im insulted, as i am one of them.\n\n------\n\nBecause apparently two features they used ambiguously wasnt enough, heres some more of my experiences:\n\nTutorial is a joke, it barely tells you where to go. You are quite frequently expected to have any clue when the quest objectives progressed, and at the end of the Tutorial when it tells you to 'find your own road' to the first city, it fails to mention that there isnt one. Going right results in a blocked road and broken bridge. Up leads to water which will apparently dissolve you since youre water soluable (What? seriously?), Down does the same. And left leads you to a peninsula with loot on it. Guess how long it took for me to realise \"Skip tutorial\" was what i was apparently meant to do. (i think so, anyway. The quest straight up vanished from my quest log)\n\nLooting is slow and overwhelming, literally turning the first few minutes outside the tutorial onward into an inventory management game.\n\nThe combat is simple, (and while very reminicent to other games of its type), is incredibly unimaginative. Bash/Cast/Buff/Summon/Etc. Nothing new, nothing special.\n\nThe map claims to be huge, and by scale it is, but literally only because your means of transport is a jog. The map itself is pretty average in size.\n\nThe ground itself has poor hitboxes and a wrong step when exploring could put you into a certain death situation due to the lack of a 'jump' button. (not complaining about the button, mind you).\n\nthe time it takes to bring up the save window (even on an i5 4690k and gtx970) is pretty obnoxious, considering certain other titles have zero issues with loading said menus.\n\nSome tips that pop up suggest you to use taunts, when the button isnt even bound by default.\n\nthe character and weapon models look like something youd expect from the mid 2000s more than today. (think Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines number of polygons)\n\nOnly half the objects that can be interacted with indicate so (Corpses of kills do not at any point indicate so) and the rest only show up when you mouse over them. \n\nLooted objects remain in world (fair enough) but can be looted once more, and with many of them overlapping, mostly clipping into the floor, or straight up having iffy clickboxes (i had to click a cultists foot, once to get any loot) youll quite frequently spend post battle clicking over and over on all the corpses to make sure you didnt miss anything, since even an EMPTY lootable can still be looted again.\n\n\nIts a common occurence that \"open world, go where you want\" results in a lot of lack of direction and confusion as to the focus of the game, and this is no exception by any means.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1447105191, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446856660, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446892460, "recommendationid": "18919842", "developer_response": "Wave of Darkness works on a new 64-bit engine with significantly performance improvements.

The usage of spells at the beginning of the game may be insufficient, and requires the usage of melee weapons as an assistance to the inexperienced players, but that can completely change in the game with the mastering of usage of spells.

Not a lot of dev's take time like this to help people out. Secondly, I think a few of the comments here may be correct, as the game does not have a positive review as a whole. Which isn't fair. From what I've seen, it deserves one.\n\nAnother EDIT: I've finally fixed my issue. I'm not sure if it has to do with having two monitors of different screen region, but the game wasn't launching in 1920x1080 - though not being the correct region I still feel shouldn't crash the game and make it unplayable.
