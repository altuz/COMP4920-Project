However after playing the game for an hour or so and getting past the horrible intro to the game, I started to have fun. While it is not tthe best game out there, it is certainly not the worst. I wasn't sure why they were charging for a f2p game but I realised that in game, you get 100 IRL currency and a \"bond\" that can be cashed in for some basic gear. Now a lot of people ask if this is pay to win, not at all. you can buy in game items with IRL money, but they only last a limited time. But this is the nice part, you can earn these items and weapons by simply playing and finding/looting the items in game, and they will last forever.\n\nSUMMED UP-\n\nPay To Win?\nA- No, you can buy items that last a limited time. However you may earn them in game and stay forever.\n\nWhy Pay For A Free Game?\nYou get in game currency that you would otherwise have to pay for IRL anyways, this way you pay less than usual and get to support the dev's. It is early access as well.\n\nIs This Even Fun?\nIn the beggining, not at all. But I dragged on about an hour, and it suddenly became fun! After completing the horrible intro, you are free to explore and do quests, level up, and earn skills. Just like any other MMORPG. But this is in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R world and has a great community.\n\nIs the world PVP?\nNo, there are arenas ment for PVP as well as the \"wild\".\n\nWhat Is The Wild?\nThe wild is a massive part of the world where pvp is enabled and anyone can kill, killing a player has its negatives and posotives. Many players choose to ignore others and get on there merry ways. This makes travelling to foreign lands risky yet exciting. You will not only have to fear the environment, and wildlife, but also \"Bandits\". There are safe zones spread throughout the wild to protect you from such people, and safely trade your goods.\n\nKOS? (Kill On Site)\nFrom what I have seen, No. Players love working together in this game and the community is great. The game has a lot of negative aspects to killing others, such as being labeled a name such as \"Murderer\" And this will cause players to avoid you and not trade with you. There are many reasons why people do not kill on site.\n\nDo I Recommend This?\nFor 1$, Yes. For 10$? Not at this state. This is a F2P game after all. The game is very unpolished but well worth a dollar, especially for S.T.A.L.K.E.R fans.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420344798, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1420344798, "recommendationid": "13822298", "language": "english", "votes_down": 52, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616169", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1420184932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 954, "steamid": "76561198004723291", "num_games_owned": 21}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 89, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Game is not very polished, quests are wacky, graphics are very out of date.

Back in before steam when people played it, there was a really good community, where one side was the guys protecting and guiding newbies, playing artifact hunter, and weapons/gear hunters, another was bandits, just destroying newbies and stealing loot.\n\nWhat makes this fun is that you can hear about the bandits (players that loot you as you return from an artifact run) from other players, and then go hunt them down with other members of the community, or just play a bit of bandit yourself.

It is also free from their website but (could before hand) be bought on Steam for a special 100 ingame money. \n\nGetting right in:\n\nThe title looks god awful no matter the settings, the FPS goes up and down like a hookers knickers this title needs to greatly improve these performance issues. \n\nA plus and a good thing is, it can be played in 1st person (F4) to help with immersion, NPC quests however don't help to much immersion wise as tthey are guessing games not that they are all in Russian they just hold no real interest to whoever is reading them after the 5th time you've been looking for the right NPC. \n\nIts like reading the same lines of text numerous times guessing/looking for the right NPC at the right time to trigger the right event, this chore increases the unhelpful likelihood off skip ahead important text. NPCs names are from what I've seen all in Russain which means you will more likely be checking every NPC to try and find out who the hell is who, hence the burnout above. A fix of giving them English names will help greatly somewhat with the above. Like invisible walls its plagued with completing linear collecting  tasks/quests that bores you to tears. I do hope that after the 1st town this game opens up. It could do with dumping the old tried stadard MMO stuff and replace it with more open-world survival.\n\nThe controls themseves i can't really fault and seem stantard stuff for a MMO. The community I have had little interaction with its hard to know if its toxic or not due to langauge. Althou the community do love to spam areana invites every two mins that got me killed twice. Specailly when you are on your way to collecting (x) number of mutant pubez as part of the quest/task you've been given. I'm sure all MMO's are just  the same game reskinned it like they don't have a orignal thought between them. \n\nI'm keeping this title a thumbs down for now. Its just not the langauge barrers, the NPC interactions with yourself, the proforrmance issues. Its a title that has missed the boat a longtime ago, its been under delopment for years, looks older than even that. At this moment I can't see this becoming anything special, its a old game that has been given CPR due to current interest in surivial games.

Huge potential, but development is sloppy and slow. Badly optimized, but even on high settings graphics are somewhat a joke. Mind you, I don't care much for graphics, but this is to inform people, after all. The content that's there feels unpolished, and a constant feel of amateurism washes over you while playing.\n\nHowever, if you run around the game with this feeling, like I did, you will also often be surprised by the many different angles the game offers. There is plenty to do, you can put hundreds of hours into the game and still see new things the next hour. Eventually the feeling of amateurism would remain, but added with a feeling of that these devs know what they want, and what they want is \"proper\", so to speak, but also that the road there will be long and hard.\n\n--------\n\nOverall it's only barely a MMORPG in the traditional sense, and that's something i'm happy about. It may not feel very open world due to the game being composed of several (large!) different maps, but in effect you're absolutely free to go where you want. Knowledge of the game, maps, anomalies and etc is more important than hours put into the game, in many situations. \nSkill and/or luck also plays a big role; Where in a traditional MMORPG a lvl 10 does not stand a chance against a lvl 20, this does not apply here. Especially in PvE it's more dependant on how you handle the situation. However, as you progress, you are able to get better gear and this too, plays a big role.\n\n\nWhile in essence most quests are well made and interesting, considering they are mostly relatively simple/traditional kill and fetch quests, they are unable to immerse you properly, one of the biggest things keeping you from being very immersed is sloppy and missing translations.\n\nOverall the combat IS good, but just doesn't feel very good due to eternal lag/latency issues.\n\nIt sometimes feels like the russian player dominancy ruins the community aspect for non russian players, and hackers can ruin any session at any time.\n\n\nStill.. I do recommend the game. It's a special game. It's one of a kind... We should be happy it exists in it's current form.\n\nWe all know a true franchise S.T.A.L.K.E.R. MMORPG would be a traditional grindfest that would probably not feel anything like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. except the world it takes place in. This MMORPG, sZone, tries hard to avoid the traditional MMORPG feel while still attempting to maintain some degree of balance and still stay true to some of the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. concepts. It's far from reaching it's goal, however.\n\n\nCan't comment much on microtransaction/P2W, as last I played is over a year back (Except these few hours on steam) and haven't researched what is available and if any items aren't available for F2P. Far as I can remember, back then, it was Pay to Progress faster, mostly gear wise. Not P2W. But can't be sure.\nEdit: I read a different review stating the best armors are only available for premium currency. If true, that would without a doubt mark the game as P2W.
