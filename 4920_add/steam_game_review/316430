I can surely say that with this game I knew awesome people wich are now my friends. (Easy to get friends with this game\nThe Developers didn't gave up on this game\n\nCons\n\nLots of dlc's\nVanilla servers are pretty dead\nIf you're an mowas player the controls will be inverted (can change tho) \nRussians with high ping", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505006004, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505006004, "recommendationid": "34850479", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505009", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505766454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 3671, "steamid": "76561197989290281", "num_games_owned": 1203}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "https://youtu.be/WTYHyFeiqek\n\nDespite the hours I have played this game for, it is fair to say this game does have a lot of rough edges. The voice acting for one is especially dire.\n\nSo in typical MoW fashion you can control all manner of troops, guns and tanks as well as the inventory managment down to individual soldiers. The mpas as ever are quite large and detailed and pretty much everything is destructible. And whilst the graphics, animations and sound are all pretty decent, the game is bugged with the same issues as other games in the men of war series. \n\nMainly pathfinding and AI issues. So yes the enemy AI on a field gun will still wreck your tanks with out any problem, your own AI manages to miss enemy tanks even when the directtly in front of them. And yes trying to get your soldiers from A to B is like herding cats. And yes there are times when you will need to save scum like mad to achieve certain objectives. \n\nOther frustrations include trying to build defenses and squad managment. Well bascially there is no real squad managment as things tend to go south pretty quickly leaving you with troops and odd units all over the maps. Same with defense building there is simply not enough time to ever really utilise the tools given effecttivly.\n\nThe game also suffers from some technical bugs such as campaigns that cannot be completed, or sometmes events not triggering until you reload and replay the mission a few times. \n\nSo basically if your a sucker for punishment like me and you like the MoW series, and linterested in the WW1 setting then this is worth a look. And if you buy the full deluxe version then you do at least get a lot of campaigns for the money (if they don't bug out). If your on the fence I really recommend waiting for a steam sale. \n\nIf you don't like the MoW series then this will not change your mind. It will just remind you why you hate those games in the first place.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505765977, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505765977, "recommendationid": "35052408", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503370", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505584895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 214, "steamid": "76561198066842806", "num_games_owned": 183}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I am really impressed developers did an amzing job of recreating wwI.
