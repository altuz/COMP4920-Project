Nothing that you shouldn't expect from a small indie game like this. It's all a part of the charm, and it just adds to the character.

It's not something many people can pick up instantly, but after a bit of practice anyone can get into the groove.\n\nCo-op is, as I've said, the mode I enjoyed the most (and from what I can tell it's designed around). It's probably best to see the single player as an added challenge extending the co-op part of the game. And with all these local co-op action games coming out it's good to have a puzzle game to chill out with.\n\nThe devs have also been updating with bug fixes and gameplay tweaks which is great.\n\nIf you play on keyboard I would highly recommend you remap the keys to something you feel is comfortable.
