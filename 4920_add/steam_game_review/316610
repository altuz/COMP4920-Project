Then they took it a step further, true completionists will hate everything to do with this game and how much thinking is needed.\n\nPlayability, Basically anyone of any age could pick it up, even replaying some of them is quite fun, although it might be fun if there was a 'move counter' for each snowman so you could see how few moves it takes you.\n\nThere is nearly no interface, and that makes the game that much better, everything is immersion based, you go to options; it is the dude thinking to himself, not just a immersion breaking up-in-your-face window.\n\n\n\nEven though I've completed the first half of the game, I can see myself coming back to the godlike-advanced parts later on for a challenge.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499639621, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499639621, "recommendationid": "33416630", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503624", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 67, "total_reviews": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
