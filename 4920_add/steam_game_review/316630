This graphics pack is a valuable asset for those making (pixel art) RPG games and could easily be used with the RPG Maker series (though you do have some work to make it compatible). But aside from RPG Maker you can also use the characters for any other 2D engine.\n\nCharacters you create will be around 125px high and 50px wide and you have about 6 base bodies to build upon. With the body, head and facials being all seperate elements the sky is the limit when making your characters. Add one of the few dozen clohing items (also seperate elements) to the character and you're close to an infinite number of characters you can make.\n\nWith the PLUS, there's also a CON to the system. With these models being made with RPG Maker in mind (though too big for that), there's not much room for animation in other engines aside from the 'fixed' RPG Maker animations. I want to incorporate these models into my Unity RPG game I'll be making and animate them with Spine (awesome skeleton animation tool,  not on Steam) and that'll mean that I have a lot of work to do and I'm not sure how it'll come out from the pixel art style the pack has.\nAn other CON is the clothing for your character, there are also a lot of 'loose items' in there that don't seem to match with anything and there's a lot of 'fixed' sets as well, where you somewhat *MUST* match them, lowering your freedom of choice in sets.\n\nIn all, I think this pack is certainly worth to grab if you want to make a fantasy RPG and are in need of a flexible character creation system...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434608060, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434608060, "recommendationid": "16490566", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506322", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491332913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 27, "steamid": "76561198054431042", "num_games_owned": 191}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Oh yes, full of goodies and lots of variation.
