Contrary to the patch notes, there is still no initial draft. Kick/punt return yardage is still incorrect. The game still doesn't feel like football, but more importantly, it's simply not fun. Getting through 2 preseason games felt like a chore (I might add that I've played through many, many seasons in FOF7 and PFS and loved every second of it).\n\nOn the plus side, the new 3D camera angles are nice, but not nearly enough to make this game playable. Overall, I didn't really see anything changed in the patch to keep me interested.\n\nI really wanted to like this, but due to the fact that this game is still extremely tedious and non-immersive, my (non)recommendation has not changed.\n\nCurrently 1.5 / 10\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am a huge fan of both sport management games and football and there hasn't been a good football management/coaching game made in some time. Needless to say, I was very excited when I heard that this franchise was being revived... Unfortunately I have been very disappointed so far. So far I've only played 2 preseason games and these are a few of the issues I've found:\n\n*No initial draft - You're given a team to start with and have no control over who's on it.\n*No 4th down conversions as far as I can tell. There is a category for it in the game recap screen but every time I've had a 4th and short the AI decided to punt automatically.\n*No 2 point conversions... Very frustrating.\n*No onside kicks... Again, this is a necessity if you're trailing late in a game. None to be found here.\n*Quarterbacks like to throw to receivers who are well covered even if another is wide open.\n*On the flipside, defensive backs have a tendancy to either stay a few yards away from the receiver they're supposed to cover or just not cover him at all. This is probably my biggest annoyance at the moment.\n*No forward progress - If the ball carrier picks up yardage and then gets pushed back, the ball is spotted where the play ended.\n*Incorrect yardage for kick/punt returns - On several occasions I've seen a kick returner tackled before he gets to the 20 yet is still awarded a return of ~35 yards.\n*Blitzing doesn't seem to be effective in the slightest. I'll have to do some more experimentation on that, though.\n*You are limited to 16 plays from your playbook on each play meaning that sometimes the play that you really want to call may not be available.\n*There are all sorts of grammatical errors and typos.\n*The only penalties I've encountered thus far are offensive offside and illegal contact.\n*No play clock.\n*No audibles.\n*3D view is simply useless. The 2D overhead is much better for diagnosing what's going on on the field.\n*There appears to be no multiplayer whatsoever, not even local.\n\nThese are just the issues I've noticed right off the bat. I haven't even really messed with the managerial side of things yet. As it stands, this game feels like a very early alpha and in its current state I couldn't recommend it to anybody. Hopefully it will improve with time, but for now I'd advise you to stay away.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412271393, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1412970199, "recommendationid": "12328161", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638237", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1412309266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 421, "steamid": "76561198005696526", "num_games_owned": 71}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 50, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I will come back and edit this review if the game improves, since I'm writing this on the first day of release.  First of all, kudos to any developer and publisher who attempts to create an American football manager game - We are starving for such a game!!!!!!!!!!  Sadly, the first impression of Front Page Sports Football is not good.  Keep mind I'm writing this after only 10 minutes of gameplay.  It's a \"first impression\" review.\n\nIt's definitely an \"Early Access\" version with lots of work to be done. It needs about 6 months of work in my opinion before it's a 4 out of 5 star game. Currently, I give it 1 out of 5 stars. My first impression is that there's no obvious way to edit player names or team names other than your own team name. Many of the player names are odd and unusual names. I'm not hearing any sound. The simulated game is displayed in a tiny small window and has no camera angles to choose, it quickly goes to the next play without giving the ability to rewind or re-watch the play, nor any control of the camera for that matter. It definitely needs the ability to replay the play, the flow is too fast. You can pause the play, however, but you can't go to previous play or skip to the next play. With no sound and no camera controls it doesn't give a good first impression. It's zoomed so far out that I can't really see anything, are my linemen doing any good? My receivers on the far side of the field, can barely see them at all. My cornerback is setup backwards pointing his butt towards the receiver before the snap. I do like the training schedule to improve your team players. I don't like that it starts me out on Day #4 after the draft. I would prefer to begin on Day #1 starting with the draft. There seems to be a lot of players suspended for illegal drugs.

My teams games aren't actually played or simulated. It just says 'Planned' and is never played. The pre-season and first week every game played, the second week my game was the only one this way. The second week about 6 other games had the same problem and week three 4 other games were not played. So some teams have now played 4 games and I've only played one.\n\nInability to play aside, this game needs work. It seems like a soccer fans version of a football sim. The free agent market has enough high quality rookies to build a team around (as best I can tell) including available red circle players who are suposed to be the best players in the game.  Quality rookies are almost never available as free agents in the NFL, as they would all be drafted. There might be a few that slip through the draft, but it usually isn't easy to see who they might be until a clever team takes a flyer on them. There are certainly no NFL starter caliber QBs as rookie free agents. There were three very good to star type rookies just waiting to be signed in this game. And in general an available rookie star or more at each position in the free agent market. It's much more like the soccer transfer market.\n\nThe 3D view looks nice but isn't very useful, you are stuck at about a first row of the stands view with no ability to adjust the view. Since it is 3D why can't you change the view? Isn't the the point of 3D? Anyway it is almost impossible to tell what linemen or anyone on the other side of the field is doing in this view.\n\nPlaycalling is just a big list, it should be broken down by formation and play type.\n\nThe whole thing feels unwieldy with a lot of information overload and no real way to feel like you know what is going on.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412280421, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1412280565, "recommendationid": "12329880", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511768", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1412917576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 256, "steamid": "76561197989913485", "num_games_owned": 115}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I was super excited when i saw this coming was coming, now I wish I had wanted to read reviews.\n\n- No explanation\n- Poor user interface\n- no sound? at least not for me.\n- game stopped simulating for me afte a couple weeks.\n- FAQs are in general not useful\n- and the list goes on.\n\nI really hope this gets more work, the original was so well done that this is just nothing be disappointing at this point.\n\nI will change my review if the game is improved.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412285377, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1412285377, "recommendationid": "12330699", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512262", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1412367081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 212, "steamid": "76561197996176198", "num_games_owned": 200}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This thing's so bad that I really don't know where to start.

Once I got over the fact that it was not my beloved FPS football from the past and gave it a fair try...there ARE some good things here....management wise. Graphicaly it's CRAP, there is no sound so que up your favorite steam albulms or whatever. Is it real football? Kind of, for the most part yes, but there are somethings that dont seem correct. For instance outside line backers do not correctly split the difference from the #2 receiver in twins. I don't think cover two or cover 3 are done correctly. The outside OLB has curl to flat in cover 3. yet there are plays that blitz the OLB whithout a safety or risky(MLB) covering his zone. This is simply not done in American football as all the receiver has to do is run a go or rail route and the CB must go with him...thats cover 3, 3 deep. The blitzing player is ususually the strong safety or this saftey takes on the role of the OLB and covers curl to flat. The game does not do this correctly and many times a back will swing out of the backfield for an easy reception in the flats with noone within 20 yards covering him. The extra point animations are stupid.....the upback turns and charges the place kicker actually getting in his way before the kicker strikes the ball wich magically goes through the up-back. Penalties are called \"fouls\" and the programmer despite claiming to know American football messed up with these A LOT.\nOverall.. I play it sometimes for the drafting, training and player evaluation aspects. I even watch my games games in 3-D but tghe animations are on par with the very first madden games which were light years behind FPS football.\nWould I reccomend?

At this point I am very glad that I not only got this on sale but paid for it with money from marketplace sales and not my own money.\n\nThe people responsible for making this game should change careers because they have no clue on not only making a football game but no clue on making a fun and usable game.\n\nSo far, I can't even stomach getting through the draft.  It is like they sat down and took the time to figure out how to make it as unplayable as possible.\n\n(Edit 2/7) - Let's say you want to start a game.  You pick a team and the next thing you know you are at teh beginning of your first draft.  How do they run th edraft?  Like any other sports sim that steps through each pick and allows you to pick and select your player?  Of course not!  Instead you have to create a \"Draft Pick List\" and then hit the button to advance to the next week (I guess this 5 round draft takes 5 weeks).  Then you get to seee if you got a player that you wanted from your list.\n\nSeriously, who sat in the design meeting for this game and thought this was a good idea?  Please change careers, there is nothing worth salvaging with this line of thinking.\n\nYou see an exclamation point that says you have unused training sessions.  Click on that and get to see the training options...  Technical Training, Physical Training or None... That is the first set of options.\n\nSelect Technical, you get a subset of options.  None, Team Play, Arm Technique, Hand Technique, Footwork Technique, Kicking Technique....    Sure, those options make plenty of sense for a football game's set of training options.  Another part of the game that was made by someone who has no clue what football is.  After that you get a subset of positions to train, I guess I can train my QB for arm technique?  Maybe footwork?  Who know what these actually represent...\n\nPhysical Training give a subest of Workout, Recovery or Stamina.  Any of the options allows you to choose what position.  I guess recovery isn;t for an injured player, but for all players in that injured player's position.\n\nAfter getting through the draft I guess there were 7 rounds as I have 7 new players.  The exclamation point told me that I had players that need contracts, it is the rookies.\n\nClick on a player, no contract button but a contact player option.  I guess we have to contact them to work on a contract.  Contact Player gives me the options to Cut, Transferable, new contract...  If I had OCD the fact that the new contract options isn't New Contract (Capitalized like the other options)...  Transferable?  What kind of option is Transferable?\n\nClicking new contract brings up...  one contract that you can click confirm for...  hopefully this is just because the player is a rookie...\n\nAfter signing the player I see that Transferable brings up something that looks more like what you would get is you were playing a soccer sim and wanted to Transfer List a player, the verbiage used is even the same.  Again, someone with no experience with football.\n\nI can't sign more than 2 players as it puts me over 53 players, so let's forget about the rookies for now.  I click on one of my current players to see if I can renegotiate a contract.  I get the same lower case new contract button and click on it... only contract terms listed with a button to accept the new contract but no option to actually negotiate the values or change them.  Why even have these options?\n\nI can't take much more.  Maybe one of these days I will get to an actual game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419321702, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423349785, "recommendationid": "13540680", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504710", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458105709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1593, "steamid": "76561198120472931", "num_games_owned": 53}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I had fun playing this game even though sometimes it makes it really hard to enjoy your time spent on the game. With the new update the game runs much smoother and it actually will run well. That is why I am recommending this game because it is a great idea they just need to refine the game. For instance, I have a quarterback with decent running ability but he will never scramble he will just set and throw. It is either he gets sacked or he throws the ball. This stinks because if that would be added a whole new element to the game would open up. \n\n            Another thing that I dislike is that in the draft i get all these good players but i cant sign them because i cant sign more than 53 players even though i cut 5 players to make room for the ones i just aquired. This is the part I am having the most trouble with because I draft these great players to fill in holes in my lineup and I cant sign them at all. Other than that i had a fun time playing this game, and even found it a little easy (i won my first game 42-17 even though i was trailing 14-17 at half and my second game 45-10) Also my fullback is a beast. The game tells me that he is not very good but he ran through a ton of people and I relied on him more than anybody else. This tells me that their rating system is off and they just generate random ratings for each player and they don't really effect the game very well. This is a little alarming because that is supposed to be the foundation of a game like this.\n\n             If they will keep refining this this it will become a very good game. I also recommend to get this game on sale (i got it for six dollars) because it is not worth twenty dollars and it also goes on sale a lot. This game is overpriced.... so only pick it up if it is on sale 6$ and under is what i would reccomend just to be safe. So overall could be a good game but it has many flaws that ruin the great idea that the game is.\n\nRating:\n5/10 (very limited appeal)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420334254, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425186521, "recommendationid": "13820211", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503038", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 50, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 2, "review_score_desc": "Very Negative", "total_negative": 44}}
