Each room is similar, often too similar or out-right copied, flipped and filled with different enemies making it difficult to really discern where the player is going, a problem that's exacerbated by the slow movement in the game. Combat is also a slow dredge but very rewarding as each enemy has the capability to kill the player who in turn must rely on quick thinking and a few simple moves to over come a single or multiple enemies. Puzzle rooms are cleverly designed with a few simple pieces working together to create a real challenge, and the timer is a unobstructive and positive addition for potential speed-runners.\n\nIf $10 isn't a huge price tag to you, the it's a good game.

Understanding that this is by design and is meant to be adapted to is essential to enjoying and completing Shadowcrypt. \n\nThe description may sound like the game has procedurally generated levels, but it does not. This isn't a bad thing though, once you get into the game you learn to embrace it. The levels are technically non-linear, but at the end of the day, they're linear. They just involve exploration and remembering where to go; the crypt is confusing and a bit maze-like, but that's a part of the game. Getting lost in the crypt is also part of the game. You'll see.\n\nYou get three lives, and when you lose them all you start over from the beginning. A complaint I hear a lot is people saying once you lose your first life you're screwed because you lose all of your gear (which is an important part to progressing). To these people I say: Don't get discouraged! You can beat this game with the starting crappy weapons, as impossible as that may sound. If you're good at fighting in this combat-based game, you will move forward. And there will most likely be a weapon or shield drop or a treasure chest. Just keep going, don't give up!\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nThis is one of the BEST games I've played this year. It took me a long time to beat it and I appreciated the mood, the music, the excellent character animation, the sound of the dungeon doors opening and closing, and especially the challenge. It's old school and feels like you picked it up from the SNES bin at the local game store, and I love that.\n\nI'd love to see another game like this from One-bit Punch, or a sequel. I'd love to see more weapons, more levels, and more boss fights. I couldn't tell you how much money I'd pay for another, longer, more expansive version of this exact game. \n\nIt's grindy, it's retro, it's moody, it's a real challenge. I'll be playing it more in attempts to get the ridiculously challenging achievements. I highly recommend this game. 10/10\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423267421, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423267421, "recommendationid": "14360379", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506421", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439671721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 773, "steamid": "76561198070607579", "num_games_owned": 374}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Shadowcrypt is a semi-challening combat focused platformer that takes obvious influence from classics like Castelvania and Zelda.  Unfortunately it is missing a few things that would make me recommend it.  The lack of content for the price is the biggest issue here and if the game was a quarter of the price then I would perhaps look at the game differently.\n\nLike arcade games of old, death will put you back to the beginning of the game.  The dungeon is not procedurely generated, so death will mean you will be playing through the same dungeon over and over.  This isn't a problem if the level you are forced to repeat is enjoyable.  Unfortunately in Shadowcrypt, many rooms are empty and encounters are separated through backtracking which becomes tedious very quickly.  Most of my playtime was spent jumping through empty rooms that look almost identical.  More encounters and some new designs to make areas fresh would have worked wonders.\n\nCombat is quite enjoyable, certain enemies require patience and if you try to hack and slash your way through everything then you will most likely die.  Again though, lack of content means that the combat isn't as good as it could have been.  Swords and shields are great, but to limit combat to only these weapons with some slight variations based on damage is just poor.  I would have loved a staff with limited usage or a slow and heavy battle axe to crush certain enemies under their shields.  The lack of content just pops up time and time again.\n\nRepetitive encounters, environments and a focus on backtracking just make Shadowcrypt more of a chore than it should be.  At the moment it is too expensive for the content and you will be able to find much more enjoyable experiences for less money.

But after playing over and over again, I found myself breezing through the parts that I deemed were too difficult at first. It goes to show that the more you play, the better you WILL become.

It does not advertise randomly generated rooms. Every playthrough will have the same rooms with the same enemy and trap placement. The only thing random about this game is the item drops and on-hit modifiers. Some people might want randomly generated rooms (and it is appealing to subsequent playthroughs for some games) but this game is in the mindset of Legend of Zelda II, Castlevania, and classic arcade games. Every encounter is carefully crafted, not generated. \n\nThe combat is precise, simple, satisfying, and difficult but fair. When you are not moving or attacking, your shield automatically blocks hits. Enemies can do damage to you with attacks or by walking into you. If enemies didn't deal damage from walking into you the game would be very easy. Some enemies have no good way to counter you if you just duck and stab. Ducking doesn't let you shield bash, but dodges high attacks and blocks low ones, making you extremely defensive. If they couldn't walk into you to deal damage, every encounter would end with you ducking and stabbing their ankles to death while taking no damage. Doing hit and run tactics by constantly running and stabbing is sort of viable, but not nearly as fast, satisfying, or viable as just keeping enemies back with a shield bash. It's the superior tactic. The javelins help in terms of dealing damage from a range, but you have a limited supply and they don't deal a lot of damage. Attacks and shield bashes hit all enemies in front of you which helps make groups manageable, though so far I haven't had more than two people attack me at once. Again, if you take damage in combat, you only have yourself to blame. \n\nThis game does not advertise itself as an RPG or a rogue-like. It is very much an action game, and a very tactical, precise one. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice, but nothing special. You trek through a fairly standard dungeon with nice pixel graphics and a fitting soundtrack. It's decent, but nothing to scream about. The pixel lighting is very nice though and adds a whole lot, though.\n\nEDIT:\nSimply playing the game for a bit longer showed me what each element and shield does. Fire for damage, ice for stun, and lightning for knockback and piercing javelins. Defender has a chance to stun, Avenger for damage, and Hammer for extra knockback. It is a fairly short game, but a fun one that I can see myself replaying a lot. The only thing that takes away from this game is it's relatively short length and everything that comes along with that. The story is minimal, but not really important in this type of game. If this game was ever expanded or used as a basis for another game, I would like to see pretty much more of everything. More kinds of enemies, more traps, more weapons, more elements, more shields, more rooms, and more areas. The number of these things in Shadowcrypt itself suffices for its scope, but there really is only room for improvement.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1410886341, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1410999177, "recommendationid": "12120231", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502624", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 21, "total_reviews": 38, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 17}}
