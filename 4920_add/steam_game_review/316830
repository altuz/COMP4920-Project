Not only does Sprite Lamp allow you to use lightning shades single sprites, but if you own [url=http://esotericsoftware.com/]Spine[/url] it also allows you to lightning shades on the animations you have made. However, the lightning shading DOES require quite some work to implement though, because you have to make a couple of extra black/white images of the original that allow the program to create the active lignthing shading.\n\nOn top of it all, both Unity and GameMaker are supported by Sprite Lamp. 2 engines that are also supported by Spine as well.\n\nSadly the author is not overly active on Steam or social media. You can contact him through [url=http://www.snakehillgames.com/]his own site[/url] though and he replies pretty quickly there.
