Trash.\n\nOutstanding Issues : Options in the menu are broken, cannot switch resolution without crash. Opening the credits showed the developper's photos and what is, assumedly, their real names, or maybe the developper is trying to shame someone they hate either way not a good idea. After the credits closed the game started at Mission 6. I did not know how to use the game so I died and went back to the menu but it crashed. I restarted the game and I noticed that all loading screens have those weird green dots all over the background, they have large Comic Sans font lettering, takes forever to load. I managed to identify a shortcut from the keyboard so I pressed it when mission 1 loaded and I got a black screen. By then I was 3 minutes into the game so I idled 2 more minutes so I could write the review.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493637452, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506594423, "recommendationid": "31484280", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504446", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 28}}
