If you enjoyed playing obscure games on Genesis and NES you will probably get a kick out of it. Many developers use retro graphics with modern gameplay but this game uses retro graphics and retro gameplay. Some younger folks may not realize it but a lot of the problems with this game are intentional (because it tries to recreate cryptic platformers of the past ) Good game if you wearing nostalgia glasses but there are some major problems that could have been fixed easily.\n\nThis game has limited open-2D world. You will not get a lot of help navigating but the formula is very simple. Basically, you just run aimlessly until something happens or you find a power-up that allows you to go to new places. I enjoyed the no-hand-holding aspect of the game but excessive backtracking and lack of fast-travel made it a lot more tedious. On that note, I would not recommend this game if you expect the game to tell you where to go .\n\nPros:\n\n+A retro love letter to the mediocre feel of obscure NES/Genesis games. Unintuitive by today's standards but also refreshing.\n+Pretty good animation especially when you kill enemies.\n+Lots of enemy types with different mechanics. So many annoying Birds damn it ( Castlevania tribute no doubt ) \n+Some funny dialogue .\n+Kind of open world. Well, not exactly but it is a large game.\n+Good amount of things to find.\n+Decent platforming elements \n+Good level design for the most part.\n+Overall I think the game is presented well.\n\nCons:\n\n-Combat is completely Meaningless. The game gives you no reason to ever fight anything beside bosses. You will not feel like fighting carefully because there are no limited continues.\n-Lots of Backtracking. That alone kills the game. You can easily spend 1 hour going the wrong way or in circles.\n-Confusing/Cryptic goals.\n-One save file. I accidently overwrote mine by checking out the tutorial.\n-I like the music but you only get one per map so you will hear a loop for hours .\n-Lack of fast travel.\n-Not much to do in towns. I wish there was some store system.\n\n[b] Verdict: 6/10 [/b] You will probably like it if you into exploring dark corners of old consoles (it does a good job of re-creating that kind of game nobody plays). The Waste Land is too big and tedious to not have fast-travel. I am not gonna spend 10 hours jumping over enemies that I have no reason to kill. Not having any incentive for combat kind of makes the game obsolete .Not a terrible game but some small design changes could have made it so much better.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492578643, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493217811, "recommendationid": "31231279", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498765", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 23, "total_reviews": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 23}}
