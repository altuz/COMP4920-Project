The level design runs the gamut between straightforward and maze-like, with my personal favorites being logically zoned residential or military areas. There is so much detail put into this game and its environments. The soundtrack is pretty catchy, the weapons are fun to use although most of them are fairly standard (with the possible exception of the grenade launcher and mauler, and definite exception of the sigil), and the enemy design is pretty cool. The quests (such as there are) are fun and interesting, although both they and the currency (gold) both become more scarce and more worthless as the game progresses. I just wish the rpg influences were a little more pronounced.\n\nStill though, solid recommendation. Can't go wrong with this remaster which fixes a lot of bugs and adds a number of features not present even in the older engine ports.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500827891, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500827891, "recommendationid": "33747863", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454290040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 812, "steamid": "76561198048385355", "num_games_owned": 150}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "How did I miss this gem growing up?!?!?\n\nStrife is basically doom with a dash of rpg, where you move at the standard Kenyan sprinter speed, have lots of different guns to play with, and destroy lots of bad guys in fun and interesting ways, but there are also towns with people to talk to, merchants to buy gear from, sections where you can stealth your way through vs run and gun, and the dialogue and voice acting is brilliant.
