Maybe it's something about my config (Win 10 64bits, AMD RX480, 16GB RAM DDR4, playing at 2560 X 1440 with everything on high). Or something else. I checked the game files integrity and it seems to be OK, but it keeps crashing. Anyway, the game is cool, if you are into puzzles this is a good choice.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497646386, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497646386, "recommendationid": "32485364", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506587", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
