Never finish a title. Ban you from making comments about them and their lake of skill coding. This game like all their games so far is unplayable and is finished in their eyes. Made me feel like I've been mugged. It's just stupid how crappy this game is.\n\nThis is my only negative review on steam. This will be removed so they can continue to sell this title. That is so wrong and I find myself disappointed with valve for allowing it! I can only assume that now that steam allows refunds this company will disappear very quickly. 30 odd hours and I never made it around the track once. There was no point as I could never make the controls work well enough to play.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Ghost%20Machine", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439721057, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1462193849, "recommendationid": "17564631", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617210", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1413139904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198002331248", "num_games_owned": 188}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": 0, "review": "2/10\n\nBought it to use with the Oculus DK2.\nThe ONLY thing it has going for it, is the fact that it uses the Oculus.\n\nThe cars handle HORRIBLY, a F1 racecar has more play in its suspension then my 1990 talon. SUPER sloppy handling, either the developers didn't give a crap, or they have never driven in a car.\n\nThe maps are bland and uninteresting, I played 3 races.. all of them on a circle track. (might have been the same track now that I think about it)\n\nThe graphics are crap, looks like a racing sim from the early 2000's\n\nit crashes alot when you try and work the menu.\n\n\nSo yeah, if I had to do it over again, I'd spend my $20.00 elsewhere.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413140130, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1413140130, "recommendationid": "12468436", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517061", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1422760577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561198059235586", "num_games_owned": 203}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Oh boy, where does one start!  MS Revolution will go down as one of the most unremarkable and forgettable titles around.  It felt like going back in time to a playstation 1 game, the graphics are blotchy and outdated, even on the highest settings.  \n\nThis game offers nothing that the title suggests, there is nothing revolutionary about MS R.  The game's weaknesses are all too evident:\n\n        - Laughable AI\n        - Stone Age Graphics\n        - Dull Engine Sounds\n        - Horrible Car Physics\n\nIf you truly are mad enough to still buy this broken and hideous game then at least do yourself a favour and research it on the net.  Look up all the videos you can and then decide whether you're still keen to invest in this game.  I decided to ignore the bad reviews  posted, now i'm $14 dollars down and left with a driving game that has been uninstalled.\n\nDon't pay attention to the amount of time spent on this game, i've spent far more than what is recorded.  I never play online, when a game downloads i disconnect from the internet to play all my games offline.  Please take the advice to research this title before jumping in to purchase,  it is a major step backwards that simply isn't worth investing in.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422762188, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422762188, "recommendationid": "14272336", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519901", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1411074732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561198037277954", "num_games_owned": 647}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": "4", "review": "Oculus support is very good once you have it set up. Not straight forward to set up as is expected with most DK2 games. \n\nI am happy to suppoprt this game and do not regret the purchace BUT...\n\nLogitech Driving Force GT support is currently flawed. The cars reverse on thier own when no pedals are pressed? The car handling will be improved in future updates I am sure but even in comparrison to much older games like LIVE FOR SPEED and even RACE 07. This is the reason I can not currently recommend this game. \n\nThank you for supporting Oculus Rift!! Keep up the hard work and keep those updates coming I will change my review once the game breaking issue is sorted. I know that it stated supported wheels are Logitech g25/27...
