Particularly the gun. It's a basic unit that if it's lazer sights lay on you for too long, it will fire and send you back to the checkpoint. The problem is execution. The enemy type requires you to move a certain distance per second across the guns point of view to keep from being locked on, but there are parts of the game where you are swimming and your turn -> accelerate speed is just too slow. The most taxing moments in the game for me were mostly gun related.\n\nMy other main frustration was never knowing which direction I'd be sent when I jumped out of a pool of water. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game enough to 101% it after just 106%'ing Super Meat Boy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504677082, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504677082, "recommendationid": "34770154", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505796761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 12, "steamid": "76561198197798185", "num_games_owned": 47}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I only got about 20 minutes into this when I started to get a pretty bad headache.
