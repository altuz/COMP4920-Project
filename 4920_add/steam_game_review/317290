While it continues the spirit of that game... I am not completely pleased with it. There are two plotlines, one on Earth, the other on Mars. Thing is, the one of Earth almost always ends with an act of mass murder. And the one of Mars... well, that isn't much better. Also the two characters I liked most from the first one do some of the worst acts possible. Basically, there are only two (maybe three) storylines where they end up together, and... in most cases they had to do those horrible acts...\n\nStill, it is a fun read, so it does have a lot of good points... So I guess I shall have to recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493367858, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493367858, "recommendationid": "31411303", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
