I\u2019ve had an alright experience with it, it\u2019s just not worth $24.99. However, I bought this when it was 50% off which feels like the right price range for it. Still, during my experience with it, I enjoyed the first route I went through. Then after that, I grew exponentially bored with this game with each consecutive route to the point where I was holding the ctrl key the whole time.\n\n\tThere\u2019s nothing outstandingly bad about this game other than the fact that losing in this game is easy to do. You are only shown the stat conditions to winning, but there are other instant-failure conditions that the game leaves ambiguous to the player. And the worst part is that you don\u2019t know that until your love interest rejects you late in the game. \n\n\tStill, I recommend this game due me probably being in the minority of the people whom bought this game liking dating sims but dislike stat management. The story is good with a lot of comedic moments and the characters are all well made. If you haven\u2019t bought this game yet, I recommend buying this on sale.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501018645, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501018645, "recommendationid": "33795554", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 38, "total_reviews": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
