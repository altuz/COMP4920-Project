A lot, that's what! This exciting, over-the-top Action-movie styled shooter is something of a unique design. It was derived off the mod for Half Life, The Specialists. While Double Action is made on the Source engine, rather than the old Goldsource engine, the game lacks the graphical touch that a lot of modern Source engine games get. However, if there has ever been a game that shows that a game doesn't have to have realistic graphics to be enjoyable, let it be this one. Double Action carries many unique traits that I have not yet seen in any other shooter. The feature that sets it apart from most shooters is the brilliantly fun Stunt system. This allows you to press right mouse (by default) to leap through the air, and even slide for several metres across the ground! Or you can use this to unrealistically and rather painfully slide up stairs, whatever you prefer. Not only this, but it has many other uses. You can use it to leap off walls, or effectively double-jump, the world is your oyster! The Stunt system isn't the only part of this shooter that makes it truly unique. While playing this game, you will find the game repeatedly slows down. This is for dramatic duels between players, and it allows you to make your moments of glory last that second longer. This leads to epic James Bond  (sorry I couldn't be more imaginitive!) movie-esque duels between players that never get dull. I could ramble on a bit longer, but for a man with only 3 hours into this game (at the time of writing this review, I plan to play many more!), I've bored you quite a bit. Here's a list of pros and cons of the game from my experience:\nPros:\n+ It's free!\n+ The Stunt and slow-motion systems are unique to this game, and really add to the exiting atmosphere you're in when you play the game.\n+ Weapons are *fairly* balanced, none in particular stand out as 'overpowered' to me.\n+ Maps are strategically-well-designed.\n+ Bots seem to be fairly sensibly coded AI-wise.\n+ There are no in-game purchases.\nCons:\n- There aren't many maps (albeit, as said above, they are well-designed).\n- The player base is fairly small, but I've never failed to find a server with a decent amount of people on it (I'd say 10 people is the minimum for a fun game, a lot less than the likes of Team Fortress 2).\n- Graphics could do with touching up a bit.\n- Updates from the developers are sparse, and there appears to be little communication between the developers and players as of late (the last update was in October of 2016).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487536183, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487536183, "recommendationid": "30043910", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509517", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488831450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1825, "steamid": "76561198168462790", "num_games_owned": 109}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It is free, it is very fun, and it will always make you feel like a badass.\n\nJust download it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485847754, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485847754, "recommendationid": "29600207", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510104", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487396210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 332, "steamid": "76561198075922511", "num_games_owned": 57}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Awesome fun!! the mechanics are really fun and the game had me going for hours! would recommend it to people who want to reanct the favourite movie skirmishes.
