The combat as far as I could play was fairly simple. However it did seem that combat would become far more involved with higher tier units and larger total fighting forces.\n\nDifficulty, most of the difficulty for me came from the interface itself. In order to select or target a unit you have to click the actual unit model rather than the hex they are on. This is an important distinction. I also found difficulty in locating my units on each new level. Neither of these have put me off the game however. \n\nPlot, weird. Okay now to the actual review. I walk in thinking I'll be helping the Folvos army, then load up the tutorial and plot twist. Okay helping Vasgalan empire now. Read decsription another plot twist helping Folvos again. So if you like plots that aren't mandatory and will make you very confused pick this up.\n\nThere used to be a game destroying bug of doom however it appears to have been patched as part of the steam integration. Well done Lonely Troops. So even if the game may never get multiplayer it appears that at the very least bugs making it unplayable are going to be fixed.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1407635421, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1407802046, "recommendationid": "11622797", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567654", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1457042067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1508, "steamid": "76561198011960428", "num_games_owned": 3089}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 36, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Its Battle Isle 1.5 with better Graphics (aged well, nothing too fancy).

It's like taking an ancient Avalon Hill game like Afrika Corps or a *very* simplified version of Squad Leader and animating it with 1990's-era graphics. The game has the same deliberate pace and slow thought demands of one of those old games with the little cardboard chits. You can almost see little tufts of pixelated cardboard sticking out of the corners of the units.\n\nThe story is minimal and easily ignored. The setting is sci-fi, but the tactics are really not much more futuristic than with present-day technology. It's kind of a WWII tactical game disguised as a sci-fi TBS game, although the storyline, scenery, and color calls to mind Afghanistan or the current Syrian civil war.\n\nThe pace and deliberateness is its strength and its weakness. It's decently entertaining for nostalgic types like me who want to play something like an old wargame without needing to find a opponent or setting up a board. What would have been great is a feature that would allow you to speed up the housekeeping of each turn, instead of having to wait a few seconds for each unit to get into position.\n\nThis game will not blow you away nor keep you replaying it over and over again. Nothing more or less than a good two days' worth of fairly old-fashioned gaming for only a few dollars.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469811721, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1469812114, "recommendationid": "24599104", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480225741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1750, "steamid": "76561198021655015", "num_games_owned": 230}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "War on Folvos is a simple turn based hex-grid strategy with simple mechanics, though I still found it fairly satisfying. Each unit gets two action points per turn and you can use those to move or fire as you wish. With effective scouting, rotating your armour units and pumelling your enemy with artillery the invader campaign becomes very easy. The rebel campaign is a bit more challenging with its weaker units. New objectives given to you part way through a mission can catch you offguard.\n\nYou can right click on units to view their more detailed stats and descriptions, however I feel key information was missing there such as weapon range. Speed and range need to be learned the hard way.\n\nEach campaign's story complements the other and they fit together reasonably well. Overall the story is a bit back and forth across the map with somewhat poorly translated (or written?) conversations between the characters.\n\nNo skirmish mode, so after the two campaigns there's no replay value. For its low price it'll keep you entertained for a few hours on the cheap if this is your genre. On this basis I recommend it. Credits lists a very small indie team, so good going to them for a reasonably well polished release.\n\nThere's a bit of an early Dune vibe to it, and I half expected to retreat into the desert to tame sandworms.

It is your standard hexagonal turn-base strategy, that tries to port to a fiction future the  tactics of today (tanks, infantry, long range artillery, air units for both air combat and ground attack etc.). It is a panzer-general or a dune (the old one) clone of sorts. \n\nI detect no groundbreaking evolution whatsoever in this game. But it must be said that, although 'more of the same', that is not grounds for dismissing the game. The stats of the units and the maps in which the scenarios unfold are well balanced, the scenarios are challenging, there is an interesting story (once again, too much reminiscent of 'dune' but interesting nonetheless). \n\nSo though not revolutionary, it is a good hex-TBS game. Actually, if I have never seen PG or Dune I would have found this game excellent. It just isn't because of the formula being so overextended by now. Still, it satisfied me because I do like the genre and so I welcome new installments of the same game-type. It would have deserved a bad review if the game was flat-out bad, but the thing is it isn't. \n\nSo it's more like having a new, good expansion to something you already know and like.
