If ANYTHING changes, my review will change. EVERYTHING in my review will be consistent with my time played. \n\nPros:\n- Play in the setting of my favorite movie when I was a kid: Congo.\n- Has a horror feel to it with it's dark lighting and fog hiding the primates as they stalk you.\n- AI is mostly good, hit and run guerilla (hehe) tactics when the primates numbers are thin and the fog is thick, and overwhelming group charges when they are in large numbers.\n\nCons:\n- Overall the game is very clunky.\n- The characters controls poorly, and the controls themselves feel unresponsive at times.\n- Gun's aim system is clunky and leaves much to be desired.\n- Drop a fuel tank and watch it fly like a bird you just set free.\n- Melee combat is clunky and the melee strikes don't always work how they should, and sometimes don't make sense (strike with ape in face and nothing happens, strike with ape 2 meters away and it dies)\n- Players are greedy and don't communicate (play with no pistol takes all the pistol ammo and wont share, if you're knocked down and dropped your weapon your \"friends\" in your group will steal the weapon until they run out of ammo)\n- By far the worst part of the game is the performance. I play on a high end gaming PC and enjoy smooth plays of games like GTA V, The Division, Total War, Elite: Dangerous, Squad, Dying Light, Just Cause 3, and other graphics intensive games. This game gets the worst framerates of any game I have ever played since I built this PC in Sept 2015.\n\nFirst impressions are everything, and my first impressions are that this is an unfinished and unrefined early access money grab. Will my opinion change after spending more time ingame? I doubt it. It's not something that I just nit picked, I really wanted to like this game an dhave been waiting for the full release for a while now to finally play it. For the sake of all the hopes i had for it Im going to FORCE myself to play it further.

You keep hearing noises coming from the bush and the foliage is cracking everywhere you look around. All you have going for you is a torch in one hand and a machete in the other hand! \n\nCongo is an action/survival game where you can play by yourself, but it\u2019s primary aim to play on a co-op basis with up to 3 of your mates. You will be able to play in two type of mods; defence or objective. The defence mod currently has 8 different locations and the aim is to make sure you do not lose your radio transmitter and to stay alive as long as you can. For the objective mod, well I guess you can figure this one out. Whatever you prefer to play, you will have to explore the jungle to find additional weapons, gizmos and tools either in crates or on the ground. You will always start with your machete but crates will get you access to revolvers, machines and submachine guns, shotgun, carabines and of course a limited amount of ammunition. Just a little tip for you, make sure you collect as many knives as you can. You will be pinned down to the ground by one of these demons and the only way to kill them went they are on top of you is to use a knife. Gps, flares (which scare the demons), fuel can, cutters and revive syringes (you can\u2019t revive yourself, so this is only if you play as a party) are pretty much your gizmos and tools. \n\nThe A.I. is actually very good, demons (Congolese Apes) will sneak around, move away if you flash them with light or use a flare on the ground and attack you at a prominent time for them. The atmosphere is genuinely scary and I really like the fog of war type of setup where you only see clearly around your character(s) which amplify the fear aspect of the game. \n\nFrom the controls point of view and combat system, they are easy to use but I must admit that I would like to see an easy way to use items in the inventory. The graphics are good and polished.\n\nCongo is an early access game and show great potential, worth giving it a go!\n\nPositives: \n~~~~~~~\n  \n-\tScary atmosphere\n-\tGreat A.I.\n-\tPolished graphics\n-\tAchievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tItems in the inventory should be friendlier to use\n-\tNo trading cards\n\n7.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

The tension is immediate, the danger, even when yet manifested, instantly palpable. You barely see as far as where your modest torch - probably your best friend early in the game - will generously shed light on. Not of a lot of games offer a distinct advantage in wielding a gun over a 2-handed-firearm, as you can still hold the handmade 360-degrees beacon to spot foes (relatively) early on. And let me add that you start with just a big knife.\n\nThe enemy is intelligent, powerful, stealthy. Most of the time 1st contact starts with the sound of the enemy carefully brushing the vegetation, and still you have to rely on you best aurality to pinpoint exactly where the threat is approaching from. It knows how and when to attack, when to retreat for a renewed or flanked offensive, and it uses the element of surprise and teamwork to stalk and hit the invader - you, who is in the end of the day only trying to haul out of this sinister place of a jungle by night. \n\nCongo is a game about pure survival from a place where every second takes a toll on your nerves, and a place where rushing blindly and pseudo-merrily will put your stride to an abrupt and violent end.  A game still in development despite its \"as is\" robustness, but already showing great promise and a rather terrifying presence not often approached or executed as deftly. \n\nThe YES-Factor : sale or no sale, definitely worth going for.\nNO Gamesman Land : can be bad for cardiovasculars (seriously) . \n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432996042, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1432996042, "recommendationid": "16078324", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500777", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472878441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561198031897870", "num_games_owned": 136}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Needs:\nMultiplayer Support Improvements\nSingleplayer Stats or Saved Progress\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438127628, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1438127628, "recommendationid": "17274223", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502527", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458605176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 82, "steamid": "76561198004802115", "num_games_owned": 248}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I like this game.
