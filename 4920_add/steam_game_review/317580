The queue times for the ride it self are sometimes over five hours! With the physical attraction being so popular, it is hard not to imagine Disney wouldn't try and squeeze a little bit more out of it in a video game. \n\nIt is essentially a shooting gallery style game, based around the Toy Story franchise. It was actually initially released on the iOS first, before later being released on PC and then consoles. The game had it's biggest hit on the Wii since this also came packed with a peripheral device in the European markets to use to play. \n\nThe gameplay it self is very simple and family friendly, just aim with the mouse and click to fire. You can be throwing pies, darts, rings, balls and all sorts in the six different galleries.  Different targets grant more points, there are also a number of different tasks to complete on each stage such as knocking over a certain amount of one target or finding a secret entrance etc. These add a little variety to the stage rather than a simple shoot and aim mechanic. \n\nUnfortunately the graphics in Toy Story Mania really let it down. You cannot play in 1080P which nowadays is an absolute must, and there are minimal graphical options which can sometimes look like you are playing a extremely outdated game. It doesn't look like any work was done at all on the PC port of the game as it is so poor graphically. \n\nWhilst each stage offers a spinet of a story, there is no overlaying plot, I would look at this game as a casual pick up and play sort of game. Don't expect any new story from the Toy Story gang. \n\nAll of the original voice acts play their respective roles in Toy Story Mania, some of which I believe are just ripped straight out of the films, but I believe there are some original lines to be found. This is a huge bonus when you compare to Toy Story 3 on Steam, which don't have the full cast. \n\nEach of the gallerias are well designed and offer a lot of variety on each stage, I really liked how the whole screen can be full of targets to hit, but I still had trouble hitting them! There is so much to look at and you only have a small amount of time to do it in, you really feel a sense of urgency on each level. \n\nAnother negative point would be the game's length, I actually finished the whole game's single player mode in just over half an hour. Toy Story Mania really encourages you to replay levels to get better scores and to earn more tickets to unlock new characters and bonus stages, so if you really want to squeeze every little bit of content out, you can probably get about five hours to action here. \n\nThis game is no by no means difficult. It is clearly heavily aimed towards a younger audience, which is a shame since the majority of the Toy Story fans will have grown up with it and be in their mid twenties now. You can get to the harder stages by really aiming to get the very high scores on each stage though. \n\nApart from the horrible graphical options and no higher resolution support, I didn't have any other technical problems such as crashing or bugs. It's just a badly ported PC game. \n\nTo conclude, it's actually a bit of a difficult one for me - I really enjoyed playing Toy Story Mania, mainly because the ride at the theme park is my absolute favorite and I love the idea that I can boot this game up and feel like I am back at Disney World about to go onto the ride instead of waiting for five hours in the blistering sun. \n\nPeople who don't have that nostalgic feeling will probably find this game dull, and boring. So I am still going to give this a thumbs up review, but with a recommendation to only pick it up when on sale for about \u00a35 if you want to try it out. Fans of the ride will really want to jump on here and bask in nostalgia \n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n[b][u]2) Only recommended when on sale[/u][/b]\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amhf0N1AxbE\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I stopped playing after about 10minutes. The UI was sluggish and the graphics were so bad and pixelated. And there's even the lack of a two player mode (as far as my 10 minute experience goes).
