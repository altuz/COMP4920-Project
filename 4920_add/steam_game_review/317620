Rather than a 100% faithful adaption of the board game, they have modified it to take advantage of a computer doing all the heavy lifting.  6 sided dice are replaced with percentage system, giving you a clear indication of how likey you are to hit.\n\nYour terminator marines have RPG style stats allowing you to customise them though the campaign, which increases the pain when you loose them (in a good way).\n\nMost importantly you get the full range of weapons and Librarian abilities from the board game expansions.\n\nMy only complaint is the price, which is high for an older game, but very occationaly it comes on sale with all the DLC and that's when you should buy it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503864113, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503864113, "recommendationid": "34537858", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504539", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499928443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 66, "steamid": "76561198053907508", "num_games_owned": 83}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I had very high hopes for this game after seeing how much I enjoyed the Space Hulk game that game out a year prior, however I was vastly disappointed by this game on mulitple levels which I will now try to bulletpoint. There are many legitimate gripes here, so if you have an extremely up to date computer, skip the first paragraph below this one.\n\n\nThe first issue for me was the graphics.(a lot of people would say this is a bad thing to put in your review, but being that there is no information about this game on System Requirements Lab I figured I'd give you a heads up.) Compared to the prior Space Hulk game which I can run perfectly on above minimum settings in even the most extreme of situations, this game literally went from 1 to 1000 in terms of graphical demand(and they are not very well optimized, unlike Space Hulk one which had very high graphical quality but good optimization), and dropping the quality all the way down did nothing really to speed up the graphics. I was having *heavy* framerate drop when even as much as two Space Marine squads were on screen at the same time. This means that in the most extreme of situations where there would have been 20 plus genestealers on screen at once, the framerate would have been MISERABLE, I would have been struggling even to more my cursor around. It would have been so bad it would have just been down right miserable to play, like playing in slow motion. To me, THAT much framerate drop matters even in a turn based game.(Which this is.) So if your computer is anything short of being one of the most high end gaming rigs on the market, and you don't want to basically play in slow motion this game is not for you point blank.\n\nSecondly, the actual gameplay in and of itself was also bad, from what little of it I got to experience from the small-squaded missions before it became miserable. This game tried ambitious new ideas I had heard about such as an RPG system. It sounded good, and that aspect WAS good, however, the format is terrible. It is needlessly complex - there are confirmations on top of confirmations that make navigating the game alone a chore, 4 different options of 'fire your weapon'. By the time you get to the RPG elements and the options for advancing your space marines with items, these new features I was looking forward to were just overwhelming. Furthermore, the game features the addition of fog of war, which I like in games like Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, but do not work for Space Hulk. Space Hulk is about having a clear map of the location as if your squad had the blueprints right there with them, and it's about blips. Gone are the blips, you now need to spend AP points to activate and de-activate radar. It had some good ideas, an RPG element is a good idea, being able to add items to your squad and customize it(I'd love a Space Hulk game where you are given the option to create your own Space Marine chapter and use them in multiplayer) but this game felt like it gutted all of the simplistic, easy to learn glory that Space Hulk has always been to me. I mean, some people consider Space Hulk to be a complex concept to begin with. Ascension takes the complexity up about 10 notches.\n\nAnd finally, and this was the greatest dealbreaker of all for me,\n\n               ****************THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER.****************** \nI know I should have looked on the store page for the game, but I felt a little blindsided due to the fact that this game presents itself as a direct sequel to the 2013 Space Hulk it even uses some of the same sound effects, especially for the Space Marines, this can even be heard in Steam's trailer for this game. After playing a heaping helping of L4D1 you wouldn't expect L4D2 not to have multiplayer. But still, the misstep I suppose is my fault. But that doesn't change the fact that this game, unlike the 2013 game, does not have multiplayer.  This to me, is unacceptable. Because of this fact, I would not buy the game even if I had a higher end computer that could handle it better. It's complexities simply aren't worth learning for this installment. If you want a good Space Hulk game, get the 2013 version and save Steam the paperwork involved in refunding your game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500687324, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501387047, "recommendationid": "33710011", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482604", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501887626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 233, "steamid": "76561198049403901", "num_games_owned": 136}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The Incredible Hulk goes into space and floats around.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500021255, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500021255, "recommendationid": "33531334", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461474", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 283, "total_reviews": 391, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 108}}
