I like the polishing, I like the simple art that looks good even if simple.\nI like the randomness of the obstacles.\n\nHowever, there is only one gamemod. The one that never save your progress, you start always on level 1 making the game offer not lot of play time and lot of repeat. Its really hard, I think the level 1 could be level 3 and level 1 should be easier, this will let the players have some more play times and sense of progression.\n\nFor the price, there should be a way to start at the beginning of the levels you reached which will be like a noob mode with no competitive scoring.
