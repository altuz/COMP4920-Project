The levels consist of fairly short escort missions where you pave the way to be clear of obstacles for the AI princess. The puzzles are very fun and enjoyable but at times become very tedious and burdensome, and not because the puzzles themselves are difficult but due to the incompetent AI Princess that will always seem to walk herself into the absolute worst possible position. You will quickly grow to hate the princess you are trying to save as she walks right into the oncoming path of a block you have to push in order to complete a puzzle, this results in you crushing the princess and having to start over and over and over. \n\nThe game feels as if it has drawn inspiration from other games such as Ico and the \u201cMurphy sections\u201d of Rayman Legends. Another frustration of the game is there are no re-bindable keys\u2026which wouldn\u2019t be an issue if the default keys weren\u2019t so obscure, you are forced to us A and D to move left and right and then greater than and less than signs to jump and attack, to make matters worse you are constantly being forced to alternate from the keyboard to the mouse to use perhaps the game\u2019s most interesting and defining gameplay mechanic; your magic chalk powers, which allow you to complete puzzles by drawing chalk lines on the screen to create ropes and fuses that can be used to complete puzzles. \n\nEarly on in the game you are presented with another interesting gameplay mechanic; the ability to drink a potion and change from an undead demon to a living human prince for short periods of time, this adds a unique spin on how you handle the puzzles, as the prince it is easier to defeat enemies whoever you cannot jump even remotely as high as your undead counterpart, but as the prince you are able to carry the incompetent AI princess to safety during the many times she\u2019s about to get herself killed. \n\nThe game does make use of its chalk art style\u2026 but more so as a cop out for some of the fairly poor character (and slightly laggy) animations that occur. These slight graphical hiccups are by no means game breaking as this is not a precision platformer by any means; however a bit more polish could have avoided this minor complaint all together. Overall the game is enjoyable and if you are in the mood for a fairly decent puzzle platformer with interesting gameplay mechanics and decent pacing then this game is definitely worth picking up for the asking price of $5.99.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418419670, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1418419670, "recommendationid": "13334600", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467477", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498452543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 998, "steamid": "76561198010267364", "num_games_owned": 982}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Dokuro is a puzzle platformer released for the Vita and iOS, and is now on Steam. It's made by Game Arts, the people behind the Grandia and Lunar series. They're actually working on porting Grandia II to Steam right now, and if you like JRPGs I'd buy it when they finish, as I've heard it's very good. And if you like puzzle platformers you should get Dokuro, as it's a great game in that genre too.\n\nThe story is set in a non-descript fantasy kingdom, where the Dark Lord has just kidnapped the local Princess. With no hero around to stop him, it seems she's destined to a forced marriage - until the titular Dokuro, a lowly skeletal mook, decides she's a bit easier on the eyes than his current boss. He's sure to get more respect as a hero than his current position, right?\n\nWell, no. After releasing the Princess he's dismayed to find out not only is she not thanking him, she doesn't even notice he exists, literally. It's up to him and the player to change that by helping her get out of the castle, but it's a long way to the entrance.\n\nThe basic gameplay is that of an escort mission. Each level is one room of an area of the castle, such as the ballroom or kitchen, with a flower at the end. You need to get both Dokuro and the Princess to that flower alive, which isn't as easy as it sounds. Dokuro can jump over obstacles and defend himself, but she can't, and what's worse, her not noticing him means she'll gladly blunder into danger. Monsters will make her turn and run, but with hazards she can and will die. Thus most levels are based around making a safe path from point A to B for her to follow.\n\nDokuro has a few tricks to help with this, such as different kinds of chalk, befitting the game's graphical motif, that can create ropes to fix pulleys, light fires, or other effects. Early on he also gets a potion that lets him transform into a prince form, where he can pick up and carry the princess to get her away from danger or down ledges, as well as defeat monsters more easily. Almost all the levels feel well-designed, and while there are some hard ones it never gets to the point of being frustrating. Dokuro controls well, and it doesn't require pixel perfect movement.\n\nThe game looks quite nice, and the story, while simple, makes you care about since Dokuro is a believable underdog. It's also decently long: I think I'm only about halfway through it at the time of this review. If you were wary because of the Mixed review status, don't be: most of the negative ones aren't talking about the actual game, just that it lacks options that are unnecessary to enjoy it.
