You get a decent return on the 3,99\u20ac (20% sale) so not to much to complain about there.\n\nSince it is a Mobile port you have fairly limited controls for weapons and such. It is not a traditional tower defense as I have yet been able to place any towers or anything like that so far in the game. You mainly controll 4 weapons with the two mouse buttons, rifle, mortar, napalm, machine gun/flamethrower. It does what it is suppose to do from what I can tell but there are far better alternatives in the genre.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433067417, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433067417, "recommendationid": "16095096", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516430", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
