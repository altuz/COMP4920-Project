It's not possible to watch them twice without replaying the game. And since the levels are large and mostly uneventful and these scenes are few and far between it's simply annoying the way it is.\n\nAlso there is no sense of progression or any kind of reward for the player except for the finale of each stage. You really only keep playing to reach the music (at least I did). There are some nice touches in art design though. Some nice views are to be found, but just as much bland stuff that could have been drastically shortened to improve the overall experience. Added length is not always better if it feels like a drag. A game like Journey for reference, which was obviously an inspiration for this game but A LOT more fun to play, was very short but infinitely replayable due to it's pacing. Pacing is important in games like these, and the developers didn't get it right here.\n\nEspecially world 2 seems to drag on forever. It surprises you with 4(!!) long, mandatory escort missions after the point where I was already tired of the map. Escort missions have always been more misses than hits, even in other, better games. It's beyond my comprehension how this was considered to be a good idea at the time of planning. \nBut also chapters 3 and 4 are way too long for their own good, with more of the same stuff you'll become tired of halfway through world 2. Sure, they sometimes try to mix things up with a rail-sufring minigame similar to the modern Sonic games, but without the pace and sense of speed. You will want these stages to end long before they do, the journey is not the destination in this game. \n\nActually if the whole game was paced like the really great final stage, this would have been a hit.\nFinally gameplay and music go hand in hand almost right from the start in nicely mixed up sections which are actually fun when presented in this way. You'd wish the whole game was presented like this. Sure, it would have been a much shorter game, but way more entertaining in the long run. I'd rather play a 1-2 hour game filled with stuff like this, and always come back to it like to a good CD/movie, than traversing through these empty and out of scope landscapes that stand between me and the good parts. Especially not for a second time. It's unfortunate really, because it's an indication of where the real talent of this new developer lies. \n\nAlso for a game that heavily relies on sound and music, the environmental sound effects are somewhat underwhelming. Sometimes there are no sound effects at all. You miss the oomph when being hit by something. It doesn't happen often, but it bothered me anyway.\n\nYet, while the gamplay is not a winner even when working as intended, the game is still ridden with bugs and other issues. The sound might disappear randomly, it's possible to fall through some walls (Act 2), the camera is unfavorable in many situations (to put it mildly), jumping button may not register input now and then. A lot more can be added, but you get my point.\n\nSo, taking the actual game aside, let's get to the good part.\nAs mentioned before, the musical score is outstanding and a joy to listen to. \nEach chapter ends with a bang, a big scripted musical number, which gives you choices inbetween for how you want each scene to play out. There is no real consequence other than a different variation in the song, but it's nicely done anyway. Like I said, the game would have been so good if this was the main focus. Had the stages been cut in half and the musical scenes been doubled, this would be a metal fans dream come true.\n\nThe soundtrack is also included, and although some of my favorite parts from the choices I made are not there (apparently it must be the other choice), it's well worth a listen for fans of epic metal.\n\nLet me sum up my thoughts with simple pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n- Art design\n- All that has to do with music\n- Scripded cutscenes with choices inbetween\n\nCons:\n\n- Stages overstay their welcome by far (especially 2!!)\n- Not much to do, to collect, to actually play except jumping around and extracting/infusing karma\n- Boss \"battles\"\n- Musical cutscenes few and far between\n- Bugs, glitches, general lack of polish \n- WAY too long/artificially lengthened, badly paced\n\nSuggested improvements:\n\n- Either drastically shortened stages... \n- ...or maps filled with more to do, to collect, to discover, to reward players\n- More musical cutscenes with choices throughout the game\n- MANUAL SAVE OPTION! Let players use the Checkpoints as manual save spots at least!\n- Chapter select option, or separate autosave before each stage finale.\n- Movie mode with all musical scenes\n- More sound effects for environment\n\nI really would like to recommend this game to anyone who likes Metal, or simply a good, innovative game, but as it is, I can't do that whithout fooling anyone. I really appreciate what the developer tried to do, even with non sufficient funding at their disposal, but since this is 95% game and only 5% (or less) great stuff, and gameplay is what matters for most people, this game is only recommendable for the most patient and forgiving gamers out there. \nAnyone else is better off with one of the many other great games that are available these days.\nMaybe in the future after some seriously needed updates to enhance the flow of the game (*badum tss*) I'll reconsider, but for now I'll have to keep the thumbs down.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431041518, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431453175, "recommendationid": "15733401", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566660", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430976556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 310, "steamid": "76561198040087242", "num_games_owned": 230}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 26, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Karmaflow is a masterful blend of music, art, and gameplay. It's had a bit of a bumpy launch, but team Karmaflow rallied together and patched most of the issues by the end of Day 1. Very rarely have I seen a team work that fast at fixing bugs. This is even more impressive when you consider this is a new studio who crowdfunded the game on Indiegogo (they didn't reach their full goal) and are new to the game development world. \n\nSeeing all the complaints of bugs on Steam, I waited until the first wave of patches before playing the game. I am happy to report that I ran into ZERO game breaking bugs and I really enjoyed my time with the game (played with a controller). NOTE: There are still some minor bugs being worked on, but what game doesn't have those?\n\nThis game is all about the music. If you don't like symphonic metal then you're probably not going to like the game, but what did you expect out of a game calling itself a Rock Opera? If you do like the genre, then you are in for a real treat. The orchestral performances of some of Metal's most recognized icons (seriously, look at the cast for this game) was spot-on and combined with the game's unique visual style, created a deep atmosphere that really drew me in.\n\nWithout going into too many details, the story follows the Karma Keeper as it travels from world to world restoring balance after the mysterious \"Dissonance\" has wreaked havoc. It is presented, as you would expect, in rock opera fashion by having the characters sing/scream their parts to tell their tales. There are shards scattered around the worlds that present Karmaflow's backstory, and really solidify the atmosphere of the game. The addition of subtitles (see! They were listening to the community and added this in the first string of patches!) really helped me keep track of Karmaflow's story.\n\nWhile the designers are new, they did a fantastic job of using subtle visual cues to keep players on the right path. There are no direct hints to solving the puzzles, meaning if you get stuck, you will have to look around the environment and experiment with different approaches to find your way out. I love this approach because it keeps you in the game instead of constantly waiting for a hint.\n\nThe ambient sounds in the game could be better. Like when a boulder hits the ground, it would be nice to hear a solid crash instead of an odd crunching sound. I wasn't too fond of the thudding sound the Karma Keeper made when it landed after jumping, but that's just personal preference. There lots of little instances like these where I wished the ambient sounds were a bit better, but hey, this was a crowdfunded game from Indiegogo with a killer soundtrack and vocal cast, I'm not complaining too much.\n\nLastly, while I really enjoyed the puzzles within the game, there were no consequences for failing or dying. If the Karma Keeper dies in the game, you respawn close by and continue where you left off. There's no reset or anything. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does remove any sense of urgency or fear from the boss \"fights\"/\"puzzles\" (I'm honestly not sure what to call them). But again, this game is all about delivering a killer Rock Opera experience, and it does that with gusto.\n\nOverall, I would give Karmaflow a 4 out of 5 as I sit and wait for Act 2 to be released later this year!\n\nPros:\n- Soundtrack\n- Music\n- Epic musical solos (noticing a trend)\n- Solid puzzle mechanics\n- Atmosphere\n- Solid Rock Opera style story and presentation\n- Game includes soundtrack (To be released with Act 2 later this year)\n\nCons:\n- Ambient sounds could be improved\n- No consequences for failing\n- Act 1 is very short (roughly 3 - 3.5 hours)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421886894, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421897615, "recommendationid": "14104711", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520636", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1428692061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 137, "steamid": "76561197970886388", "num_games_owned": 1343}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Better than i expected.

All you will read below has been gathered from the Karmaflow website, Facebook, Twitter, contact with the developer, bugtesting sessions and the game itself.  \n\nI am quite puzzled to see some people denounce this game in the way they do. Let's be real here: Basecamp Games is a studio that started out as a student graduation project, they are new to all this. Anyone expecting a fledgling studio selling a 15 euro game to deliver a flawless experience should get their heads out of their pretentious asses. \n\nHad the game cost 4 times the amount, or if the developer created a plethora of games before this, then I might have reconsidered as well. It surprises me how dedicated Basecamp is as a studio, as they have patched some major problems out already and are (probably) doing so as we speak.  \n\nNow then, onto the game. What is Karmaflow? \n\nIn short, Karmaflow is a 3d platformer that let's you play as the Karmakeeper, a little guy who travels across the lands to try and fix an imbalance that is tearing these lands apart. There's more to it but I don't want to spoil anything for you.  Much of the narrative is brought to you in song and acted out in cutscenes. The gameplay itself is fairly straightforward, and should not be too challenging for too many. \n\nThis game stands on it's graphical style and stellar music. It's not hard to find a list of all the talented musicians that helped to compose this beautiful soundtrack, and it can be seen that the creative director is in fact a composer. During the game itself, you can find instruments that will add their sounds to the ambiant music, enahncing your experience. \n\nNow, I do have some smallgripes with this game. The camera can be a bit weird at times, which is detrimental to your jumping & gliding abilities. The camera moves when it wishes to show you something, but it can really mess up your jumps or your sense of direction. I did not yet encounter a problem with checkpoints, but I see others have. Karmaflow runs fine on my average PC, but it stutters for a slight second every time you reach a checkpoint (as a statue of you is suddenly spawned from various shards) this game also does not tell you where to go at every point, so make sure to get your bearings when you can. I tend to get lost at times, poor me. \n\nIf you see other reviews stating there are no subtitles and the music goes out of sync if you pause during cutscenes, that has all been taken care of. Basecamp is a developer that evidently listens and strives to give you the best. \n\nThe game is rather short at this time of writing, but anyone who purchases Act 1 will receive Act 2 later free of charge as an update to the game.  \n\nBottom line: \n\nBuy This --> If you like games that are more about the experience and easthetic than actual gameplay, and you like the style (both music and on-screen) \n\nDon't buy this --> If you only want gameplay, or a game that just tells you what to do at every turn, and you get easily annoyed if some things work less than perfect sometimes. If you have a MAC, wait until you are sure it works (watch the updates)\n\nI am enjoying this experience very much, I hope you will too!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421848694, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421848694, "recommendationid": "14096938", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509067", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423295487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 86, "steamid": "76561198043624070", "num_games_owned": 928}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 41, "comment_count": 0, "review": "EDIT: The game is being fixed very quickly!

The visual concept is also very creative, but of course a matter of taste too. The problem is the annoying gameplay inbetween... \n\nI have nothing against plattformers and puzzle games, but this one is just too simple and boring.

The story is interesting because every Act ends with a dilemma that you as the Karmakeeper has to solve (Choose really).

It honestly is. This game is simple in exeecution, but amazing in implementation. I have only minor gripes in the time spent so far.\n\nYou, as the keeper. Are the decider on a tale. As best I can describe it, you have a choice to make in the world. Is it right, is it wrong? Funny enough, I can't say. Each of my choices so far has been tough. This game manages to make neither the best, neither the worst. And it has no issues gutpunching you to make them. This strives to be a rock opera, so far, i fully believe it has.\n\nI'll admit, this game isnt for everyone. It won't be. It is a music lovers dream though. Watch the video's, see if the voices and people are those who you like. If so, give it a go. I truly think you wont be disappointed. I haven't been yet. \n\nMechanically, and sadly I do have to touch base on this. Mechanically, the game has a few minor flaws. Most issues are minor, but can be an issue. At a few places, i managed to get stuck, not out of design, but my own cleverness. One of the resources you make do with, its possible to get too much of in places, and have to do some re-negotiation to divest yourself of it. It can be tricky to do so. A few minor issues getting stuck in places, but minor gripes to that. Those are the only complaints mechanically on this game. \n\nI do however recomend a controller to play this game over keyboard. It flows so much better.\n\nTo praise some of the mechanics. This game gets the jumps right that so many bigger games fail on.

There's issues with the controls not being responsive enough for a platformer, the environments are a little confusing to navigate in this first episode. There's no major faults with the game outside of it not having incredible gameplay design and execution. But then I don't entirely expect it either. It's very difficult to get that in a 3D game from an indie studio.\n\nAs for the music side of things - I wasn't blown away, but thought it was a very fun way to conduct the game narrative. Subtitles are something sorely missing, however - And with growled vocals some players would have difficulty understanding the plot - And this is assuming they can hear the vocals clearly through the sound levels.\n\nI'm yet to see music form an integral part of the gameplay itself, which is something I was really hoping for. While it's still possible that the game could get better in the future, the gameplay and musical elements are two very disparate parts.\n\nIn all - I want to recommend this game sorely for the lovely idea, the pretty settings, and for it being interesting. As I say, I can't recommend you play it as a game - It's more a curiosity.

As a Metal fan I decided why the hell not and bought the game without any kind of hesitation since I saw Marc Hudson (DragonForce) Epica, COF, etc. Power Metal always had a tiny bit of cringe on it, then the game took it the whole way down CringeTown. Whose fault is it? I'd say only for the poor dialogue sketch and maybe a bit for the character design. Regardless everything else, I saw something i havent seen in a long time, and thats the beauty and the art of a single player. Unique Ideas, unique character creation and mostly the scenery. PEOPLE! We are changing from a dark area to a beautiful palace in the sky! We are metal lovers! We think first of the pit of hell and then the glorious palaces of Vallhala!
