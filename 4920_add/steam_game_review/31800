I came into this one off the heels of playing The Phantom of Venice, thinking I'd keep with the European theme. This one was more annoying with the language than that one, lots of french to translate. I agree with the other reviewer who said that the story was weak--you are sent to check up on this designer who is acting funny. ....Okay? \n\nThere are SO MANY loose ends by the time you finish this game. I am still wondering why this person did this or had that or said that.... It's like they tried to add in red herrings but failed miserably because it just ended up as a unexplained attempt at a plot twist. \n\nThe things that annoyed me about this game were that number one: you as Nancy are NOTHING but a glorified errand girl and gofer. You have to one thing to get something that another person needs so you can talk to someone else. #2, there is a ridiculous amount of reading. You are supposed to buy books (with money you have to earn) to learn how to do a bunch of different things, including fighting the bad guy in the end. \n\nMost of the puzzles are very easy, with a couple that are just ridiculous to solve, they give you no books for those (eye roll) \n\nThe only redeeming factor was that I was genuinely surprised at who did it. Totally had the wrong person pegged for this one. \n\nAs someone who grew up on these games, this one missed the mark for me. I have a feeling to go back and play Secret of the Scarlet Hand or Treasure in the Royal Tower for some good old fashioned detective work, none of this errand girl stuff."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1488877536, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30369304", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198193731326", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1503047540, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1261}, "timestamp_updated": 1488877536, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This HAS to be one of my favourite Nancy Drew games by far! \n\nThe characters and the places in this game gave me a very nostalgic feel for some reason haha. \n\nThat aside, the characters didn't have much of an impact on me, I felt that they weren't unique enough (besides Minette and JJ Ling).

Nancy Drew has an internship with Paris' most famous designer, Minette, who has been recieving death threats for some time.
