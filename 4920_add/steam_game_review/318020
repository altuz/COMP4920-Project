It is not. There are many things wrong with this game.\n\nAlthough it is graphically detailed, there is very little contextual detail (You will find yourself asking, \"What is that? What does it do? Isn't that an ally? Where is the enemy? Why am I blocked by an indestructible force here?).\n\nThere are very few supplies, so it is easy to run out; and if you run out, you just have to wait for your destruction. (The currency system is not at all like Generals, I'l explain that next).\n\nThe currency system, instead of being a single stream type (dollars or whatnot), it is broken up into many different types of supplies (metals, fuel, special items, etc), which makes it almost impossible to gather enough of everything required to make a feasible fighting force. Also, yes, I did mention fuel.

I'm going to give you the frigging run down of this gam, and I know my low hour count has something of a disallure but that's for another time! Act of Aggression is now! \n\nWhat were my first impression of this game? Terrible, but then again I was playing the reboot edition which might as well be this previously beautiful soaked in animal piss and feces. Numnuts at Ubi and Eug, this isn't how you make a reboot! You're just runing the tatical plays of the original, and this review will soley focus on that game! \n\nFirst off, yes, I play as the USA. Why? Because TEAM AMERICA that's why!\n\nAnyway, the graphics of the reboot suck, but the orginal game actually is a bit more better and has more of a feel too it. You can actually tell that your soliders are running! RUNNING not in place, but running! \n\nI can soldily give graphics a 7/10 for the original, but for the reboot i give it one dirty latrine (3) out ten! \n\nMusic is okay, I mean it's nothing special, and since it's the same soundtrack for both games I can't say it's not too different. However, when playing as The Cartel I discovered the soundtrack fits them great since you're mainly stealthing most of the game, and by the way...NAPALM! (6/10)\n\nGameplay for the orginal is a solid copy off of C&C and if you haven't played command and conquer...the hell you've been? There is dozens of those games, you've got Red Alert, the normal orginals, Tiberium wars (GDI!) and then you had the fourth game which was basically you fighting the Nod for Earth (and that's the redheaded step child of this little family.) \n\nAnyway, but it takes it a step further when it comes to tatical gameplay. You see let's just the reboot sucks and move on (4/10)  but the orginal is so much better and is actually deserving of praise. Think about this, I can build multiple superweapons in both games, but the normal  SWs don't usually rely on cashflow so...guess what boys and girls...if you want that nuke go find and guard that red desposit. \n\nthen do like I do, build four silos, put two to a silo, and light up a cigar and just carpet bomb(nuke) an area. Easy win, easy  death, and my god I love the smell of nukes in the morning (coming to a Country near you in 2018...brought to you by THE TRUMP and KIM JUNG UN adminastration!) \n\nFRIGGIN 8/10 I would carpet bomb The Cartel again! \n\nUnit avaliability is tricky, since both games have the same units, but I think the original makes it more of an experience rather than just buying them with cash. You want soliders, spend money, you want that damn heli? you better have the aluminum on the fleek (gah stupid word...) \n\nplus every faction does have unique units, so, you're basically getting a unique exprience out of each one. USA, USA, USA!!!! \n\n8/10 again...for the original. \n6/10 for the reboot. \n\nGiven these numbers (and before I forget to mention no...don't replay the reboot of this...just play the orignal which comes with it.) \n\nI can soldily give THE ORIGINAL GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a great 7/10 (which is above average and lives up to the hype a little whle still having shortcomings...don't worry...C&C did too.) \n\nTHE REBOOT!!!! THE DUMBING DOWN PIECE OF **** is...a...10/1....hahaha....no...just kidding. It's 4/10 a below average game. \n\nGood night, and good day, and AMERIcA WILL LEAD THE WAY!\n\n(I recommended it simply because the orignal version is great enough to play alone...and I want you to get it on sale...full price for it is okay...but sale would've been better.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506256572, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506256572, "recommendationid": "35179684", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502688", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505637172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1524, "steamid": "76561197961086101", "num_games_owned": 208}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "one of the best RTS games. very under-rated. perhaps it lacks speed of gameplay to be more popular with the crazy majority of RTS players.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505178091, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505190013, "recommendationid": "34892960", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498979", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466443610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 388, "steamid": "76561198202160394", "num_games_owned": 91}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is not very well optimized or polished, it reuses alot of assets from other Eugen games and takes most of its gameplay elements from other, more interesting RTS's.

It's just a mess. Menus lag and stutter randomly, it's unstable as all hell and crashes at the slightest provocation, and even the installation process is buggered. \n\nBut who cares right? We're all RTS players here. We only care about gameplay. \n\nAnd the gameplay is ok. The bases take up most of your screen around midgame, farming resources is simple as can be, moving troops is kinda a pain because they handle and move like garbage, but fights have a lot of weight to them. \n\nTheres depth (some) where you can capture enemy soliders, and your tanks and vehicles will take damage from running over things like cars, oil tanks, etc. Pathfinding is nice, since vehicles will use roads naturally - and infantry are fast enough to not be vehicle fast but still respectably speedy. Upgrades feel meaningful.\n\nIts just not good though. \n\nThe design may be pretty, the look and feel is ok, but the play is garbage. You'll spend 20 minutes building up a reasonable fighting force, only to have most of it die in a 2 second skirmish. Units die incredibly fast, since every weapon hits hard and most heavily armored tanks can only take 4 hits tops. Aircraft zip in and out of the battlefield, so you can't really rely on them to be a sustained prescence. They also die and kill fast too, so aircraft battles are underwhelming. \n\nMovement around the map is terrible as well. The maps all feel just too small, but at the same time getting troops anywhere in something resembling a formation is a pain. And it just runs HORRIBLY. I'm talking missing mouse clicks every 2 seconds. I'm talking frequent unexplainable crashes. Things of that nature. \n\nIts just not good. And it runs like absolute rubbish.
