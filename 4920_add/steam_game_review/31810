I played most of the original ones as a child and then played some mid series to more recent ones a few years ago. It feels like a solid entry into the series. I usually perfer my ND games a little darker than this or to solve an actual crime, but the puzzles, pacing, and characters were great so I forgive it. Plus, the lighter material made it a safe choice to play in the evening after dinner. For a ND game it's pretty straight-forward making it a nice little treasure hunt. I also thought the voice acting in this one was good and liked how the characters seemed to interact and have relationships off-screen. \n\nDanger by Design seems like a fair game to compare it to since they were released about a year apart. The two games share the same great mechanics and features that make gameplay easy, without the idk cheesiness (I guess that's the right word) I found it Danger by Design. There's also no annoying currency system or errand running in this one making it clearly the better choice. \n\nAs I recall some of the earliest games in the series could get you stuck if you did not do certain events in order. Thankfully this is not the case here. At one point I honestly thought I was stuck, but the game took pity on me I guess and I was able to continue on. I would love to elaborate more on this, but I currently don't know how to make spoiler tags or if it's possible.\n\nTLDR: Most of my lack of enthusiasm for this game comes from my own personal preferences. It's more light hearted than other entries so it does not have the same creepiness factor of others. However, the game play itself is solid. If you're looking for a good treasure hunting adventure filled with good puzzles, you'll probably like this. \n"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1476664659, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493311", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "26080080", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198143215783", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1476663744, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 9}, "timestamp_updated": 1476664832, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have looked EVERYWHERE for a way to make this game run on WINDOWS 10.

For starters the game is too short with too few locations to explore.  There isn\u2019t even a direct Blue Moon Canyon area of the game either.  It took me only about 4 hours to beat it, (with minor help with a guide on occasional puzzles I admit). For most of the game you are just stuck on a train moving through narrow corridors without really being able to enjoy the highlights of riding a train, such as looking out the windows at the surroundings, being in the main engine room, maybe even driving the train, blowing the whistle, etc.  Not to mention there is always an annoying cut scene when changing cars that can\u2019t be skipped, which for stepping out on the outside of the train and viewing the surroundings you see remarkably nothing!  You never even see the train from the outside!  Unless you count a bad drawing of the town map.  Does the train look the way it does in game as it does on the cover, I don\u2019t know, do you?  Besides the train, there are only two other small locations on a map that you visit, with neither being very big or interesting.  \n\nThe story is also rather stale with yet another mysterious buried treasure with a random ghost thrown in that you never see or hear about again after seeing ONCE.  You spend most of the game repairing a weird device that just shines a beam at the point of the treasure, and in doing so you use priceless gemstones that end up probably being worth more than the \u201ctreasure\u201d at the end (spoiler: huge letdown).  Another let down in game is that there are too many pointless dates and irrelevant names of deceased people thrown at you, providing you with all kinds of confusing information that for the most part you don\u2019t even need.  Also, things in this game just don\u2019t feel at all consistent and are often random regarding events or objective.  Even at the end you still don\u2019t entirely know what happened to the original owner prior to death, his wife, or his engineer as it isn\u2019t really explained.  \n\n  As for the gameplay, most of the puzzles are challenging, but possible and often rewarding so long as you take time and think things through, (and consult a guide when you can\u2019t).  Most of the art is impressive enough, and the character animations are remarkably better than in the earlier games.  The music is original and has a theme I can only describe as adventurous.  Sounds are good and I didn\u2019t encounter any technical issues throughout the game.  So for the base of the game itself, it was pretty solid.  That is before encountering the biggest problem with the game in my opinion, which is that most of the characters are unintentionally incredibly annoying, with most of them offering little to nothing in the story.  In all of the Nancy Drew games you always do essentially all the work with some help or guidance being offered from the other characters, however, in this game they just drone on and on about pointless, irrelevant information which you are forced to listen to in order to progress through the game.  \n\nThe only real enjoyable characters were the Hardy Boys, with everyone else being too annoying, rude, pretentious, or just plain out of place.  Frank and Joe Hardy being included in this game was a neat and reasonable cross-over situation, which was certainly nostalgic for those of us that have grown up reading the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and even the Boxcar Children mystery books.  However, I feel that the Hardy Boys were not used nearly as much as they should have been or were used in the right way.  For example, one of the brothers (your choice) gets stuck as a burger cook job for the sole purpose of ease dropping on a conversation about the treasure.  At this part, your just making sandwiches while yet again listening to pointless characters rattle on about useless information.  The Hardy Boys do offer some information and real help unlike the other characters, but that\u2019s about it.  You don\u2019t travel together in a trio or really do anything together except for talking at a table. \n\nIn conclusion, I honestly understand what the developers were going for here, and it hurts me so much because this had the makings to be such a good game.  Picture a mystery adventure to find out what caused the mysterious deaths of the company on a train over a century ago as you venture through the Midwest on an exciting 18th century adventure on that same train!  Hop on board a real 18th century locomotive and explore a part of the country foreign to so many on the ride of a life time to search for a lost diamond mine!  Uncover ancient areas of great conflict between Westerners and Native Americans.  Explore ancient settlements and once great gold boom towns gone to ruin.  Gather Clues from non-annoying characters while journeying through hidden mines for the ultimate treasure!\n\nThis\u2026is not what you get in this game at all.  \n\nSo unless you\u2019re a diehard Nancy Drew fan, or mystery fanatic, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this particular game.\n\nThanks for reading"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502691659, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34229690", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198313496151", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1502265074, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 421}, "timestamp_updated": 1502691659, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is an awesome Nancy Drew game and one of the easiest too!
