It's really a lot of fun to find out every single reference!\nAs someone said, this little pearl can often be neglected or ignored, being it an indie JRPG and we all of course have played hundreds of JRPGs from the 8/16-bit era until nowadays, but this game has way more depth than one may expect. It's really great on any field: nothing is left to chance, everything is studied and has its own right place in the game's own world.\nIt's something that has been worked on for much time, and it's so enjoyable even for someone like me who has started playing JRPGs with imported cartridges for the SNES back in the '90s..\nGet this game, at any cost!! :P", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505324479, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505325724, "recommendationid": "34924022", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521918", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 628, "total_reviews": 644, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_negative": 16}}
