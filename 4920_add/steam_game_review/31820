Since there was a piece of it stolen it start's to run on it's own will - or so it seems. \n\nAgain the game uses the standard routines of interviewing people, talking with friends and try to solve riddles in the amusement park. All to soon it comes clear that all of the people you can interview might have a motive. \n\nTechnically this game is a point and click adventure, the game is aimed for younger female audiences, but again it's playable for all who like adventure and puzzle games. This series is famous for the sometimes creepy stories that are involved. Oh... have I told you that you can have serious accidents during the adventure? No... well... Now you know! Have fun bashing in your head. Don't worry since there is a cute replay option, something we urgently need in real life.\n\nI can recomend this game without further thought, it's nicely rendered, has a good story and some nice puzzles."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1394600156, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509154", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9435764", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198051074097", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1353052800, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 152}, "timestamp_updated": 1394600156, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is one of the more simplistic Nancy Drew games as it is only set in one location, however I enjoyed the puzzles and still a good game."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1403282603, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10572044", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076162355", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1395282910, "num_games_owned": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 239}, "timestamp_updated": 1403282603, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This was an interesting game and I learned new things about carousels, but because it is an older game it was a very fast playthrough.
