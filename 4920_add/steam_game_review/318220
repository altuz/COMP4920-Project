Install LCPDFR. This game is not worth it, I bought it when it was in active development (if you can call it that) and the concept was great. The UI sucked, the game was really clunky but hey, it was in Alpha... right? HA NO. This piece of shit runs like crap and is missing so much, I can't believe I paid more than $5 for it. The AI is terrible, the game itself is extremely basic and now they've dropped a Kickstarter for a new game promising to finish it if we help fund them to 10,000 euro. I don't think so\n\nSave your money and go buy a decent game like Swat 4 or GTA 5 to install LCPDFR.
