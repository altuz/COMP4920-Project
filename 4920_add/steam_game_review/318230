However, the negatives outweigh the positives so much it's just not fun.\n\nIn FTL you have a long period of build-up to get your ship in tip-top shape to face the final enemy which means beating through multiple enemies and fun chance exercises that can leave you with something great or take away something you'll surely miss. In Convoy the difficulty between encounters can swing from easy to super difficult that it leaves you in frustration. For example, I went through with a mission by doing what they wanted and it lead me on a questline through enemy territory to steal something. I ended up dying eventually (which you will many times) and doing that same quest but I instead stole a list thinking I would forgo a lot of hassle. Well, I did but met my doom much faster as the enemy here were far, far more advanced. I had no way of telling ahead of time. It's just the way the game is. Start again. In another instance I ran into some enemy and fought them--super easy. Just down the road I ran into a group of enemy and they tore apart my convoy like they were paper. Only my main vehicle was left and it can't fight so I could only watch as they beat it to nothing.\n\nThe chance exercises just aren't fun either. Most of the time it seems you lose rather than win. I'd rather avoid them and focus on the main mission rather than take a chance to find something better, but that makes your convoy weak to attacks so you have to take a chance. Don't do them and take more damage because you're under leveled, do them and possibly take damage or lose a vehicle or sometimes get something good. It's a lot of negative against you and little reward.\n\nOverall, this game is good if you want to and have the time to blow and don't care to get frustrated. It fills a void. Unless it gets some sort of progression like FTL it's definitely not worth $15. The short playtimes I get are probably only worth 1/3 of that. I'll keep playing it in short spurts to see if I have been missing much, but I don't expect much more from this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505803028, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505803028, "recommendationid": "35059110", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509694", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 410, "total_reviews": 514, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 104}}
