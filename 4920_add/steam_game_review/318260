Make a game where you start doing the busy work and work your way up where you are managing employees and then regions, etc.  The problem is this game fails at almost every level.  \n\n* Pizza making: almost no feedback telling you what you're doing right or wrong.\n* Delivery mini-game: Horrible controls, frustating \"physics\".\n* Managing employees: boring.\n* Managing stores:  Supposedly there is competion, but from what I can tell they don't actually do anything.\n* Events: Occasionally there are events that happen, but they have little more impact on the game than Monoply Chance cards.\n\nIn the later game, you're mostly sitting around sending employees on vacation, wating for more money to buy another store.  There's just a lack of anything to do in the game other than make rude shapes using the pepperonis.\n\n---------------------------------\n--- Re tried the game 2015-01-16 after the new patch\n\nHere's what's improved: \n* Pizza making: Customers' tolerence for what constitutes \"lots of\" or \"a little\" ingredient is much relaxed so you don't have to experiment by counting ingredients anymore.\n* Pizza prepartion: There is now an extra step in making a pizza which involves timing the cooking phase.  This adds to the challenge when multitasking.\n* New inventory system:  Having a new system to play with is good and adds some depth to the game.\n\nHere's what's not improved: \n* Delivery mini-game: The driving still my least liked part of the game.   I think the biggest problem is when driving fast, it doesn't feel fast, so when you hit a curb at 50mph it seems like the car unnecessarily launches into the air.  Also, I didn't mention this before, but the sound the car makes is unpleasant to the point I turn off the sound, especially so when one of the wheels is off the ground.\n* Customer Feedback:  Customers are still strangely vague about what they didn't like about a pizza.  Saying that a pizza didn't have enough toppings on a pizza with 5 ingredients doesn't help much identifying how to make a better pizza.  It would be better if the customer could comment on the ingredient that was most wrong (e.g.  \"There wasn't enough cheese.\")\n* Allow Employee boxes:  This new feature seems to be there to encourage players to fill orders themselves and/or get to the part of the game with store managers.  Either way, having to click a box every time I want an employee to interact with an order gets old quickly.  If I ran a real pizza shop and had to tell the employees to work on every individual order, I'd go insane.  I think this could be made better by allowing the player to promote a manager on acquisition of the second store rather than the third.\n* Cooking an order: There's a new icon that appears on the left part of the screen when an order is being cooked.  But the icon isn't associated with the the order screen, so if you have two orders cooking, it's guess work to determine which order to click \"Perform\" on to stop cooking it.  Having the cooking graphic on the order line itself would fix this confusion.\n* Costs: With the addition of ingredient purchasing, money management becomes much more important, however there is almost no control of costs or prices.  As far as I can tell, the only direct control of my money I have is what I pay employees and optional purchases (advertising, events, etc).  Ingredients, once upgraded into them, must always be stocked; so you can easily get into an unrecoverable state where the cost of ingredients out-paces your income.  It would be nice to be able to turn off the ingredient upgrades.  Also it would be nice to have a daily summary of costs and income, e.g. Sales, Tips, Wages, Ingredients, Store costs, penalties, advertizing, etc.\n* Advertising:  I have no idea what affect this has on the game or how to decide what the sliders do.\n* Managing employees:  No changes with employees.  Paying them and sending them on vacation is about all you do here.  Employees are basically duplicated drones differentiated only by job and a rating of skill.  Training seems pointless when a beginner can become a master in the matter of minutes naturally.  There's no strategy needed when dealing with them, so it just feels like a chore.\n* Later game:  There still doesn't seem like much here, just more of the same.  Have I just not played enough, is there a new mechanic after getting into new regions?\n\nI'd say, overall the updates to the game are in the right direction, but I still cannot recommend the game.

I wasn't that impressed with the rest of the game either, upgrading ingredients and delivering pizzas which I was looking forward to, got old quick.

It seems like no matter what you do, you always put on too few toppings. There doesnt' seem to be any indicators of how much is \"a lot\" of pepperoni or \"a little\" either, so no matter how much or how little I put on, the customer feedback was the same, -- \"Did you even bother to put on any toppings?\" Very frustrating.\n\nThen you have to deliever the pizzas yourself, at least at the beginning, which is harder than it should be. There's an AI arrow telling you where the house is, but it doesn't actually tell you where to go. It tells you \"as the crow flies\" where the house is, which may or may not be where an actual road is. This results in a lot of missed deliveries because you flip your car over or crash into a house because you turned where it was indicating but it ended up being a dead-end. In this modern world of GPS, you'd think they coud've put something a little more accurate like that in the game (maybe it's an upgrade later in the game, who knows...)\n\nEventually you do earn enough upgrades to hire employees, which significantly improves your customer feedback (since the computer is now making the pizzas and delivering them for you). Still this quickly becomes a very tedius repetitve thing where all you're doing is clicking on \"Yes, employee, please make this pizza for me....\" \"Yes, employee, please deliver this pizza for me...\"\n\nI feel like this game wasn't sure what it was trying to be. This either needs to be a more functioning simulation that gives you feedback on how to improve your pizza making skills or it needs to be a more automated tycoon-style game that you don't have to remind your employees every single time to start the pizza, deliver the pizza, etc. \n\nI played this for about 2 hours.

This one really falls short. I'm actually surprised to learn that this isn't an early access game.\n - UI needs a lot of polishing. There's literally a part of the interface where if you have nothing selected, a screen just reads \"NO.\"\n - Parts of the game occasionally freeze/lock up. There's about a 50% chance that when I see one of the \"clean up for the health inspector\" minigames that it'll freeze in some way or not count down the game tmer.\n - The parts of the game that should be fun, like making orders, are more tedious than anything and it's very difficult to measure if you're improving on your pizza making skills at all or if it's just a total crapshoot on whether or not you get a perfect order. It just generally results in you having characters perform all tasks for you and you just click/drag icons to people's faces.\n - It just feels very clunky and unfinished. Hard to describe, but it has that very general \"this game is not done\" feeling.\n - Delivery part is the most fun, but the navigation is weird, the map doesn't show your destination, and as you buy car upgrades the cars seem to actually get worse in terms of handling and helping with perfect orders. Who would've thought that hitting the breaks on your car would flip it frontwards, implying that the pure stopping force of your breaks is stronger than the pull of the earth's gravity on your car/it's weight. aka upgrading your car turns it into tissue paper.\n - It's too easy.

You can read the full review below.\n\n[h1]Review Result or TL;DR[/h1]\nI can recommend this game. It makes quite fun for short-game sessions.\nThe developers did improve some weak points during last updates.\n \n[b]Strong Points:[/b]\n + Concept Idea is nice (You get order, you craft the food, you deliver them).\n + Different Food with different Toppings.\n + Random Events (Mafia, Flashmob, Poisoned Food) where you need to take a decision with good/bad impact on you.\n + Feedback what you did good/bad during creation of food.\n + Improved Driving-Expierience during Delivery-Mini-Game.\n \n[b]Weak Points:[/b]\n - Currently none (as not parts of the game where re-played).\n\n[h1]Supreme - Updated Review (14th June)[/h1]\n[b]1.) Tutorial[/b]\nThe tutorial is still clear written and easy to understand.\nA strong improvement in new version is to give advises at the end of \"Food-Creation\"-Process, regarding the topic ammount and likes of the customers.\nThis makes it more easier to build a \"perfect\" pizza.\n\n[b]2.) Technical: Graphics[/b]\nIn my last review I concerned, that there is no life in the delivery-city and no day/night-cycle.\nI was surprised during my last game session. The city looks very nice! The textures got updated, the city environment got improved. Day/Night-Cycle implemented.\n\n[b]2.) Technical: Sound[/b]\nNo change since my last review.\n\n[b]3.) Technical: Controls[/b]\nThe controls during the delivery got improved.\n\n[b]4.) Lets Play: Working in Shop[/b]\nSince the last updates, this point got improved. The orders comes now via phone, computer or smart-tv. You will get feedback during the food-creation process what you did good and what not (in regards to the topics on pizza/sub/..). This makes it more easier to understand what means \"little\" and what means \"a lot\". Anyway, it needs some experience to do it perfect, but the game now supports you a little bit.\n\nYou have now a short period of time to do the job by yourself or assign it to one of your employees. The employees have an energy bar. You need to send them for a break, otherwise they will burn-out and quit ther job. In case of some employee quits / or get fired, you will automatically get another one. During my 1h session, I did not find any possibility to upgrade the single employees. Maybe it is implemented and I did not found the corresponding menu.\nAnyway, as this is unconfirmed and will not be have any impact on the review-result.\nCurrently, I cant give any feedback for the multi-store-feature (Tycoon Mode?) as I did not reach the possibility to do this.\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to buy new ingredients stock. Otherwise the customers will call you to get disappointed because their favorite food is out of stock.\n\n[b]5.) Lets Play: Deliver the Food[/b]\nStrong improvements on this part of game.\nControlling the car is more precise and easier. The borders got removed, so you can drive across the walkway without your car get flipped (btw it is still possible to flip it - but another way). If your car flips, you can reset it and will get put onto your wheels again instead of the delivery failed.\nYou still not need to consider the road traffic act, but as the time seems to be shorter than previous, and the car dont flip on walkways, this makes more fun!\n\nAfter delivery, you will get a good overview of the delivery-stats and the store reputation will increase/decrease.\n\n[b]6.) Lets Play: Upgrade your shop[/b]\nUnlocking ingrediences, sides and cars is remain unchanged.\nThe store-tier upgrade seems to be offered automatically during the game (after some days).\nThe update makes it possible to hire employees (during my game-session only cooks/drivers).\nIt is now possible to get multiple orders when the reputation is high enough (makes it more easy to put enough workload on your employees).\nMaybe I dont found appropiate menus, but it seems that the company upgrades such as advertisment got removed (unconfirmed).\n\n[b]7.) Lets Play: Manage your shop[/b]\nI was not deep enough in the gameplay of new version to give a review about this.\nThere are still funny and new random events where you need to take decision.\n\nAnyway, when I checked the last updates, it makes quite fun to play the game. So I will change the recommendation from No to Yes for this current Build.\nAs soon as I continue playing my savegame and check the multiple-store-feature, I will update this review again.\nIf you have any questions, please come back to me.\n\nBest regards,\nGrinf4ce\n\n[b]//Edit 1:[/b] Added TL:DR section.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420981886, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434272755, "recommendationid": "13941526", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.978642", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503100366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 140, "steamid": "76561198193873643", "num_games_owned": 26}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is the best cooking game on steam!
