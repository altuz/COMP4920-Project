When I got to this game I literally was scared to turn off the lights! Now having grown older I realize that the game really wasn't that scary and my imagination played tricks on me a lot but it is still one of my favorites. I've enjoyed playing it many times and truly this particular game in the older years of Herinteractive really shows just how detailed the game's story can be. All you have to do is look at the Penvelleyn family story to see that. Definitely an enjoyable game."}]}
