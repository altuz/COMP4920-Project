I got it for myself, because gosh dang it I'm a huge Peter Pan fan..  Not a Peter Pan fan in the obsessive way Michael Jackson was a Peter Pan fan, but a fan none the less.  Who can forget the magical moment when Tinkerbelle Sprinkled her Pixie dust  (ok it wasn't Pixie dust it was LSD) onto the children so they could fly through London on their way to never never land..  (Also not Michael Jackson's home) \n\nIt needs to be said, this game has nothing to do with Peter Pan!!!  Shocking I know, but some time after Peter Pan 2: Return to cashville, Disney decided to break Tinkerbelle off on her own, give her a group of friends, and have them go adventuring together.  Something that would appeal to little girls.. I can dig it, I'm sure if I had little girls they would totally be into Tinkerbelle, probably dress up like her on Christmas, try to jump out our third story window in an attempt to fly like her, who knows maybe even sprinkle some of her own Pixie dust on people.. (totally not LSD, atleast that's what I told the police)..  \n\nAnyway enough fooling around lets get right into the review...  Unlike many other Disney games which valiantly try to be fun, this one just throws up it's hands and says aww phooey...  This game would probably be fun for girls under six years old, but Disney seemed to forget most children under six can't read.  Zero voice acting in the game means most children will play for a few minutes, then go do something more fun... like ram peanut butter and jelly sandwiches into the video game console, or give the dog a bath with something that is not shampoo  (ok this time it is LSD)  \n\n[b]Pro's[/b] \nTinkerbelle.... and her friends???\nPrintable pictures (although have more fun google the term Disney Princess printouts..)\nColorful  ???\n\n[b]Con's[/b]\nSame repeating music over and over again, guess they put it on a infinate loop.. at the very least toss in a few crashes or something....\nNo voice acting\nInsulting puzzles designed to test the wits and mind of a 2 year old...

While steam has a lack of GOOD children's games, the few that it does have will never see Tinker belle's adventure as one of them.  I would normally recommend this game if it were on sale, just for the sheer giggles of owning it, but being a Disney it'll never see a sale where the price dips below 10 dollars.  Maybe even on the off chance that the license expires, but meh, this is one you're best left leaving alone..", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458271359, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1458271359, "recommendationid": "21896995", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517169", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488731588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 199, "steamid": "76561198100929697", "num_games_owned": 379}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Bought with my 4yr olds love of Disney Princess and Fairies in mind, heres the verdict after we put in a mammoth 50 mins playtime !.\nFirstly, she wants to play more and didnt want to stop when i told her enough for today, so i guess thats the main objective achieved.\nThis is basically a point n click mouse controlled game. Static screens with shining objects to collect, other fairies to click on to speak too etc etc, no other control option that i could see in options.\nIts all based on the recent movie adaptations and uses characters from the films.\n\nPros:\nIts simple to understand. I had to read instructions and guide alot but she is 4 - give a couple of years which im guessing is more the intended age and i reckon mouse control and reading skills will be enough to deal with it.\nIf your wee one likes Disney Fairies this is going to appeal to them\nIt looks nice enough graphically (didnt check for 1920 x 1080 res, seemed to default to lower, kiddie didnt have patience to wait while i messed in options so ill check after bedtime !). I imagine in higher res would look pretty.\n\nCons:\nIts simple enough that it may then prove boring ?... time will tell\nSmall objects to find with mouse pointer - younger kids will struggle. I had to reduce DPI on my mouse alot for mine.\nGiven what it is, its damn pricey.\n\nVerdict:\nIts target audience is young children, so in that it achieves what it offers - a non challenging gentle game which you wont need to worry about them playing. However, i paid \u00a36 for this in the recent sale and i now feel that was too much !. \u00a314.99 is just beyond comprehension. \nIf you see it sub \u00a35 and you have kids who like Disney Fairies you could drop the money on worse things to keep them happy, anything above that price is a rip off frankly.\nRecommended for young kids or extreme adult Disney fans only if HEAVILY discounted.\nI have selected 'No' as my recommendation based on someone coming here and it being full price.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418230224, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1418230224, "recommendationid": "13307024", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510490", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498751512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 373, "steamid": "76561197980706670", "num_games_owned": 166}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "My 5 year old loves this game, i sit with her, narate what they say and we have a good father daughter time.

Are my experiences with it enough to recommend it?\n\nIt plays a lot like the DS games based on the Tinker Bell movies. Manouvre around a 2D map of small locations, collect things, talk to people, and play some minigames. The flight mechanisms feel wonderful to fly around with. Most of the scenery looks nice. But the story mode, which is the only mode that feels like a proper mode, feels like a collect-a-thon in almost every level. To fulfill deliveries, or to begin with equipment repairs, you need to find specific items scattered around.\n\nAnd those are for the very most part flower seeds, other seeds, and berries, scattered around on specific (or sometimes random) screens; except for a few items that can be only gathered through minigames. But collecting items is what virtually every level of the game is about, in their essence. Each level takes place during a season of the year, or rather, in-between when they change the seasons on Earth a few times a year. Though, each season-themed level only really consists of one task that needs to be done, before they pretty quickly skip forward to the next season. Thankfully, there are still more than just 4 levels in the game.\n\nI do like calm games. I do like games where I can just play around. This game completes that task, although it had big problems keeping my attention after a while, due to the repetitive feeling I got from most of the game. New areas are continuously discovered during gameplay, but the map screens aren't all that much bigger than they were in the DS games, where they were really tiny.\n\nThe graphics deserve a paragraph by themselves. For everything in the world, you will want to click the High Quality button in the settings, and not even then does it really reach even 720p (My bet is more on 1024x600, but my eyes could in theory have deceived me). The intro sequence's use of very low-quality footage from Tinker Bell 1 is also a bit of an oddity to behold.\n\nCanonwise, despite the thumbnail's use of Lost Treasure clothing and scenery, the game goes better along with Tinker Bell 1, from which many in-game locations and some characters hail from.\n\nI have been uncertain as to whether to give this Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down. It has given me a Disney Fairies non-DS game at long last, but the long-term gameplay, and the graphical quality (which for one time's sake actually is complainable about), does not deliver. At \u20ac17 at the time of purchase, I felt like I had overpayed even when I did like the feel of the game. If it ever gets somewhere below \u20ac12 (the further down, the better) and you're a very long-term Disney Fairies fan, then it could qualify as \"More content. Yay!\". But I have to stoop down against one of the franchises in my life that has meant the most to me, and say Thumbs Down.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445380851, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445380851, "recommendationid": "18591676", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505621", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1416787204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 123, "steamid": "76561198111555170", "num_games_owned": 218}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I am a lover of Disney, fairies, and Disney's long gone online game, Pixie Hollow. \n\nI was expecting this be more like the Nintendo DS games, but it is far from.
