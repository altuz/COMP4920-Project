The adventure revolves around an island and it's locales, an old harbortown bar, two skippers for whalewatching, an old lighthouse and... smuggling of course. \n\nThe story is, of course quite a normal Nancy Drew fare, besides that you might as well fail, there is always a second chance.  This game has also, as most Nancy Drew Games an infotainment value.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game isn't bad, neither it's boring or too obvious, you can play this game with some fun, solving riddles, or geting clues. But somehow this game feels... different than some other episodes. I would say, it's mostly the suspense.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b][list][*]Graphics fit the game.[*]Some characters are quite quirky - which is the only fun you'll gain out of the game.[/list]\n[b]Cons:[/b][list][*]Lacking the suspense of other episodes.[*]Sound, well... the music get's now a bit to repetetive.[/list]\n\n[h1]Recommended only to fans of the Series[/h1]\n\nThis game is only a must have if you actually like to play the Nancy Drew games. It's not an outstanding game in the series, but it's neiter the total lemon. The only good is some of the quirky characters in the Game, for example Nancy's host, the bar tender, the sailor and... well... of course the other skipper that also has the museum.\n\nDon't grow too affectionate :Tools:"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1407794590, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501511", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11667583", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067321450", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1407484125, "num_games_owned": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 329}, "timestamp_updated": 1407794590, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I was finally able to beat this game!
