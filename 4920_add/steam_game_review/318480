Controls are solid and the gameplay makes you really think about using your arsenal to the best of your abilities, in attempting to maximize the damage/coverage of the area and stars for you to get. The co-op is just a rehash of the single player however, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a different experience out of it. The problem will be the number of levels, while you have 60 levels and they all feel relatively compact and unique, and some replayability to 100% sections, that may not be enough for people at a 9-10 price tag. \n\nIt's for puzzle fans and completionist fans, but others may want to wait for a sale.\n\nFor more first impressions and Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLYLaA0-BQY", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426778739, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1426778739, "recommendationid": "14960717", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517294", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427423757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1688, "steamid": "76561197993867618", "num_games_owned": 967}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "a fun bomber-man style puzzle game, with good visuals and music and a decent amount of challenge and replayablity.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426721001, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1426721001, "recommendationid": "14953321", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512328", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468115207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 818, "steamid": "76561197981087823", "num_games_owned": 388}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A hidden gem of a top-down puzzle game. You'll definitely enjoy this if you enjoy puzzle games, especially if you like top-down ones like chuck's/chip's challenge. There's even a competetitive aspect if you're into that - every stage has a speedrun leaderboard for any% and 100%. It took me about 14 hours to get gold on every original stage (but I didn't do any of the bonus worlds).\n\nThe premise of this game is, for each level, to burn up and explode everything that can be burnt/exploded, collect all the stars, and to do so in as short of a time as possible. However, this isn't like Bomberman where you have an unlimited supply of bombs - every bomb is something that has to be picked up in the stage and is consumed when used. The time, stars, and burn percentage are flexible, too - you don't need to collect everything or come in under the par time for the level in order to advance. However, if you want to \"gold\" a level, you'll need to get 100% stars and burn rate and finish under the par time (but you don't have to do that all in a single run, so you can go for 100% one time and go for any% but under par in a subsequent run and you'll still earn a gold for that level). \n\nWhile you CAN simply play to just beat each stage, I think this game is the most fun if you shoot for getting gold on every stage. You could probably blow through this game in a few hours if you didn't try to get gold. Adding speed and finding ways to optimize your run for a given level is one of the key aspects of the fun of this game, IMO.\n\nSo, the first time you play through a stage you'll probably take it slow and figure out what you need to do to get 100%, then later try to build speed and optimize in future replays. Towards the later stages, I found most of my time being spent optimizing and attempting to achieve the par time (after I had already figured out how to beat it with 100%).\n\nThe gameplay of burning stuff is unique and satisfying. Since things take time to burn and explode, a key aspect of going fast is to figure out what to burn first so you can maximize the amount of things you have burning at once. But when you start to burn more things, you can open yourself up to getting killed and having to restart.\n\nEach character has different abilities, meaning there's multiple ways to complete stages, some faster than others. If you're creative you might even discover routes the designers never thought of.\n\nThe level/puzzle design is excellent. It increases in difficulty and complexity as you get further into the game. New mechanics are introduced at a satisfying rate.\n\nMy one suggestion would be to provide some sort of global leaderboard that takes into account your position on every stage, so you can see who is the overall top player or something like that.\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of puzzle games, I'd say this is a must-have. It can get very heavily discounted and there's plenty of hours of playtime as well as an aspect of competition and replayability if you're interested in climbing leaderboards. There's plenty of content, too. Even after getting gold on the main game you can still play the bonus worlds and collect the hidden saplings. I highly recommended this unless you're not a big fan of puzzle games. This game deserves a lot more attention than it's received, IMO, but I think that puzzle games in general tend to be less popular these days.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468118249, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468118256, "recommendationid": "24221705", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508724", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506038906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 698, "steamid": "76561198061695259", "num_games_owned": 76}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "As a long time Bomberman fan, and lover of puzzle games alike, I absolutely loved this game!
