You have to uncover a lot of clues, which at last lead to the final solution of the mysterie behind the secret of Moon Lake.\n\nNancy Drew Adventures are quite often disregarded as childish, and especially girlie adventures - I beg to differ. They are worthwhile and even for adults they offer a lot of relaxing if not outright fun of the suspense story kind. Forget those blasted Visual Novels, most of them aren't worth the black dirt from under your fingernails. But digging up real mysteries and trying to make sense out of leads, or fall for red herrings is indeed a lot of fun.\n\nSure, the graphics are already dated. But the story that is told inside this game is still very vibrant and good. Nancy Drew is sometimes compared as a Mary Sue character, but if you delve deeper into this mater you will take note that she isn't she can have accidents, which sometimes draw her off a case, or even... well kill her... and you'll come to love the stories that are told in the adventures. Why, you ask? Because they remind you of the stories you have read as a kid, or you have seen series with the same suspense stories.\n\nI recomend this game to anyone who loves Adventure, Riddle and Suspense games, with real culprits to catch and ghosts that only exist because somebody is still telling their stories."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1401986904, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514435", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10357970", "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198089733694", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1399133221, "num_games_owned": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 235}, "timestamp_updated": 1401986904, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ah the classics, you don't get much better than that.

Everything you do in this mystery challenges your brain and you get to do cool things like getting thrown into a shack and you have to escape before you burn up in flames. The thing I like the most in this game is the detail of the house with countless references to Mickey Malone's dogs. You really get the vibe from this game just how much one person can truly value their pets -- even if they are the key to finding secret loot.

Luckily, the soundtrack has not and I really appreciated the music. The puzzles are fun and challenging. Solving them will take some creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. What's more, the game didn't feel like I was just going from puzzle to puzzle, task to task. I felt like I was exploring something and on an adventure.

Upon your arrival Nancy's friend has left because she was too scared (what a puss). After her friend explains over the phone what is going on and no way for Nancy to leave she is left to her first spooky experience during the night at Moon Lake. You also learn about the history of the cabin which was owned by Mickey Malone, a notorious gangster who happen to own a few dogs.\n\nGameplay: Has some good exploration including a few activities that have you run around in the woods looking for things such as bugs and taking pictures of birds. The puzzels are fun and not too difficult other than one that requires you understand roman numerals (ugh). The characters are interesting and you get to befriend an old grumpy man who birdwatches. You also get to see some cute dogs which is always a plus.\n\nAll in all its a fantastic point and click game and id probably rate it a 9/10.
