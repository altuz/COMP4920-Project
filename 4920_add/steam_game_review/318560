Once you find them, you can simply press the E key to order them to follow you and you lead them back to the starting blue safe zone.\n\nMovement is made by rotating your direction with the mouse, then holding the left mouse button down to move forward in the direction you face.  You can fire unlimited bullets in a straight path in front of you by hitting the space button.  To me, the movement controls would be much better if they had taken a more traditional approach and made WASD be movement, perhaps using A & D to rotate, W to move forward in the direction you face, and this would allow you to move backwards by simply hitting the S key.  To me, I think this would have worked much better and it made it less awkward because it would free up your left mouse button to fire.\n\nRegardless, the game is pretty fun and has a certain level of addiction to it.  The cutest element of the game comes when you get into a close battle with the baddies and any prisoners following you will run off to a corner and quiver and shake, obviously scared to death.  You'll simply need to go recapture them with the E key if this happens, but it always seemed to get a smile out of me.\n\nThe game is not without faults despite its unique gameplay and the fact I love the randomly generated levels to keep the game engaging and different every time you play.\n\nMy biggest complaint occurs once you fail a level which happens if your character gets touched by any baddie.  When you fail, you immediately replay the failed level, but it completely generates a new random level, and this is my biggest gripe with this game.  There are many times that I want \"another chance\" to fix whatever I did wrong on the SAME exact level I just played, not a new randomly generated one - which can be 10 times easier (or harder) just based simply on the procedural generation and placement of your prisoners and the danger zones which spawn the baddies.\n\nMy next complaint comes with what definetely feels CHEAP from the baddies when they crawl over walls to get to you and they don't have to work through the maze as you do.  I don't know if this is intential game design or a flaw that needs to be worked out.  Because this game is not \"early access\", I tend to believe this was left in the game intentionally, and it certainly feels cheap when it happens at certain times.\n\nAdd in the awkward choice of controls that takes time to get used to, and you have a very unique game that I just feel could have been done so much better.  I hope that the developers can make some adjustments, add in an option to repeat a failed level rather then procedurally generate a new one, and give us some customization on the movement controls... as well as prevent the baddies from walking through walls essentially by moving over the top of them.\n\nMy Scores for this game break down as follows, and sadly this game doesn't seem to break out of the sub-par games that the publisher 'Strategy First\" seems to have a reputation for:\n\nValue of the Game: 20 out of 40 - It's not priced too high at $4.99 and the game offers a unique experience, but the game breaking faults I mention above with the awkward choice of controls brings this score down over it could have been.\n\nFun Factor of the game: 12 out of 30 - Again this \"could\" have been a unique Indie game if only it was made with a little more pre-planning and if the code made the AI enemies use actual intelligence to work through the mazes rather then just climing over walls and if you could repeat the exact same levels you just failed.\n\nControls/Bugs: 5 out of 20: Ugh, giving the controls a 5 out of 20 here is giving the game benefit of the doubt and assuming that they actually tried the more traditional control layout\n I mentioned above.  Bugs like the mobs climbing over walls lowers this score as well.\n\nGraphics/Sound: 7 out of 10 - The graphics and sound work fine for this style of game and while they aren't anything special, they work just fine.  Unfortunately for this developers of this game, graphics and sound are only 10% of my overall scoring criteria.\n--------------------------------\nFINAL FIRST IMPRESSIONS SCORE: 44%\n\nAs much as I want to like this game based on \"what it could have been\" and its unique gameplay, I just can't recommend it, even at it's low price point of under $5 USD.  Sorry devs, make some adjustments to fix my above complaints, and comment below my review.. and I will be more then happy to give this game a second look and review.
