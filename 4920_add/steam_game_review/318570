The moody ambiant track was actually memorable and made the game worthy of returning to in small doses. Feels distantly like a primitive underachieved tablet version of Darkest Dungeons \n\nA board style game with tower defense combat. Good atmosphere and core concept but dev did not fully realize in execution leaving a grindy repetitive clumsy and rather unbalanced experience to deal with.\n\nGreat game but feels like an alpha. Game tells you to follow clues of Van Helsing to find Dracula but I played this for over 5 hours and I never saw any such thing. From what I can tell Dracula, which is the main goal, can spawn at any time in early zones or in advanced zones and there is no rhyme or reason to it. End boss battle not well thought out, game has you grind all abilities to max to start out with a decent chance at being able to play and not die immediately. \n\nEvery tile that is 1 hex away from start location is zone 1 - 2 hexes are zone 2 and difficulty scales up rapidly. Each hex can be one of nine districts which improve an aspect of your faction every turn, for example being able to heal quicker for the hospitals. User interface is a little on the clunky side. \n\nRapid movement on the combat map is difficult, the action points based system is hard to balance with health management. The inability to go to the next turn without having to explore is disappointing especially mid game when you need to recover and are forced to go several zones in just to uncover a square and make the days pass, exposing you to very real risks of a game over encounter. \n\nThe end goal is to kill Dracula which is an overpowered unique monster that sometimes telegraphs that he is in the fight by taunting you and then showing up as a random spawn. He teleports around, can tank way too much damage and moves through the battlefield way too fast. With no way to pin him down it would take nothing short of a massive grinded army of guys to take him down. \n\nBecause yeah, this is plants vs zombies, but instead of just having a card u spend coins on to spawn towers, you get ONE tower when you uncover a house tile, which you can customize with a weapon from the gun shop tile, and thats it, you gotta babysit this tower because when it dies it is gone forever. So achievement this level of grind would be no small feat, and after all the grind necessary to even get this game started thats a daunting prospect. Because yeah, the game starts you off in a tower defense with one tower, most basic weapon, and then spawns foes on all lanes. \n\nYou cant win, and have to grind to have a starting deck that can even remotely put up some kind of a defense. Even then there are a lot of spinning plates all at once and you will mess up sooner or later. I think if this game had been retweaked it could had been really good but it has been released a long time ago and I am not expecting the gameplay to fundamentally change.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500412010, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503549010, "recommendationid": "33638259", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 40, "total_reviews": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 25}}
