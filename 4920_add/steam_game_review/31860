For starters, basing a game around a legend is pretty darn cool -- the skull itself was a beautiful work of art. The puzzles in this game have really been stepped up to a challenging level. Even on junior sleuth, the puzzles are quite challenging, almost as if you were playing as a senior detective. Not to mention, the entire locations and scenes in New Oreleans really adds to the entire story background and the mystery of this game. This is most certainly a game worth playing!

And each series explore certain locations that makes you feel like you have been there and learnt some new knowleges about that place.\n \nThe  graphics might not be the most beautiful things amongst other games but, to me, the adventure games is not really about how beautiful it looks, but it is about the content of the game.\n\nLike other ND games, solving the mystery of the \"Legend of the Crystal Skull\" really depends on the player. You will seriously need to explore, solve puzzles, obtain informations so forth! Which at the end, gives you such a satisfaction! \n\nAnd I found Henry very sexy... \n\nIf you like adveture games, solving mysteries on your own, I recommend ND games!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1407733789, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502796", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "11647573", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198119774005", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1405398355, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 599}, "timestamp_updated": 1407733789, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Particularly enjoyed this one, I thought the graphics were decent, with very few glitches.

A mansion, a secret room, a dusty journal,  a graveyard, plenty of personal belongings to rifle through, and a nearly perfect combination of gothic creepiness and quirky fun. \n\nUnlike some of the other Nancy Drew games you don't get bogged down by minigames or tasks that feel unrelated to the plot. Everythign you do from solving riddles to exploring the environment to interrogating the suspects feels like it's driving the storyforward but the game still lets you set the pace and come up with solutions on your own. The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, the story is complelling, and the characters - while there aren't too many of them - are all interesting. On top of that you have a great atmosphere, detailed settings, and teamwork between Bess and Nancy.\n\nIn fact it's difficult to find flaws with this game.

I begged my mum to get if for me when I saw it in a Scholastic catalogue. I couldnt stop playing until I got stuck at the contraption/puzzle you have to solve in order for the shop owner at Zeke's to sneeze and aid as a distraction for Bess to sneak in back to look for an important clue (not gonna say too much in case it spoils the game).\nPlaying it again, I thought it was a bit boring after a couple hours. You're stuck in this one house, with a garden and cemetary and the lack of characters doesn't make it hard to figure out who did it early on in the game. It's also pretty challenging, I played as Senior and if I hadn't of googled a lot of things I wouldn't have finished the game. Walked back and forth between all the same locations, gathering clues, going back again etc got really irritating after a while. The story itself is good: but I think it could've been a lot better if there were more characters and locations to explore, and if the whole walking to and from taking up half of the game. The game took me 9 hours to complete and I'm sure most if the nine hours was getting to and from places. \nOn a positive note, the graphics are surprisingly good for a game thats been out for so long! The creepy and somewhat gothic atmosphere was definitely cool, fitting in with the storyline nicely. Plus, I couldn't stop playing even though it infuritated me more than anything. \nOverall, feelings of nostalgia aside, I probably wouldn't rush to play this game. As much as I love Nancy Drew, it didn't please me much. Although I am incredibly fussy when it comes to games, and games have improved a lot since 2007. Maybe it's me being too harsh but I won't recommend this one. But hey, if you want to play it go straight ahead! One persons opinon to another are all completely different and for the most part people enjoyed this game, I'm just with the minority of people who didn't."}]}
