The campaign, that is the tutorial too, is well made. The difficulty is good, not too hard, not too boring.\nI really enjoy the atmosphere, that is greatly done with the setting - how I love to flow down this river - and the music.\nAs it is a survial game: I like that it is not that much realistic, not having having that deep research tree etc. I really like that simplicity in the gameplay. Still, it has it challenges.\nUnfortunately, it has some \"problems\" with description text cut off in several dialoges. As for me, I manage to \"complete\" them out of the context.\nSummary: There are some things, that are not perfect, but I really like this game, mostly of it's atmosphere and the really well done single-player-campaign-mode, and the well done campaing-single-player-mode. Yes, it's the same, but I personally find it's hard to find games that have a good single player and a good campaign, this has both of them.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506021817, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506021817, "recommendationid": "35111993", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 485, "total_reviews": 612, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 127}}
