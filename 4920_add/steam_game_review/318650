Units getting easily stuck - Many times I have had units get stuck in the map. For some reason having a massive army moving all at once ended up pushing some of my infantry off the walkable path and into a rock, getting them stuck forever.\n\n2. Path Finding - I found the A.I path finding for both your units and enemy seem very weak/stupid. Many times I have ordered my units to go a certain route only to have them do the opposite. You will need to baby sit your units a lot. Another good example is the air transport...many times I order them to land on a large flat land only to have them fly somewhere else.....like into the middle of a enemy AA defense system...\n\n3. A.I - Many times I found my units get attacked only to stand there and take it or would follow the enemy unit to the other side of the map. This bothered me a lot since many RTS has a basic system where if a enemy attacks them or near them they will engage and if the enemy unit flees then your units retreat to their last position. \n\n4. UI - I found the general UI works but sadly the map and the information given to you is broken. I found many times I would get a warning about units under attack only to find nothing and other times find my forces are truly under attack but will not get any warnings about it. For the map it's very hard to see your units sometimes on certain maps as they don't appear clearly on the map. \n\nOverall a okay RTS but nothing too amazing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505981142, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505981142, "recommendationid": "35099811", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503722", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "total_reviews": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 20}}
