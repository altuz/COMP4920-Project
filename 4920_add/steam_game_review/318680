Even with a coupon I don't think the price was worth it (EDIT: on sale for $10 from $15 USD). I got all the achievements (less 2) in 6 hours. Every dialogue advancement causes the character sprites to flicker. Most puzzles are skipable - which on the one had is nice so you don't get stuck, on the other makes the game a lot shorter. The incentive to complete the puzzles is to get the achievement and your money's worth - although most of them could be solved with random guesswork and button pushing. And others, when I eventually did figure out what you're supposed to do, there was no context clue that I could find to hint at that solution (I'm looking at you last puzzle of the game). Without seeing the achievement title I likely would have been stuck longer.\n\nTo make matters worse, I tried to start a new game to see if I could clean up missing achievements - I found on a second playthrough you get glitched halfway through the game and cannot advance. On a second playthrough, the items in your inventory that you need to find are greyed out in the hidden object scenes. This is annoying but not game breaking. What does break the game is when you are in the library and need to solve a simple guess puzzle of putting books on the shelf based on the author's nationality, the books vanish from your inventory when you click on them. This puzzle cannot be skipped. Exiting the unbeatable puzzle causes all other inventory items to disappear. I only fixed this by deleting all my save data and starting again - not a huge loss since I completed the game a second time within an hour.\n\nAll that said, I really did have some fun with this game, mostly because there was no guide and I had to figure everything out myself. But when I look at its faults and the total gameplay time, I'd strongly suggest only buying it when it's on sale, if at all.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1478458838, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1481669576, "recommendationid": "26462387", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515270", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507069788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561198117221161", "num_games_owned": 195}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "At first I tried to like this game because of the subject matter, then I tried turning a blind eye to what bothered me about it, and in the end I gave up and asked for a refund.\n\nThe dialogue was not very inspiring.  I would not characterize it as inane because it is one cut better than that, but just barely.\n\nIt's hard to tell when you should click to advance the dialogue.  If you do you might miss something, but that's probably not a bad thing.\n\nI wasn't expecting the game to be about finding hidden objects, but it is.  I encountered three puzzles, none of them giving hints as to what I was supposed to do.  That wasn't a problem on the first puzzle (an uninspired cypher solving puzzle), but the next two were hidden object finders, after which I threw in the towel in disgust.\n\nThere are several YouTube walkthroughs that I should have looked at before buying the game, because I would have realized what I was getting myself into.\n\nA shame, because medieval alchemy is a great subject.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507136516, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507136516, "recommendationid": "35476175", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
