THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE. THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED.\n\nI was rooting for Vinci Games, I really was. I wanted to like this game so bad. My brain was screaming don't buy this game, but I decided to follow my heart and give it a try. I regret my decision so much.\n\nHere are my reasons:\n\n\nI dropped my gun and couldn't pick up another one, the optimization was iffy, I got stuck on a pipe, the game design seem to be limited to grab the keycard and hit the thing, and in the short time I played I managed to turn the entire game wire frame by hitting esc and when I pressed F2 the entire thing quit itself. It took me all of 12 minutes to want my money back, as this game does not offer a compelling story or fun game experience. It was ear destroying ambient noise, unappealing AI interaction and absolutely no depth in combat, with a complete lack of any other mechanic. Unlike the description, there where almost no dynamics, and I was not even slightly thrilled playing any part of this game. This game is so bland, it makes air control look fun. You just run around and hit the same 4 or 5 monsters the entire game, with absolutely nothing satisfying about getting a kill. Sometimes there is one on the floor, which does the same thing, and sometimes there is a big one, which does the same thing. You just pathetically wallop them with your flashlight until they crumple up and instantly disappear. If you want a good sci-fi horror shooter experience, you are probably just better off installing Doom 3 again, because this game seems to be a horrible mangle of concepts from different titles that got tossed into one giant unappealing mess of a game. This is possibly one of the worst games I have ever played in my life. Even worse than early access, because they are trying to market this featureless pile of dung as a pulse pounding horror game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418073733, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422824635, "recommendationid": "13286827", "language": "english", "votes_down": 69, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722916", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1418123960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 166, "steamid": "76561197976251043", "num_games_owned": 410}, "votes_funny": 10, "votes_up": 172, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Cargo 3 is an unfinished product sold at 15 dollars a pop. It's repetitive, boring, and lack of content makes it a shallow game which needs much more time in the development cycle. You'll find bugs a plenty and combat is slow, mundane, and uninteresting. \n\nWhile the enviorments themselves are interesting at first, they lose their appeal after the first level. Mostly because it's copy pasted over and over and over again through out the 7 levels seperated by 3 stages in each one.

I wanted to love Cargo 3, it had a price tag that agreed with me 4.99, was a FPS sci fi horror game and generally looks like something I would love.  After downloading the game I was stoked to play it. \n\nAfter the first minute of playing I had already come to regret my decision.  The movements are sluggish and kind of unresponsive.  You randomly take damage for no known reason, looking in all directions I saw nothing that should have damaged me but none the less I was damaged anyway.\n\nThe hit detection also seemed to suffer from the same unresponsiveness that the controls did.  Pressing the fire button would cause my weapons to fire 3 to 5 seconds after I pressed the actual button.  Which allowed the creatures to start attacking me.  Point blank shots seemed to have no effect on these creatures at all..\n\nEventually I found my way to the first level's end... I think?  I was greeted with a loading screen... upon reloading, I was devoid of my weapons.  After wandering for a few moments I was attacked and killed as I had no weapons to defend myself  (this was a bug, when I reloaded the checkpoint my gun was back)   After wandering a little while longer I was killed while my point blank bullets cruised through the creature right in front of me.\n\nI think this game could be good, if the movements and hit detection were fixed, while it certainly won't win any game of the year awards for the low price of 4.99 with some fixes it could be worth a few hours of game time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429926322, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429926322, "recommendationid": "15527799", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583869", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1425496212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 335, "playtime_forever": 27, "steamid": "76561197986360343", "num_games_owned": 630}, "votes_funny": 18, "votes_up": 91, "comment_count": "5", "review": "This game is an abomination! There is simply no better way to put it. Its graphics, its design, its sound effects, everything. \n\nTruth be told I like indie games and I like giving them a chance. This is how it all began with Vinci Games. The horror genre is one of my favourites, anyway. Not to mention when the atmosphere is greatly determined by the presence of zombies or zombie-like creatures. And of course, the sci-fi environment gave another reason to give this one a try.\n\nOne thing you notice right away is how the game allows you to continue your progress. Even before starting a new game. No, there's no data and you will start a new game but what kind of programming and preparation happened in the background if the main menu has such a mistake?  \n\nThen you start in one room and go to another one. And then another one. And these look very similar. And once you come across with a new design later on you'll encounter the same elsewhere. The game barely offers any variations. There are some pictures and text telling you the story before the menu but once you are in the game there's no indication as to what you need to do. Yes, later on you encounter a door that requires a red card but... that's it? And the next level says green card. Really?\n\nWell, yes. It reminds you of Doom. But Doom was released 20 years ago. Enemies appear out of nowhere and once killed they respawn later on. Several times they respawned right in front of me or in the next room (as the smoke effect was visible through the wall). You kill them with a drill you are provided with at the beginning then you continue looking for the key and do the killing to the same creatures you have already disposed of. Oh, and some of them hide behind the wall which opens up after a while (again, Doom by id software).\n\nI do not know what happens later on as for me it was perfectly enough to get to the 2nd level and quit in order to abandon this mess once and for all. And this game costs 10 euros? It is a joke.\n\nI think Vinci's credo is as follows: \"Let's make a game with the critically acclaimed Unreal engine and cash in on the well-made trailers.\"\n\nThis is bad. Very bad. Avoid it as far away as possible.

The graphics are enjoyable thats probably the only positive i can give. The modles of the zombies arent the greatest but they move and attack quite nicely, the guns look decent but graphics wise everything gets held back because of the poor visuals, and by that i mean 90% of the maps are very dark and you must use the 3 available visions that are given too you, personally i used Nightvision. The whole time there a grey lines shooting across your screen almost as if you are in a flashback of some sort, it doesnt help with the game play but you get used to it after a while.\n\nall in all id give graphics a 6/10\n\nThe graphics sadly were not the only thing with flaws, for mutants id never expect them to sound the way they did. \neach mutant has their own sound and honestly none of them have good sound effects, the first mutant you encounter sounds like a high pitched crow and it just doesnt make sense when you hear it.\nThere is only one song/sound that plays in the background of the game and it doesnt add to the suspense at all, the sound of the foot steps you take is one of the better sound effects in the game.\nAlso the sound effects of your character choking to death on the gas in the poisonous rooms, its quite realistic and makes you feel sick to your stomach.\n\nI could probably forgive all of the above issues if the game was not so repetitive and bland.\nI will give a breif run through on how this game is, the only story concept of this game is at the start when you read about what happened and why your character is in this hell. All you are told to do and all there is to do in this game is to collect cards to open special doors that will bring you to the next level.\nThe cards are not very noticable and for the first five or six cards you find they are in the exact same place (where you replenish your HP, Armor and Energy), then the odd time you will find it in a corner of a random room.\n\n\nThe plot and story is short and has really nothing to it, no thought or effort.\nOther problems i found with this game is the mutants spawn where ever and when ever they please, if you dont kill them they just stockpile and there becomes an abundance of mutants everywhere. You get nothing for killing these mutants and the wepons given to you, especially at the start of the game are not anywhere near helpful.\nBoth guns i collected took far too long to kill the mutants and even longer to reload, and the melee weapons you are given take about six hits to kill a mutant and as you progress the zombies get stronger so of course it requires more attempts to kill a muntant with whatever weapon your using.\nIf you dont kill the mutants of course they follow you until you are far enough away, but it is very easy to be trapped by them inbetween doors or in corners. If you dont have your weapon at the ready or have an opening to get away you will die in seconds.\nAlso at the start as i was progressing through the game, i noticed as i passed through the doors that required keys to get through the maps were being recycled. I noticed and recognised a lot of the same rooms and hall ways, as crazy as that sounds but when the whole concept of a game is basically a search and destroy, you tend to give yourself side objectives (because you get none in the game). \nAlso this game is not scary at all, nothing about this game makes you feel terrified or worried. Zero sense of ergency.\n\nIf you are like my self and like to state your oppinion for others to interpret, but can still enjoy a game as is, then for the right price this game is for you. \nThis game does feel a little unfinished and quite rushed, but this wont be the last time i will play this game.\nI do like to finish what i started and i intend on finishing this game.\n\nIn total i give this game about a 4/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430247274, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430247274, "recommendationid": "15600588", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500449", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432797798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 454, "steamid": "76561198006497533", "num_games_owned": 32}, "votes_funny": 16, "votes_up": 53, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Long loading time", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421425588, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421425588, "recommendationid": "14013766", "language": "english", "votes_down": 46, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444697", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "total_reviews": 52, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 2, "review_score_desc": "Very Negative", "total_negative": 42}}
