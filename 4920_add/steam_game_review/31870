The P&C segments are routinely broken up by decent minigames throughout. Individual lines of dialogue can also be skipped, a rare treat.

It is a casual approach on Nancy Drew adventures, and I am a fan of original series. I clearly see how this game coud be as good as the other games, but it just didn't happen.\nIt feels like the creation of this game was rushed, so the controls aren,t polished, the mini-games could have a tweak here and there, and the game mechanics cause some absurd things, like a photo camera requiring the batteries to take the negatives out, and, right after that, Nancy taking out the negatives and putting them onto the table in direct white light (IRL that would ruin the picture, that's why we needed that red lightbulb in the first place).\nThe attempt to make the dialog feel more like a game has its ups and downs - while I enjoy the possibility of saying something wrong if I'm not paying enough attention, Nancy pausing mid-sentence just feels wrong.\nIt could be much better.\ni would rather recommend playing other games from Nancy Drew series."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487769192, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30098901", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198103347134", "num_reviews": 99, "last_played": 1483120027, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 248}, "timestamp_updated": 1487769192, "received_for_free": false, "review": "When I was first introduced to this version of the Nancy series I was not expecting this.
