Especially the scene where Tiana, Naveen, Charlotte, and Georgia chase each other around in a mad kissing frenzy, making Tiana Disney's first interracial bisexual polygamist princess. \n\nIt's mainly a collection of minigames that you beat in order to accumulate beads, which you then spend on awesome fashion accessories such as a bow that goes over your chest, and another one that goes over your bum. You can wear any of your favorite outfits from the movie, including the waitress uniform from Duke's and the waitress uniform from Cal's.\n\nOne thing that hurt this game a great deal was the exclusion of multiplayer. Being able to actually play this game with 2-3 of your closest friends would have been fantastic (until they stopped being your friends since you kicked their butts). \n\nThe graphics are pretty good. At one point Charlotte's cat shows up, which is weird because she had that thing when she was a little girl. Was it just really old? There was only a difference of about ten years or so between the childhood scenes and adult scenes, so I suppose it could be the case.\n\nMany of the original voice actors returned, except for John Goodman, whoever did Mama Odie, and probably Oprah. Seriously, John Goodman? \n\nThere is a fun cooking minigame, but it doesn't really seem to have any effect whatsoever on the rest of the game. Can be ignored if you want.\n\nThere's also a karaoke/sing-along little bit, where you can have Louis' band play such songs as 'Almost There', 'Down in New Orleans', and 'When the Saints Come Marching In'. (No, that one wasn't in the movie. I don't know why it's there).\n\nAll in all, a pleasant game to play over an idle afternoon or two. Would only buy it if it's on sale, though.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489055433, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489055433, "recommendationid": "30405955", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489269217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 126, "steamid": "76561198209341245", "num_games_owned": 541}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "LOVE IT", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1483186200, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1483186200, "recommendationid": "28866368", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
