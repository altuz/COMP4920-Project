Although the game is made by HER Interactive, I believe some male gamers might still enjoy the challenge the game presents in using one's brain to fit hints and pieces of the story together, and ultimately solve the mystery.  As a kid I was a fan of reading the Nancy Drew novels, so there was a bit of the nostalgia factor at work for me, but really if you're just the type of person whom enjoys a decently concocted plot, as well as the mystery genre, you'll probably find enjoyment in this title. If you aren't into solving puzzles, or have very little patience, best to avoid as such things ARE a requirement here. In summary:\n\nPros:\n+ Creative puzzle designs and decent graphics for it's time\n+ Outdated graphics still hold a certain charm in their aesthetic, as does the period music\n+ Good voice acting. Nancy Drew's voice in particular is quite memorable and occasionally pops into my head when reading lines from other leading female detectives in novels\n+ Good character variety with a believable setting\n+ There are some very genuinely funny and cute things that give the game a human flair; like the quack hypnotist guy owning a cat you briefly interact with, smatterings of relevant real world literature, and the money earning sidequests leading you to dialogues with various quirky small townsfolk\n+ Nancy herself is a well-developed protagonist, and the phone/radio conversations she had with her father, friends, and random strangers were some of the best. She has some sass and fire when the situation calls for it, but isn't rude, and has a thirst for exploration & knowledge that makes her relatable\n\nNeutrals/Cons:\n- A few of the puzzles were annoyingly chance based, or difficult based on controls \n- Although most of the puzzle rewards and clues end up pointing you in the right direction, I still personally ran into a couple of moments where I couldn't figure out where to go next without looking it up\n- Backtracking. Lots of backtracking\n- The sewing machine game. Accounted for 90% of my frustration\n\nOverall:\n8 out of 10\n\nThe Secret of the Old Clock was one of my first mystery stories back in the day, and seeing a Steam Sale for these games, I became curious as to how well the novels were adapted.  I was not disappointed when I started playing, and will be checking out the other titles that came in the bundle as well!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487990111, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30155957", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198260730931", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1487825522, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 321}, "timestamp_updated": 1487990111, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game was just plain fun.

The story feels very linear, and I never really had a point where I was lost on what to do. I very rarely had to use guides, and that may feel simplistic to some more hardcore puzzle solvers, but I liked the easier flow.
