Even the stairways look like they were plucked directly from Anor Londo. But! I'm not going to name it as a con.\n\nI'll start with the negative aspects:\n-Stiff as wood animations all around, which makes most enemy attacks look goofy. I swear, that tri-headed demon has a grab attack during which the protagonist stays completely still. Same goes for death animation - Leopold doesn't die per se, he just slouches a bit, looking depressed. It looks less like real combat and more like an elaborate game of pretend.\n\n-Strange AI. Some enemies aggro only when you stand uncomfortably close to them, but can be provoked by locking on from afar. Which trivializes one of the bossfights, since you pick enemies one by one, lead them in a corner, then bash their heads in with a halberd. \nSame goes for certain bosses - they feel a bit too easy, having extremely long windup animations and enormous amount of dead zones.\n\nWould probably need adjusting for the final release.\n\n-Not exactly memorable layout for the palace. Maybe it's intentional, but most rooms and hallways look copypasted to hell and back. 1 entrance+ 3 doors, with only 5 or so grand halls, and only 1 of them has at least something worth noticing (namely the giant statue). I can understand if striving for minimalism was a choice in design, but right now it doesn't provide that \"hollow\" feeling, it just looks unfinished. Fitting for an Early Access game, I suppose.\n\n\nNow for something good. It's going to be a much shorter list.\n\n-Ambience and music are well-done, amplifying the somber atmosphere of the game. \n-Story is...not particularly captivating, but it's mysterious enough to draw the player in. \n-Potential. Yeah, I don't really say that often, but the game certainly has potential. It's not gonna get any GOTYs, that's for sure, but I can see it as a pleasant experience in the near future.\nAll that, plus the fact that the game was made by one person (or at least that's what I've reckoned after doing some background check) really makes me want to recommend it.\n\nAnd I will. But keep in mind, my decision is swayed by the fact that I'm a sucker for these kinds of games.\n\nSo if you want to play low-budget version of Demon's/Dark Souls, you can pick it up after the full release and just pretend that you're playing a game made by FromSoft's F-team.

Did I not? I'm still not sure. \n\nI went in expecting a very mediocre, deriviative clone of Dark Souls. Actively what I wanted from it. And it managed to be more than that. But also managed to scuttle that with some very poor design decisions. Isn't that odd?\n\nMalebolgia is a purposefully slow action game set in one self-enclosed level, that gradually opens up, then warps itself through later story sections. You follow one character, with one weapon, with no character levels or armour or any of that jazz. This isn't a bad thing and the story emphasis proves to the be the main driving motivation for this game.\n\n[h1]\"You're finally handling that weapon with pride, Leopold.\"[/h1]\n[i]-Princess Marie-Elizabeth[/i]\n\nThe story, a fairly simple tale of guilt and redemption that never really gets around to either, follows the backstory of your character Leopold. It has a bunch of dressed up nonsense strapped to it, involving latin aesthetics and NPCs who speak in riddles, but also some meaningful dialogue from other NPCs who reveal their backstory, their biases or even casually chat as they reminisce about innocuous activities.\n\nThis emphasis on a single character really pays off, and proves to be a fairly engrossing tale with some decent climactic moments. \n\nAll the side characters are distinct and individual and fulfil a specific role, all within the Palace Malebolgia itself. Malebolgia manages to have some interesting uses of environments that conveys a sense of a cohesive whole.\n\nBut this is where the problems start.\n\n[h1]\"We're all dead here.\"[/h1]\n[i]-Sir Eligor[/i]\n\nIt's way too dark. Waaaay too dark. \"Early access indie greenlit first-person horror game on Steam\" dark. Your torch illuminates a nice little 3-inch circle under your feet and otherwise you're pretty much left to your own devices.\n\nThis doesn't do anything, you see enemies from a billion miles away anyway since they've all got glowing eyes. You know what it does? Hurts my eyes, for one. Squander the game's potential by making most Malebolgia locales proper look completely indistinct for another - in that they're all black because you can't see anyway. Even with the brightness jacked to full, it was like wearing a gimp mask.\n\nJust use the map to navigate? The map is worthless. It shows one area at a time and navigating it is a shot in the dark, which is fitting. For some reason the arrow that shows you which direction you're facing is itty bitty and blends into the player marker, another fantastic design decision. But the map sucks, might be the worst map I've seen since Shadowman.\n\nMaybe it's good that the game is so dark, because the animations are horrible and ugly. The game's artstyle, sure, you know what you're getting into, and honestly the models don't even look that bad. But the actual animation - from limpwristed, undercommunicated telegraphs to Leopold's penguin waddle walk cycle just sucks. It's awful, robotic, and still manages to be weak.\n\n[h1]\"Forgive an old man his flights of fancy.\"[/h1]\n[i]-Sir Dullahan[/i]\n\nBut here's the real clincher, here's what really ties it all together into a package that I'm fairly sure I'll never return to and I can't bring myself to recommend:\n\nIt's a good 15-25% slower than it should be. From the gameplay to plain walking, just getting from A to B takes longer than it should. In a pitch black game, with a worthless map, that consists of mostly finding your way from A to B and that's not even adding in that for all the game's talk of parrying and dodging the combat quickly devolves into just baiting attacks and spamming heavy attack. \n\nThere's no tactics here. No thoughtful strategizing or emphasis on character builds. It just wastes your time.\n\nSo honestly, no, it wasn't that fun. Malebolgia has its moments, and it had its chance, but it let it slip with some core design decisions that just reduce that brilliant story, presentation, and level cohesion into something that's just kind of a chore and eyesore to play.\n\n[i]On a fairly tangential note, I have no idea what procs these achievements. They just popped up at random, apart from maybe the final one. I couldn't tell you what I did to earn them. One for looking at a statue, two at once for spawning at a clock, one for returning to look at a body in a bathtub, I don't know.

I enjoyed this game for the most part. \n\nThe visuals are beautiful and very clever.  I really enjoyed the striking contrast of the colours with the simplistic polygon style.  Malebolgia comes off as clean and never overpowering or crowded. I loved the use of light and the torchlight really lent itself to the atmosphere.  I particularly enjoyed as the game progressed through the acts, the atmosphere became darker without being too obvious.  If there's any critique to be made, I feel that Leopold's model could play with light and shadow a little better, as he was a bit awkward looking at times.  I also understand that it's much more difficult to have light interact with dynamic objects though, so I am not too bothered. I also thought that important NPC's could have more defined models, as some of them share models with regular monsters.\n\nI enjoyed the OST for this game.  Very atmospheric and well done. I also enjoy a game that can appreciate  silence as  important in setting tone for a scene or area.\n\nNarrative is great.  I enjoy games that don't necessarily hand you the entire plot. The game trusts the player to remember small details and connect the dots themselves. The pacing is good, apart from the one of the last portions of the game, where it requires you to set specific things on fire.  I thought this was so out of place, especially right after a big boss battle. It was easily the poorest part of the game in terms of pacing and mechanic. \n\nGameplay is good. It differs from Dark Souls in that there is no customization or weapon/armour collection. The fighting system is particularly simple, probably because it takes a great deal of work to code this type of game. This game can be quite difficult if the player isn't acquainted  with Dark Souls style gameplay.  I found it to be a bit too easy at times, as some mobs could be defeated by backstepping > attack > backstep > etc. I didn't utilize the block function very often. I found it frustrating that I couldn't unsheathe my weapon unless there was a mob around, and that when fighting multiple enemies, I couldn't choose which one I wanted to target with ease.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Malebolgia and I look forward to seeing future projects from this game dev.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457463514, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457464093, "recommendationid": "21713705", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519845", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481509405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 202, "playtime_forever": 125, "steamid": "76561198064850410", "num_games_owned": 1931}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1]Teal Deer[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Developers:[/b] Jochen Mistiaen \n[*][b]Publishers:[/b] Jochen Mistiaen \n[*][b]Initial release:[/b] May 2015\n[*][b]Genre:[/b] Atmospheric, Adventure, Action, Creepy\n[*][b]#Worth/NotWorth:[/b] #Nah\n[*][b]BSERC[/b] - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): Cel-shaded and clunky dark room exploration very clearly inspired by Dank Souls, eh eghm-- [i]excuse me, [/i]I mean Dark Souls.  \n[/list]\n[h1]Exposition, Concurrence and Summation[/h1]\n\nThere isn't much to say about [b]Malebolgia.[/b] The inspiration is written on its sleeve so to speak. \n\nI like this game, [i]aesthetically.[/i] Mechanically it's very clunky.

The character is a commander of a pre-industrial country that must come to terms with the impact his life's choices have made, whether he is alive or not. All manner of great demons, ghosts and people of his past inhabit the palace, yet it is dark, quiet and horrifically lonely. The lighting and setting in the game are above par, complimenting the flat-shaded look of the environment and cast - a candle flicker illuminates a three-story statue in a haunting way, for instance. The haunting and beautiful music is the perfect pairing to this look -- sparse and finely played piano and low, grinding melodies that echo throughout. All of the paths are carefully thought out and the palace changes per each victory, making the large structures even larger with new paths to explore.\n\nThis game is constantly referred to as a \"Dark Souls clone\", which I think the developer can wear with pride (imagine being compared to with one of the greatest games available today!) but it is his singular vision that made this game much more than its parts.

Ultimately, it boils down to the incessant pausing that occurs throughout combat. It makes the combat frustrating and clunky.\n\nCombat works fairly simply: a basic weapon attack, a strong weapon attack, and an attack with your torch. A lot of the combat is built around the timing and maneuvering of your attacks versus the enemy's. Reading their attack signals is important as it lets you know to move out of the way or try to time your block. Okay, it's all fine so far. That's not a bad system. The game also seems to try to add a claustrophobic tension by having you fight often in cramped quarters versus large opponents. Again, a fairly neat idea.\n\nWhere it falls apart for me, however, is the way that all strikes and blocks cause the action to freeze for what feels like nearly a half a second. There's no obvious beneficial reason for this pause--my best conjecture is that it's an \"action-enhancing\" effect--but it results in some serious complications regarding the combat. As the combat revolves around the timing of attacks and blocks, these pauses inhibit my ability to \"feel\" the timing. Take a common scenario: I attack, but my opponent has also begun its attack animation. I feel that I can still block it once my attack animation finishes. However, successfully landing the strike has caused the pause effect to happen. I now have miliseconds to successfully trigger a block, but now, instead of timing it from the beginning of the attack animation, I have to time it from the end of the pause, which creates an even shorter window and that's if I manage to guess when the pause ends. The typical result of all of this is me missing my window and taking yet another hit.\n\nI suppose if my attacks broke the enemy attack animation, there wouldn't be a problem, but they don't. Also, I'm sure that there are those of you out there who are able to compensate for the pause and still pull of the block. I'm not saying no one can do it. I'm saying I can't. I tried to get better at it, but it ended up just making me mad.\n\nThere's some very cool ideas in here, and I really wanted to expore more, but I don't like to spend my free time doing things that make me mad. I know I've got less than 2 hours of play time on the game, but that's split over three play sessions, each of which had to end when I found myself actually yelling at the screen. (And no, that's not a common occurrence for me.) This left me with an upleasant experience and as a result I can't, in good faith, recommend the title.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1465676716, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1465676716, "recommendationid": "23508560", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511759", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454169025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561197993368913", "num_games_owned": 1071}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I can see what they were trying to do with this game.

Sadly, the controls are way too clunky for paces it puts you through. Movement is very basic and the controls match, you have a Lock-On button, Guard and Attack button. The game falls apart when it comes to combat, your guard and attack buttons won't do anything unless you're locked onto an enemy, this is bad because there's some enemy attacks (grabs) which will automatically break your guard, and locking back on doesn't always work. All of your attacks are slow and cumbersome and you don't get a dodge roll. Dying in the game doesn't feel like you messed up, but rather the character didn't do what you wanted it to which is frustrating at best. \n\nOther than that the art and sound create a great atmosphere but the palace itself is too copy and paste, and rooms get reused a lot, leading you to become lost easily. Animations on everything are also very poor and look incredibly amature. With a little extra polish the game could be a nice little jem. As it stands I can't recommend it.
