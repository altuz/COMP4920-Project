I never finished it as a kid because I was too scared of the temple segment. I finished it today in under 4 hours. \n\nThe game itself is a point and click adventure game like other games in the Nancy Drew series. Nancy Drew is a detective so you solve puzzles and mysteries in the case. The premise of this game was that Nancy had just begun her internship at Beech Hill museum in Washington DC when a prized carving of King Pacal is stolen from a display case in the museum. The thief leaves behind a scarlet hand print. All the action of the game takes place in the museum as well as a metro system which can take you to two offices, a hotel and a hospital. This is not a big game. It isn't as big as other Nancy Drew games I've played.\n\nThe game isn't scary in hindsight. Some other Nancy Drew games are beyond creepy but this game is an escape from creepiness. \n\nThe Mayan history is very interesting but it is tedious when you have to remember facts about certain people for the quizzes in the temple.\n\nGraphics and gameplay: the graphics are quite atrocious but it doesn't hamper gameplay. This game was made before they gave Nancy a cellphone; so to read the journal for hints or phone someone you must return to the hotel which is tedious.\n\nThis game isn't the best Nancy Drew game. But it was the first that I played and that counts for something. Pick this up cheap on Steam if you want a nostalgia kick or a fun and challenging short game."}]}
