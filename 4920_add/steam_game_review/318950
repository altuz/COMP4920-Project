I got this game because my girlfriend asked me to purchase it.  I love the movie Tangled, but modern Disney games are usually a miss.  This game plays pretty much like a Lego game if you've ever played one of those.  Rapunzel collects orbs and Flynn collects coins.  You use teamworks to navigate the world and you run into some of the characters from the movie.  Quite a bit of exploration.  I noticed that you have to wait until you begin the game in order to access the graphics options, which is odd.  I also noticed that, if you are playing two players, 1st player is always Rapunzel and 2nd Flynn.  I also noticed that 1st player always has to use the keyboard to move, which can be a bit tricky.  This is unfortunate as my girlfriend wants to play Rapunzel, as I am sure many daughters do as well, but has no experience with keyboard-gaming.  Luckily, she is a fast-learner and caught on quickly, but I can see this being a potential problem.\n\nAll-in-all, if you like the Lego gameplay and the world of Rapunzel, give it a shot.  Especially if you have a younger daughter or want a co-op game to play with the Mrs.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501022746, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501022746, "recommendationid": "33796586", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505494", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 6}}
