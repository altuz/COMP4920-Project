It looks like I'm going to find all sorts of nifty ways to use my character classes.  I mean, the way the dialog and story line is written out, it's exciting and fun how your team interacts with each other and the world, how you gain and lose reputation.  It's a fun juggling romp which makes you feel connected to actual entities in space, which not a lot of games are so fluent in creating.  I love the setting, I love the relationship of the corporations and how every class has been written in with their own personalities.  \n\nAtmospherically and contextually, and other big words, Starcrawlers is so easy to sink into.  The classes are a great blend of sci-fi persona with both traditional and original concepts.  I think the Psykers are very cool yin and yang ideas.  All together this game looks to be amazingly well rounded, and it is a blast to start getting your toes wet in the crawl.\n\nThen hours later, unfortunately you start to realize things aren't making sense.  As I have progressed, I start looking at these skill trees up and down and going, \"What the hell?\".  The abilities are all just about doing the same thing, damage this way, damage that way, but hardly any of them make a difference.  I hate to say this, but they are all just different spellings of doing the same thing.  Doing damage with different presentations.  \n\nThere seems to be somewhat strong identities from class to class, but I'm not seeing how they're being used to they're full potential.  For instance, the Cyberninja has the ability \"Ambush\", which is on the 1st tree, 2nd tier, and takes advantage of enemies who are BLINDED.  That's great!  So look around and see what other abilities cause BLIND....  Uhhh.. ok I see one... It's the \"Shadowfall\" ability that's on the 3rd tree, 5th tier?!\n\nSo I'd have to master tree 3 before I could strategically use a very young branch from another.  With that kind of logic (or lack there of) that practically forces me to focus on tree 3 before anything else, which in this is example is merely something considerably minor.. right?\n\nWell... maybe that's not so much of a big deal.  Maybe it's a matter of finding skills that cause BLINDNESS from other classes.  That would be cool!  That would really make the cohesion of the team work together!  Let's see... nope.. nope.. nope AH, Void Psyker!  He/She has some tricks for that.  Great...  But that's it?  Seriously, of my whole team (discluding Soldier and Engineer thus far) I only see one or two classes that barely utilize this debuff.  It's not just that, there seems to be a lack of noticeable relation to each other.  As if they're just put there as a decal.\n\nNow looking at all these other conditions like Dazed, Charmed, Confused, Stunned... and VULNERABLE... whatever the hell that means?  You see what I'm getting at? These buffs and debuffs, to me, appear aimlessly scattered around.  You look through it all and you find a HUGE lack of correlation between skills.  The Smuggler is a prime example of this with its traps.  Just random outcomes and no follow through.  What does the Smuggler do, or for that matter, any other class or weapon, that can take advantage of these effects?\n\nBut maybe I'm barking up the wrong \"tree\". (pun intended) What about the elements? Besides debuffs, you have an array of \"elemental\" damage types, (Fire, Force, Nanite, Void, Corrosion... am I missing any?) but what difference do they make besides a name? How am I gonna know what I'm guarding against or, like others have mentioned, what makes one armor or shield more useful than another?  It's not completely without effect, fire burns, and corrosion melts armor I guess, and maybe the others have their own nature, but hell if I know?  THERE IS NOTHING, NO GUIDE, NOT EVEN A PROPER WIKI that is going to explain any of this to you.  \n\nI would say it's it's all just random, but I can't because I don't know.  Many of these trees, from top to bottom, have nothing to offer that consist of any strategy.  It's just damaging, straightforward and no kind of tandem to speak of.  Some skills make other skills obsolete and pointless.  Just previous lame versions you trade out.  And mixing two trees is just as sterile.  Using the Smuggler as an example again, he/she has a trap mine that damages all or most enemies once triggered... well, in the Gunslinger tree there's \"Trick Shot\", and what does it do?  Damages up to three targets, which, most of the time, that's the magic enemy number.  They both use the damage type of your weapon.  If you want to spend all day trying to figure out what makes those two any different, or reason as to why you're \"building\" a character in any form or fashion, you're going to get ridiculously frustrated.  It's pointless... that's my point.\n\nIt's all broken, or never assembled really.  \n\nThe only part of this game that I have found any strategy with at all is TIMING, and it's one repeated pattern. Simply put, BUFF allies and infect enemies with Hacker, let everyone else unleash their \"skills\" (multi-colored damage output) and when you want to really laugh at them, pull another Hacker trick by speeding up a teammate. and he gets to cut in line.  This works great when you time your timing, (LOL) and you pull one member in for a finisher.\n\nThat's my next subject... The Cyberninja and Prototype overkill.  Want to make sure you always have the upper hand?  \"Acid Rain\" and \"Overcharge\" are ridiculous trump cards.  That's all I'll say about that.\n\nSo I think that's all I need to say for my 2 cents.  I'm gonna thumbs down this game.  I hope that it will encourage the developers to think about putting as much thought into the mechanics as they have into the world.  I love the atmosphere and I love the just about everything this game presents except for this big stump.  It just seems unfinished.  I don't quite understand the high rating of this game unless they were made in the first 6 hours of playing.  It's such a beautiful game with so many enticing elements.  I think people must have the same idea as I had, that you're adventuring and exploring and finding gear, and maybe you're not sure about how it all fits together yet, but that's part of the adventure is finding out later.  Well... I'm sorry to say this but there's a major disappointment ahead.  The only thing to figure out is how many times you'll pay to reset all your ability points before realizing you're not working with a full bag of tricks.  \n\nThis is what bugs me, again, the elements are there but are not being used!  So because I actually DO believe in this game.. I mean.. I'm ready for the REAL VERSION.. whether that be a complete overhaul update (which would be nice) or STARCRAWLERS 2 (which should happen anyway) ...I'm going to give some suggestions to the Juggernaut team.\n\nPLEASE, finish the combat system.  All it would take is a little TLC.  Make the skills stand out.  Give the crawlers abilities that work in conjunction with each other so you can really use the timing of your crew in different ways.  I'm sure this was the goal in the first place, but I know what happened... the engineer for the skill system and stats mechanics was abducted by space worms as you were nearing the end of the kickstarter campaign... these things happen.\n\nLook at this crappy review by me and... understand I represent the common, and not all that successful of a gamer ...consider the outline of what I and others have identified about your product and take some pride in your creation!  I can shamelessly give this game a thumbs up in my heart.  It's got the soul of something that could be the foundation of a continuing epic.  \n\nAnyway, I'm going to keep going at it, maybe I'll figure a little more out and get to the end of the story.  Maybe.. be nice to come back to it working right. -J", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505257276, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505305119, "recommendationid": "34909893", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493137", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 214, "total_reviews": 238, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 24}}
