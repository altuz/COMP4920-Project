I love the Nancy Drew games but this is one of the worst games in the series. The plot is not well done, it's like 3 weak subplots smooshed together to make the 'mystery'. The characters were strange and unlikeable, the puzzles were lackluster, and the ending was awful. \n\nProbably the one fun thing about this game was being able to play as Frank and Joe Hardy. Plus the graphics were nice and I could appreciate the fact that when this game came out the graphics would have been fairly cutting edge for a ND game. \n\nOverall this game feels like the production of it was rushed and not a lot of effort was put into it. I'm really surprised that Her Interactive would release a game this bad. There are much, much better games in the series and I would reccomend pretty much any of them over this one. Unless you are a Nancy Drew fan and really want to play every title in the series, I would skip this one."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1409699349, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505896", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11962425", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198148917472", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1431580831, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 248}, "timestamp_updated": 1409699349, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Another great Nancy Drew game!

They're excellent point-and-click adventure games with a kooky sense of humor, fun minigames, and great puzzles. However, this one was hands-down my least favorite of the series. \n\nPlot: There was very little? The game focuses too strongly on the mechanism of being both Nancy and the Hardy Boys (which is fun, sure, but not enough to carry the game), and not enough time is spent unraveling the plot. Instead of letting the player put all the pieces together, the answer is just dumped on you in several minutes of exposition at the end of the game. \n\nMinigames: There were three. An arcade game version of rock paper scissors (seriously,) making shell necklaces according to a pattern (you have to acquire the shells by either wandering the beach/scuba diving for the rest of your life, or buy them from the little store. Some necklaces cannot be completed without purchasing items, which was boring), and fishing. Yes. Fishing. You click the horizon. Wait for the bobber to drop. Click the bobber. Bam, fish. That was the whole thing. \n\nPuzzles: There were a number of puzzles, which ranged from busy work (separate insect parts from seeds and count them, do math, write up a chart), to \"push buttons in order that you saw them in the hallway,\" to \"make one hundred snow cones for some guy until he tells you you did it right.\" None of these were especially entertaining or needed much use of your mind to complete them. At the end there is a completely nonsensical puzzle where you guide one of the Hardy Boys to jump onto a stone pathway... and he dissapears and reappears randomly around the pathway? That's not... how pathways work? I don't understand. \n\nSnooping/Exploring: There was very little! Most of the locations are just long pathways to click through. I want to rummage through people's desks and sneak into their bedrooms, but we don't really get to do that much at all in this game. \n\nCharacters: Nancy Drew usually has a variety of colorful, weird, kooky characters. This time? We have an angry guy, a rambling woman who is more annoying than charming, and a guy and his daughter who play the parts of Stereotypical Hawaiian Native and Stereotypical Surfer Girl. \n\nAlso... this game did not age well at all. Even the updated version for steam was... yikes."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1388278682, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500172", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8382612", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198048939823", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1387413667, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 233}, "timestamp_updated": 1388278682, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A blast from my past!

I absolutely love the Nancy Drew games, and I grew up on Maui, so I thought \"Hey, I love Her Interactive, they haven't let me down before, and I miss Maui and my family, it'd be nice to have a little reminder of home. This'll be perfect for me, right?!\". But, no. I was wrong. So wrong.\n\nI had actually bought a physical copy of this game when it first came out. However, I was still in Maui at that time, and I had a bunch of other ND titles I still hadn't played yet, so it got put off. And eventually I moved, one of the discs got lost somewhere along the way, and I couldn't play it. Recently, I got some birthday money, I found that the ND games were starting to be put on STEAM, and I thought \"Oh, perfect! I'll FINALLY be able to play it!!\" But the hype was short-lived. The searching for shells, the fishing, making necklaces, etc. were nice and calming, but they got boring and tedious very fast. ND characters are usually all so vibrant, varied, and interesting, so at first I thought these ones would be the same, especially with the interesting concept introduced at the very beginning of doing stuff, getting novelty money, doing more stuff, and repeat. I mean, it wasn't the most fun, but it was an interesting concept at least.\n\nI thought they could really do something cool with Big Mike, make him some sort of eccentric dude with interesting gimmicky get rich quick schemes, but super chill and working on trying not to force his values on his daughter. As for Pua, I thought they'd explore her relationship with her father more, give her more of a personality. I thought she'd have more of a local girl with a passion for surfing, but other interests as well. Instead, I got a stereotypical surfer girl who does nothing but eat, sleep, dream, and breathe, surfing.\n\nBut, even after all that disappointment, I still held out hope. I was hoping that if nothing else, the ending would be interesting. Perhaps they'd somehow make it where KIM was actually the culprit? Her Interactive is usually really good at making completely unseeable twists at the end. And...again, I was disappointed. The \"culprit\" was so painfully obvious from the beginning, but I thought it was just going to be a classic Her Int. rug pull trick of \"here's a super suspicious person, it's so obvious that they did it, but...psyche! Hah, nah fam, they did all these things for completely unrelated reasons. It was actually this other dude. The actual culprit saw how suspicious they were and used it to try to frame them.\" Nope. Not even close. Honestly, Nancy could've solved the case just by skipping everything, opening the locked box with the map {just her being the curious person she is, and being so close to a locked box that's just out in the open, in plain sight}, getting snorkel equipment, and following it.\n\nAnd I'm not even going to get started on those painful frass puzzles.\n\nThis game is frass.\n\nI'm sorry, I really wanted to like it, truly I did, but I just couldn't.\n\nThe minigames weren't even good, and those are usually the saving grace of otherwise boring ND titles.\n\nIs there any way to get a refund?
