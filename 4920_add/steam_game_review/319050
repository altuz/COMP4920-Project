It is sad to admit there are very few active players, it's true, but the game has a more or less solid AI, that will be brought upon you in both pve campaigns (realms) and pvp duels (if another player doesn't show up in 5 minutes), and since the game is turn based you can still play a compatitive league with other players making your turns at any time of the day you find yourself able to (asynchronous games).\n\nThe game has two main mods:\n[b]Chaos mode[/b] - the original way this game is ment to be played: all your actions (atacks/spells) have a chanve to succed or fail, if they succed you instakill the chosen opponent, if they fail - well, nothing happens on screen, while off screen you will probably have a little real life drama.\n\nand [b]Law mode[/b] - the lame (imho) mode added to soften the butthert of whiners who find it too hard to cope with a game that takes a fresh look at the turn based strategy concept, and hence requers a fresh way of thinking from the player. I mean: this is your avarage turn based strategy mode where every unit has a health bar, your spells use mana, the succes of your atacks is guaranteed, while their impact depend on your damage.\n\nAt this point both modes are properly balanced and fun to play in both pvp and pve. The only drawback of this game is the lack of a propper single player campaign (which is justified by both the game's lore and the fact it was initially a pvp game), so all the pve is done through series of standalone maps.\n\nIf you like classic and challenging turn based strategies that dont put you on rails and let you find your own way of being cool, you should give this one a try.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505512128, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505512360, "recommendationid": "34982013", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495213", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 365, "total_reviews": 486, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 121}}
