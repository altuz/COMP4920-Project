Its so fun because there is no violence and has helpful features to make it through easier. The dialougue is real snazzy becuase it makes me feel like i am actually talking to my favorite princesses!!!! The cutscenes even include my character with voice acting too!! The magic commands are simple, they have pleasant animations like the twirl one thats my favvvv ^w^ I like how the tasks dont demand any rush and leaves you to explore all you want. Turning the poor little imps back into sprites is so uplifting and so is helping out all of my bffs throughout the story. Plus running around the locations makes me really very happy because i get to twirl around with the wand and look at all the sparkles, I could do it all day!!\nAnother thing, the gems(currency) are super easy to pick up and theyre very pretty also. I am able to buy the cutest dresses and lots of stuffz for my room. Again the setting is impressive as it mirrors those from the movies and the castle puts everything together well, serving as a good starting point for the chapters. Everything is like a dream come true because everytime I get to a new place I never ever want to leave itttt \nThe visuals to me are reminiscent of renderware or similar software from a previous era which I find aesthetically pleasing. You cant die which saves time, just roam around and focus on doing favours while looking forward to going shoppingggg on the side (: This type of adventure format is simple yet affective, especially with some imagination. I personally would not want the graphics any other way, despite what other reviewers think. DPMFA is a cool videogame to play for any age because it is family-friendly. \n10/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498204000, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498204000, "recommendationid": "32669856", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507783", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505221267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 24292, "steamid": "76561198088517041", "num_games_owned": 241}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "i have had this ontop of my wishlist for many years and it is great to finaly be able to play this game. lets just say that the hype has not let me down.\nthis game is fantastic and will make u nut evry time you twirl the crystals out of the bush\n\n\ni rate this automobile 8.6 out of 10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498377837, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498377837, "recommendationid": "32761292", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504862", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506142101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 105, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 583, "steamid": "76561198055479610", "num_games_owned": 41}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "My Granddaughter luved it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498798633, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498798633, "recommendationid": "33023151", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500892", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 31, "total_reviews": 36, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
