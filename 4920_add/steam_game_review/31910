Terrible graphics and random, non related puzzles. Not even kind of creepy. The plot is really simple, no tiwsts at all. It has this weird confusing third person map that you have to use to get around. Overall, there was almost nothing I enjoyed about completing this game. Not to say I don't usually love these games, but I would definitely go for a different one"}]}
