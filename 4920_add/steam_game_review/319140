The graphics are good, the music is great. The challenge isn't incredible, but the gameplay is rather solid. Why don't I recommend this? It crashes about once every 20 minutes, and hard-locks if I try to enable controller support. Playing with the keyboard is awful with the default keys, and without a controller, pretty much impossible to play as well as intended/possible. With no dev support to fix these issues, I can't recommend giving them any money for this game.\n\nThe boss is interesting, starting with simplistic controls and graduating to more and more complex patterns, but it depends on personal taste as to whether that's a good thing to you or not.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506299124, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506299124, "recommendationid": "35193486", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505841856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 243, "steamid": "76561198117625637", "num_games_owned": 149}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "you murder hundreds of aliens on their home worlds to find a warp core to go home. 6/10 IGN", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505841845, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505841845, "recommendationid": "35068884", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506280190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561198066952119", "num_games_owned": 66}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nice and sweet designed but in gameplay extremely optionless hard button smasher, lead to frusturation when you are not skilled and lucky enough to master the bosses.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506280527, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506280527, "recommendationid": "35188820", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505456182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561198026993658", "num_games_owned": 533}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "NOPE!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505456353, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505456353, "recommendationid": "34965350", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472844", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 181, "total_reviews": 247, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 66}}
