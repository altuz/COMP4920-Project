The correct answer is \"an axe wielding, full plated dwarfen warrior\".\n\nAre you an axe wielding, full plated dwarfen warrior? No, you are not.\n\nInstead you are a wizard, most likely human. I don't know for sure. It's just that dwarves usually are not that much into magic. All you have is a piece of wood without anykind of blade or hammerhead on it. And your fullplate is all wavy, soft and entirely made of cloth?! \nIt doesn't really make sense to me.\n\nWhat is the appeal of being a oh my god what just happened when you put this runes on this piece of wood and on the robe?! \nA laser beam that homes in on targets around corners?!\nA ball of ice that splits into even more balls of ice?!\nA shield that blocks harmfull projectiles, that charges just by walking around?!\nA ball that can bounce through walls, but doesn't do anything else? ...okay, thats useless. But the other stuff, thats pretty awesome.\n\nWell, not everyone can be a proud dwarven warrior. But sometimes you have to go with what you got, and you, you're a wizard.
