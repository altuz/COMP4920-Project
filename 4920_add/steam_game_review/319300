Definitely worth the buck fifty I paid for it.  I'm not sure I would have paid more than a couple dollars though, considering how basic the game is.  Wait for it to be on sale, then nab it!\nBasically, the game amounts to this: \"How many moving pieces can you manage at the same time?\"  You've got trains running all over the place and you need to work the signals, throw the switches, stop the traffic, etc to make sure all of your trains arrive at the right station...without colliding, derailing, and exploding!  Some of the maps are pretty easy, but a few are quite hectic.  Overall, it's an amusing little game.\n\nP.S. I hear that this game (or something quite similar) is free on Android...but I guess that only helps if you've got a smartphone and/or don't mind gaming on a stupid 4\" wide touchscreen.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419903434, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1419903434, "recommendationid": "13702768", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506130", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1428313316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 329, "steamid": "76561197998886660", "num_games_owned": 748}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "As you can see i have played the game for 5 hours and all completed\n\nGood diversion for a brain teaser.  Many of the later levels will need to be played dynamically, you will need to replay multiple times to work out planning so there is no sitting back and studying the rail plan until you have at least seen the trains run at least once to see where they go.  The game steps up difficulty very nicely introducing new problems as you progress through the levels.\n\nOnly downsides i found with the game is it appears to be mobile game and i felt it was overpriced for the enjoyment.  This game would be better suited to $1 or $2 market.\nThe PC port has a few issues the mouse not clicking to select the four countries available, although once you are in the game there is no problem with the mouse.  Only way i have found to resolve this is to restart the game.\nThe only other issue is some of the edge tracks do not appear on the screen which caused me issues a few times until i got used to looking more carefully.\n\nThis game is based on the Android and Apple App Game called Train Crisis so if you have the option you can check that out as a demo to ensure you like the game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428314245, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428314245, "recommendationid": "15232559", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500353", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423302750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 390, "steamid": "76561198097680485", "num_games_owned": 156}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Cool & pretty small puzzle game. \n\nGo for it if your looking for a bunch of brainstorming & reflex challenges. \n(Oh and a lot of funny train's crashs and end of course retries ;)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423290177, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423290177, "recommendationid": "14364025", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497367", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421796700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 37, "steamid": "76561198049538850", "num_games_owned": 222}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Funny.
