This is not the case anymore as it launched and we were able to host a server with no problems.\n\nWith that said, it's a clunky mess filled with bugs, falling out of bounds, money dupes, spelling errors, and a confusing gear system. But just because it's a bad game doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable.\n\nI bought two copies of CHAOS for $0.79 to play with a friend and I think it was worth it. The dungeons and mobs are slighty bland but still offers a decent challenge. Because of this I'd recommend playing it with at least one other person.\n\n6.5/10 would fall through the floor again", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499994517, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499994517, "recommendationid": "33525497", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503690", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 10}}
