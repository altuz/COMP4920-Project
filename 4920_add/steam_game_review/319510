If a horror game scares you, remember it doesn't mean it's a good game. The game puts you in a cramped space where you can be ambushed anytime and could be jumpscared anytime. Of course you'd be scared but the game doesn't earn it. Eventually playing it gets tedious and annoying really. Also the lore is not great. Like the area of a Chuckie Cheese like area is a great environment but the \"hidden plot\" is still quite bland and I bet Scott Cawton just read a bunch of fan theorises to get the lore for the later games.
