I used to always get top 10 in leaderboard everytime I played, I was a beast.. untill hackers started doing their thing and the leaderboard was then filled with impossible scores. and now the leaderboard doesnt even have anybody elses scores in it and it says im playiing on an apple phhone (definatly what windows 10 is). its rediculous how far downhill this game has gone. I used to love it a ton, now its worthless!It would have been a relevant purchase if you got it at its peak... now though... without competition there are original flashgames that are equal to this\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499923382, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499923382, "recommendationid": "33495784", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499630", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 348, "total_reviews": 399, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 51}}
