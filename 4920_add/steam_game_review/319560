This game finally fills that void. It feels JUST like Populous 1 & 2 combined into a Populous 1 Deluxe version. You probably wont be disappointed with it for the cost. It takes about 9 or so levels until it really gets going and then you're addicted all over again. I hope future updates will allow for an even larger area to play, and maybe some graphics adjustments. I get the retro look, but I honestly would like an alternate semi-modern/semi-retro sprites with maybe double the current resolution. Don't get me wrong, huge thumbs up. I love this game so far! I'm about 20-30 levels in and there are a TON to play, and spells to gain.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499824625, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499824625, "recommendationid": "33469573", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508102", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 142, "total_reviews": 181, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 39}}
