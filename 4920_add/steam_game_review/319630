Definitely. Cuz it let you know the very reality is the best that can ever happen to you. [/h1]\n\nCharacters 9/10: Really got myself immersed into this. The characters are so vivid and convincing I feel Im just Max and they just live around me. I love Max\u2019s love and hate her hate.  The time she [spoiler]kissed Warren[/spoiler] I fell love with this girl. Although some of the characters felt a little bit too characteristic I could always find someone similar in real life. Nerd, geek, rockstar, bully, hippie, every school has them right? I don't give it a full mark becuz I feel the transitions of some characters are too abrupt. Trust me you cannot guess who\u2019s the real hero and villain until the last chapter. You can say it makes the story more dramatic but I think more hints and clues are needed to make it more reasonable. \n\nStory 10/10: Story is riveting. Romance, murder, mystery, bully, time-manipulation, you can find almost every popular element in the game. Many turning points in the story, you will not have the reality(or is there a reality?) until the end. Atmosphere is great. Conversations are rich, pretty much every character has their own personality. The rhyme of the game is tense, which really got me into the story. Cant remember how many times I got moved by the game. The only flaw I saw is in the last chapter Max told Chloe to explain everything to her when they came back to the past. Previous time rewinding never took away Max\u2019s memory. Maybe I got it wrong I dunno. \n\nGraphics 7/10: Mediocre for a game produced in 2013, but it is compensated by its art style. \n\nArt 10/10: The art style is kinda like a combo of cartoon and oil painting, which really appeals to my taste. \n\nAudio performance 10/10: Great soundtrack. Every time Max sat down somewhere reflecting I chose to spend a bit more time enjoying the music. The voice acting is amazing too. \n\nGameplay 7/10: This is basically a avg so you cant ask for much gameplay. The time rewinding is cool and you will find out it is way more than save/load. But few things other than that. \n\nOptimization 8/10: Ran smoothly on my pc until crash several times in the last chapter. Guess the storm was taking the optimization away. \n\n[spoiler]\nThe first time this game struck a chord with me was when I saw Kate(oh little Katie Im sooo sorry I let you die) was taking fluoxetine. Always wanting to be the best and perfect, I developed deep anxiety and depression when I was in graduate school. Countless times I just wanted to quit, to give up everything I had to hide in some place where I could take the courage to face my real self. Thank God I still have games with me. From The Witcher, I learned what the world needs is not hero, but professional. From The Dark Souls, I learned there is always hope as long as you don't give up. From To The Moon, I know love is love, which cannot be altered by time, space, everything. There are just so many examples I cant enumerate them all, and they encouraged me to keep my head held up. When I screwed up something in the past, I always wished I could have the power to go back and fix it, or maybe the next morning I would wake up finding every trouble was just a dream and now I lived in a different time line from that imperfect me. Now from Life Is Strange, I truly understand the meaning of \u201cpresent is a gift\u201d; I believe there is no \u201cbetter choice\u201d and the reality is the best that can ever happen to me; I know I will always come back, not necessarily with a better me, but a happier me. Thank you Geralt, thank you Vito, thank you the Ashen One, thank you Warren, Chloe, and Max, I know you will always have my back.\n[/spoiler]\n\nOverall The number of times I shed tears/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506445291, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506445291, "recommendationid": "35225790", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554998", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505635910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 718, "steamid": "76561198079300310", "num_games_owned": 145}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'd heard about this game since a few weeks after Episode 1 came out way back in 2015, at the time, I didn't decide to pick it up because I didn't think it was the game for me. It didn't appeal to me at the time. 2 years later, only a short while after Before the Storm was released, I decided to see what this game was about. I had always known that this game was considered by most to be one of the best of its kind and in some peoples opinion, one of the best of all time. Now that I've played through all 5 episodes I must say, I can see why this game has been praised for what it is. I enjoyed almost everything about this game. It was probably the first \"Choices Matter\" game that I've played where the choices really feel that way.\n\nThis game was an emotional rollercoaster which actually had me tearing up in the end. I came into the game expecting it to be good, maybe even great, it exceeded all my expectations. The story was so rich and enjoyable I almost didn't want it to end, very rarely do I think that about games. The soundtrack was beatiful and really added to the games atmosphere and the emotional output it conveyed. The characters felt real (to an extent) and lovable, most of them, if not all were three-dimensional meaning there were no characters you really were bored of or didn't care for. If anything was wrong with this game it would be perhaps some of the more overdramatic moments but even they felt believable.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that this in my opinion is one of the best games I have ever played, I don't know if I can say top 10, but definitely in that area. This game won't be for everyone and that's alright, people are allowed to have their own opinion, but I emplore you to try this game, it's cheap and even more so on sales. If you don't play Life is Strange, there is a good chance that you will have missed out on something you might never experience in a game ever.\n\nI am also eager to see what they do with the Second season which they recently announced.\nWell, that's my experience with Life is Strange.
