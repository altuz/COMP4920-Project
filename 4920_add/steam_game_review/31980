I had to turn it off. And, with very little human communication in this game, I played in silence. The plot was as flat as you can get. The ending was predictable.

It seemed to be that I'd struggle with one, struggle, rage, struggle, finally get it only to stumble upon an even harder puzzle. \n\nNow that I've returned to playing the games, I'm glad to see more diversity with the difficulty of the puzzles. It seems to be more of a mixed bag when it comes to Ransom of the Seven Ships. I was able to solve several puzzles on my own - only two I had to consult walk throughs for. \n\n\u2665 Driving a golf cart? Scuba Diving?\n\nSign me up! I found it a lot of fun to be able to zip around the island (though the car goes rather slow) and be able to explore underwater for things. I actually tried three times and was able to find the Easter Egg buried under some coral.\n\nHer Interactive placed focus on having the player explore the environment....and the ways they urged you to do so are fun, if not great. \n\n\u2665 The monkeys!\n\nI quite enjoyed playing mini games with the monkeys. There are three mini games that you can play and if you win, you may choose a reward such as a quest item, fruit to feed the parrot, or even silly things like eye patches and sea shells. \n\nSince the game can feel taxing with going here and there and everywhere, I appreciated the break that playing with the monkeys provided. \n\n\u2718 More like a chore than a game.\n\nThe main quality that I highly disliked of Ransom of the Seven Ships was how tasks would make you go all over the place. Is it fun to explore? Yes. Would I prefer only being able to investigate one place? Of course not. However it became extremely tedious...go here, do this, only to find out that I needed to go back to the beginning to get what I needed, then back again, etc. \n\nSure it tacks on to the amount of gameplay. However does it add on to the amount of fun? No. \n\n\u2718 Flat. Flat. Flat.\n\nWhen I first played this, I was so excited for George to appear. I love when Nancy Drew games branch out to involve other characters such as Bess, George, the Hardy Boys, etc. In this game you can interact with George or the beach bum. \n\nOkay? Cool! ...Not so. \n\nThe characters just felt so FLAT. I thought the history behind the treasure was interesting and enjoyed the puzzles, as challenging as they were, yet there seemed to be no connection between what happened and how the characters responded, aside from Nancy. Dialogue with George was more like a chore than a conversation...and the beach bum? Yawn. \n\nThe man's journal you find has a more interesting voice & detailed personality than the living AI do. \n\n\u2718 The twist is eh....?\n\nWhen it comes to the ending of the game, I felt it was quite flat compared to others in the series. The \"twist\" is only shocking if you have played the previous title that the antagonist was featured in. It didn't have quite the same effect on me, nor will it to others I imagine, who haven't played the game connected to this one. \n\nOverall I would only suggest playing Nancy Drew: Ransom of the Seven Seas if you are trying to play through the entire series. While it has some solid virtues, I feel like it fails to entertain, and finishing the main story feels more like a chore than anything else."}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1416832866, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500673", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "13066621", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198141546983", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1416805588, "num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 539}, "timestamp_updated": 1416833394, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you haven't played any Nancy Drew games do not play this one.I normally love all the Nancy Drew game but this one was terrible.
