This game has some great artwork better than the first two but that is the only positive i really found in the game. The story is okay, but it is incomplete and probably will never be finished as the developer has scraped the second part of the game.  Each of the three characters are now boring to play.  They have limited your skills, and there is no unlocks for the characters. The puzzles in this game feel really basic and takes no time to just walk through a level.  The hardest part about the game is controlling the 3D aspect of the game. The 3D just doesn't fit well in this game and/or just wasn't implemented right. I have been playing this with a friend and we both get more frustrated with the crappy controls and the 3D gameplay than anything else and we both wished it was more like the first two.\n\nTLDR\npros: \nNice Artwork\na start to a decent story\n\nCons:\nthe 3d was poorly implemented and awkward to navigate.\nthe characters have been over simplified\nthe puzzles have been simplified\nHalf a story with the second part being scraped by developer.\n\nOverall they just missed the mark on this one. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505936899, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505936899, "recommendationid": "35090994", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513546", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506795202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 577, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 577, "steamid": "76561198131118909", "num_games_owned": 127}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Amazing game!\nMaybe a bit overpriced for it length.Get it on sale and you wont regret.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506501920, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506521025, "recommendationid": "35238054", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506269734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 99, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 375, "steamid": "76561198069131067", "num_games_owned": 159}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The story is not complete but I enjoyed the moment i play this game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506270315, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506270315, "recommendationid": "35185112", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499810", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506264066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 304, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 304, "steamid": "76561197973858112", "num_games_owned": 177}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really can't understand all the negative reviews of this game...unless they all bought the game full price and really resented the $20 price-tag that much.\n\nI played and loved the first two Trine games and enjoyed this one all over again. Trine 3 might have had a few bugs and camera issues with multiple players, but nothing close to game-breaking, and it still has the same charm that the first two installments had.\n\nThe art style and levels are beautiful, the controls are responsive (not \"pinnacle of platfom gaming\" but still good) and as a co-op experience its a great 4-6 hours. It's a blast solving puzzles, whacking a few monsters, and exploring with 1-2\n\nThat being said, the only complaint I might have is that $20 is alot for a game of that length, but I bought it on sale. I rarely buy games full-price these days.
