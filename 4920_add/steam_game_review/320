The complete lack of ANY communication for TEN YEARS is completly disgusting, It is disrepectful to the fans who supported valve for years. Its sad that valve doesnt even have the courtesy to tell their fans that half life is dead. It is clear that we will never get a satisfying ending to an amazing story. I personally am not interested in anything valve has released since Episode 2, and if the single player story driven masterpieces of recent years are anything to go by, its that valve only cares about its games as service titles, and not their narative driven campaigns. I am deeply upset that we will never get to explore the atmospheric and exciting universe of half life again. Valve prides themselves on their independance and flat workplace structure, but its clear there is a lack of focus. Valve, like too many companies in the video games industry, seem to be too blinded on following the money, they have left behind those that got them there in the first place..."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505675144, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35030923", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198181136159", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1505677086, "num_games_owned": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 46}, "timestamp_updated": 1505675144, "received_for_free": false, "review": "PLS HL3"}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504683132, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492719", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "34771075", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038919367", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1506789562, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "playtime_forever": 28508}, "timestamp_updated": 1504683132, "received_for_free": false, "review": "WE WANT HALF LIFE 3"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505300542, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486959", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "34917277", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198031672864", "num_reviews": 69, "last_played": 1504704004, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 243}, "timestamp_updated": 1505300542, "received_for_free": false, "review": "goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO0OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO0OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOd.\n\n\n\n\ni dare someone to find the two zeros i hid in the O's."}]}
