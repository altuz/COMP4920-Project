The menu system that is meant to search out you music is entirely and utterly flawed. You can get it to work, it is just difficult, and will not do expansive libraries/folders for whatever reasoning, there is the limitation in file formats, etc. Maybe it works on Vista flawlessly, but the Windows market is already mainly on Windows 7 or Windows 8 these days for the majority.\n\nThe rest of the game works for me just fine, however, being limited to the game's default tracks makes replayability horrid and as is the game doesn't have any 'jazz' to its visuals and you just rotate your sphere of spheres on an axis to match incoming rays. Shallow as could be.\n\nAs I stated back in January in the community discussion for this game, unless you are looking for ideas from a dev perspective and find this on sale for under $1, I wouldn't recommend this game.\n\nIt sits in my library as a reminder to me, review and find solid ground for each purchase before making the purchase."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1393542841, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503828", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9284926", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198001716361", "num_reviews": 55, "last_played": 1393542661, "num_games_owned": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 16}, "timestamp_updated": 1393643088, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Quite a simple game, but I do not recommend this for the price it is offering.

There's a glitch in the game though, when the flower hits a certain size, the projectiles vanish for no reason as if it hit an object.
