Stay away from this frustrating title. This title doesn't teach math but depends on patience with the mechanics of the game interaction design (and there are different levels of frustration depending on what random game pukes up) and quick mathematical whit in the few instances they'll be encountering math problems\u2014meaning if you're not prepared to babysit your children as they get frustrated trying to get passed the quirky games and ask you to \"do that part\" for them stay away from this frustration of a title.\n\nAs soon as the game starts it prompts to select UK or US\u2014every. Damn. TIME! Every... Why that matters is beyond me because they all have British voices anyway which make some things they say not readily apparent (Cockney accents...seriously?)... the STUPID sound effects (I mean it will annoy you if you can hear it in the next room!) drown out important dialogue.\n\nThe graphics settings? Why are they there? No matter what you select the game simply stretches to my monitor's resolution.\n\nWhat's the goal? Going through all the frustrating mazes and puzzles to save pretty pretty princess who's been kidnapped by the turban-sporting evil dragon? Good thing we're comfortable implying the acceptability of ethnic predeterminations. There's a bunch of crucifixes around the game as well.\n\nWant good puzzling for the kids? Try Pajama Sam. Math? Try The Counting Kingdom, which FAR exceeds the low bar set by this title and gives kids time to think about their next move rather than putting the restrictive clock on them AND pitting them against the computer... believe me, when the CPU decides it's time for it to win, it wins, much to your and your child's chagrin!\n\nDon't mind the supposed awards it's won, they've obviously been given to perpetuate sales because if this title deserves them those awards aren't worth winning.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414676005, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1414676005, "recommendationid": "12694251", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492644", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1426021306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 193, "steamid": "76561198154433526", "num_games_owned": 51}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game does not work. \nI purchased it from Steam and downloaded it as per any other game from Steam.
