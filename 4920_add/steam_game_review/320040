However there's a lot to be desired from the basic mechanics of the game.  While it has a couple different classes, each only gets a couple different moves none of which have much depth to them.  Between that and a fairly cut and dry enemy roster, you're left spamming the same buttons in roughly the same way for an hour until you get to the end of the run.  In addition, the risk/reward balance of the game is fairly non-existent.  Currency from killing monsters gets spent on mechanical upgrades to kill monsters more effectively...but most upgrades add very little to your stopping power and most enemies go down easy anyway.  In fact, most enemies can just be outrun without much consequence.  Even dying isn't much of a threat, it just brings you forward to the next area.\n\nDespite these gripes the feeling of lore, deeper story, and creating the myth as you go all feel great.  I ran through the game a couple times just to experience the style of the game alone.  That said, once I figured out how irrelevant combat was I spent most of my time just ignoring it entirely and skipping large sections of what was definitely meant to be an intergral part of the game.  It's sad because this feels like a balance issue which could be solved by moving a few numbers around and changing how the difficulty works, but without that fix the game is essentially just a fairly nice visual novel with a lot of running from point A to point B in the middle.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505621611, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505621611, "recommendationid": "35013715", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518616", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506149589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 93, "steamid": "76561198003885158", "num_games_owned": 296}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you've played the Yawhg, and like me said: Why aren't there more games like this? You're in luck, there is at least one game like that, and it's Moon Hunters.\nThis top down shooter puts combat and RPG mechanics in the back seat in favor of the real reason we read books and play video games: adventure.\nThe point of the game isn't to destroy monsters (though you will), or save the world (though you might), it's to create a story with your friends and travel the land.\nI played it with my two best friends after a night out at the pub, and we all ended the game immensely satisfied. I don't even mind they blatantly ripped off the concept and aesthetic of The Yawhg, with added combat, it gave us a shared experience and story that will add to our friendship long after the game is forgotten.\nBuy this game.
