Bought this for my 4 year old. He had a great time, we'll play more I'm sure.\n\nYou build train tracks, put down buildings, rocks, trees, people, and more. Lots of objects to choose from so you can be creative. The building controls are dead simple. Just a few menus that let you place objects, change their size and rotation, change the weather, all basic stuff that works well. \n\nThen you choose a train and drive it around the track. When the train hits anything it explodes, so there is lots of fun to be had creating some big destruction. The train controls are almost nonexistent - just pick your train and it starts to move, all you can do is change the speed. But that\u2019s enough, it\u2019s not as much of a game as it is a playset. \n\nYou can download tracks that others have made, and that\u2019s a good way to get into some instant action. You can share your tracks too.\n\nThe visuals are nice. Bright and colourful, music and sound aren\u2019t annoying. All in all a nice package.

I'd make a game mode where the kids can collect coins by having the train pass over them - they would have to build the track out to that spot.
