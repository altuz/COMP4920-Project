It bears no complexity in gameplay and only serves for an hour's diversion, yet it presents a naively beautiful display of an age old story.\n\nAs the dawn breaks, our gaze meets with a sleepy valley under the summer sun. There is a pond, a meadow, a bridge hanging between two huts, an old archway and a cliff by the sea... and a storybook residing just above the valley. The utter presence of ultimate peace. And here, out of nowhere, we come in to this pastoral scenery. As many gamers call it to be \"Navi\" - a reference to the fairy companion of Link from [i]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time[/i] - we take the role of a tiny glowing fairy.\n\nAs we move our cursor around the environment, the fairy moves around and explores this limited geography, and when we click on it, it sings. Our aim here is to take clues from the storybook scenes and make the fairy sing in the appropriate place, time and condition to make the story progress. For every scene from the storybook we successfully manage to imitate, we observe the next chapter of the tale. These tiny puzzles are not hard to figure out and their results are exceedingly beautiful in a minimalistic way. The environment has its automatic day/night cycle, and the time of the day is directly a piece of the puzzle so you end up waiting for the appropriate time to trigger the event most of the time. There are some other little puzzles that would change this dreamy geography unrelated to story chapters, but they are all details of the end result. The most annoying side puzzle - which reveals the actual ending whence you manage to complete - is finding the half transparent pieces of a photograph concerning the main story around. These pieces appear randomly around the map in different times and stay around only for a couple of seconds, so if you'd like to see the ending event and grab the related achievement, you keep wandering around to catch those annoying pieces.\n\nEven with events with slightly annoying triggers, the whole game doesn't take more than an hour - an hour and a half at max - to complete. There is no actual narrative in game, yet there is a poetic narration about the possibilities imagination may hold power over at the end. Ultimately, it is a simple and elegant display with a naive message, open to interpretation by anyone who'd spare that hour.\n\nThe current price is an exaggeration for the content you'll be getting but the game goes into sale often or even may be acquired via some bundles. For a dollar or so, I can safely recommend the experience as a meditative choice before going to sleep; putting a silent, comfortable smile on your face. I haven't played the developers newer games here around Steam, but I'm told [i]Star Sky[/i] also holds great promise and may very well be worthy to check.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469095285, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1480065842, "recommendationid": "24439441", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471669", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1414189737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561198040564976", "num_games_owned": 79}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 59, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It is a pretty game, but it could be prettier.

There isn't really a lot to it on the surface. You basically fly around as a butterfly or something (who everybody is referring to as Navi lol) singing little butterfly songs and essentially unlocking stuff. Your song helps to create events which further the progress along. The story itself is a minimalist as can be. Basically it is really the representation of a short poem/musing about the limitless possibilities of dreams. You probably wont get that during the game itself necessarily, but the message will be conveyed to you in the end.\n\nOverall, not a bad hour long game, but there is also definitely not much in the way of replay value. Presently, the game is a buck on Steam. That seems to be the right price in my estimation. But it for a buck and enjoy. Spend more and you will likely regret your purchase a little bit.\n\nAll told, for what is basically concept art/poetry in game form, I give this a straight 6 out of 10.

What's going on? Game shows you and immediately gets to the action of finding out yourself.\n\nUser interface is minimal, only telling you how to move and how to sing. As there are no special maneuvers to attempt, the controls are sufficient for flying around: the faerie goes where you click and hold and then sings when you click the faerie.\n\nSinging is the main thing you want to do all the time. Singing at right places (and times) induces special events like e.g. rain or flower blooming. There's also a story that only progresses when you sing at the right place at the right time. Flow of time is seen in the celestial motion but all events nevertheless happen exactly at same times each day or night.\n\nUnfortunately \"the song\" gets old pretty fast. It is this echoing sigh sound and spamming it doesn't make it any better. On the other hand the music is nice enough not to be annoying but too forgettable to leave a lasting memory.\n\nIn addition to moving and singing you are only introduced to a huge book, the grimoire. It acts as both the menu (telling you e.g. that F is for fullscreen) and as the clue for progressing the story. You can read the whole (short) story at one time and then just come and refresh your memory when you are stuck and bored of exploring the world. Your job is to accomplish the story as depicted by the mysterious tome.\n\nStory is hard to explain without spoiling it, so at simplest it could be described as a love story. Your experience may vary as it can be interpreted as a tale of companionship or longing. All the same, it only takes about an hour to figure out the story to its end while looking for the other secrets. That is, if it works correctly for you: on my second try of playthrough I was unable to trigger the story events for whatever reason.\n\nWhile not necessarily partial to the story itself, the secrets are the hidden things to try and find while exploring the dreamworld, many of them worth an achievement. In addition to its namesake, the meadows, you can find ponds, trees, a mountain, a floating island and a sea as well as a couple of celestial and atmospheric features. It's fun to see what you can do and find the various secrets of the dreamland, that is, until you have found the few there are.\n\nThere's also a mysterious puzzle that took an additional hour of my platime, because I missed it in the first playthrough. These transparent pieces are floating in the air and disappear quickly if not grabbed immediately. For me looking for the puzzle pieces was a chore because they are difficult to notice and they appear only at random times. This being my second playthrough, the progression bug prevented me from experiencing the story for another go so I was even more bored just trying to stumble upon the pieces.\n\nMeadowland is a beautiful but short exploration game. It managed to evoke both happy and sad thoughts in me at the end in its presentation of the fleeting nature of dreams. While it's short and gets boring after a while if you can't figure out the way to progress, it's fortunately also very cheap: I'd recommend waiting for at least -50% sale and my recommendation of the game is partly based on the small price. After all, you'll probably get only 1-2 hours content of various quality out of it, less if you are not going for 100% completion.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439091941, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439091941, "recommendationid": "17452304", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525720", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459564623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 368, "steamid": "76561198141404871", "num_games_owned": 596}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I do believe Meadowland was Marten Jonsson's (Star Sky, Star Sky2, But to Paint the Universe) first Steam game.

As a puzzle game the visual clues found in the book are a bit difficult to understand but the story is \"age-old\" of when a boy and a girl meet and fall in love.  \n\nBiggest review complaint is about an achievement called \"Tree of Dreams\".  To gain this achievement the player must fly back and forth across the whole landscape (day and night) looking for semi-translucent puzzle pieces, a type of mini-game.  A bit tedious but doable.  No offense intended to Mr. Jonsson but I am glad he steered away from actual puzzle elements in his later games.  His later endeavors are still beautiful art pieces but focus more on the tale being told then gimmicky puzzles.
