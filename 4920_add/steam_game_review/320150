To beat the 70+ levels, you'll first need to figure out the approach to tackle them, and then reach the exit.

For me, the puzzle sections aren't really that hard, but some of the platforming sections are. However, this game has simple controls. For each deadling, you only use one button for control. One deadling walks, two use jumps (but one stick to the walls) and another fly. This last one i find quite annoying to control, t's like flappy bird, but much better. Even at full price, the lenght and variety of this game make it worth. Last, i need to adress two bonus levels: 3 and 10.

Those a rubbish comparisons. Deadlings is a side-scrolling puzzle platformer: you evaluate the level, decide which zombies are best at each task, then you set them running into the level (inputting single commands like jumping, but never directional input). This game is immensely more like 'Lemmings' and a little bit like 'Braid' and other less-manic puzzle-platformers.\n\n3) The fact this game isn't like those other famous titles is not an insult. This game is a great little gem! As you progress, the game expands on your options and the depth of the puzzles. I highly recommend not worrying about good scores initially and instead try to clear levels, otherwise you won't see much of the game's brilliant concepts for a long while.\n\n4) This game is very much worth it's asking price, and it's an easy purchase when on sale! Few games are both this well made, and be within anyone's price range. Not perfect, but nothing that would really ruin your fun.\n\n5) You can only unlock one level at a time, by completing the previous level. If you are stuck, this game doesn't offer you much else to do. This is the game's one major flaw.\n\n6) There's also a weird interaction that 'Bonebag' (your fast-running zombie that jumps) will literally explode if he runs into a wall or clips into the side of a platform. It makes sense from a gameplay-design perspective, but is visually doesn't make sense and it's infuriating to behold! Just a minor flaw but when puzzle games can be taxing on your patience, you REALLY notice stuff like that!
