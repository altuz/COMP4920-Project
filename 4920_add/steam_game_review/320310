Not even the $0.49 that I purchased this for. Would have much rather spent it on a rotten vine of grapes.\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Category[/th]\n        [th]Rank[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Graphics[/th]\n        [th]6[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Sim[/th]\n        [th]2[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Arcade[/th]\n        [th]3[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Customization[/th]\n        [th]2[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Controls[/th]\n        [th]2[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Overall[/th]\n        [th]3[/th]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nGraphics - 6/10\nNot the worst graphics to come out of a game, but at the same time, if you're looking for Forza/GT style graphics, definitely not the game to get.\n\nSim - 2/10\nThe vehicle actually moves and turns. As for everything else, non of it makes any sense.\n\nArcade - 3/10\nRead above. Scores one point higher since arcade style racing games don't really go for simulation realism.\n\nCustomization - 2/10\nYou can customize the brake bias, engine position, color, gear ratio, and suspension stiffness. Oh, and you get to pick from a slim selection of vehicles. No ABS, ESP, TC, gearbox type, or anything more than what was mentioned.\n\nControls (Xbox 360) - 2/10\nTriggers don't do anything. You do everything with the left stick. I don't expect anything much different with a keyboard, simply just use WASD.\n\nOverall - 3/10\nI feel like this game had a lot of potential just from the title. I bought this looking for something different than racing R34s and Ford GTs, but you're better off playing anything other than this. The fact that this isn't even in early-dev stages says that Homa Design has no plans on improving, or, should I dare say, finishing this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500148792, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500149034, "recommendationid": "33567499", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 3, "review_score_desc": "Negative", "total_negative": 18}}
