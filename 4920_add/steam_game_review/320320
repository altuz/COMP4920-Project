The gameplay is similar... at parts.\nYou take control of two characters, travel around the landscape while killing enemies, collecting treasure and exploring dungeons.\nEvery time you play the maps are different, which adds a ton of replayability.\nUnfortunately the combat system takes some getting used to. Read the manual a little bit to understand the control scheme (and hotkeys). But once you get past that you're all set. \nThere's also online support, although I don't know how active the game is nowadays.\nSo if you like Diablo-esque games, go for it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499598091, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499598091, "recommendationid": "33400901", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501254265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 802, "steamid": "76561198060344703", "num_games_owned": 138}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fucking yes, the game is pretty good and ir runs perfectly for me in WIN 10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500115123, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500115123, "recommendationid": "33556363", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499588", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 52, "total_reviews": 70, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 18}}
