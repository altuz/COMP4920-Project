I would recommend picking this up very cheap or passing as other games have offered a lot more and a lot better. The cool aspect of building your interior layout and redesigning your ship to either support a combat focus, transport or exploration is fun but after a while you start to feel like the experience is lacking, for example the combat is very basic having you just chasing or running away from your enemy until either of you are destroyed...sadly a few times the A.i would have a faster ship and simply run around you prolonging the battle.\n\nOverall I felt it's very lacking in the overall experience and after a few hours I just got bored as I felt nothing different as it just went in a cycle of Research, transport, Attack and repeat.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505937660, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505937660, "recommendationid": "35091213", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502902", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1415313056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 97, "steamid": "76561198047007925", "num_games_owned": 108}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game is not finished and never will be.
