It's roots are in the Axis and Allies mold, but it plays dramatically different, with the inclusion of cards that make for asymmetrical opponents of varying qualities. \n\nIt's an elegant translation of the original board game, and a worthy addition to your library.

If you win the auction, you will get to choose on of the cards.  But, the twist is, bid too much and the 2nd person gets their choice for a fraction of the cost - or drops out completely.\nThe AI seems to focus on defence - which is ok - but as you get closer to the victory point - doesn't try to use the poweful stacks it has built.\nWould be good with a multi-playerr or hot-seat option.\nPrice is excellent - but this could be a try before you buy and an occasional game.\nOverall - i like it and when i get 4 hrs clocked - will feel i've got value for money\n\nUpdate : The AI level is controlled by picking different characters to play against.  There is a list, and it shows 3\\4 by default who seem to be unrated.  Scrolling down shows the higher rated characters.

I've honestly enjoyed this game and I was probably one of the first people to pick it up when it was released on Steam and didn't expect so many negative reviews for this game. \n\nThe gameplay in my opinion are fantastic, you make a bid every round and if you win, you get first pick to Da Vinci's various war machines and get to go first. There are multiple ways to achieve victory points, such as having the most provinces, or building up castles. Around four maps and three settings the amount of victory types with multiple AI types to choose from. Graphics are pleasing and the gameplay is calm.
