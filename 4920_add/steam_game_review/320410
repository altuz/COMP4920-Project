Might use it to discard lesser click n shoot casual type games. \n\nNot a bad simple click and shoot game. 4 different weapons with different ranges, effects each represented with a silly looking portrait and some banter between them. Intro was a low quality slideshow with what looked like a transgendered general. The game itself is kind of cool. You get a 3D globe of earth with some main cities marked as destructible hotspots so you get news once on a while on what got destroyed and it creates some dramatic tension. Otherwise the aiming itself is not super accurage and the sensitivity is way too high by default and I had to adjust my mouse DPI to compensate. Not sure how the game progresses, it seems like each weapon is individually upgradable in 3 different subcategories (speed , dam etc).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504045226, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504045474, "recommendationid": "34590547", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
