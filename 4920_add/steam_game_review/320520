I loved the soundtrack and all the artistic style of the game. I also got curious to buy this one, because from the trailer there was more history, but suddenly, iv noticed some bugs wich are making me upset to play this one. For a platform game, I most go for the gamepad, but the settings are not working, they recognise my gamepad, but when pressing the buttons to change the correct ones, it doesnt mark. I still enjoy playing on keyboard, but the game could run more smoother as the 1st Oscura game. I cant say i didnt like the game, but at the same time the game couldv been more polished from some certain details... so from now I dont recommend. Go play the Oscura game for smartphone, it's not better, but it run as it should be working.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498943296, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498943392, "recommendationid": "33101634", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5}}
