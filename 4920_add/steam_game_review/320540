The graphics although nothing spectacular are collourful and refreshing for gaming in our times as racing games have switched for the realistic approach of more recent times and whilst this is good it also means we lose cool and charming little games like this. \n\nThere's enough weapons to keep the gameplay mixed and you can upgrade your karts such as power and acceleration.\n\nIt also comes woth full controller support and a multiplayer component which is nice.\n\nOverall my only negative criticism is that there aren't enough tracks but I feel the devs could easily add more if the community asked for them, \n\nAll in all this game is fun especially for the price tag and you'll get a few hours gameplay from it.

It's really fun, even there is need for some costumization.\n\nWhen you upgrade your stuff, you can have more weapons etc. You can also upgrade your cart and the colour. It's not that much, but it's okay since you see this game in Early Access.\n\nWhat needs to be fixed:\n- Hills / speed (It feels that you stop, when you drive)\n- Sound settings (It's 100% loud and almost destroyed my headphones) You have to change it in windows.\n- The driving seems OK. I'm not the one who plays car-games so much, but it feels too lose. When you drive, it's okay and no delay, but turning is hard.\n- You fall off too easy (If you drive into few things)\n- They should add voice acting for cutscenes (in the beginning) It will feel more alive.\n- The game crashed first time for me, that it could't find a resolution? So it gave me this message box that it didn't support anything. A restart  & verfy files fixed it.\n- MORE WEAPONS PLEASE! :D\n- You should be able to shoot bagwards, when you have a weapon.\n- It would be great if you could change clothes, skins, etc. \n\nOverall for those things, i find it funny. I can't way to beat the shit out of my friends. also note, that they are working on splitscreen and different stuff.

You're racing mobility scooters on public streets and yet it's challenging to not run into a wall while taking a corner. I probably end up doing this at least once in every race, and for my 66 year old mother (who was drawn to the concept and I thought might be ideal) it's completely constant. Using a gamepad with thumb sticks helps a bit, but I feel like even with a full blown steering wheel the winding tracks would still prove too difficult.\n- The problem with the above is exacerbated by AI bots that are *incredibly* effective. Even on the lowest difficulty level, it's hard not to get constantly hit by something, and there's no real shielding in the game. If you're lucky, when you notice you're being targeted with rockets or guns and you happen to pick up the defibrillator (a good example of the admittedly clever charm in this game), then you can disable the weapons of the bots immediately around you. However, that won't help if someone sneaks up and whacks you with a cane. It's also possible to lay down some oil slicks, but the bots always seem to successfully navigate around them.\n- It gets to a point where if you haven't upgraded your vehicle in just the right way, by the time you get to the last few tracks, it's virtually impossible to advance. I think I put too much into my transmission and/or weapons rather than upgrading my engine enough, and accordingly I simply couldn't go fast enough to even keep up with the other bots--even if I successfully managed to never hit any walls or get damaged by bots.\n- It's for the above reasons that I never successfully finished the single player campaign and the game proved so incredibly *frustrating* that I just gave up on the whole thing.\n\nHonestly, Super Tux Kart has far better gameplay and features on virtually every level--and that game is completely free and open source. The only thing Coffin Dodgers has that STK lacks is online multiplayer (as opposed to just local split screen). However, since the base game was this irritating I lost interest. I played a few matches online, but the issues persisted, and the only way I could imagine it being halfway enjoyable is if I played without any bots, and last I checked there weren't a lot of servers setup this way anyways.\n\nMeanwhile STK features...\n- Drifting support where you can gain speed while skidding around corners\n- Wider more open tracks that are easier to navigate and far more enjoyable to play with more diverse settings and interesting elements\n- Weapon and defense upgrades that are more well balanced\n- A broader difficulty scale which facilitates AI that won't completely murder you when you're just trying to play through a casual kart racing game\n- It even has better graphics\n\nAll things considered, while the game's concept has some initial charm, I can't recommend it with the current state of its gameplay, especially when there's better cheaper options available. Rather than spending $11 on this game, you'd be better off taking that money and donating it to Super Tux Kart (you'll get a bonus level or two that way too).\n\nhttp://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449444842, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449444842, "recommendationid": "19537790", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503343361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 367, "steamid": "76561197977776611", "num_games_owned": 271}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Simple racing game, yet so entertaining.\nGot stuck on last race in the campaign for ages!\nMultiplayer works great, best played with friends.\nLove the idea, love the dark humour.
