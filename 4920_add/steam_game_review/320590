In fact, it wasn't until after I had already spent about 60 hours playing that I finally decided to go ahead and and purchase the $10 base game.  The $10 was well spent as I now have a permanent XP/credits/rewards bonus which is very beneficial as your character levels get into the teens.\n\n[u]Getting Started[/u]\nBefore you can actually start playing the game you have to choose your character type from 1 of 4 options.  The main differences between the different types aside from appearance include the base attributes and type of special movement.\n[olist]\n[*] Faceless: starts with high speed / low attack, can double-jump and hang on walls\n[*] Guardian: starts with high armor / low speed, antigrav allows you to float around\n[*] Huntress: starts with high attack / low armor, can dash through the air with great speed\n[*] Mercenary: is the most balanced to start with, uses a Jetpack\n[/olist]\nOnce you choose a character type you have to choose your class:\n[olist]\n[*] Defender: Tank class - High armor and defense\n[list]\n[*] Preferred weapons: LMG, handgun\n[*] Gadgets: stationary shield, extended shield\n[/list]\n[*] Assault: Main damage class. High attack capabilities\n[list]\n[*] Preferred weapons: assault rifles, melee\n[*] Gadgets: rocket, stationary turret\n[/list]\n[*] Infiltrator: Damage class with some control abilities\n[list]\n[*] Preferred weapons: sniper rifle, shotgun\n[*] Gadgets: poison dart, stunning trap\n[/list]\n[*] Destroyer: Damage class focusing on area damage\n[list]\n[*] Preferred weapons: rocket launcher, flamethrower\n[*] Gadgets: grenade, mine\n[/list]\n[*] Medic: Healer class\n[list]\n[*] Preferred weapons: charger, SMGs\n[/list]\n[/olist]\nNext you customize the appearance of your character and name them.  Finally, you choose from 1 of 3 factions, which are kind of pointless for now unless you want to play with friends in which case you should join the same one.\n\n[u]Multiplayer[/u]\nWhen I first started playing this game I was routinely playing with other humans but in the time since the player base has decreased and I find myself usually playing with bots.  It's still a lot of fun though because you can get a great kill-death ratio and a lot of XP.  At the same time, this game is at its best when you have a human teammate to join forces with.\n\n[u]Game Modes[/u]\nTypically you'll end up playing PVP, with any unused player slots being filled in bots.  There is also a co-op vs AI level which is a ton of fun if you can find coop players.  The last mode is a last stand type game mode where you and your team must survive waves of enemies.  Unfortunately, the last 2 game modes don't come into rotation often.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nThe gameplay is fun enough to warrant playing as all of the character types and different classes.  Though it is not perfect and may take some getting used to, movement and weapons work well.  Rounds typically last 10-15 minutes and are fast paced.  Gameplay basically consists of trying to get as many kills as possible and/or capturing/holding control points while watching your shields and taking defensive actions to allow your shield to recharge in order to avoid getting killed.\n\n[u]Levels/Stages/Maps[/u]\nThe different stages are excellent and there are numerous.  They are nicely rendered, visually appealing and contain tons of small details that keep them from feeling empty.  There are also certain areas where teams tend to cluster which turn into corridors for epic battles.\n\nThe stages do a good job of creating a flow that pits teams against eachother, particularly on the conquest game mode.  You will also have to change your play style depending on your character type and class due to their inherent strengths and weaknesses, and movement type, all of which makes for more variety.\n\n[u]Weapons[/u]\nAssault rifles, sniper rifles, LMGs, SMGs, missile launchers, flame throwers, pistols, shotguns and a device for charging teammates shields.  You can also carry 2 gadgets such as a rocket launcher or grenade launcher, poison dart, shields, defensive stations, auto-turrets, traps and more.  There are also attachments you can add to each weapon to add secondary fire modes and increased range, damage, accuracy, etc.\n\n[u]Upgrades[/u]\nThe main motivator for progressing in this game is upgrades.  Armor/weapon upgrades, weapon attachments, offensive/defensive gadgets/abilities, cybernetic implants, unique appearances and more.  All items require you to be a certain level to use and the tiers are laid out well enough so that you'll always be working towards the next tier of upgrades.\n\n[u]Shops[/u]\nYou can buy weapons, armor, etc. from shops and the market.  The regular shop sells the basic stuff which is easy to afford and good enough to get you through.  The faction shop sells the good stuff, but everything costs faction currency which is a commodity you collect by completing achievements.  Finally, the market is where players can go to sell their own items and buy from others, as such you can find some very useful and rare things here when the player base is active.\n\n[u]Crafting[/u]\nUsing recipes and special components, you can craft special and rare weapons and armor.  I think the recipes cost too much in the faction shop but if you're lucky someone may sell what you want on the market.\n\n[u]Special Abilities[/u]\nAs you level up you can build out your skill tree which enhances your stats and opens up special abilities.  For example, as an infiltrator with a sniper rifle you can gain abilities which make your next shot do the same damage as a headshot or lower your enemies defense.\n\n[u]User Interface[/u]\nThe user interface doesn't explain in great detail exactly how you are supposed to do everything but it's easy enough to figure out as you advance through the game.  The game didn't originally support the English language so there are some spelling and grammar discrepancies but nothing too bad.\n\n[u]Audio[/u]\nThe music is well done and very fitting though sometimes I turn it off to play my own.  Weapon sound effects are sufficient.  There was a bug where the reloading sound would get stuck in a loop but the devs quickly fixed it.\n\n[u]Developers/Staff/Community[/u]\nThe staff of the game has been vocal in the community, open to suggestions and accommodating to the player-base.  The community is small but includes some great people.\n\n[u]Footnote[/u]\nSome of my information about character types and classes has been gleaned from http://www.indiedb.com/games/warside/features/warside-factions-character-types-and-classes-revealed", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442703278, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1447911881, "recommendationid": "18107763", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556826", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435983324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1137, "steamid": "76561197961024197", "num_games_owned": 453}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Great game with a lot of potential. Everyone that actually chat in game are all nice and helpful. \nThe controls take a few games to get used to but after a few hours in it becomes easy to master the jumping/hovering.\nThere is a varity of weapons that each add their own form of gameplay. Certain pvp maps makes some guns better than others depending on if it has narrow passages or being wide open but that only adds to the strategy of having a good weapon makeup in your backpack.\n\nOverall as of right now if youre going into the game thinking it is a finished product youre going to have a bad time. If youre going into it just trying to have some fun maybe with some friends then youre going to enjoy yourself for quite some time.\n\nIt seems that the devs are making good progress with the game and I would expect it only to get better as time goes on. \n9/10 honestly.

The character detail is well done and there are many armor styles to choose as you progress.  Characters traits are customizable mainly by equipping items, but there is also a skills panel to develop your strengths.  Environments are interesting and detailed to the point of being immersive and not distracting.  There are plenty of weapons and other equippable items, like a med station or turret, to fit anyone's play style.  Players may find a \"favorite\" weapon that they always use, but some daily challenges encourage players to try other weapons, and this also helps keep the experience interesting.  \n\nThere is a crafting store for each faction, though I haven't quite figured out how to make anything great.  There is no tutorial, and information in English about crafting is scarce.  As such, it's hard to comment one way or the other about this function except to say it's not explained and not intuitive.\n\nThe PVP game is a lot of fun, and you generally don't have to wait long for a match to begin.  PVE is also fun, but other players can vote to kick you out of a game even as it is well under way, and that is definitely not fun, and yes I speak from experience.\n\nApparently there is also a clan system in this game, and though I see the button to make a clan, I don't see anyway to join an existing clan, nor have I seen any evidence of clans operating in the game.\n\nI think the gameplay is great.  Graphics are really good.  Character customization is great.  Music and sound are good.  PVP system works well.  PVE is fun but why do they gotta kick people?  \n\nOverall, a really fun game that maybe has a few kinks to work out.
