[i]Questerium[/i] is a Hidden Objects Game (HOG) combined with Full Motion Video (FMV). It's not the best HOG I have played but it is worth playing. The puzzles are fun and even though (or maybe: because?) the acting is cheesy, the FMV really adds something special to this game.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nA meteor has struck near a town. It's emanating an unearthly energy and the resident scientist, Dr. Gustav, starts experimenting with it. Something must have gone wrong, as the meteor's energy has suddenly manifested itself as a huge but inert whirlwind just outside of the town, causing the townsfolk to flee in chaos. Two children are unaccounted for. You play an investigator who's asked to go look for the children in the abandoned town.\n\nThe story is rather thin. Dialogue is scarce. You do learn some background stories about the main characters by reading journals, newspaper articles and other texts you find while exploring the town. All in all, the narrative is enough to keep a HOG going but not much else. This is one of the many HOG that relies on a lot of puzzling and just a basic story to keep the player interested.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nAt the start of the game, you select a difficulty to determine the challenge [i]Questerium[/i] will offer. You can adjust the difficulty at any time while playing. \n\nAt the easiest difficulty, you occasionally see a small sparkle on all the objects you can interact with. The hardest difficulty mode is meant for people who want to click on everything to check if it does anything, and who don't mind resorting to some pixel hunting. The difficulty modes in between don't have the sparkles but you can use a hint button to lead you to the next object to interact with, if you're stuck. \n\nThe hidden object puzzles in [i]Questerium[/i] are what I'd like to call 'the advanced type', meaning you don't just need to look for items hidden in a scene and click on them, but you also need to combine items and use some items on other items to find hidden objects. It's a small step up from the basic hidden object puzzles seen in some other HOG, but a step up nonetheless, making the hidden object puzzles a bit more challenging and interesting.\n\nThe other puzzles are varied enough. There are some classic puzzles and there are some original ones. The difficulty of the puzzles is never too high to be frustrating, but overall they are challenging and most importantly, they're fun to tackle. \n\nOptionally, there's some collecting to do while playing the game. In [i]Questerium[/i], you can collect money and plants. The plants are easy to spot but the money is hidden very well. Spots where there is nothing but hidden money don't even 'sparkle' on the easiest difficulty mode, so you either need to click around a lot or keep one eye on a guide. \n\nAt any time, you can click a button to travel to your own personal place in the world of [i]Questerium[/i]. There you can use the money you've gathered to buy fountains and trees to make your garden look more impressive. The small building leading to your garden contains a book that keeps track of the plants you've collected. The rest of the room automatically gets filled up with all sorts of decorations while you complete achievements in [i]Questerium[/i]. All this is completely optional and not relevant to the game at all, but it's there for people who like trophy rooms like that, and it's a fun addition to check out once in a while if you're an achievement hunter.\n \n[h1]Graphics, FMV and sound[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are as good as you'd expect from a decent HOG. In the case of [i]Questerium[/i], of course, it's the FMV that makes the game look special and different from other HOG. Graphically, the FMV looks great. The FMV is used only for the four characters you meet in the game, though, so it's only a small part of the whole game. \n\nThe acting is very cheesy. This is a word us FMV afficionados use to avoid calling the acting terrible. But we use the word affectionately. The quality of FMV acting has known extreme highs and lows over the last 25 years, but the appeal of FMV is that when the acting is ok, the FMV is called great, and when the acting is bad, it's called typical charming FMV. Or indeed, called 'cheesy'. The fact is, the FMV in [i]Questerium[/i] adds a lot of atmosphere. And after playing [i]Questerium[/i] I have to say it baffles me that this is the first HOG with FMV I've ever seen, because FMV goes really, really well with the HOG genre. I hope to see more of that combination, although preferably with a slightly higher standard of acting, if at all possible.\n\nThe music and sound effects of [i]Questerium[/i] are fitting, atmospheric and clearly of high quality.\n\n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n\n[i]Questerium[/i] has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.\n\nThe 23 Steam Achievements, which are also tracked ingame, consist of story-related achievements, puzzle-related achievements (for solving them without skipping or using hints) and collection-related achievements (for collecting all the plants, finding all the money and buying decorations for your garden).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502735264, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502735264, "recommendationid": "34240874", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517182", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 27, "total_reviews": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
