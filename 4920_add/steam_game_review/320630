I thought that you would drag to match 3 but it is only clicking groups of 3 or more to clear tiles. I finished the game on easy but the timed mode doesn't provide much more - it is the same game, just with a time limit.\n\nI don't recommend the game and if you are interested, I suggest grabbing it on a sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497716318, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497716827, "recommendationid": "32509875", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506376", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 29, "total_reviews": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 18}}
