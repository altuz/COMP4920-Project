This one looked like one of my usual guilty pleasures: glossy album-cover art, modular frame story (collect items to free the personification of each month of the year because A Witch Did It).\n\nSadly, I overlooked the fact that the core mechanic [i]isn't Match-3[/i], not as we know it.\n\nYou don't shuffle or move tiles (\"gems\"); you just click on where you see 3 or more of them together and all the connected ones disappear.  I can't articulate why that's so much less satisfying, but it is.  I imagine that other goofy Match-3 people like myself will feel the same and want to be aware of this.\n\nAlso, the hidden object minigame is just not possible in windowed mode; there's stuff that gets cropped off on the borders.  (It was awfully difficult on fullscreen, too; there's no way to adjust the resolution in-game and by that point I didn't want to bother messing with my display settings).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503471811, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503471811, "recommendationid": "34431737", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 20, "total_reviews": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
