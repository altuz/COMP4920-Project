The outcome of the story appears to depend on one choice.\n    [*]The main character has his own personality that is much different from mine, so he does things that I wouldn't choose for him to do.\n    [*]The story I got, involving Sakura, had an ending and epilogue that felt forced.\n[/list]\n\nThis isn't the best or most playable game out there, but it's good for what it is. It's a decent story with characters that are eventually likeable, and if you're interested in improving your Japanese, this game could be very replayable.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502554590, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502554590, "recommendationid": "34194702", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503149", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 367, "total_reviews": 390, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 23}}
