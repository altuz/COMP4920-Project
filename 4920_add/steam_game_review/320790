While the environments look lifeful, missing sounds and animations make the characters look like robots, and they act like it at times. AI is unbelievable: it will constantly walk into walls, walk past you when you're firing at it (only responding when you actually hit them). The fact that they say it's single player is in my mind a lie: the AI is not up to par to even CONSIDER it. The 4 maps avaliable are all unique, but affect gameplay too much as certain maps are a characters bread and butter (for example, the catacombs-like map for the melee class). \n\nCharacters level up and get abilities, but will cause horrible sways of power. With being able to unlock abilities such as a Radar, significant speed/strength boosts, it will cause a bad dynamic for new players going against old. While the netcode looks alright with the limited time I spent with it, the game made me feel sick at times with the backdrops/enemies put in front of me. Balance is significantly off in my opinion, as R.O.B. has one hit kill capability that outweighs the rest of the other portions. \n\nSignificant portions feel unfinished, with no fall damage sounds, or appopriate world elements. You pick up powerups, that you have no idea what they do, and the game does absolutely nothing to teach you on how to play. You'd think that wouldn't be necessary in an FPS, but when you have mechanics such as being able to put oil on the ground and setting it on fire, I should be told about that. Or that an ammo distribution center is....well an ammo distributrion center, not me running into things randomly hoping to find ammo.\n\nI will be following this review up with a video, but I want to put this up here right now to make sure no one buys this game. It's frankly an awful experience all around.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414443431, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1414443431, "recommendationid": "12661042", "language": "english", "votes_down": 28, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630232", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1414436249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 12, "steamid": "76561198038211107", "num_games_owned": 426}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 168, "comment_count": "13", "review": "This is PvP only.

Gameplay is quite fast paced, there are bounce pads, power-ups and instagib weapons, which gives it an oldschool feel. It definitely plays more like Quake than any modern FPS, although there are ironsights. It's pretty fun and has potential but it also has some serious problems you might want to know about before buying:\n\n>it's optimised like crap. i get low fps even if i switch all settings to lowest, and my fans gets loud as hell, there are also occasional crashes. \n>classes are clearly imbalanced, also they start with only  1 weapon each, which kinda blows\n>no voice acting or music outside of menu, there isn't even a commentator\n>it's multiplayer only, there are bots but they aren't that fun to play with\n>it was just released and there are already problems finding people to play with\n>only 4 maps and very little variety in game modes, although the maps are spectacular\n\nThis is actually a neutral review. I can't really recommend this game yet, but i also don't want to bash it with a negative rating, it already has very low score as it is.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414459824, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1414461376, "recommendationid": "12663755", "language": "english", "votes_down": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520617", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1417097361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 183, "steamid": "76561197993368913", "num_games_owned": 1071}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Could have been fun it people actually played the multiplayer.
