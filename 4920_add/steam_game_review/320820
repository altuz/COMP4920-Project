There's not much in terms of story, gameplay, graphics, or sound. There's really not much of anything.\n\nWhile some of the sequences are kind of interesting the first time through there's simply nothing significant enough to be memorable. This is mediocrity in a small package. It's semi-disappointing because I think some of the core concepts could've been turned into something good. But they needed more...imagination to come to life.\n\nToren feels like a final to a semester long game development class, not something people should be spending money on.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506724695, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506724695, "recommendationid": "35314838", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506834", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502651361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 80, "steamid": "76561198194459855", "num_games_owned": 434}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "My bf got this game on PS4.

Honestly, as long as you're not particularly picky about controls, they shouldn't ruin the experience.\n\nThe game tries to recreate a experience brought to you straight from Team Ico, and while it accomplishes this to some extent, it will never quite get you there.  For an indie title, it's a reasonable attempt at this however.  The atmosphere is decent, although the plot's disjointed nature at times can throw this off.  The plot also never has a feeling of completion for me at least, so came off as a bit rough at times.  It's also a short game, lasting roughly 2 hours for a playthrough.\n\nIs the game worth it?  I'd be hesitant to want to pay full price for this, but if caught on sale for $5 or less, I'd say it's worth the time for an interesting attempt at storytelling.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505240902, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505240902, "recommendationid": "34906220", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503058", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 205, "total_reviews": 313, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 108}}
