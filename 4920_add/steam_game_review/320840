I also remember my frustration at getting close to the end only to ditch when victory was so close... Fokkers!!\n\nSo recently thanks to a friend I was able to re-play this classic game, it'd not faired all that well gien it's a 27 year old game but it was still playable and as much fun, and annoying (lol) as it ever was. When I saw Wings! Remastered on the store I had to buy it, mostly for nostalgia reason's, and taking me back to being that 17 year old spending most of my nights playing this on my Amiga.\n\nThere are one or two minor things such as the text in the journal between missions will sometimes when it runs to two pages display much larger than it should and thereare one or two minor control issues I have experienced using the XBox Controller which are irritating but not all that much of an issue.\n\nThe graphics are bright and crisp and while some may say they are not as good as some of the other newer games available on Steam, they have done a great job in recreating the look of the original game and while it is remastering of the original game it not only brings it upto date but also adds something more up-to-date to allow this game not just to appeal to us old timers but also (you'd hope) to gamers new to the Wings!\n\nSound is excellent, the background music, sound effects and other assorted pieces of audio have been recreated and add to the games atmosphere, the voice acting while new to Wings! added a nice new addition and helped push the story forward.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, well it's not going to win game of the year it is a solid game which is as fun to play as it was in the 1990's, and it is evident that Cinemaware have ensured this is a loving recreation of that original game which was at the time one of the better Amiga games available and today still stands the test of time as being a fun game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496061542, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496061542, "recommendationid": "32040704", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 103, "total_reviews": 131, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 28}}
