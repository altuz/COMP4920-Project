Basically you start with a little ship, accomplish various type of missions to earn gold so that you can build up your \"pirate town\" allowing you to have a bigger ship or bonuses. Note that you can build a brothel, that's always a +. You navigate freely on the world map even though you can't do much on it, except for trading upgrade items in town or accepting missions. You can also interact with other ships on the map to escort or fight them. \n\nThe sailing and combat are VERY arcade-y. Aim with your mouse, left click to fire your cannons and right click to use a special attack when the bar is full. There is a mini-game in which you fire a cannon in first person to sink bad guys boat without hitting your pirate friends boats. Although it does not seem to actually give you the gold you earned during the mini-game.\n\nAll in all buy if:\n-You want a fast paced arcade-like pirate game where you sink tons of ships.\n-You like hit'n'run gameplay.\n-You like mindless fun.\n\nDont buy if:\n-You're looking for realistic sailing/naval combat.\n-You expect a game with factions or nations.

You know the usual stuff.\n\nAnother thing I really like about this game is the soundtrack. The ole pirate singing and music really fits the game.

If this game gets a few more updates that add some more content to the game then I believe that this could become a pretty decent little pirate game.\n\nMainly my issue with this game is there is only 3 ships you can unlock, and 2 unlocks per building at your pirate island, it doesn't take very long to build up money in this game if you pay attention to its mechanics which in turn makes it even easier and faster to unlock all of the stuff you can and then you just have the story mode to complete.\n(Buy Brothels and the Taverns to get extra gold, then go to a port town and grab one of the treasure hunt tasks, don't finish the task and gold farm off the ships that come to attack you. Use gold magnets for increase pick up)\nAnother negative point is all the ports that are around in the game only offer the same 3 mission ever so that gets very repetive.\n\nOutside being able to unlock everything extremely quickly it also comes with some pretty bullshit bugs, a few that I've run in to are:\n~On exit the game will crash throwing up an error code, which when you relaunch the game later you'll find out it deletes your game saves.. (Kind of a piss off to have to start all over)\n~Controls of WAD can sometimes stop working if you pause your ship while picking up gold, you'll have to hope that it recovers before you get blown out of the water...\n\nAll in all it's not a bad game I just wouldn't recommend it without some new content being put in, I think a few more ships and upgrades for the island, and prehapes a few minigames would make it a better/easier buy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423334747, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423334747, "recommendationid": "14373512", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499407", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500160020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561198016944963", "num_games_owned": 116}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Game opens, cant click on anything... mouse moves.. but simply wont click on new game.. or any other thing.\ntried vsink.. tried multiple rez settings, tried Hz settings..  \ntried to post this.. needed 5 mins.\nso i tried again. used 1900x1200 setting.. i was able to click on things, however, the game now plays in Negative colors.  done trying.\nGL to all. not recommended.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500160178, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500160178, "recommendationid": "33571996", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 8, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
