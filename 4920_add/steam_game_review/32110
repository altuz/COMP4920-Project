If you don't like Mahjong, you wont like this game either, but for fans of the game LUXOR: Mah Jong offers stylish graphics, several modes of play, period specific egyptian music and a wide variety of power-ups that tweak the traditional game just enough to keep things interesting. The game also supports the Steam Overlay although true widescreen is not available.  In most respects, LUXOR: Mah Jong is a polished puzzle game and deserves to be in the library of any serious Mahjong player. I highly recommend this game to fans of the genre, or even casual newcomers who enjoy a well done casual game."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1337124446, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500159", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "3661298", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025726362", "num_reviews": 62, "last_played": 1337151600, "num_games_owned": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7889}, "timestamp_updated": 1337124446, "received_for_free": false, "review": "easy casual game with various versions of mahjong \n\n79/100"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1459563333, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499137", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "22189029", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197982628667", "num_reviews": 290, "last_played": 1343286000, "num_games_owned": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1459563333, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Sometime works, sometime not."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1377015904, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496132", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2402213", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006836183", "num_reviews": 259, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 67}, "timestamp_updated": 1377015904, "received_for_free": false, "review": "oui"}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1396716441, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494374", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9735212", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197968432161", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1374293237, "num_games_owned": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 38}, "timestamp_updated": 1396716441, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game!"}, {"votes_down": 15, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1397096984, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477910", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9775775", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197993930568", "num_reviews": 350, "last_played": 1397096950, "num_games_owned": 4439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 45}, "timestamp_updated": 1397096984, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's good."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1468946585, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "24410961", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198089035538", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1505271427, "num_games_owned": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 805}, "timestamp_updated": 1468946585, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have played various versions of Mah-Jong on many platforms ever since \"Shanghai\" came out for my old Macintosh 128k back in the 1980's. This is a very nice visualization of the game. Nice graphics, and sounds and the Egyptian take on things is nice too. It runs very well on Win 10 for me with no screen flicker or crashes or other issues. Plenty of layouts to play and on the tougher ones, you will be keeping one eye on the timer as some can be rather hard to beat (for me anyway). You get some interesting powerups to help you along, though. The price is okay for what you get which is a good-looking game with plenty of playtime. A good little time waster, over all. I can reccomend it highly."}]}
