It has a female archaeologist and she gets to explore Thailand!\n2. References to Thai culture are absolutely fascinating\n3. It's feels like a huge game - over 4 hours play time, and that's unusual for these point-and-click/hidden object games\n4. It has all the right ingredients - interesting locations, hidden objects, mini-games, puzzles, variety of special objects\n5. There's a real variety of puzzles\n6. The music is lovely in places and the game has all the feel of something that took real time to make\n7. There's a baby elephant! (definitely need more elephants in games - developers take note)\n\n\nBut, desite all this, it just doesn't work!\n\nThe reasons are (includes some spoilers):\n\n1. The acting and characterisation is rubbish! The dialogue is so poor in places that I physically cringed. The Thai monk characterisation is borderline racist.\n\n2. Finding some of the locations is really tricky - the rendering of the environments gives you little clue that there is anything else to investigate.\n\n3. Some of the 'puzzles' are nonsensical. Why, oh, why do I use a 'catalyser', some sawdust and another chemical to fix a clearly broken boat? A boat which, I should add, was moments ago in a raging inferno which I had to douse with a fire extinguisher, and yet is miraculously unharmed! Oh, and at one point I have to dress a monkey so he'll give me an elaborate bracelet which makes me strong enough to break the bars of my prison!\n\n4. The tone of the story and characters is all over the place. Melissa flirts with the other male archaeologist - is he meant to have been my mentor? Surely there's a real ethical dilemma about that one? What about having to retrieve the pickled remains of conjoined twins from a Mengele-like experiment, to satisfy an unhappy ghost? And yet, my character also asks whether her fellow archaeologist (he's so boring, I forget his name) has a \"male\" attitude to driving, and I'm meant to find it funny.\n\nI really don't quite know how so much could be included in a game, so many hours could have been taken, and yet the result is so poor. There might be some fans out there, and sure it will take up a good few hours to complete, but I wouldn't say that there was anything I really liked in this one. Apart, maybe, from having a gecko sidekick - oh, and elephants!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500206865, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500206865, "recommendationid": "33583409", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506991", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 31, "total_reviews": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 21}}
