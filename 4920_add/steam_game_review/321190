These concepts are portrayed in a very powerful manner in several of the game's highlight moments, alongside with great production value like hot-blooded BGM and animated scenes (climax scenes only).\n\nHowever.\n\n95% of the novel, which are made up of parts that lead up to these highlight moments, are filled with uninspired everyday life fillers fraught with characters that range from dull to okay. Or worse, drawn-out scenes of super heroes fighting villains in the most cliched way possible. Even the production value is sub-par, in contrast to the stellar presentation in climax scenes.\n\nWhat we get is not justified by its current price of $35. If you have to get this game, try to get it while at discount. Also, word of advice, whenever you feel like the game is getting boring, go ahead and skip a bunch. Usually the last 10-20% of each route is more interesting. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493432513, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493432513, "recommendationid": "31429420", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496357", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "total_reviews": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
