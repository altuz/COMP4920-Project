Morph into eight deadly beasts and use their own unique abilities, blaze through maps at insane speed to pick up power-ups, and fight your friends or foes in classic maze-like arena maps, just like the good old days. Wickland is an arena FPS dedicated to PC Gamers.\n\n[u]Release Date: 14 Nov, 2014[/u]\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\nSet in what seems like Midievel times, Wickland brings back that oldschool fps feel that we all remember from the early 2000's. There are 2 modes at the moment including what they call \"Warm up\" which is basically just FFA Deathmatch and Duel Mode which is a basic 1v1. Both are fun to play but I find FFA a lot more fast paced and fun. Weapons are very similar to those of Quake and even imitate them in a midievil way. Instead of keeping the same character through the game though, you switch between them on the go by simply scrolling or pressing a number key, each character having a different weapon. Health pickups, Ammo, Armor and Weapons spawn around the map and must be walked over to be collected all respawning a short time later.\n\nAll in All [u]Wickland[/u] is a really nice FPS Game!\n\n7/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep[/i]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503229545, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503229545, "recommendationid": "34371653", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517004", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503780046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561198090778111", "num_games_owned": 40}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Haven't played much of the game but I have enjoyed the very little time that I have played it. I got it for $0.10 because of a steam discount I got for crafting a badge. The only issue with this game, and it is a big issue in my opinion, is that there are no servers.

IT IS DEAD!\nI ended up removing this game from my steam list. But I figured I should give a warning to people who stumble across it.\n\nThe game is good. Witckland is a Quake style shooter where you pick up weapons that change you into to strange mideval (?) fantasy monsters that have different magic powers that work like traditional guns. There is a werwolf, ape man, and many more creatures. I like the concept of a weapon changing your whole character, and would like to know if other shooters use this premise. \n\nThe levels are all dark castles, so setting can be a bit dull, but the levels are well designed.\n\nThis game uses a health and armor system where you can pick up power ups to heal like traditional 90s shooters. The controls are very tight and great. \n\nThe main issue is all forms of servers are dead. Meaning the only form of gameplay is bots. Bots are super mobile and accurate, so they can provide a great challenge if you are into that sort of thing. Also you can use external programs to make a server with your friends temporarily and play. But I don't have friends with the interest to put in the effort, and assume others would be in the same boat. \n\nAchievements are a small factor in games, but can add a fun moment or extra challenge. Achievgements here are just win a large amount of games. Which is impossible without hours of planning and grinding. There are no unique, funny, or furfilling skill based achievements.\n\nI got this game out of a bundle with a bunch of game I did want, and if servers were still working/ easily accessible it would have been a treat. The bottom line is there are dozens of shooters that have working servers to get similiar gameplay (although maybe without such a fun and unique theme.)\n\nI rate the game 6/10. It's nothing spectacular, but it's serviceable in fun. But being dead, comparatively difficult when compared to other games to get a single game going; I can't reccomend it. If someone knows a shooter with a similiar theme, aesthetic, or mechanic where you're whole character changes based on the weapon I'd love to try it out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501648505, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501648505, "recommendationid": "33963557", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500408", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 76, "total_reviews": 159, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 83}}
