However, the game's pretty dead every single time I check multiplayer, I don't think anyone's playing this, which is a shame. It's not an awful game, it's sort of like Nazi Zombies w/ more Silent Hill-esque monsters, some upgradable stuff you can find each map, it can be rather roguelike also. I only say \"Not Recommended\" because of the dead multiplayer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505449917, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505449917, "recommendationid": "34963877", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494553", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 235, "total_reviews": 297, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 62}}
