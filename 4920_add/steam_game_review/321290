I played Jisoo's route through first since I heard he was the hardest, and let me tell you, I am not satisfied with the ending.... It definitely has left me hoping for more.

But MAN the stat raising killed everything.\n\nArtwork was gorgeous and just really well done A+ I'm serious. \nI think the story could be ok?? It has a premise (very similar in ways to Nameless but not in a bad way more like a pleasant inside joke kind of way :) that is unique. I really like the idea behind the story and think the characters might develope in interesting ways that I actually really wanted to see... I honestly still want to see... But I will never know because it was so riddled with stat raising, quick saves, meter checks, reloading, gift buying, special items, incredibly specific measures, aimless searching, and extremely repetative interactions that I couldn't tell you what the character and I really talked about. Do more dialogue, flesh out all these characters that live together for a year, don't hide the story (or drown it) with stat boosting.\n\n I couldn't finish one route.... I was on track with the stats and everything but I just stopped after 4 ish hours in the same route and realized that I was only halfway to the end and it wasn't even fun anymore. Zero replay value. Why would I want to do all of that again?\n\nIt is like it's a game about stat raising with an OTOME minigame going on in the background. It is cruel in a way... I really want to know what happens... I know walkthrough videos won't do it justice (I tried watching them but they are forever long too because of THE STAT RAISING and I missed reading it myself).
