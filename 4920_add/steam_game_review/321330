If they limited weapons to certain situations at least it could feel strategic, like an action puzzler. \nGood music but again pretty repetitious.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496213777, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496213777, "recommendationid": "32079483", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517006", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495034597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 296, "playtime_forever": 296, "steamid": "76561197994000906", "num_games_owned": 541}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If the player character was comprehensible and the music was better and the controls were tighter and the weapons were actually useful and the sound design wasn't grating then this would be a pretty okay game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495034718, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495034718, "recommendationid": "31806600", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494181", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 7}}
