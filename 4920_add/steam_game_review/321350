The idea is sound enough, and the trailer is tempting, but the execution is lacking soul and substance.\n\nSo what works? You can dogfight both AI and human controlled fighters. The AI fighters are a lot easier, but still rewarding. You also have to discover the universe, it's not justg handed to you on a plate. This encourages exploration. The controls are ok.\n\nWhat doesn't work? The sound is weak (which is easily fixed guys!). The waypoint system is a nightmare. Scratch that, the nav system is a nightmare. It needs simplifying. If a civilisation can create a spacefaring culture, then the navigation system would be paramount, and easy to use. You can fly a space station. Sounds cool right? Wrong. Space stations are for deploying and making money from while you are away doing someting else, not blasting level 1 pirates!\n\nThis game is not as terrible as some reviews would suggest, and even though there seem to be periodic updates, there is no info on the steam channel about what those updates are doing.\n\nOverall this is playable, and a definite distraction, but the price is too high for what you get and there are stronger games out there for about the same cost that bring far more to the table.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414261547, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1414261547, "recommendationid": "12629299", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531514", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421619448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5959, "steamid": "76561198018505077", "num_games_owned": 90}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": "5", "review": "I highly recommend this game if you like space sims, or even trucking sims. I like the variety of shipments you can carry from planet to planet. The graphics are great, and run smoothly on a low-end computer. For the price I couldn't turn it down. I like space fighter games, but the \"trucking\" aspect of it keeps me coming back to this, playing for hours. It like a combination of Moon Breakers and Euro Truck Simulator. I would like to see a little more personality thrown in, like better space station stops. Perhaps a more \"Truck Stop\" feel to it, or some humor here and there. \n Or just throw on the \"Convoy\" soundtrack on Winamp and your good.\nExcellent game at the price.
