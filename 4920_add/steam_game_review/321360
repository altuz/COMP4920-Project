However, the game suffers from constant bugs and glitches after updates, as well as delayed mechanics and some balance issues. So strap yourselves in for the review ride and HOLD ON TO YOUR BUTTS!\n\nVisuals: Primal Carnage: Extinction's visuals are sharp, clean and looks astonishing for an indie title. The game also features many great looking skins that does its very best to enhance the visual experience.  \n\nGameplay: The gameplay of Primal Carnage: Extinction is solid and constantly improving. There are several game modes to choose from such as Team Deathmatch, and Get To The Chopper. Unfortunatly, most of the game's servers are either Free Roam (Team Deathmatch with no time and score) or roleplaying servers that end up defeating the purpose of an online multiplayer battle experience. The game's single player offering is a joke, as there is only Free Roam and Survival. Survival/Horde mode so far only has three maps, and in my opinion is more enjoyable when playing with a group of people instead. Other personal complaints I have are the game's delayed mechanics compaired to the original game such as not being able to control your jumps as a dinosaur and slower crosshair speeds as human. A major complaint in my opinion is the game's balance due serveral classes such as the pathfinder and carnotaurs being very op. The humans could use some improvement on their animations as they feel robotic and lifeless. The new progression and challange system is a great way to get skins but unfortunately is bare bones in its current state. Gameplay can still be fun and enjoyable but Extinction is a bit of a disapointment for those looking for a competittve multiplayer experience. \n\nCommunity: The community of Primal Carnage: Extinction is in my opinion pretty toxic due to  these types of players: imature gamers , roleplayers (sigh), votekickers (the worst) and admin power abusers. Also the poor devs at Circle 5 are constantly being harassed by frustraited players after each update, and being told to make new dinosaurs. Most of the Free Roam servers are populated by roleplayer types while Team Deathmatch and Get To The Chopper are hardly populated. \n\nThe worst kind of players from my experience are the votekickers who abuse the votekick system for their own selfish needs. Votekicking should only be ment to kick players who ignore rules on servers and show disrespect towards fellow players, but any votekick should always be a last resort. But, sometimes there is always that winy stupid person that votekicks players who had done nothing to deserve being kicked are kicked from servers. This had happened to me twice already, one was me not knowing the rules that I cant play as a tyrant and ended up being kicked without warning instead of giving me a chance to change class, and I was automaticly kicked on my second time because there were two friends who were hogging the server. To be honest, just avoid these people in general because they will waste your time and ruin your fun. So how do I have fun then? Simple, I would recommend playing with friends or with people you are farmiliar on a server that is always friendly and welcome as the Primal Carnage community should be. \n\nPrimal Carnage: Extinction is still in development and I have faith that the small team of developers will do their best to make Extinction the game that it was ment to be. In conclusion, Primal Carnage: Extinction isn't perfect just as any game isn't. So hey, if your a dinosaur lover like me then this game is for you. I give this game a 7/10.\n\nPros: Game looks great, Lots of wonderful skins, Game is improveing, Is still fun and enjoyable. \nCons: Balance issues, Delayed mechanics, Too many Freeroam servers.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505866679, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505942483, "recommendationid": "35074601", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501571", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506273789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1152, "steamid": "76561198424176612", "num_games_owned": 2}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I always wanted this game for years and i finally got it!
