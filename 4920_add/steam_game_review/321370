It feels like it is still in early access, and can use some work, but theres a lot of potential. As a full game though as it is right now, I would not recommend it.\nThe controls seem slightly delayed, and are sloppy. Jumping is a huge issue, as well as running. \nYou tap slightly to make your character move and NOT fall off, and your charater doesnt move. So you hold down for slightly longer, and your character goes flying off the sign. \nI've died so many times because I hit spacebar to jump and because of the delay, the character doesnt jump, just runs straight off the sign. It is very frusturating and unrewarding. You have no control over your jump, once you jump your charatcter will jump at whatever speed you were running at, and you have no control of the jump while in the air. So quite often you'll jump from a sign right into the abyss.\nThe idea of the game in general is very creative, but as a platformer, there are much more polished games out there you can get for a cheaper price.\nThe controls are just so sloppy that it ruins the game for me.
