Nevertheless, this game was a disappointment. Took me 3h to get this thru, with small breaks. This was a basic okay, so I'll just list the cons down below.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Edgar Allan Poe!\n+ Okay graphics\n+ Enging has a nice little twist, slightly morbib, which bides to the source material\n\nCons:\n- 9,90\u20ac is way too much for ~3h playsworth\n- No achievments?\n- Puzzles not very challenging\n- No replay value\n- Graphics could be a lot better\n- Music is mediocre\n- Short\n\nAll in all, buy it if you love Poe and point and click but only from sale! Not worth the ~10\u20ac/12$."}]}
