For the price, I am blown away, I expected it to be a stinker but it is actually fun to play.  You start off your career with a rusty slow boat and no money and have many ways to earn it.  Racing was too hard right off the bat so I did some taxi runs, then discovered this pirate treasure mode where they just literally scatter the world with money and you just have to collect it all.  Well since there was only a couple of upgrades on the rusty boat I maxed it out and now need to figure out how to get a better one.  \n\nSome negative aspects I would say is the limited selection of upgrades on the boat classes.  Maybe things get deep down the road but if the later boats have just one speed and one rudder upgrade I would be disapointed.  Time will tell though as I venture through this title.\n\nAs far as graphics options and settings, this game is fully loaded.  All resolution, texture, effects, sound (including # of voice channels), controls, AA, etc is all here in the launcher.  Everything worked on the first try as well, no crashing or hiccups.  In the game, it looks beautiful but the textures are a bit too low-resolution to be a game from 2015 however, they should work on that as the whole experience would be improved with textures many times larger.  \n\n360 controller works out of the box, but there is a chance it needs to be turned on before launching the game and selected in the launcher as the input device, but I can say that you can use both the keyboard and controller for at least navigating menus at the same time, which is nice.  \n\nWishlist:\n- Trading cards\n- Achievements\n- Steam Cloud\n- Online multiplayer\n- Higher resolution textures\n\nOverall totally worth the $4 it is currently.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427319296, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427319296, "recommendationid": "15052564", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535556", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427578778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 231, "steamid": "76561197992293259", "num_games_owned": 607}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I bought this game on impulse, because of the low pricetag and the inability to resist. I have to say, I'm positively surprised by what I got. Note that this game was originally released in 2008 (according to the official website) It made it's way through Greenlight and was released on Steam this week. \nIt's an open world boat racing game, wich takes place in 3 area's. You start in Russia and move on to Greece and the Caribbean later. You can also quicktravel between the various locations in the game, once you unlocked them. You navigate to various point on the map to start races, taxi jobs, upgrade and reskin your boat or buy a new one, acquiring sponsors etc. You start your career with a crappy, slow and ugly boat. Races can be a bit dull in the beginning but with the various ways to make money in this game, you can quickly upgrade your boat or buy a new one. The upgrading ability is limited to just a button press for a better engine, to give an example. You can't choose between various parts. At least not where I am now in the game. While racing you can pickup powerups, like nitro or weapons to use against your opponents: rockets, torpedo's, shockwaves, mines, EMP's, oh and off course, bouncing, exploding frogs :)  So if you are looking for a realistic boat racing game, this isn't really your thing. Then there's a mode were you collect golden coins that are spread out over the map. So another way to make money.\nGraphics and sound are decent. Again, considering the pricetag, I'm just satisfied with it. Just don't expect super high resolution textures or cool lighting and particle effects. For some strange reason, the screen ratio in the menu's is 4:3. At least, on my system. However, ingame it all works with the proper resolution and screen ratio that you can configure in the game's launcher. You can set more graphics and sound options there.\nI like the game's physics too. They are not hardcore offcourse but certainly not too arcady. The boats really have some weight to them. \nThe game has 'experimental' controller support but at this moment, you are better of with just the keyboard, wich actually works fine. The 360 controller does work. However, you can't remap the buttons and the layout is a bit odd and unusual. Gas, brake and steering is all done with the left thumb stick. The triggers don't do anything with the boats. I hope the dev will add the ability to remap the buttons in a future update. It's not a huge letdown. Like I said, the keyboard works fine too. \nAll in all, I'm very satisfied with this game, which costs the same as a cup of coffee and a snack. You really can't go wrong with that.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427477462, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427535309, "recommendationid": "15078011", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519801", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484039131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 193, "steamid": "76561198052494738", "num_games_owned": 268}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's not too bad.

Boat, weapon and track variety are good enough for a few hours of game time. It has a basic progression system that consists of getting money or popularity to imporove your boat or get sponsors. Most maps have about 3 races to complete and upon winning most of the races in a map you will unlock the next map. Boat shops are located on specific maps which will open up new boat options as well as upgrading the opponents boats to maintain difficulty. Sponsors will unlock as you gain popularity and will apply bonuses to you cash and popularity income. The biggest shortcoming of the game are the controls on an Xbox 360 Controller, with the Left Stick controlling both forward/reverse as well as steering. On top of the poor control scheme control rebinding is not an option. Some boats are also to nimble for their own good as a slight adjustment to direction will result in a complete loss of stability, losing you time or in worst case scenarios putting you in a position requiring a reset and potentially losing you the race. The AI is also very lacking, while their fixed racing lines that vary from one another is an okay solution, their inability to avoid obsticles such as land results in some races becoming very easy if you can identify where the AI will have issues. The AI also uses weapons the instant they think they have a valid target which means as soon as they pick up a weapon, they will generally fire at that exact moment. This can get frustrating with EMP's as the 1st boat to hit a weapon can drop an EMP causing all racers including itself to travel in a straight line for quite some time.\n\nThe Good:\nLow Cost\nStraight forward progression\nVariety of Activities\n\nThe Bad:\nUnrebindable Controls\nPoor default control scheme\nAI\n\nThe Passable:\nLevel Design\nWeapon Choices\nGraphics\n\nIf your interested in a boat game with weapons, this one might be worth while if its on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494456404, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494456404, "recommendationid": "31673732", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446760202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2136, "steamid": "76561198121782745", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "pretty badass if you like boats an it runs very smooth to lots of fun for the racing aspect to", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500666042, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500666042, "recommendationid": "33704131", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 11, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
