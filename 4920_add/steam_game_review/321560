If the dev reads this, just want to make you know that you're a god at designing levels *clap*. Many devs should play and learn from this game.\n\nI really think this game deserves way more love.

This game. Is... I would put it in the \"meh\" category if Steam had that one, so this is a very light recommendation, but I think its main mechanic is interesting enough and it does enough with it to justify a recommendation, I did have a good bit of fun with this game after all.\n\nThat being said, I kinda wish this was a shorter $5 game. Instead of the 160 levels, give us 80 of them, pick out the better ones and give a more consistently enjoyable experience. This game really feels stretched out for content, in the end. There are some levels that toy with a few extra mechanics (time shifting blocks, blocks that pop in and out of existence when you hold the shift button, a few autoscroller-type things, basic stuff mostly) but the majority of the game is confined to making use of the main mechanic in a static environment. And there's only so much that can be done with that, I felt the game getting repetitive pretty early on and it didn't get more varied down the road.\n\nThere's also an uneven difficulty curve, I feel. Outside of the bonus world, I didn't find myself challenged too much by any particular world... but each world had a few levels way harder than anything around it. A lot of the boss levels also felt a bit unfair, having to pray that the boss would end up in around the same spot every time so that you could learn the level and complete it, and the final boss especially felt too long. There's a fair few levels requiring precision beyond what the game gives you, too. I feel like focusing on really precise movements in a physics-heavy game may not have been the best of ideas. But that's just me.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game is pretty interesting though and makes for some enjoyable platforming challenges. There's some levels about getting enough height via flying through blocks, other levels about trying to get down below via gravity and clever use of the main mechanic, and some just straight-up platformy levels. The extra mechanics occasionally thrown in also make things a bit more interesting; there's a few levels where you basically fly using the user-controlled blocks, and the boss of the 8th world has this very clever proximity thing going on, I really enjoyed that one especially. There's also plenty of replay value here; every level has three time challenges to meet. Personally I couldn't be bothered to even go for time challenges most of the time, ending up with very few sun medals and only a few dozen of the full-moon medals, though usually the half-moon medals aren't too hard to get. I spent around 7-8 hours just playing through all the levels once, so there's no shortage of content here, certainly, though honestly I would have preferred a bit less in the end xD\n\nOverall it's a solid precision platformer, definitely unlike any other game I've played, but I feel the focus should've been on making a more compact and enjoyable experience rather than just throwing every level the developer made into the game and calling it done.
