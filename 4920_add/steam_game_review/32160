It feels very much like a well-crafted mobile game. The game consists of you bowling down a lane full of zombies, overcoming obstacles and traps like water on the bowling lane and deploying tricks that you earn to improve your game. The controls are okay, but odd. You use the mouse to adjust the power behind your roll and then once the ball is out of your hands, you directly control its movement with the mouse -- moving left to right.\n\nIt's an idle-time amusement and little more. Not worth the price, but not a broken or terrible game. If you're into this kind of thing, I'd wait until it hit a buck or two before buying.
