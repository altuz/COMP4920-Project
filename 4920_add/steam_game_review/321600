Images are extremely poor quality, and some of the \"lost objects\" appear to just be clip art or stock photos taken as a whole (i.e. a polar bear standing on an iceberg, when the object is just \"Polar Bear\").  Many images are warped or so faded as to be virtually indistinguishable from the background, made worse by the low resolution / clarity of the entire game.\n\n2.  Moderately poor English grammar / usage / spelling.  Everything from subject / verb agreements, to misspellings (\"gorgoile\" -> gargoyle), to typos (\"Bulp\" -> Bulb), to flat-out misidentifications ( glass of beer = \"juice\", swan = \"duck\").\n\n3.  The \"story\" is almost entirely inconsequential, told in poor English, and generally not at all consistent with the legend of the  Flying Dutchman.\n\n4.  Though advertised as something that will \"keep you searching for weeks\", I completed the entire game in 65 minutes, much of which was spent trying to figure out why grasshopper = \"flute\", or why the \"jellyfish\" looks like watermelon, etc.\n\n5.  From what I saw, there is absolutely no \"randomization\", nor are there \"hundreds of objects\", nor are there \"dozens of locations\".  I saw seven locations:  cave, island, boat, house, \"hotel\", pier, ship (end).  Each time the objects may or may not be loaded... but they were *always* in the same place.  Once you were able to locate an item, you'd never have to search for it again.\n\n6.  Interface was clunky ... upon finding an image, you had to wait several seconds just for the game to realize you'd done so ... move the object to your satchel ... then open the screen up for clicking again.  Clicking more than 2-3 times in rapid succession would greatly advance your timer (even if you were clicking on the correct object, but before the last one had made it to your satchel).\n\n7.  Obviously a \"bargain bin\" title at ~$5 USD ... but you'd probably be better served by getting a cheeseburger & fries (or literally any other $5 object).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1410921088, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1410921088, "recommendationid": "12124761", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601646", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442022278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 81, "steamid": "76561198138437975", "num_games_owned": 1174}, "votes_funny": 9, "votes_up": 49, "comment_count": "5", "review": "I don't like writing negative reviews but this game deserves it.
