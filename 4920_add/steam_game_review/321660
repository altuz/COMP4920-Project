Totally worth buying on a 75% off or better sale.\" According to My Own Rating.\n\nI've had fun playing the game, but in order to do so, I've had to accept two facts. First, the video and screenshots are misleading, everything you see in 3d is part of an animated background that doesn't seem to be affected by anything you do. Then there's the fact that either the positive reviews have been paid for or I should go become a billionaire irl. I just find it hard to believe that mining industry is that simple and easy to run.\n\nOnce you accept that it's an extremely superficial/simplified business simulator with an animated background view, it's rather easy to have fun if you like business simulators. \n\nThat should be enough to clarify what the game is not: It's not a machine simulator, and it isn't a deep business simulator (in fact, it's even hard to say it's a good one). \n\nI've stumbled upon a few bugs (such as the PANIC message when trying to load a save file after completing or losing a game), but nothing that would make the game unplayable. Also, the free game settings seems to have been poorly designed leading to impossible scenarios, like when you try \"hard\" for all options and start the game with a production so low that you're losing money unless the price is really high and you don't start with enough cash to increase production or even survive a couple months until the market price rises.\n\nOther than that, I was expecting a very crappy and unfinished simulator, and it's just a superficial one, therefore, it's much  better than I expected.\n\nDon't expect much out of this game and you can have fun for many hours.
