The game is apparently not suppose to do this. After the training mission, you are suppose to go on actual missions. But, the the game will not let you. SO....the game's software is CORRUPTED!

The tutorial mission isn't that difficult (the only problem is than they didn't mention you also need the left, right, up, down keys to maneuver with the plane). You just need to press W + down and that's all you need to lift the plane.\n\nW-S: Control speed\nA-D: Control direction\nUP-DOWN-LEFT-RIGHT: Control inclination (Left-Right inclination may turn the plane down. You can correct it by using DOWN key).\nE: Shoot bomb/missile (Change with Q)\nSPACE: Shoot bullets\nCTRL+SPACE or CTRL+E : Shoot special projectiles (if available - Seen over score, at the left)\nF1-7: Activate different kinds of view.\nG: Pull/hide plane wheels\n\nAaand that'd be all I guess.\n\nSPOILERS\n\n-Really loved the bomber plane mission, I was just shooting while a pilot was driving and suddenly he was shot and I had to drive the plane! It was a bit difficult since the plane was really slow (as it should be nonetheless).\n-I suffered a lot with the mission where you steal a reaction plane from the nazis, it wasn't specially difficult but it didn't have any checkpoint. So you could go back to the beginning of the mission quite easily. That made this mission even more difficult than the last ones. \nI remembered it now. I didn't know I had to press G to pull the wheels out. Otherwise I couldn't land and I ended up exploding.\n\nSPOILERS END\n\nI played this game as a child and it's been a long time since then. I hope someone else can also enjoy this game as I did.\n\n9/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1483219400, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1483227248, "recommendationid": "28882294", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504902", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444424124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 69, "steamid": "76561198064465729", "num_games_owned": 77}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "When I finally got past the training which was almost impossible, it wouldn't let me play any other missions anyways.\nMy advice would be to get this game on sale", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436833005, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436833005, "recommendationid": "17035977", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503653", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430718604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 46, "steamid": "76561198024522105", "num_games_owned": 102}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "a standard flight simulator/ war game if you play war thunder it has the same basic feel, but its low end production (to current standards) means you might want to glance over the controles. it looks like the default is a south paw configuraton for the key board.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430710742, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430710742, "recommendationid": "15680024", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495048", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506054916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 127, "steamid": "76561197961146235", "num_games_owned": 238}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Flying the planes is one of the most enjoyable experiences on Steam.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431107056, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431107056, "recommendationid": "15743031", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480058", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494752907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 316, "steamid": "76561198061821321", "num_games_owned": 33}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "absolute pure gas game here lads, well worthy a cheeky cop.  all the planes are bare easy to fly n feel the same, but for a fiver u cannae really ask for more una.  also if ur a real pro you can drop bombs on urself", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495136508, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495136508, "recommendationid": "31828077", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
