A series of games in gold colored boxes changed my world.  \n\n  I cut my Ad&D teeth on the wonderful \"Pool of Radience\"  I spent most of summer vacation staring at my Zenith TV and listening to a 1541 disc drive click and crunch its way through the numbers I no longer had to touch dice to benefit from.\n\n  Luckily when I discovered there was another gold box that dealt with \"The Curse of the Azure\" bonds it was time for Christmas vacation. Managed to remove those damned tattoos just in time for school to start up.\n\nThese games consumed me fully.  Many a night lost inside a gold box  ended in panic as I turned of the  TV and pretended to be asleep because my Dad's alarm clock was ringing.\n\nNow I'm the dad and the kid thanks to Icewind Dale:enhanced edition.  \n\nI installed it and started running the adventure with the premades to get a feel for the engine while I decided what multi-classed chars I wanted to start over with when my damn clock started ringing .( 2) 1/2E Fighter/Magic User, 2) 1/2E Fighter/cleric/magic user, 1)  1/2E FIghter/magic user/thief, and 1) 1/2E cleric/magic user).\n\nIf you want crazy ubertextured eyecandy move along, If you want to rent your adolescence for a few hours a day while forgetting to eat and spending most of your work day tired and cranky this is the game for you.\n\nI highly recomend it.   My only complaint is the total lack of a gold box.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505003993, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505003993, "recommendationid": "34850018", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539856", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506543399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2538, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2777, "steamid": "76561198034238053", "num_games_owned": 365}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I probably would have been disappointed, had I played IWD when it came out. The amount of content recycled from Baldur's Gate games is simply astounding, but at the same time IWD lacks the soul of the BG series due to the simple fact there is zero character interaction and little freedom of choice or consequences, all caused by a lack of recruitable characters with actual backstories, and the linear story of the game itself.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're a powergamer who always wanted a party made from scratch and it drove you mad how you always had to deal with the deficiencies of characters you recruited over the course of the game, you'll have a field day here (prepare to spend upwards of three hours on character creation, mostly depending on exactly how bad you want that 18/00 STR). \n\nIWD mostly consists of heaps of combat, dungeon crawling and trap finding. Not a whole lot of puzzles, non-linear quests (any quests, really), or dialogues. Also, the base game will cut your character development very short (I'm currently embarking on HoW and will update the review). If you looked forward to your mage finally wrecking stuff after being the punching bag of the party for 40+ hours - too bad, it's virtually impossible to go beyond lvl. 7 spells. To add insult to injury, some of the quests can - and will - be completely broken if you don't follow the exact order of actions the developers intended, which is sort of morbidly impressive given how linear the game actually is.\n\nAnyway, despite all of the shortcomings, I can't help but recommend the game.
