Note that I used \"Visual Novel\" and not \"game\", because thats exactly whats going on here. Its very text-and-reading-oriented. \n\nAs a Visual Novel, I'd rate 7.5/10. Great art style, and comfortable to look at. Actually quite a bit of background infomation and plot. I appreciate the dialouge and AMAZING music, on the contrary, if played through too many times (e.g. exploring different choices, finding the 5 different endings), or just staying in the same scene for too long. the music can become a looping annoyance and the dialouge is repetitive. I will say that I appreciate the vast variety of details I find. Its focuses on a yuri between the main character and one of the crew members, but you are \"given the option\" to be straight. There's a tsundere case and a gay one too.  Overall, was a satisfying game that took me personally less than a hour to finish and explore and most definitely gave me more than I bargained for especially since this is a Free to Play \"game\".\n\n\n/u Pros:\n*Great art style, that is easy and comfortable to look at\n*Awsome music\n*different Choices; Slight \"Choose your own adventure\" where choices affect the ending and dialouge\n*Interesting characters\n*Background/Lore infomation\n*Option to fast-forward to skip dialouge\n\n/u Cons:\n*Scenes and music can get repetitive through multiple playthroughs\n*Wanting to explore more than the same course of storyline\n*Would be nice to have more options; have more endings\n*If you're gonna put so much info and extra details, don't just let them sit idlely\n\nIn case the developers see this:\nPersonally I think this game has so much potential. I think it'd be great as a free roam, story focused game. I'd like to get to know the characters more, learn about this universe you have created, and have more choices. I'd love to do more than just be on a space ship. Granted I love this story of a saboteur and solving a mystery. Just implement all the details of different races, planets, events, and characters. Like I said before, this has so much potential, and I realize I'm asking for a lot, but I'd be so happy to see this grow so much higher than it deserves.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487452176, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487452176, "recommendationid": "30018689", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486752968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 756, "steamid": "76561198271048999", "num_games_owned": 5}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I honestly loved the story of this game!
