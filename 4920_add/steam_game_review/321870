It is a good experience storywise. Only things I found annoying are the mini-games. Some of them are frustrating and non very much in theme with the game, like the bunny one. The controls are a little cluncky and the savepoints too few. Several time I had to run trough all the stage so that I could save my progress. And the hiding spots from monsters should be more present; too many times I had to run back trough several screens to avoid one of them, only to keep finding him in my way. Excepet for this things it is a wonderful game for horror  and psychological games fans. Great atmosphere, good story and nice graphic for an indie game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500710049, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500710049, "recommendationid": "33714920", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508887", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500609260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 73, "steamid": "76561198079839969", "num_games_owned": 87}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "review": "The controls are choppy (which is weird because most all you can do is move up, down, left or right), the dialogue appears to have been written by a teenager with a horrible understanding of how human beings actually interact with each other and the no-auto-save \"feature\" made my first time playing it frustrating enough to rage quit after losing a half hour's worth of progress. I mean, I peak out a door, see a creature walk by, figure the coast is clear once he walks by, right? NOPE. As soon as I open the door, I'm dead. How was I supposed to know that? I was thinking, well, I'll open the door and if he's still close by I'll run away and go through another door. There's a lot of stuff like that in this game.\n\nHowever, I really do like the general look of the game. The art is great. It LOOKS beautiful but it plays rough. The story has heart but I just wish it was written by a better writer. Also, I get that they're trying to pay homage to The Shining, but this isn't homage, this is borderline plagiarism. Man, All in all, the game looks good but I just wish they tried harder when they made it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500609804, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500609804, "recommendationid": "33687935", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502487", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499525227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 148, "steamid": "76561197995769135", "num_games_owned": 509}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Some jumpscares that I don't even know what so scary about what been depicted on it, clunky control, and unlikeable npcs.
