Necessary for the rest of the parts, but it was super repetitive. It was mainly hopping back and forth between four places. And not even in a we're going to stay here for a while and solve this thing kind of way, but in a we're going to this city to get one thing, go back to find out we need to go into another city for one thing, but the problem still isn't solved. Rinse and repeat. In the previous games there was enough story and progress that it never felt repetitive, but this one was preyy boring. I liked the new cities though, and there were lots of creatures for Moo Hatchery.
