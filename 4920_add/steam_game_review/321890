THIS GAME WILL REVEAL MANY PLOT SPOILERS FOR THE PREVIOUS PARTS AND A COHESIVE STORY CAN ONLY BE FORMED WITH THE PLAYING OF THE OTHER 3 GAMES IN THE SERIES.\nAveyond: The Darkthrop Prophecy is the fourth and final installment in the 4-part series of games that make up Aveyond 3. Don't start with this one, as you'll be missing TONS of backstory. Instead, buy Lord of Twilight first, Gates of Night second, and The Lost Orb third... And finally this one.\nNow, I've been following the Aveyond series for several years, back since the first game in 2004 (which doesn't go under the title of \"Aveyond\", instead; it's called \"Ahriman's Prophecy\", and it's free from their site, aveyond.com). I was young, the game was cool, so I stuck with the series. In 2006, the actual Aveyond was released and I was stoked. More of AP? Nice! However, Aveyond 1 was completely different from it's predecessor in the best way possible... Fast forward to today, with me writing this review.\nNow, I've had this game for a while. Not on Steam, but from somewhere else, so I've played through it a few times before, so this isn't a \"first-time playthrough\" review or anything. But without further ado, let's get on to the actual review.\nAveyond: The Darkthrop Prophecy is a great game from a great team of people. It's got a ton of pros... But also it's fair share of cons. I'll list them all out for you, dear reader.\nPROS:\n+Decent price\n+Decent gameplay\n+Great story (if you've been following since Lord of Twilight)\n+Custom music (not all of the music is build-in RPG Maker music, as one could expect)\n+Difficulty selection\n+Nostalgia factor (for the select few who played the first Aveyond)\n+Combat just works\n+Dat plot twist at the end (again, you'll have to have played LoT to understand)\nCONS:\n-RPG Maker... XP.\nBefore we go any further, I want to explain why this is a con in detail. Aveyond, the series as a whole, while a great series, is all RPG Maker XP. All of it. From Aveyond 1 (not it's prequel Ahriman's Prophecy, however) to this most current one, Aveyond has been an RPG Maker XP game. After 4 years of making games with RPG Maker XP, you think they'd at least move onto RPG Maker VX Ace (which is what I use), but no. Not even a slight upgrade. Don't get me wrong, there isn't nothing wrong with RPG Maker XP itself (besides its dated-ness) but having a whole series of 7 games be all made in a program that was just barely considered \"new\" at the time of the first game's release is just baffling.\nNow back to the rest of the cons...\n-Cannot change screen resolution\n-Can be confusing to those who never played any of the other parts of Aveyond 3\n-Controls can be awkward\n-Moves a bit slow\nAll in all, I will recommend this game. But please, before you spend $10 on this, buy the others. At least get Lord of Twilight to start you off.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427769747, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427837795, "recommendationid": "15134476", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539900", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432929010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 743, "steamid": "76561198144674528", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Man... times were HARD in this one. Everything cost an arm and a leg, some creatures just refused to DIE, the resistance some enemies had to my weapons that I bought in the area confused me to no end... and worst of all, the people in this game got smart. Normally I can just go into people's houses in any town, hit up about five or so houses and loot them right in front of the owner's faces! And they'd be perfectly fine with it! But now there's not  as much to steal... and they complain when I try. But the pickings are still sparse, they've heard I'm coming to town, so they hid all their valuables.\nLike the slime farmer! Every time I visited him, I stole all of his slime. All of it. And never used a single one. If this game taught me one thing, it was that you should never leave your stuff around me. I will steal ALL your shit. Even if I don't need it, I will steal all your shit. \nAnd when I saw Nox for the first time, I thought she was annoying, then I saw her character art. SHE IS SO CUTE! Don't even get me started on Uma. Too much cute, not enough money. \nSeriously though, if you get this game there will be a LOT of walking because there is no longer a magical transporter, there is no more alchemy that YOU can do, and say goodbye to the Moo Hatchery. The game is challenging enough to give you a good amount of gameplay and the story is awesome~!

The places we've previously visited in all the games were unavailable, which could be good or bad. It was getting repetitive to revisit the same places over and over, so the new places were a welcome change. However, one of my favorites parts about this series is the ability to go around collecting animals for Moo Hatchery. Not being able to even visit it took a lot out of the experience for me. And since this was the last of the series, and they just added new areas while keeping the old in the other installments, I think it would have been better if they had at least let us visit the old areas even if there were no missions there. \nSo, it was fun, and more polished than the others.
