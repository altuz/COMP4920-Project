Loot isn't as varied as what I would've liked it to have been but the developers saw to putting in the extra elbow grease so that weapons and armor appear on your playable character when equipped.\n\nFor the $5 I paid; it's perhaps in my top 20 best Steam purchases but you can't go too wrong at it's standard retail of $10 especially if you still hold fond memories of Nintendo's 64 days.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418090033, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1418090127, "recommendationid": "13289279", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543564", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482178027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 419, "steamid": "76561198136545980", "num_games_owned": 189}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "simply fun game and looks beautiful", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1474804374, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1474804374, "recommendationid": "25690486", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492716", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459178526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 251, "steamid": "76561198000068857", "num_games_owned": 552}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "the frog lady has some wacky titties for a game for children and now i think my children are traumatised for life", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1490219386, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1490219386, "recommendationid": "30676007", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491833", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495004642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561198098103095", "num_games_owned": 25}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "hate it.
