By which i don't so much mean its a challenging game that rewards careful gameplay, I mean that it is constructed to kill you and be deliberately obtuse and difficult to play. My two principle concerns with the game are as follows:\n1. Often times the window of time you have to perform your jump can be measured in a few frames of animation I'd guestimate you often have a window of less than half a second to correctly jump and land on a platform that is slippery and has a safe zone only about 1 and 1/2 times the size of your avatar. *I am not good at platformers* so while i feel this is relevant to some/many players I acknowledge and pay homage to all of you who have mastered the art of platforming to the point where this is an exciting challenge. For me, it was not. It was merely frustrating when all i wanted was to play this quirky platformer with a nice aesethetic.  My larger concern can be found in the next point.\n2. this game involves a tremendous amount of jumping, in a land riddled with obstacles and enemies that will instakill you. This is to be expected of a retro platformer. What i was tremendously dissapointed to find was that often times, the only way to determine when/where you have to jump is by experemintation. Please don't misunderstand me i don't mean the jumps are difficult to land (they are, hellishly so) as that is part and parcel of the genre. No I mean that literally the only way to know where you have to jump is to jump and pray you land on a safe platform because the camera is often zoomed so close to your player that you can't physically see the next place you have to jump. \n\nI applaud games that are tremendously difficult. I enjoy platformers, even though i'm trash at them (super meat boy is a great example i love that game even though i simply cannot beat it). Yury however is punishing and rewards you for initial reckless behavior followed by absurdly difficult jumps and positioning.  I'm not telling you not to buy it, you may well be skilled enough to play it, i simply want to ensure your aware of what your signing up for.\nGame on Players~", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438883729, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438883729, "recommendationid": "17417494", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999751", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1426821569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 8, "steamid": "76561198126929550", "num_games_owned": 366}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game would have been better had I remembered the refund system...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445106587, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445106587, "recommendationid": "18532048", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494263719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 48, "steamid": "76561198022143876", "num_games_owned": 1707}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So much potential but the pacing is unacceptable.
