No. Just.... no.[/h1]\n\nIf you're a fan of the HoMM series, you need to play this game just so you can see how far the franchise has fallen. It's like going to a funeral: You need to go just so you can gain closure on the fact that your loved one is in fact dead.\n\nIf you haven't played any of the Heroes of Might and Magic (its PROPER title) series by now, then don't bother. I loved H3, but that's mostly just nostalgia now. H1 was my true love, with its colorful and silly graphics. But i'm spoiled now by visions and hopes for a better future that never came.\n\nThe problem with H7 lies in its bland story, bland setting, poor AI, and lackluster art direction. H6 and H5 had the same problems in different ways. But H7 fails in another significant way: It takes place in the past, before H6! I'm not even going to bother going into detail on this.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505861225, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505861225, "recommendationid": "35073606", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523603", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507048857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 952, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 8805, "steamid": "76561198021664572", "num_games_owned": 158}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you liked the previous Heroes games, this game can be fun as long as you are willing to accept that it isn't perfect.\n\nBy it isn't perfect, I mean the bad:\n- The AI isn't great, but at least this time it doesn't cheat like it did in HoMM2 and HoMM3.\n- It still crashes. For me, this was around once every 10-20 hours, mostly when ending a campaign and returning to the campaign screen, so I never lost any actual progress.\n- There are some weird bugs, like the infamous firewall bug (enemies stay within it instead of leaving it) and some other minor weirdnesses. For me nothing game breaking and (besides the firewall one), I did encounter one once every ten hours.\n- You need to login to uplay on the first run, otherwise it won't work. However Uplay never went down when I played it, so again, it is much more stable than it was a couple of year ago.\n- The community died in practice. The base game has walkthroughs, but the expansion has none. Not even on the usual places. You are on your own to experiment.\n\nThere are other things which it does very well, also the good:\n- This is HoMM5 2015 edition in most regards.\n- There is a huge, very well balanced campaign. The level design is good, there is a good story arch, it does help you by testing different skills and setups and the skill system is easy to understand and fun to experiment with.\n- There are some combinations which are much more useful than they appear to be. The skill system is well balanced.\n- There is no \"best\" build for a hero. There are a different approaches working with different situations.\n- The AI is somewhat bad, but the campaigns are build with that in mind. There are some levels where I was outnumbered by far by every single enemy stack.\n- Also, there is a huge variety of well balanced units. This also mean that there can be small number of entry level creatures you need to skip when you can defeat large packs of champion creatures. This was an usual case for me under the wizard campaign.\n-The graphics look great and the interface is easy to use.\n\nAnd the great:\n- The hero build variety is amazing. I ended the last level of the expansion with an economy / diplomacy hero which had a righteousness / leadership combo buffed by positive spells (read: prime magic and fortune) within around six weeks without ever buying a single creature from a city / dwelling, but building up the army on the way relying on constant good morale in the end. On an earlier level, I used defense / fire focusing heroes, just to realize on the last battle that I need to switch to a full offensive approach with melee units to win instead of casting fireballs and having the army look at the fireworks from a distance.\n- The armageddon build is working and shining like it did back with Heroes 2. Because clearing out half a level with a couple of elite creatures is fun.\n- All the magic schools have game ending builds, and one is not necessary better than the other. You need to adjust your strategy a lot depending on the situation.\n- Some of the levels in the campaign are similarly epic as the ending of the Sylvian / Inferno campaign in HoMM5. The expansion is a bit similar on how I remember Armageddon's Blade even on normal difficulty.\n\nI didn't tried multiplayer over the network though. But the campaign is fun and is really well balanced.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505257231, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505257231, "recommendationid": "34909887", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514603", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506890660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 841, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4182, "steamid": "76561198130664911", "num_games_owned": 76}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I usually am hesistant to write reviews but I wanted to spread some love for this game - I've been playing it for hours and still can't get enough of the Heroes-vibes it gives to me as a long year fan of the series.\n\nThere's been a lot said about this game and yes, there still are some bugs and some strange AI behaviour that can be annoying sometimes but I really enjoyed digging deep into all the factions' skill sets and specialities. In my opinion Might and Magic Heroes VII takes the best mechanics of the heroes games such as skill trees, artifact sets, building decisions, tactic phase at the beginning of combat and more.\nI really like that the quick combat that can be played manually if the player is dissatisfied with the result and the magic skills and different factions seem very balanced to me.\n\nI have some issues with the creature design - the creatures look amazing but to me they lacked some love in terms of sound design and abilities. You have to focus more on skilling your hero to come up with interesting strategies since the creatures are mostly just for the purpose of hitting and shooting, no specials. \n\nThe music is gorgeous - you just never get sick of it even after hours of playing, it's enchanting and catchy and makes you enjoy staying in town a little longer, even the enemy's turn is fun when you listen to the music.  The soundscapes are beautiful and the interface sounds are great.\n\nIn total I really recommend the game to all people - be it fans of the Might and Magic series or not - it's a good addition to the series and a lot of fun!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506925988, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506925988, "recommendationid": "35406844", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505833189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561198007799091", "num_games_owned": 118}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Unable to install Uplay.

I've played them since I was a child and have played through every single game and expansion. \n\n4, and 6 have been controversial games in the series as it has really divided fans over the years as with these installments, different ideas were employed that were not viewed so favorably. \n\nHeroes 7 does fix some of the mistakes that plagued 6 and does feel like more of a classic heroes game, but it does come at a cost and with its own slew of issues. Its incredibly buggy. Sometimes it takes me multiple times just to make it to the loading screen. Quests can break, but that is usually fixed by exiting and restarting the game. And lastly, with few exceptions, there's really a lack of any challenge. The AI is pretty dumb and will usually just lay down while you steam roll over them. I found this especially true when enemies would prefer to just sit there and take it when you have an AOE spell that lasts multiple turns, as opposed to escaping the area.\n\nAll that being said, there is a good game here. It feels more like a heroes game than its predecessor, there is a huge amount of content, and the way the campaign plays out is unique, even if I may prefer the traditional way the campaign was told.
