If your internet connection is down, or if Black Jacket's servers are down, the game will not run at all. Further, Black Jacket has no publicly-viewable privacy policy that I could find, so be mindful of what they do with your personal data.\n\nIt's good that there is at least bot support, because you will have a very difficult time finding anyone online to play with outside of special events. Unfortunately, the bot AI is very simplistic and rarely uses any sort of team tactics like passing and coordination, so you won't get much enjoyment at all if you're planning on playing solo.\n\nThe core gameplay is fun - basically soccer with tanks. If you do have a group of friends to play with, you may get some enjoyment out of it, but I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone else."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1385689471, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511684", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "7816600", "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003046745", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 437}, "timestamp_updated": 1385689471, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Metal Drift is a fun game for the very few hours you will playing it.\nIt is a third person combat car game where you need to kill the opponent and take the ball in middle to score with it.\nDon't expect to play this over the net since there is never any servers running and if there is it is only 1 other person.\n\nI would highly recommend getting the 4-pack twice and play with 7 irl friends that is where this game gets fun.\n\nIf on sale I would highly recommend buying it to try it out other than that there is far better games out there."}, {"votes_down": 10, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1414441515, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529188", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "12660669", "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198044695906", "num_reviews": 54, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 144}, "timestamp_updated": 1414441515, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Wha is good on a Multiplayer game?\nThe challenge of Player VS Player, correct?\nAnd what if you don't have friends to play with?\nOh well, there must be a story mode, or at least a flat setting to set you up for action, right?\nSo... what might go wrong here?\n\nWell Metal Drift firstly needs to register to play.\nI bought the game guys.... hello?????\nWhy did you had to force us to register to play.\nGee bad move, whatever.\n\nAfter the whole proccess I logged in to find what?\nAlmost empty servers and.... no story mode.\n\nSo If I wont convince a firend of mine to buy the game, I can not actually play it, right?\nWell guess what, this is a NO from me.\n\nIt is a very VERY rare thing putting a thumbs down on a game.\nBut I can't play it.\nNo seriously... if I had some friends playign with me I could give it a shot and recommend it on discount.\nBut now what can i do?!\n\nBy the way, graphics are not something special...\n gameplay is average, can't tell if it is boring or not though, SINCE I CAN NOT PLAY ALONE....\n\nIt's a no for me and I am really sorry.\nI know that fanboys will come and rate this down but I don't really care.\nReally, think about it.\nSpending money on a game you can not enjoy, how would YOU feel?"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1305884266, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516422", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "506235", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971269084", "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1383761729, "num_games_owned": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6101}, "timestamp_updated": 1385405840, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This small little \"Capture the flag with hover tanks\"-game is real fun!\nNice graphic, good arenas, a level-up-system with new weapons and tank improvements.

I bought this game quite some time ago now and enjoyed playing it over LAN at home with friends and against bots. I'd like to tell you what changes were made in the last update to this game, but I can't because the devs decided we now have to create an online account with password in order to play at all. It would've been nice to give people the option to continue playing over LAN without forcing players online with strangers. I enjoy playing multiplayer online sometimes, but there are plenty of times that I just don't want to. I enjoyed things the way they were. \n\nIf you know nothing about the game, it's basically like the old Car Wars arena play from Steve Jackson Games, but these vehicles hover. I enjoyed the game a lot for what it's worth, but if you want to play you need to get used to the idea that an online account is required. I can't review any of the changes since the last major update that added the account requirement with no option to bypass. As it is, if you like cars and weapons in an arena, this is okay... but wait for it to go on sale. \n\nI do recommend the game overall with the notable provisions stated above. My kids didn't really like playing it very much. They'd rather play a lot of other games instead of this. I have deleted the game from my system, but if my kids ever change their minds about playing... maybe I'll make an account for it. Maybe. Sometimes I just want to play over LAN with people I know, but the devs excluded that option.

Multiplayer is difficult to find if not nonexistent.  While you can still technically play it with bots for a lot of people it isn't as fun.  I will leave my review as stands because despite the tragedy of it being abandoned I still adore this game, and really wish that it can either be picked back up or that another game developer makes a similar style game.  This is a warning to anybody expecting to try and buy the game now; if you are looking for multiplayer, you will be disappointed.\n\nMetal Drift is honestly a jewel amidst broken glass; a diamond in the rough.  There are too few games of its caliber out in the general PC world anymore, and most are either too expensive, too limited in what they can provide, or too broken to even be worth playing, usually any number of the three mixed together.\n\nThe general synopsis: Metal Drift is what I like to call Soccer with Tanks and Lasers.  You're given two teams; one blue, Athalon, and one red, Triax; and a ball in the center of the map.  Players grab the ball and try to take it to the enemy's base to goal...only it's not that simple.  Players can die and explode into bits and pieces, some players can be sneaky and use power-ups to one-side you.  As you play the game, you level up your skills and unlock different weapons and skills; from the starter auto-repair and basic blaster, to the all-powerful shock cannon and teleportation ability, there is a guarantee that there will be a specific ability and weapon combo that will fit your playstyle.\n\nNow, the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n+ Great narration/voice actor for narrating\n+ Awesome gameplay\n+ Great level variety\n+ Good graphics without the cost of a high pc; my craptop could run this smoothly at 4 years old.\n\nCons:\n\n- AI has a tendency to gang up on you if you're closer than the bot with the ball\n- A very tiny playerbase...save for private communities there isn't much in the way of a playerbase.\n\nThis game NEEDS to be more popular.  It is amazing, fun, and engrossing.  The fact that it looks like a really good game that easily trumps any full-price game of its caliber currently on the market, and costs much less as well, should make it a very popular title.  It's sad that nobody plays this besides the few private groups out there, and there needs to be more players.  I DEFINITELY, beyond a doubt, recommend this game to any passersby, just because of how fun it is.\n\n-Kerian"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1357584993, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499136", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "6409537", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198065678891", "num_reviews": 34, "last_played": 1497511477, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 19218}, "timestamp_updated": 1385405859, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Would I recommend it?
