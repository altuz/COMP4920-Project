In hindsight I ought to have paid more attention to the fact that the reviewer had only clocked up about 15 minutes recorded gametime, and also the boast that the game was developed by the same guy who brought us \"back to life 2\" and \"back to life 3\" (check out their reviews). But I'm a sucker for something \"different\" and it was on sale for \u00a30.79 so I thought what the heck. \n\nWell I think there's the germ of a good game idea here but it would need w-a-a-a-y more work to make it enjoyable to play. Where to start? First a general comment about the production values. Put it this way; the initial screen containing the configuration info for the main game contains a facility to alter the default key bindings - but guess what? There are a dozen actions listed none of which correspond to the game that is about to be launched!\n\nNext- the inadequate instructions. \"The aim of the game is to save a number of prisoners in the maze of each level and bring them to a save point placed randomly within the maze, and to do this you have to group them  and bring them to a save point placed randomly within the maze\".  We are told that key \"E\" \"groups the prisoners near the selected point\", and we have mouse control over the \"protagonist's\" direction, mouse click to move and spacebar to shoot the nastys, \"You can only group the prisoners near the 'group point' i.e. those who are inside the large coloured target\".  \n\nClear so far? No? OK let me fill in the gaps. The mouse controls not only the player's direction but also the position of the \"large coloured target\" which is a blue hexagon I initially thought was there simply to help the player aim. The player moves by keeping the LMB depressed while steering with the mouse. When the \"prisoners\" are found (a group of small cubes like lego bricks) you put the hexagon where you want the prisoners to move to, and press the E key. All the time you have to be alert to the enemies (large green cubes) which require blasting by aiming at them using the mouse, and pressing the space key. So there are 3 keys (E, space, and LMB) each of which produce directional effects, but only one aiming device. That's the first big problem with the game mechanics: if you want to fire at an enemy which isn't directly ahead, you need to stop, turn and stop leading your prisoners. I suppose this could be seen as part of the challenge of the game, but the challenge ought to be enjoyable and wrestling with the control system isn't. \n\nThen there's the fact that you are shooting enemies in narrow corridors when your prisoners are very fragile themselves. Almost inevitably what happens is that while you are trying to lead your prisoners to the save point you will find them between you and an enemy. What do you do then? Unless you are close enough to move past them in time, when you shoot at the enemy, you destroy all your prisoners in the process. There's nothing else you can do to stay alive. And the prisoners move so slowly that the basic gameplay involves stopping and starting your own movement constantly to let the prisoners catch up, remembering to stop your own movement and your prisoners movement when you have to change aim to shoot an enemy. \n\nFinally there is the random element. Yes it's fun to have unique levels generated every turn, but you might find your save point next to 9 prisoners and you can win by just pressing the E key, or you might find it right next to an enemy spawn point making it almost impossible to deliver your prisoners safely. \n\nAll in all I suspect the gameplay would get repetitive if I had the patience to stick with the game long enough to judge but I haven't.

There was some challenge to it after I learned the basics. I can see how later it would become very challenging. I wasn't able to find a volume adjustment which was a little frustrating though. Feel free to take a look at the video i'm uploading to YouTube if you want a better idea of what this is like to play this for the first time. I would recommed this game if you are looking for something kind of new and different.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/HiddenLevelStart", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423170882, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423170882, "recommendationid": "14343606", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476946", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
