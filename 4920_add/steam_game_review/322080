You could probably splice together a few chunks of random LiveJournal pages and get the same result as the diary entries.

If you want a psychological platformer, just play Psychonauts again.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496671542, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496671542, "recommendationid": "32199814", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495540", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 31, "total_reviews": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 14}}
