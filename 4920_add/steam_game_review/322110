Not a frame of slowdown, not a frame between pressing a button and my character doing the thing I told them to do and no dodgy hit or collision detection.\n\nSo with that said, there are a few minor irritations I have, but since it gets the above right, they're in no way deal breakers. The art style is a bit... newgrounds? (Although not without its nice touches in animation, like charging up a shot or when at low health). The cutscenes are really rather low budget and seem to tell a different story to what the gameplay and lore actually says. the music however is excellent and exactly what you'd expect from a game like this.\n\nThe rest of it is the usual issues that you will either love or hate about the RNG nature of rougelites. So if you like that, you'll like that here, if not, you won't.

The name of the game is simple: beat all the bosses and give the big bad(s) at the end what for. However, as roguelikes do, if you die on your journey to defeat all the bosses once (or three times if you play on the easier \"Reverent\" mode) you will be forced to start again. On your multiple \"runs\" you will acquire augs, items that improve your parameters, cores, armor pieces with varying abilities which can be mixed and matched to suit your playstyle, and different basic weapons, altering your basic attack, for the current run. A unique currency, soul chips, can be earned on your runs to unlock new items to appear or buy a few already unlocked items that you can use on your next run. There are two characters, Nina and Ace, who function very similarly to characters X and Zero, respectively. You can switch between which one you want to play in between runs in the hub area. \n\nLevel design is procedurally generated. While this is nothing unusual for a roguelike, this is the part where I stress that Megaman X fans may not love this game as much as other people are saying they might. In Megaman X games each level was carefully crafted and could be revisited at any time. Whichever stage you went to first, there would doubtless be little secrets or areas that you couldn't access until you had a specific upgrade or weapon. Then, you would revisit it, and get the item that was behind that wall or underneath that truck or anywhere else under the sun that it might've been. 20XX loses that element due to procedural generation of levels. There's no set order for you to receive core (armour) upgrades and after one boss you only have 3 random bosses out of the remaining bosses to choose from, along with being unable to revisit cleared levels in that run. There are out of the way small hidden areas with augs, but in my opinion there is only one specific generated secret area that is actually that hard to spot.\n\nI bought this game a while back during early access after seeing mention of it elsewhere and as a fan of both Megaman and roguelikes was instantly hooked. While I haven't been around supporting the game as long as most longtime supporters, I have seen the work that has been put into this game by the developers in that short time and I can see that they truly care about this game. That is a very strong quality that is sometimes missing in certain games nowadays. As you play, read up on all the enemies and items, and listen to the music you can see the love put into it by all parties involved.\n\nA condensed list of pros and cons, some that I didn't touch on above\n\nPros:\n-A soundtrack so good it's a crime\n-For the most part, plays like a Megaman X game\n-Online leaderboards and rankings catered to speed runners\n-Massive replayability\n-Local and Online multiplayer\n   -Both players can play as the same character if they want to\n-Just funny enough\n-Lots of data lore on every item, core, boss and enemy in the game accessible with more appearing as you defeat them more and more times. For you readers out there who want a taste of the world and setting of 20XX (like me)\n-Has been polished for years by a very devoted team\n-The soundtrack is so good I have to give it two separate points\n-A hard \"Defiant\" mode for players who want a challenge, with a multitude of modifiers to make your game harder\n-A robot cat\n-Really good looking\nCons:\n-Lacks certain Megaman X elements that may make or break the deal for some people\n-Procedural generation may get boring after seeing the same combinations a lot of times\n-Some secret areas are not so secret and also suffer from being repetitive\n-Controls may feel more \"slippery\" compared to Megaman X\n-No secret street fighter moves\n-Some players may have to unlock a large amount of items before being able to finish a run due to difficulty spikes at certain points catching someone off guard\n\nTo bring things to a close, 20XX is not what Mighty No. 9 should've been, but shares elements of what mighty no.9 was emulating. If you are looking for a real classic Megaman X game that has everything that that series did, you will not be wholly satisfied with 20XX, but may still find it a pretty neat game. If you're into roguelikes, definitely give this a whirl. Even if you're a Megaman X fan, I would still recommend you give this game a try so long as you aren't put off by the roguelike aspect. \n\nOne last little thing from me. It's easy to say this game is \"A Megaman X roguelike\" and possibly disappoint a few people but I have come to love this game as itself and not as a Megaman X-esque roguelike. Even if you have no expectations going in, I totally recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505270213, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505270213, "recommendationid": "34912072", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505669407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1183, "steamid": "76561197968679602", "num_games_owned": 848}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I cannot imagine a life where i would have skipped this one, and it would have been so easy to dismiss it as another cheap Indie shooty-mcplatformy thingie.\n\nI'm glad i actually went trough and bought this.

That game was so painful it made me bitterly against roguelikes.\nTo paraphrase the current US president: \"The problem with Enter the Gungeon is not that it implemented rogue-like elements wrong, but that it implemented rogue-like elements faithfully.\"\n\n20XX is different, better, and far more fun. This is because it removes the most terrible rogue-like element; 20XX removes torturing the player for no just or discernable reason and then removing your all progress in the game.\n\nThat being said, here some 20XX flaws:\n-Moving platforms are sometimes too close vertically to jump in between them, or too closely packed together otherwise, causing many unnecessary falls. Some non-moving platforms also have this problem.\nExamples include certain areas randomly found in the Fire Level (Agnisort I think it was called), the Sky Temple to a lesser extent, and the final level\n-Your movement and jump stat bonuses will kill you. If you improve your speed too much, your character will fly off so fast they miss the platform you were aiming for. If you improve jump height too much, your character will accidentally slam into a spike or damage area. Movement needs to be consistent in a platformer, or it breaks the player's rythym.\n-Minor art concerns. Not the style, but the animations bother me. The best example I have is when you stop walking. When you come to a halt, your upper body flings forwards slightly. It would make more since if the character stopped themselves with their legs, like happens in real life, but instead their upper body swings like a bobblehead for a moment. There are more examples of animations like this, but I don't have time to nitpick all of them.\n\nRegardless of the above dialog, I will end this review with a sentiment many people here have clearly said and echoed.\n\"Don't get Mighty No. 9, get 20XX!\"", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506776449, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506776449, "recommendationid": "35336405", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507074798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 168, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 679, "steamid": "76561198239208778", "num_games_owned": 98}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Now that this game has became a FULL release since i bought it a while back, i wanna give my honest review (opinion). Let's Rock! First of all, given the title, it's very Mega man X and to be fair, that's a huge +1 in my book.\n\nI grew up playing all the megaman games, espically the X series, as a child (and now). 20XX does what the lack of X (megaman) content we have gotten through the 10+ years by beloved fans creating their own vision and gameplay mechanics to life. The creators kept improving week by week with communicating with the fans to make the game  FLIPPING AMAZING! It's like the creators wanted us to take part in this, deep down, i say \"yes, that was their plan\" because this game feels alive and fresh.\n\nMighty #9 was a HUGE disapointment, it was slow, janky controls, poor level designs and was not fun in the slightest. I'm gonna talk about the individual aspect of 20XX...\n\n[Story]\nAs of course, judging by the title of the game, this does take place in the 20XX. Chaos starts happening around world, it's up to Nina (Megamwoman) and Ace (Zero) to save the day or earth or... their payment debts? actually the story is nothing to carzy, very megaman, which is fine.\n\n[Gameplay]\n20XX really took influences from the X series and snorted a ton of crack because holy HELL this game is FAST PACED!!! I've never heard my controller make so many clicks in my life since Megaman X4! The controls is tight and responsive. if you missed the platform or fall to your death, that's YOUR fault, not the game. The biggest mechanic in the game is the RPG elements. There are items, armors, shops, slot machine, weapons and secret weapons throughtout the game and it'll drastically change the way you play the game. You could be a tank built doing 100 damage for your basic attack and have 20+ health or become SONIC THE FREAKIN HEDGEHOG with your speed over 10+ and pass the through the main course in a heartbeat. The choice is yours alone playing the game. What makes this game have more replay value is the SEED system, meaning random generated levels like \"The Binding of Issac\". No area is the same. This game can be really hard, if not prepared or skilled enough.\n\nSPOILERS! SPOILERS!\n\n[Final Level/Final Boss]\nWhen I first played this game back on early release, they only had 3 bosses fully functional until NOW!!! After defeating all 8 bosses, you think your done until you go up to the teleporter at the end of 8th stage saying \"Onward\" and i'm like \"Wut?\" so you proceed on until you're in freakin SPACE! SPACE, THE FINAL FRONTIER! This level test all abilities for the final fight. YOU WILL DIE!!! This level is difficult, the enemies are stronger and level design is made to tick you off. Finally, reaching the end of the level, you fignt one of the evil doctors. He LITERALLY is a hybrid of all the bosses you fought. Shootin Minecraft? yep. Shootin ice shoots? check. Fire balls on your balls? Double check. This is a tough fight because the pattern is all over the place. I was damage boosting most of the time because i was like \"how dodge? Dodge to? WHAAAAAAAAAAT IS HAPPENING!\" After clawing your way to victory, you're rewarded 3 power ups letting you know that there is 1 level left... F#@K! You thought the previous level was hard? Pfffff nah. This level is Satan's butthole. However, somehow reaching the final fight. The final boss wasn't hard or anything but it was memorable because the room is HUGE and played out like small level to pass through and damage him. After defeating the boss, you think a cutscene or something but something feels off. After proceeding on, you go through another door then EVERYTHING IS BLOWING UP! WHOAAAAAAAAA! You have to dash your way out to the escape pod. Finally reaching the escape pod, you get brief cutscene of our main heroes escaping, the ship blows up their escape pod leaving a \"MMZ4 ending\" until it pans to the right to show our heroes alive and well.\n\n[The END]\nThis game melts my heart with how far it has become. I give this game a \"Play the hell out of it\" Now if you excuse me, I'm gonna play it some more!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507040638, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507040638, "recommendationid": "35447399", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506389287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 516, "steamid": "76561197968657577", "num_games_owned": 971}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "A must-play for anyone who still has a special place in their heart for Mega Man X.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505359343, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505359343, "recommendationid": "34941500", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495146", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507166081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 389, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1611, "steamid": "76561198054431366", "num_games_owned": 101}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A perfect throwback to the days of Mega Man.
