(Sadly, \"Midnight, the Stars, and You\" doesn't play during this sequence).\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple. After character creation, you enter one of several princess worlds and resolve to help the people there with whatever problems they might have. You are armed with a magic wand, with which you can fire magic bolts or flourish it to trigger different environmental effects. Occasionally you will be called upon to fight Heartless (not their real names, but I never bothered to remember what their stupid name was and they're basically the same as Heartless); however, they pose no challenge as you can basically spam the spacebar to rapid-fire your wand and clear all foes off the screen.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice, for the time the game came out. There are worlds that (to a youngster) would be quite large and fun to explore (as an oldster myself, I was able to sprint through most everywhere in no time flat). There are lots of cute animals all over the place, the one true metric of a good game.\n\nThe game scatters gems all over, whether sitting out in the open, squirreled away in chests, or rewards for completing tasks. The most you can hold is 999, and they have no discernible use. \n\nAt one point, there's a minigame where you have to save the memories of the merpeople from Ariel's world from sinking deep into the ocean. It's fun to just let the rocks sink down, since there's no penalty for a miss anyway. Take that, memories.\n\nSnow White only has four dwarf friends. Sneezy, Sleepy, and Bashful were presumably killed and eaten. \n\nAll in all, this is a good game for children, and a fun game to ironically play for adults.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492066520, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492066520, "recommendationid": "31111289", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511202", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497775917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22, "steamid": "76561198011939502", "num_games_owned": 47}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Bought this game to play it with my 3 year old daughter, who loves the Disney princesses. I have to say that I am very disappointed.\n\nThe game lacks controller support. There are simple workarounds to that, by using third party software to map controller buttons to keys and mouse events, but out of the box, the game is far too difficult to control for a small child.\n\nThere isn't much story, which is acceptable given the audience. The gameplay feels clumsy much of the time, as well as the controls, in sequences where timing is of some importance. The game interface shows symbols of what keys to press (on the keyboard), but because we have mapped these to a controller, it provides us with nothing but confusion.\n\nWhen the game has been completed (which doesn't take very long), it is possible to revisit all locations, but there is absolutely nothing to do. All the enemies and tasks are gone, making it really boring to play afterwards. We started over from the beginning, but it quickly became boring to revisit the game.\n\nI appreciate the fact that this game is one of very few which are available in our native language.
