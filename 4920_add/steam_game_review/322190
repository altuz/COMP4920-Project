There are unlockable skills, equipment bonuses and of course different hat styles to consider. Great turn based strategy game \u00e1 la X-Com or Worms. The visuals are stunning! Fantastic soundtrack, partially by \"Steampowered giraffe\", who are really cool.

I call this game casual because it's not too challenging and it's not too complex either; it's just very fun to play. Everything this game offers is at least good.

I do want to report an error in the game to the developers though. On a mission like royalist tax enforcers an enemy royalist hit the generator taking it out.

Regardless to say with 2 explosion weapon experts i was unable to hit the generator and complete the misssion.\n\nOne of the best games ever though!\nWould break the game with a rogue royalist again 10/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505923102, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505923102, "recommendationid": "35086958", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498707", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506829756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 792, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19480, "steamid": "76561197970520344", "num_games_owned": 111}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is very addicting.
