And I totally approve this game.\n\n[h1][i]INTRO. What is Guns, Gore & Cannoli about?[/i][/h1]\n1925, Thugtown is invaded by zombies. You are Vinnie Cannoli and your boss hired you to get someone safe and out of town. Trust me, there's no need to know more, as the best part are characters, situations, humour and gameplay.\n\n[h1][i]GRAPHIC. Engine And Artistic aspects.[/i][/h1]\nBeautiful. Simply beautiful. The game is a cartoon platform, very colored, nice characters art style, most of them recalling stereotypes or movies (my character is the one resembling the Godfather, of course) and locations or enemies are often hiding some reference or gag as well.\n\n[h1][i]SOUNDTRACK. Themes and Accompaniments.[/i][/h1]\nI wasn't expecting that but here comes the sweet. According to the year there's some 20s band-like music with kind of a cheerful mood that gets in total contrast with the constant splatter situations through the whole game. Simply hilarious.\n\n[h1][i]GAMEPLAY. How does it work?[/i][/h1]\nJust like any platform. You jump, you shoot, you find weapons and grenades, there are bosses. I could call this a 1920s Metal Slug on steroids. There's a local coop mode with up to 4 players, because just like all metal slugs you enjoy it better with friends. Too bad there's no multiplayer besides shared screen.\n\n[h1][i]LAST NOTES. What doesn't work?[/i][/h1]\nNot much about the game, actually. It's more about technical issues, such as the lack of a multiplayer/coop online, or the ridiculously buggy joypad setup. Luckily for me I don't play with joypads, but it's quite embarassing when you set them up for your friends and every key binding gets lost every time the game starts, and once in game everytime we all die joypads lose association with the player, forcing us to set up everything again.\n\n[h1][i]TL;DR. Pros And Cons[/i][/h1]\n[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]\n[*][b] THE GAME.[/b] A good platform playable in coop with friends, filled with humour and stereotypes about Italy.\n[/list]\n[h1]---CONs---[/h1][list]\n[*][b] NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER.[/b] Which is nonsense. Shared screen is great until you try joypads, but There's no chance to play with friends online nor even on a Local Network, which is nonsense from a sale point of view.\n[*][b] JOYPADS.[/b] The joypads association system is buggy. And I'm being generous while trying not to swear talking about how bad it works. Briefly: it doesn't keep settings even in game once everyone dies.\n[/list]\n\n[i]I played this game on this machine:\nLaptop Lenovo Z50\nIntel Core i5-4210U\n8Gb RAM DDR3\nGeForce 840M/Intel HD Graphics 4400\nWindows 10 Home x64[/i]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506511862, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506516293, "recommendationid": "35239892", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517934", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506810623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 244, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 764, "steamid": "76561198003495525", "num_games_owned": 308}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "GG&C reminds me of Contra, legendary NES game.

And what Guns, Gore & Cannoli does different is put forth some real effort into graphics, art styles and voice acting to make a stellar side scroller that doesn't rely on dated \"8-bit\" graphics.\n\nThe story is cheesy and entertaining, and comedic in the same way that the names of the characters in Airplane! were. You are Vince Cannoli, a local mob enforcer sent to Thugtown to do your job. However once you arrive, you find the whole town is in the thick of a zombie outbreak released during St. Patrick's Day. With a gun, a lot of one-liners and a desire to see his job through, Vince goes through the town trying to figure out why the hell this is all happening.\n\nGameplay is fairly rudimentary, basic movement and weapons with little variation but easy to understand without going into elaborate details. The Graphics and Artstyle are the game's trick card, because they're stellar for what it is. While it is 2D, the basic look is comic inspired. And I don't mean \"Telltale's lazy shading\" I mean actually comic book inspired, like Dick Tracy or The Shadow. Character features are slightly exaggerated while detail is still taken. Every gun can be positively ID'd, there's some intriquite detail behind both backgrounds and the various enemy types in the game and there are moments where I did go \"This is some impressive looking shit\".\n\nSo if you want a side scrolling shooter that isn't knee deep in 8 or 16 bit art style with a fun main character, solid gameplay, great graphics and options for local co-op, here you go. Guns, Gore & Cannoli is enjoyable as hell to play, and I'll applaud the devs for actually trying to make an interesting and different game in a marketplace filled with generic similar crud.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505785547, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505785547, "recommendationid": "35056150", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506481608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 66, "steamid": "76561198248908276", "num_games_owned": 35}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Got it because it was on sale and looked like a good time waster i could play during classes\nWay Too Repetitive\nEntire game just feels like grinding, zombies are not fun to fight, they are just annoying \nOverall poor game, feels like the kind of thing you would find on MiniClip", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506481815, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506481815, "recommendationid": "35234523", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 318, "total_reviews": 344, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 26}}
