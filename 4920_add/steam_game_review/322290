You're a young girl and are attempting to help your monster friends save their home. And reclaim lost furniture.\n\nWhat carries this game is its charm; there's something likable about the characters and setting. It feels \"Studio Ghibli-ish\"; those that know the studio and have watched a few of their movies know exactly what I mean. There's a child-like whimsical nature encapsulated in the experience which the character designs, music, art style, and the totality of the visual helps convey. It makes for an entertaining experience everytime you boot it up; but that just might be me since I believe unique visual flairs to titles add to the experience and make them uniquely their own. This is one of those titles that people would place in that, \"I would enjoy a cartoon series or short episodes of this being made\" because what's here is fantastic.\n\nThe game itself is no slouch: whilst clearly targetted at children its still quality. It's on the easier side, but you'll still see the game over screen a few times and get damaged plenty, especially when you're attempting to get used to the game during the initial stages. The title is a mixture of platformers, light puzzle game, but is mostly a 1 button fighter with a few special moves and a drill that can be charged in battle. The charge is required against most enemies as they have armor, and the armor needs to be obliterated through a charged attack. You have an attack button, a dodge button, and a jump button. Simple.\n\nMy only complaint is the inclusion of the critical system in the game. At the top of the screen there is a bar and musical notes coming from the left and right side of the bar meeting in the middle. If you attack anything when the musical notes meet in the middle of the bar, you get a critical hit. Critical hits build up your drill's power and inflict more damage. The mechanic is interesting, but you will never realistically be stopping your attacks to time hits better. As it stands, criticals are incidental more than anything, as no one stops in the middle of striking opponents to get the timing down properly. It's like telling you you can juggle during matrix fights-its impractical. It's a superfluous mechanic.\n\nAlso worth noting is the weak sauce that is some of the \"worlds\" having levels that are just mirror versions of previous levels. Feels like padding and lazy as hell. It's not a lot of levels, and some are interesting, but still worth noting.\n\nI'd place this game in the same categories as some of the Kirby Titles and Starfy: games that look to have a certain target market but bely an experience that can be enjoyed by all. Although the comparison is a little unfair, as the aforementioned franchises tend to have titles that usually lack any semblance of a challenge. This game may be targetted at younger audiences but it will still trip you up here and there. Additionally, the plot has depth that you otherwise wouldn't expect.\n\nAll in all, recommended. The game isn't particularly *amazing* or anything PHENOMENAL, but it has so much charm and the totality of the package makes for an enjoyable experience. The ending was bitter sweet for me as I wanted to see more of these characters and wished for it to continue. You get a solid game with characterization reminiscent of a child's movie that adults can enjoy even moreso than children due to its innocence that is lost on those that lack the ability to place nostalgic value on it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501915602, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501977850, "recommendationid": "34031925", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508148", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501521198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 581, "steamid": "76561198064433548", "num_games_owned": 93}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game reminds me of all the great action adventure games in the Playstation/Gamecube-Era.
