No, seriously. I'm beyond making jokes today. What in the name of whichever god, creation event or tentacle-waving space beast that managed to vomit up this galaxy is this catastrophe?\n\nI've played bad games on here before. We all have. We've all suffered that involuntary cringe when the 'Made in Unity' launch screen pops up, anticipating the sea of stock assets and buggy unoptimised crap that's about to come flooding towards us like that scene with the crimson elevator in [i]The Shining[/i], except with a tidal wave of livestock diarrhoea but... this?\n\n[b]Bubonic: Outbreak[/b] isn't just lazy. Oh, that it were simply lazy. Lazy would just rip unmodified asset maps straight out of the pack they were bought from and use them for [b]every single stage[/b]. Lazy would be taking the lockpicking and safe-cracking mini-games from one of those same packs and failing to ensure that they even functioned. Lazy would be forgetting to take the useless 'Journal' out of the game from a previous build so that should you activate it by accident, there's no way to remove it from the screen. Lazy would be the same enemy repeated ad infinitum throughout the game. Lazy would be neglecting to map any button for a player to read the notes. Lazy would be placing a script for a door key inside a safe and then not actually bothering to [b]PHYSICALLY[/b] place a key inside that safe, leaving the player to just fucking guess that they were staring at anything other than thin mocking air.\n\nNo, what makes this game special is that you're given a torch and a camera with two vision modes to make your way around: night vision and ghost vision. Ghost vision, as I'm sure you need spelling out for you, is the [b]only[/b] way to see the spirits that will otherwise insta-kill you so guess which other two lighting methods become immediately redundant? Guess what you'll be staring at for the entire playthrough? That's right! [b]A TINY NEON BLUE BOX[/b]. Wow, it's like a tour of all my favourite Unity assets [b]IN GLORIOUS MIGRAINE-INDUCING 240p.[/b] \n\nThis is an honest-to-god atrocity. \u00a35.99 is a sick joke for something that will be begging to be played for \u00a30.17p in the next sale or clinging to the arsehair of an IndieGala bundle.
