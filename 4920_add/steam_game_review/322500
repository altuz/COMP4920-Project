At a stand still everything is in slow motion, allowing you to plan out your approach. \"Time moves when you move\" That being said every movement and action causes time to run normally, which makes it important for you to think before going into action. While dodging pass zooming bullets you'll be given different tools to dispatch the foes that stand in your way. Some of those tools being: Fire-arms, melee weapons, and even the work-phone in your cubicle.\n\nThe gameplay is great, but the game itself does not contain a lot\n\nYou're given a short, not so compelling story; with a few interesting twists.
