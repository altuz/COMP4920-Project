That in mind, I hope others who might be a fan of the series as well might be able to take what I say about this particular game more to heart.\n\nOn to it: The Empire series is one of my favourite in the DW\u2019s line, I probably play them more than the main game series to be quite frank. That being said, Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires was a bit of a let down compared to past installments. I believe anyone who might have never played an Empires game or even a Dynasty Warriors game who would still be able to pick this game up and thoroughly enjoy it.\n\nI initially played the game on my PS4, where I had to stop because it kept crashing my system, so instead reluctantly rebought the PC port. Which is really all it is, a port to the PC from the PS4. The controls can be really off-putting at times, and I would highly suggest never playing this game without a controller. Going into a full list of cons, again, I want to state that these will be coming from the perspective of someone who plays the actual series and not just this singular game alone.\n\nCons:\n\n-The game is a step back from previous versions. Dynasty Warriors 7 Empires had MUCH more content in it. More dialogue, better cut-scenes, an overall better system. It was just a better game. So to see DW8E get worse was really\u2026 discouraging to someone who pretty much dropped $100 just to be able to keep playing the game. \n\n-Character customization options have literally not changed at all. Facial adjustments have maybe slightly improved? Otherwise it\u2019s mostly just all brought over from DW7E.\n\n-To any long time fans of the series, it\u2019s really not worth $50. I mean, that\u2019s a really hefty price-tag, and while I do feel perhaps some buyer's remorse from having paid double to keep playing, I also enjoy Empires enough that I really would have preferred to be able to play it on my PC. Even if the PC port is kinda okay.\n\n-This is redundant, and I know it is, but it really bothered me how bad interactions and dialogue were. There is no visiting cities anymore? No walking about and actually seeing how your rule affects people. It\u2019s just an occasional cutscene, and it really takes away from the immersion of the game. \n\n-Children system is still trash, and you can only have one. And from what gameplay I have done, your spouses no longer heal you if you\u2019re on the battlefield with them and injured. \n\n-DW8 in general was a step back from DW7 as it was, so truthfully, I can\u2019t be too surprised that the Empires series suffered some as well.\n\nPros:\nThese judgements are steered more towards new players of the series, as the game still does have redeemable qualities.\n\n- From just a game standpoint alone, it\u2019s fun. There are lots of campaigns to do, and hours worth of difficult battles to participate in.\n\n-You can have your own character who can marry off any random officer or notorious officer and have a kid who you can also play with. As stated in the cons, the system isn\u2019t amazing, but it\u2019s still a fun little thing that\u2019s there.\n\n-Tons of variety in characters and fighting styles. Really, there is SO much to choose from, it\u2019s great.\n\n-It\u2019s a hack and slash, so you get to run around killing thousands of people and it\u2019s pretty rewarding for just that alone.\n\n-The added strategy of the Empire series allows you to try different techniques in how you would like to take over all of China. You can rule with an iron fist, be really benevolent, or be downright tyrannical. Depending on which route you choose, your gameplay might prove to be more difficult, which is part of the enjoyment of the game.\n\n-You don\u2019t have to be a ruler. You can assist in helping bring someone else to power. Tear someone else down. Overthrow rulers, etc. The possibilities are really quite high.\n\nIn the end, while it might be easy for me to say \u201cthis game is bad compared to DW7\u201d objectively it is not a terrible game by any standards. If I had to drop a flat rating on it, I\u2019d give it a 6/10 and I do recommend it to people who might like to try an Empires game on the PC. I think anyone who might want a fun game to play would like it for what it is, but anyone who has ever touched a DW game beforehand would be able to clearly see its glaring flaws.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501963361, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501963361, "recommendationid": "34045436", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493614", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502060445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 598, "steamid": "76561198078003454", "num_games_owned": 152}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I've probably put in atleast 50+hrs into this offline.\nAmazing game.\nTerrible port.\nHave a controller AND this game is on sale?
