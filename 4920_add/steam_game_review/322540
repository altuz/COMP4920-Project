I'm a big fan of 4x and grand strategy, but this is just clunky. I looked past the graphics (which aren't very good) and I didn't see much worth playing. How this game is $20 without a sale is actually astounding. Luckily I got this for $4 and could try it without much of a loss.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499912900, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499912900, "recommendationid": "33493597", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504539", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 21}}
