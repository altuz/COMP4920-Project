While the navigation of the death tunnels does require new insights and different ways of looking at things, the amount of agility required to execute the changes of perspective in a small amount of time may frustrate those who aren't veterans of the platforming genre. Then the level names start to sound all too apt: Denial, Anger, etc.\n\nThe progression of the game covers the five stages of grief, and you learn more about the narrator's tragedy by finding secret alcoves. The theme seems appropriate, as it requires a massive change of perspective to move on from loss. I will admit, though, that at times the journey seemed endless, and I wished each level were 25% shorter. \n\nGamers experienced in platformers may enjoy the interesting way that you rotate the world around you  by changing your Down.
