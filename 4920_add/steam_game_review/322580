It's very frustrating to quit the game, (come on after 2 hours) and when I want to restart, i have tostart ALL OVER again, yes, from the very beginning  I wonder if it's possible to put updates and include a SAVE button???  Also i cannot zoom in.  The fire buttons are working i suppose, I do get a yellow sphere.  but i cannot jump, hitting my space bar does absolutely nothing. Maybe there is an update andi don't know about it?  I have a sony vaio and Nivdie (spelling) sound card. An i7 and the graphics are great but the controls arent all there. Please email me if you have ideas to make it work better.  Thanks.  doug", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411524446, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1411524446, "recommendationid": "12212729", "language": "english", "votes_down": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510835", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1412425281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 161, "steamid": "76561197972928677", "num_games_owned": 171}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": "3", "review": "too many bugs - though the puzzles are fun", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412425395, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1412425395, "recommendationid": "12360409", "language": "english", "votes_down": 62, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434709", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
