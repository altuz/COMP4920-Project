You have to choose at least 2 keys that are useless in a game of this genere, if only was a good game.\nThis game weights 1.1 GB to download and this is stupid. There is no way a game with graphics like this could weight 1.1 gb, unless they packaged super high res sprites and texture that, frankly are really not needed for the purpose of a game like this.\nThe cinematics are frustratingly long and the script is so boring that at a point into the introductory cinematic I wish I were dead (they try to be funny and make jokes, but these are so bad that I truly whish are written by a 12 yr old).\nThat said, your AI companion is annoying as hell, it pops up every 15 seconds to say something stupid about black hole nano-fields jargon and when it does, you can no more control your charachter so you must wait the idiotic-without-any-purpose monologue to end to start playing the f***g game again.\nCharachter animation in really horrible, something you'd expect from a free flash game as said before, but not from a paid title.\nAt the end of the day this game is a puzzle platformer where you collect coins to win a level. If you collect more than a bare minimum you get more points. You can replay levels to best your previous score and that's it.\nThis is a game that, back in the days of phisical distribution, you would have found into the 4.99 bin at the store.\nI truly hate the developers for taking away 1.5 hours of my life.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499862069, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499862204, "recommendationid": "33478233", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481325", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 75, "total_reviews": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 23}}
