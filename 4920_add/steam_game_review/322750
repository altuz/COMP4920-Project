They are either boring in execution or painfully lacking in effectiveness. I've played a great variety of shmups of different sorts and I really expect the weapons to be more impressive in general. For the weapons in this game to do the job I need them to do requires excessive grinding which I don't appreciate in a single player game.\n\nWithout weapons being retuned I can't see myself playing anymore, let alone completing the game.\n\nEdit: Just a quick note for anyone wondering. My personal preference for a really good shmup would be something like R-Type Final if you've had the chance to play it. Really good replayability, and plenty of options for unique ship choices.
