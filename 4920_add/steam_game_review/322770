For a mere $13.99 (current sale price) you get a game that pushed the boundaries of what one could expect in a VR title.  This is a complete VR experience.  Don't let the negative reviews or the status of EA or lack of constant updates stop you from getting this game.  This is a MUST buy VR title.  If you own a Vive, Oculus, whatever, you owe it to yourself to experience this game.\n\nA lot of the negative reviews mention locomotion.  Well, you're not teleporting anymore unless you want to.  You can mostly move freely using your touch controller's joystick.  It's not perfect, you have to click down to go faster or to turn. But it's done very well. \n\nA lot of the other negative reviews mention lack of updates.  Well, this game is pretty much a finished product.  I have 1.7 hours on Steam currently and I still have not finished the game.  And there's a whole area I haven't explored.  Keep in mind that the normal price is $19.99.  This is a lot of content for the price.  And it's not just average content or above average content, this is AMAZING content for the price.  I played 1.7 hours straight because I was having so much fun.  I plan to get right back into the game later today.  That's because I loved the game world.  I have not experienced any bugs on the Oculus Rift w/ Touch.\n\nThe dungeons are so well designed and intuitive.  The puzzles are logical (no having to search for a  key that's hidden in some vase under a cabinet type crap).  The riddles are creative (yes, riddles).  You have different tools at your disposal, including food, pickaxe, torch, sword, shield, bow & arrow, or wand.  Also, climbing up the ropes or chains is just so much fun to get that extra bit of loot or spoiler alert [spoiler] burning curtains to get the items hidden beneath or breaking barrels with your sword to get more coins [/spoiler]\n\nAdmittedly, the weakest part of the game is probably the melee combat.  I didn't find it very challenging.  But I did enjoy using the bow and arrow.  And nothing is more satisfying that beating down that skeleton archer with a sword after he's been trying to pick you off.  \n\nRating 9/10 just a better story and improved melee combat and this game could have been legendary", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506210952, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506210952, "recommendationid": "35166667", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504225", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506483937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 149, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 392, "steamid": "76561198005146135", "num_games_owned": 991}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This game is amazing.

A bit simple and a bit naive but captivating nonetheless. Gameplay is based around dungeon crawling with some combat and an occasional puzzle thrown in for good measure. Movement is a combination of roomscale and artificial locomotion with a choice of teleportation and recently added free movement. I particularly enjoy the latter as it is implemented in a way that feels rather natural and is not VR sickness inducing in any way; there are even some advanced anti-sickness options for those who are succeptible. \n\nAll in all it's not a very long game in it's current state, main adventure(chapter 1) is about 4 hours but it was very enjoyable to play and certainly worth the money. Especially so given further expansions are expected with new adventure chapter.\n\nOn the technical side, game was running ok on my initial oculus+touch setup but certainly became more comfortable with 3 sensors as there were some issues with dead tracking zones when facing certain directions. Latest patch added optional stick turning so having full 360 tracking is not as importalt now but still preferrable for a more immersive and smooth experience.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506140456, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506140456, "recommendationid": "35143804", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502623", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505534417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 254, "steamid": "76561198412241348", "num_games_owned": 6}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This was my VR hooker, love this game.

Overall it's a great game, but although the recent partial addition of free movement has improved things in one area, having to click the thumbstick button to turn incrementally with Touch controllers is a really bad idea.  It makes things fiddly, imprecise and awkward and causes needless wear and tear on the switches, not to mention breaking the immersion.
