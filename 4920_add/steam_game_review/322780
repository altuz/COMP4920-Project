Having spent plenty of time playing Ark, Space Engineers, Conan etc., I\u2019m comfortable with the idea of losing stuff and rewinding a bit. Sure there was a clown who was trying to shoot me because I was by a gold box within 5 minutes of first starting the game, but I was expecting that and managed to shoot him in the face more times than he shot mine. Yeah, I enjoyed the challenge of losing 3 ships to that first wind wall while I figured out how to build a ship that worked. I do enjoy the flight and exploration sans mantas\u2026 however, there\u2019s a few reasons that I\u2019ve more or less already stopped playing.\n\n1: Loading lag/ insta-gib physics bugs. Expected but still irritating in their frequency.\n\n2: Never finding any core upgrade BPs despite clearing multiple dozens of gold chests across two separate expanse zones. I\u2019ve gotten lucky and found a few good engines and core upgrades loaded into assemblers and have made a really nice ship, but the moment it\u2019s sunk, I\u2019m back to being a dork in a 1k Dhingy. I swear the world drop tables are like 90% bossa flags and railings.\n\n3: The free-for-all PvP setup and low population makes it feel like I\u2019m spending all my time in a run down western ghost town, where the few people you find are either folks who\u2019ll point their gun at you and say \u201cgimmie yer money\u201d then shoot you anyways, or folks who run and shut their windows and doors because they\u2019re worried you\u2019re one of the mooks who\u2019ll point their gun at you and say \u201cgimmie yer money\u201d and then shoot you anyways.\n\nBasically, the world as a whole feels empty, hostile, and none too rewarding with the essential stuff locked behind RNG. I\u2019ve talked with friends who\u2019ve tried the game and they were also in agreement with what I was feeling, especially since most of us are in different regions and time zones, making meaningful cooperative play infeasible due to either time or region ping constraints.\n\nI know the PvP part is actually physics based and as such, is more or less hard coded into the game because of Bossa\u2019s game design decisions. To paraphrase a blog, when you get hit in the face with a cannonball and die, it\u2019s not because cannonball entity A does 100p of damage to player entity B, who has 100p of health; it\u2019s because a cannonball that weighs 19.0509 kilos is traveling at 1,437 ft/sec and just so happened to collide with your face. I get it. The problem is they\u2019ve forced the PvP, allowing no actual PvE options due to their game and engine decisions, and seem to be relying on RNG to stretch out game play life (point 2), and left it no holds barred allowing people who\u2019ve gotten everything to get bored and see the only \u201cfun\u201d thing to do as blowing up fresh folks in flying bicycle-powered wooden bath tubs (point 3), turning this into a fairly hostile non-social sky raft simulator where getting your foot stuck under a floorboard sends you flying 1,000ft off the port bow doing cartwheels and staring at a grey screen of shame and rage (point 1). Man that was a long sentence.\n\n4: God damn mantas and no swivel guns yet, (which\u2019ll prolly be another tech tree I need to spread my trickle of knowledge gains on.)\n\nAnyways, while PvE would be nice (i.e. somehow disabling cannon and pistol damage), it would also means the blade-framed-airship-flying ramtard griefer who would still find ways to use the physics engine to ruin your shit couldn\u2019t be shot in the face to deal with him, then there\u2019s the dropping trees or salvaging an engine off the side of your ship to drop it on someone\u2019s head etc., so it\u2019s not the golden goose everyone thinks it is.\n\nSeems overall that Bossa picked a really REALLY shitty foundation to try to build and balance a game on. Basically, do NOT get pulled in the the airship building and exploration plugs, the way they're making this game will bring out the worst in people. I offered someone a hand, and they and their friend tried (and failed) to steal my ship.\n\nYou'll probably be stuck in a rowboat due to RNG not giving you the core upgrades you need, and pretty much 90% of the people you meet will either run away, kill you for no reason, or try to kill you because they want what you have.

It has some very good ideas, such as:\n[list]\n[*]No levels, no hard gating.  Your ability to explore is based entirely on if you can design and manufacture a ship to get through the various \"walls\" that separate zones.  Higher tier zones are behind walls that are increasingly difficult to cross.\n[*]The only character progression is a knowledge based system, which isn't lost on death and can't be stolen.\n[*]The grappling hook for movement is great, and rewards skillful play instead of grind, unlike far too many other MMOs that reward the latter over the former.\n[/list]\nThat said, there are some very serious issues with the game, enough to make me stop playing after 70 hours while I await a fix.  If I were to point to just one thing that has killed this game right now, it's the glitch exploitation.  There are two glitches that by themselves might not be too problematic, but combined, become the perfect storm of toxic gameplay.  These glitches are:\n[list]\n[*]Duplicating exploit.  As far as I am aware, any and everything can be duplicated via an exploit.  This means the PvPers, pirates, and griefers have no incentive to ever gather materials or protect their current investments (ships) as they have an infinite supply of readily available mats to nearly instantly rebuild/repair anything that gets damaged or stolen.\n[*]Invulnerability exploit.  Yes, that's right, anyone can get onto your ship, either via grappling hook, or the glider, and then proceed to salvage at will.  If you get off your helm to attack them, they take the helm and drive it into the abyss below, and you can't kill them, because they're invulnerable.  If you stay on the helm, they simply salvage your ship until there is nothing left, and you crash into the stormy abyss below.  It's lose-lose.\n[/list]\nThe crux of the issue here is that the first exploit makes PvP and piracy meaningless, leaving these exploiters with nothing left to do but grief legitimate players.  They can then do so with impunity, because hey, God mode.  Even if you take their ship and crash it into the abyss, they can instantly rebuild it from duplicated resources.  The legitimate players like myself leave the game, leaving nothing but the toxic exploit-abusing griefers behind, who are so delusional they actually blame the legitimate players as \"... the reason this game has no pop[ulation]\" (yes that is an actual quote from a griefer).\n\nBossa's current attitude is laissez faire, claiming it's more important to fix the problems instead of dealing with it by banning those who exploit\u2014as if the two were mutually exclusive, or even in contention.  So for now, avoid, until Bossa fixes things.

Lately though the game is not in a state that I would recommend. The devs behind the game have been unable to fix a duplication bug that exists in beta and is being abused everywhere. This by itself wasnt such a big deal, for a few months I managed, I stayed away from other people and played to avoid these players with ships duplicated out of end game quality materials and it was ok, I still to this day have not lost a ship to another player. What prompted me to write this review and find a new game to play after a few hundred hours of play time is the fact that yesterday morning the devs condoned the exploitation of the secretive duping, which has a direct impact and advantage over other honest paying customers. The terms of service has rules, like every other game, forbiding the exploitation of bugs known and unkown in order to gain an advantage over other players - Bossa let us know yesterday that their TOS does not apply to the game in its beta.\n\nI am disgusted by this stance and will not pick up the game to play again until the duping is either fixed, or even if it is not fixed and can not be detected and you dont feel like you can ban people for it - at the very least let players know that the exploitation of bugs to hinder the progress of another player or beta tester is not \"ok\" with you guys. It is easy enough to understand that the duping is so out of control that they dont want to risk banning too many people - but that could change if you told the players that there is a difference between discovering bugs then reporting them, and discovering bugs and exploiting them. The reset would be a great oppoutinity to reposition yourselves in a way that shows you care about the health of the beta community when it comes to the issue of duping. \n\nI urge bossa to look at other studios for examples of what to do about duplication exploits in MMOs - both in and after beta.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506690469, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506690469, "recommendationid": "35293205", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509254", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506930932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1764, "steamid": "76561198033598096", "num_games_owned": 190}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "28 hours were fun.

The islands are community designed, and many of them are truly stunning.\n\nThe physics engine is a little wonky - the game is in Closed Beta - but is the backbone of some of the most unique gameplay that I've ever experienced. Your grappling hook is your best friend, and is endlessly amusing (even when it's frustrating).\n\nShip-building is a lot of fun (if you're into that kind of thing), and the design interface is easy to use without limiting complexity, though I'd like to see some more elements added in the future.\n\nNavigating and flying around in your creation - that's even more fun. Don't get too attached to your airship, though. Pirates roam the skies.\n\nEven when you're the shot out the skies by marauders who \"just need some target practice,\" though, it never takes excessively long to get back to roaming the skies - the \"grind\" for materials and experience (\"Knowledge,\" which unlocks advanced engines, wings, and cannons) isn't so bad. It's a cycle of hopping from island to island, gaining Knowledge and schematics for items from exploring them, farming materials, having your ship stolen or blown to bits by pirates, building a better (or temporary) one to replace it, and moving onward. In that way, the game can be an exercise in detachment, and I often find the game-loop (especially just exploring) to be rather relaxing.\n\nThat's my experience as a solo player thus far. I've spent a lot of time alone, but another player is never too far off. Many of them have been pirates, but I've also met some friendly veterans who've helped me out, I've provided help to some noobs myself, and I've just started to befriend a few people who want to unite to protect people against pirates.\n\nI'll update this review once I get to some more advanced content and dive deeper into PvP.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505806833, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506518802, "recommendationid": "35059742", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 510, "total_reviews": 731, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 221}}
