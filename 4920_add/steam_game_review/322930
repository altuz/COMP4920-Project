Please be aware that it's more a training tool than a game. Right now there is a problem with the steam version that it only gives you 4 models instead of the 30 in the standard version. I'm sure this gets patched very soon. When it does you can make sure I will purchuse the professional or ultimate version.\n\nedit: \n\nThe problem was fixed (very fast) and there are now 34 models to fly with. After flying with some other planes and heli's (I really suck at those) I'm really impressed with how every plane handels. All I need now is the ultimate version.

Aerofly RC7 is a flight simulator of RC aircraft and can also be used as a training tool for those interested in the real hobby. Aircraft range from miniature indoor helicopters to full scale, fuel-guzzling beasts, every one is easy to fly yet tough to master! The sim includes beautiful photo-realistic scenery from real locations all over the world with many different airparks to fly from, which all have their differences, my favourite being the variation in runways (gradient, length, width etc). Every one makes for a challenging flight without even considering the wind yet!\n\nThe hud is great and easy to interpret, it includes vital instruments in a simple easy to read format which can all be adjusted to your liking from the dropdown menus, everything works very smoothly and everything feels like how it should feel. From the menus you can also customize each aircraft to your liking e.g. throws and whatnot. I've found nothing annoying about this sim yet but If I do I'll be sure to come back and update this review.\n\nTo sum it up;\n\nPros:\nGreat physics\nAwesome interface \nStunning photorealistic scenery\nSmooth running, high fps on ultra settings\nEasy super simple control setup(Regular Joystick, Keyboard or RC transmitter of the simulator type)\nPlenty of great aircraft \nTrackIR compatible \nVery customizable (Aircraft flight surfaces, throws etc..)\n\nCons:\nNone other than the cost aspect, I got the regular edition yet moved to ultimate as I noticed a few of my favourite birds were in it. Ended up costing me well over $100 all up.\n\nI guess in the end if you really are into flight in general, flight simming or RC aircraft the enjoyment had is definitely worth it. Like all flight sims especially those with payware they are not cheap, I'd honestly say this one is worth every penny, and I personally love it!\n\nA must have for any AVGeek!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415322393, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1416350840, "recommendationid": "12823375", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540633", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482538567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1234, "steamid": "76561198011798933", "num_games_owned": 131}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I am a beginner to the world of RC airplanes. I had one a few years back but things didnt go so great and became discouraged with the hobby until i saw this. I bought the standard version  (all a beginner really needs) and thought i would need hours and hours of practicing before I got good at it.. nope! I just needed an hour to learn how to not overfly my airplane, and smoothly control things to keep from crashing. Felt confident enough to go out with my new airplane today, and was more than happy to see that what i learned with this, helped in the real world... \n\nHighly reccomend to anyone looking to get into RC flying. I use a Logitech game pad (similar to PS2) and have a DX5e Radio that i am now waiting to get the hook up for so i can use it with this program.\n\nGraphics are excellent, models behave like they will IRL.  Overall a fantastic tool!\n\n\n11/12 Update\n\nJust an update - I was out flying over the weekend, and again yesterday. I have to admit that this as a TOOL (not game) is extremely useful and helpful to those getting into the hobby.  If you are thinking of getting into the world of RC flying, try this first - its a lot easier to spend 30 bucks on a piece of training software (a real steal if you think about it) instead of the hundreds of dollars on airplanes, radios and parts that you will need if you go out with out any practice or experience. \n\nI am not sure why there are people out there griping over the views  or cost.  The view is the only one you have (unless using FPV) when you are out at the field.. this isnt a shoorter, or flying game. This is a TRAINING TOOL!\n\nAs with anything, start small- build from there. As a beginner you dont need the most expensive version. Learn to fly first, learn to transfer those skills to real world and then move up. \n\nIf you go into this thinking you are getting a game, or that this is like FSX or anything, you will be mistaken.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415482087, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1415793611, "recommendationid": "12850953", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441633", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498765270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 569, "steamid": "76561197979058715", "num_games_owned": 62}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 32, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Wish I could get a refund.

I have both RealFlight and Phoenix RC simulators and I just bought ultimate edition of Aerofly RC to compare with them.\nTo be honest, It is very hard to compare all those 3 top rc simulators with each other, they are all good and they have all pros and cons. However,instead of comparing all those 3 games, I will try to explain my opinion about Aerofly RC.\nThe Graphics are really good and it will probably satisfy rc sim fans.\nThe Gameplay mechanics are really good and this simulator will really help you in real life if you are beginner. Especially, I have some of the in-game plane models in real life and game really gave me feeling that I am flying in real life. By the way, I am using Art-tech 6ch simulator transmitter which is cheap and easy to use on your computer. \nSounds are good enough for you to feel realism and sucks you in the game.\nThe aircraft details are fine and realistic\nThe weather is good. Especially if you fly your rc models at noon you can set up the time of the day and practice not to fly in to the sun.\nThe wind is effective and normally in my city its rare to see weather without wind, so in the game I am using wind settings to be better rc pilot in real life.\nSummary:\nBest part; In my opinion, the hardest part of the rc plane is landing and this game will really help me to increase my skill about landings\nI wish; there are some kind of missions which can add more playable options with friends, the game is a bit expansive and you really need to buy ultimate edition if you want more and you will want more... In some sceneries you can not change the views. There can be more planes, especially some electric motored planes are not enough for me because in real life I am just flying with electric motored rc planes.  \nIn conclusion: this simulator is really great and it will give you both pleasure and training for RC models. I insist that you should use simulator controller (with cable if you can) instead of xbox or other type of controller. The other simulators are also great. However, this one is enough for you if you are searching for a really good simulator which will train you for real life or just enjoy multiplayer with friends.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415800469, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1415956239, "recommendationid": "12911151", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503675", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490400678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 252, "steamid": "76561198033853726", "num_games_owned": 64}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "In the past ive owned many RC simulators, including real flight versions, FS one, etc. etc.  I dont like how Real flight is in the dark ages when it comes to downloadable software.. or interchangable hardware.  this simulator is the answer to these problems and is just as good, if not better.  i highly recommend this software for learning fixed wing and single rotor helicopter RC flight.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489987029, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489987029, "recommendationid": "30629926", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493502622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 649, "steamid": "76561198148138273", "num_games_owned": 27}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "really good gaem but needs more info and saying how to hook up a rc remote\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451102913, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451102913, "recommendationid": "19949840", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.979156", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469052080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3518, "steamid": "76561197999960373", "num_games_owned": 44}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Consider buying this if you are at all interested in RC flight.\n\nLarge variety of real world models to fly.
