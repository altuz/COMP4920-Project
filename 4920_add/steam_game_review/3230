Had to CTRL ALT DEL\n\nAfter reloading the game my mouse would refuse to move in diagonal, so I boosted sensitivity and launched second map, voice acting and the 3d was good enough, seemed like it was a tactical game about using special abilities with a genetic flavor to defeat enemies, explore and get more genes and whatnot. Unfortunately the gene tab wouldnt open and it was critical to defeating that mission, along with the janky mouse movement I decided that was far enough of a trial to axe this game permanently\n\nToo bad I kinda liked where this one was going conceptually"}]}
