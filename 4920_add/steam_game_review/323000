It is a defense game where your base is mobile and moves forward. The player uses the mounted weapons to attack and kill enemies. There are several sorts of enemies, bases and other things to fight but the battles gets very repetitive after a while.\n\nThe base can be upgraded and customized between missions to adapt to the next mission and you unlock new weapons and bases during the campaign that is very long. The weapons can be divided into several groups that are useful against different sorts of enemies and can either be manual or automatic. Manual recharge faster but are otherwise the same as the automatic.\n\nSo far the game can be quite fun, the reason for me not recommending it is the huge amount of bugs. The game starts just fine for me but sometimes during missions my base gets stuck and doesn't advance forward which causes the game not to advance. This happens quite often and restarting the mission doesn't always help.

It has progression, different difficulty levels and a wide variety of enemies.  There are plenty of options to defend your moving fortress tower, either automatic or manual firing.  \n\nThe main problem I have with this game, is that when enemies come into melee range of your tower, when they die your fortress may stop moving.  This is game breaking, because you cannot move forward to complete the mission, and thus you need to restart or retreat.  This bug happens very often, probably 1 out of 3 times I got into a mission.  It has happened every time in fact in the last mission I am stuck on, in the third map.  It would be nice if they would fix it, but I doubt it, I don't see too much chatter in the community.\n\nOther than that, when playing the game I do enjoy it.

Excellent twist on the traditional stationery tower-defence. Instead, your mobile fortress, mounted on the back of a gargantuan creature is trying to push its way through hordes of enemies to reach the exit, in classic 2D side-scrolling style of yore. Select the squads that will man the towers of your fortress. The archer is great for long range but can't shoot enemies that get in your face. For that you need a short range spear squad. Later, unlock siege or magic squads that are better suited against armoured units or buildings. Play around until you have your ideal combination of squads, and upgrade with additional recruits, giving a faster rate of fire.

But because some major issues it is really a pain.\n\n1) upkeep (grind fest).\nyour mobile base and \"turrets\" cost you some money. For example you need to pay 20% of your income for base and 15% for your \"turrets\". it means that the upkeep for a fight is at 35% and that means that if you get 1000 gold from map it will be reduced to 650. The further the game you are the bigger the upkeep is and the more expensice the ubgrades. so basically the furhter you are the more gold you need but you will be recieving less. Taht means that if you need some money you need to play a map you can beat with \"low cost\". so basically you will be farming one map lots of times to get your ubgrades. This is not fun at all.\n\n2) Game Bug.\nWhen a mele mob is engaging your fortress, you stop moving. and sometimes your fortress dont start moving after you kill the one who stopped you. Everyone likes to restart map right? Because at this point there is nothing you can do.\n\n3) Auto aim\nSome of your turrets are \"automated\". They work really good... well most of the time. Some mobs can run away from you (for example range mobs that are to close to you) when they run the auto targetting wot hit it. and if your turret locks on that mob it will be occupied by shooting behind a mob till the mob wont stop or die.\n\n4) Progress\ngame keeps your \"record\" in 3 categories: monster killed, gold looted and time needed to finish. That is theory. in practice game dont save your time stats (but luckly you can live without it so it;)\n\n5) Medals\nyou can get your new fortress plans and \"turrets\" from 2 sources. By completing maps and by collecting medals. That is really great but... at some maps there are fiever mobs on map that you need to kill ( for example you need to kill 120 but map offers only 100). The trick here is that some mobs are in huts. if you destroy that hut to fast you loose mob. So in some maps you need to wait as long as you can with the destruction of the huts to get more mobs. And here comes the bug. You wait monsters comes in mele game crashes. you dont wait mobs dont come out you dont have medal...\n\n6)Info\nsome \"turrets\" just lack the proper info. For example \"spread shot\" shoots 4 arrows and it deals x amount of damage. The question is that is combined damage of 4 arrows or damage of one arrow?\n\n\nThe bottom line is This is a very good example of a very bad example. The game got great potential and it is wasted. If you plan only to simply \"finish the game\" it will be fun. If ou want to \"complete the game\" it will be a rebooting iritating grind fest.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1484444626, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1484444626, "recommendationid": "29262036", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 11, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 6}}
