It reminds a lot cooparative board games which I like a lot since I'm a fan of those type of board games. So the consept of the game goes like this: you control four astronauts and you got to keep them alive for 10 turns (or weeks if you like) during the voyage to Mars in order to invastigate an anomaly with a heavily damaged spaceship. Each astronaut has 2 actions, one move action (deploy) and one repair/use module ability action, for this second action each astronaut has to roll his/her dice (you will have 2 rolls). The results must be split between repairing a damaged module or use a spacial ability of each module. So managing your dice results and keeping the astronauts in good health and with enough dices (each roll varies from 1 to 5 dices according to how well fed or exchusted are) and choose the right person for the right job (Becouse like modules astronauts have one special ability each) will do the trick. It's very short (I've played 13 hours and I have beat the game 2 times allready) but it's replayability is good. So I recomend it only to those who likes cooperetive board games and only on sales,  \u20ac 15 are too much, I purchase it for 5 euros and I think that should be the maximun amount of money spend on this game... In the other hand I would have give 40 to 50 to buy it if it was actually a board game...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500838891, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501330457, "recommendationid": "33751375", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518024", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503236866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 877, "steamid": "76561198373000182", "num_games_owned": 237}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Its still to buggy.

Yeah! Cannibalism? Hell yeah! But in reality, not so much. I thought that being a survival-based game with random events confronting your crew on its way to Mars, that the concept was somewhat similar to Sunless Sea, a fantastic rogue-like which has you captain a ship in similar circumstances (though on water). Tharsis, unfortuantley, was much different, and this was due to the mechanic of dice. See, when confronted with a broken engine, or a food shortage, your crew gets to roll dice, and the higher the number, the more likely you can deal with the event successfully. And that is where this game falls short of Sunless Sea, in that, while there's always an element of randomness, events are not entirely beyond your control or your decisions. In Tharsis, the roll of a dice can mean the difference between fixing the command module or having your ship disintegrate in space. While I like the look of the mystery meat served in Tharsis (looks like steak), the sheer lack of control over events makes it a hard game to succeed at.

If you're looking for a story or to have some attachment to the characters in the game, you might want to choose something else such as FTL.\n\nThe games resources are very easily identifable, from characters, with their special traits and their individual health, morale, dice rolls along with the overall ship's health, food storage, assist points, research points. It's easy to tell what each of the modules benefit for, allowing you to make judgement calls in evaluating decisions a lot easier. There isn't much hidden or obscure stats in play. \n\nThus your strategies are more often easier to formulate. Trial and error is pretty straight forward, there isn't much long enduring scenes, as almost everything is skippable or short enough. \n\nI recommend this game if you like to have the experience of formulating strategies easier than most games due to its simplicity. There are puzzles that you can tackle that I have not tried. So I can't say for certain how much replayability and how much depth the gameplay goes in terms of challenging your strategies.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500046936, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500046936, "recommendationid": "33538417", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500422", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500032606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 59, "steamid": "76561198012524009", "num_games_owned": 239}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Basicly like playing on a rigged online casino, wait what!? casinos are rigged !?\n\nWhy am i comparing it to online casinos ? cause its basicly the same thing, often they offer you free spins which often lands you a few good wins in the start to get you hooked. \nBut after doing well for a short time it all goes downwards, you roll all the dices you shouldnt roll and in this game it seems to happens everytime you roll.\nEnter a room where for an example void is 1 and injury is 2 and 3, you have 5 dices, expect 3-4 of them to lands on void / injury and expect atleast 1 crew member to die or you loose enough dices that your entire crew has to go into the same location to try and fix it.
