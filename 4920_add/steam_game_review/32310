No, but it certainly tries. About the only circumstance in which I can recommend spending any money on this game is for the sake of nostalgia. I purchased it to tick one off the list of childhood games I hadn\u2019t beaten (I got stuck in the castle section as a kid). As an adult, I can see why I never beat it, from a design perspective its horrendous. Most of the story progression is punitive and arbitrary. It seems like the entire project was one big cash grab, with an extra poke in the eye to buy the hint book (suck it LucasArts, the internet is a thing this time around). There are a few endearing puzzle moments, mostly in the early game, but the further you progress the more likely it becomes that you are totally stonewalled. So if you play, play with a strategy guide at hand, and for your own sanity, save after [spoiler]scooting that damn chair for 5 minutes (before you poke the armor)[/spoiler]."}]}
