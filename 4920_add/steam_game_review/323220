I recommend it wholeheartedly. It's hard. It's also rewarding when you master it. It has functional multiplayer which I've enjoyed. It has frustrating issues due to early access to boot.\nIf you feel like a challenge with a game that will be worth the money by the time you're done taking what it offers - look no further.\nI still have things I haven't unlocked and levels that I barely know anything about by the way.

The game features roguelike elements, mixing that in with 2D platforming mechanics. The combat is fast paced, movement is precise, and the RNG is offset by a demand for skill rather than luck. Your gear still determines how easy you really have it, but if you want to make it far and beat the game you'll need to hone your skills with the mechanics. I like that personally, it's a different take on the roguelike genre and this game in particular executes that very well.\n\nIt's a game that knows what it wants to be, and is almost complete. As I see it, this is definitely worth picking up if you're up to a challenge and a breath of fresh air in the roguelike genre. I wholeheartedly recommend this game. 9/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505185940, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505185940, "recommendationid": "34894234", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497498", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499755427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1942, "steamid": "76561198010399346", "num_games_owned": 284}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "extremely hard but extremely fun! me and my brother we are having a good time! buy it ! :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506796183, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506796183, "recommendationid": "35349550", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504249", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507136578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 867, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2076, "steamid": "76561198168071610", "num_games_owned": 120}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "One of my favorite games of all the time!\nLovely art style and a nice soundtrack.

Sort of. it's a great game, no, fantastic. However, I have my reasons why I sort of advice to step away, however if you love rogue likes or you're looking for a great split screen game, this is for you.\n\nPros:\n4 classes, one being unlocked, 4 skins for each and a ton of perks to choose from.\n4 worlds, 3 levels, 2 soundtracks for each world, when unlocked\nSPLIT SCREEN CO-OP!!\nOnline as well\nLots of unlockables\n[spoiler] When beaten, although there is no cutscene or anything special, you get to re-do the game with your current stats, and weapons, with harder enemies, and loads more of them.\t[/spoiler]\nVery rewarding when you learn how to play\nCons:\n(This is a big one) Game has been out for YEARS, and it's still in early access stage, game still feels the same, aside from a few new things.\nWildling is SO broken, \nWeapons don't have that feeling when you really don't want to part ways with it, no special things to them that will make you feel attached.\nSpecial challenge rooms have no advantage to using them.\n\nOverall I give it a 7.5/10, just wish it finally came out of early access.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506526509, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506526509, "recommendationid": "35243924", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505193987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5046, "steamid": "76561198025365368", "num_games_owned": 103}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "DEV dissapear  for 3 months now \n\nim concerning that we got scam.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506484084, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506484084, "recommendationid": "35234924", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478853", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 722, "total_reviews": 777, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 55}}
