Meaning that, because reaction speeds are slower with a mouse (in particular to click a very specific region) compared to quickly tapping with a finger, that it'll take longer to actually point at something. Not to mention that the skill buttons are clickable with the mouse, meaning that if the fight takes place in the lower regions of the screen, that you'll often click them by accident.\n\nBut what of the Gameplay itself? Sadly, as it stands now, it's basically a hack-and-slash, giving you three stamina-using skills to use, a dash and a regular weak attack. Spamming these special attacks quickly drains your stamina, which will cause you to be temporarily stunned if said bar is completely depleted.\n\nWhile you have the choice of one of three characters, you get the other two as soon as you\u00b4ve beaten about five bosses. These AI seem to be well capable of just spamming their own skills, but the enemy tends to have a preference for you anyway. Meaning you'll still be well busy keeping yourself alive.\n\nAnd that's it. Tap to move or double tap to dash out of the way of an attack, keep laying on the heat and you're set. The character buttons that possibly serve to further define or gear up your character are \"not available yet\". So we're obviously dealing with a Tablet port that also serves to just give a taste of what's to come, as the loading screens love to wave around that the actual release is dated for December.\n\nThere are no graphics options to speak of. No resolution options, either. Let alone anything else. Alt-Enter works to switch between Fullscreen and Windowed, but that wasn't said anywhere.\n\n\nHonestly? Unless the developers make some changes that clearly embrace the PC market or simply make it friendlier for them, I would avoid this game. EVEN IF ITS 3 DOLLARS.\n\nTake my opinion for what you will, but I say that this has a lot of fixing ahead of it before I can consider it well playable.\n\nUPDATE\nLet's clarify this: If you start asking money for it, it stops being a Beta and becomes a release. If you don't want your game judged that way, then don't ask money for it or don't release it yet.\nThe page also does not clarify the true nature of this game, as it being a 'preview' or a taste of a product to come.\n\nThis is not a practise we should condone.
