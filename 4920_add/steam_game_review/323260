Mostly swapping pieces, some click to remove all linked pieces. They simply take too long, even with some special abilities that can be bought with coins you earn while playing.\n\nStupid story, and highly irritating character. Had to turn off sound to at least not hear her noises (was that meant to be singing?) whenever she started acting impatient. I would have liked to just shoot her, often thinking, \"If you don't like how I do this, do it yourself, you stupid dumb %\u00a7&$!\"\n\nThe idea to have to remove pieces to clear a path is nice, but the character itself just ruins it.\n\nWith that, I can't recommend it for anyone who just wants to play some match block game. Better play Season Match (the first one), Hexus, or Heroes of Hellas 3. Intergalactic Bubbles is fun too, though sadly only fullscreen (sigh).\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452314721, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452314721, "recommendationid": "20413089", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514492", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1422594267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561197996359543", "num_games_owned": 287}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A simple little match-3 game with some (easy) hidden object scenes.  The match-3 portions are very reminiscent of the jewel quest games in their added quirks.  There is some plot behind the game leading you across portions of the map, but it's very much a casual puzzle game.  Graphics are simplistic but cute and fitting for the game.\n\nThe game did bug out on me once during a match-3 section, wherein all of the criteria were met to 'win' the map but it wouldn't close out.  I had to return to map and retry the level, losing the progress I had.  Not a big deal in a match-3 game but still frustrating.\n\nWorth picking up on sale, especially for the younger audience, but not worth full price of $4.99 unfortunately.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414994113, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1414994113, "recommendationid": "12757762", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513094", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427303273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 744, "steamid": "76561197993813869", "num_games_owned": 922}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I cannot recommend this as a hidden object game, since it isn't one.
