If you're looking for more of a HO/Adventure game (i.e. the Artifex Mundi style), with puzzles and inventory and object usage, this is not the game you're looking for.\n\nGameplay itself is easy and the HO puzzles and minigames are not overly challenging.  Problems come in when objects are not well-labeled, making you search for something that actually is something else entirely.  There is also lack of precision with objects layered on top of other objects; there have been times in my playthrough where I couldn't click an objec that was directly behind another one, forcing me to pixel-hunt for a clickable spot (with the accompanying irritating error beep every time the top object blocked the other).\n\nThe dialogue is stilted and not believable.  Dialogue cutscenes that advance the game are tedious and hard to read due to the poor grammar and writing.  I don't expect these games to be the height of literature, but I do expect appropriate proofreading and quality control.  That said, I don't know this game's origins and it may actually be a poor translation into English if this was originally in a different language. \n\nI have a personal fascination with Templar history, which is why I picked this up, but unfortunately the tedium and poor writing vastly overpowered my love of Grail legends.  Given a choice, I would not purchase again, and I'm relieved I got this one on sale.  It's not godawful for what it is, but I would personally exhaust the myriad other HO games available first before considering this one.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426909786, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1426909786, "recommendationid": "14981989", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503533", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1411843069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 211, "playtime_forever": 185, "steamid": "76561197969752619", "num_games_owned": 4717}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An old-school style Hidden Object game without any point-and-click adventuring parts.\nEven the separate mini game is a simple chinese checkers style game that only shows up a couple of times.\nScrolling screens, layered screens, find (and correct) errors in mirror mode, and best of all, time challenges on all the levels when you have completed the game.\nA nice change of pace from the new trend of casual point-and-click adventures with a few Hidden Object scenes thrown in for good measure.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411822013, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1411822013, "recommendationid": "12259717", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512768", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450078201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 362, "steamid": "76561197960557260", "num_games_owned": 1045}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This one is a miss.

This HOG focuses on object finding, the way I like them.\n\n[b]What I enjoyed[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The HO scenes play in the classical PopCap way that I like. Objects blend in and require skill, but they are not cheaply obstructed / hidden - most of the time.\n[*]Scrollable scenes, and an object list that helpfully dims each item name if you need to scroll to see it (almost too helpful, as it makes finding stuff extremely easy).\n[*]Some of the HO scenes are beautifully rendered \"Da Vinci's sketchbook\" looking layouts. Looks great and provides an alternative to photorealism.\n[*]One mini-game had me finding anachronistic or \"intruder\" items inserted into a painting of Christopher Columbus, such as kangaroos and AK-47s. That was funny.\n[*]Nice character art in the story sections (except for the main character - see below).\n[*]The historical journal provides an interesting backdrop to an otherwise dull plot.\n[*]Once you finish the story mode, all the locations unlock for your clicking pleasure, in a time challenge mode that you can ignore if you want. So you can keep coming back to the game every once in a while.\n[/list]\n[b]What I didn't like[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Some ridiculous mistakes in the English text throughout the game.\n[*]I said the objects are well hidden - most of the time. The few times they aren't, it's just a cheap opacity trick that would be infuriating if not for the scrolling trick. Or the hint button.\n[*]No widescreen, and the art resolution is a few years old.\n[*]You see the main character in the game's cover art on Steam? You see that bored, irritated look on her face? That's the only artwork of her that's going to accompany you throughout the game. I don't know if they were trying to get a \"professional\" look on the face of this FBI agent / art expert but she just looks like she's thinking \"I hate this job. I hate these people.\"\n[*]I didn't think anything could make me dislike Moonlight Sonata, but this game overuses it to such a degree that I just muted it eventually.\n[*]Abrupt, unsatisfying cliffhanger ending.\n[/list]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461055114, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1461055132, "recommendationid": "22512433", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506508", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444084290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 344, "playtime_forever": 172, "steamid": "76561197970078168", "num_games_owned": 844}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Old fashioned hidden-object game.

I would only recommend this game IF you like HO games and IF you have an interest in the Templar history.  If you're not big fans of both, don't bother with this game; stick to the Artifex Mundi titles.  \n\nThe objects in the HO scenes are nicely done, but be aware that you may have some difficulty clicking on some items like the flashlight, especially if they overlap.  You can tell from the character dialog that English is not the native language, and I'm OK with that, but some of their labels are misleading if not inaccurate.
