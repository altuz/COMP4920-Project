If I were to ever start making games, it would resemble something like this. Grow Home is a creative take on the collect-a-thon platformer, whittling it down to a shorter but extremely fun and joyful experience. Its about the fun of exploring a place not just to find all the collectibles, but to see what the next part of the world could look like, to see if there are going to be any new mechanics. The world looks simple, but becomes a lot bigger and exciting with the ability to climb any surface. By giving you a clumsy walk but intuitive climbing controls, the game creates some great moments of last minute saves from falling into oblivion, or failing as incredibly as possible. Movement is half the fun of the game because of its strange walking speed, not despite it. \n\nIt also helps make everything the robot does look a lot more charming and full of character, like they've been given a mission they're barely equipped for, but somehow makes it work. Watching B.U.D drag an unwilling sheep toward a checkpoint, or try to pull a gem out of the ground, or even just throw a rock tells so much about a character who never speaks outside of some adorable, inaudible sounds that come out of him on occasion.\n\nThe 3D platformer is not dead. Instead, it exists in smaller, more diverse forms. With this and Yooka-Laylee (a game I have unfortunately not played yet), I hope game developers can see the appeal of these kinds of games and try to capture their magic in newer ways.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505708391, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505708391, "recommendationid": "35038673", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506911181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 107, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 107, "steamid": "76561197975383250", "num_games_owned": 112}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "More frustrating than fun to me, so unfortunately that means an uninstall.
