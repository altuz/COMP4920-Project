The music is integral to the game and gameplay where you hit a set of notes that corresponds to a certain action. The soundtrack in that aspect, is lilting and gorgeous.

How do you keep messing up classic games, steam?\n\nI actually had held off since childhood playing this game. It came with a lucas arts pack on steam, so I finally got to play it. I. Was. HOOKED! It took me about a week of casual play to beat. \n\nI actually feel a little depressed knowing this will be the first and last time I will know of and play LOOM. If any of the adventure games deserved a sequel back in the day, it was this game. Since I've played it and beat it, I feel as though there is no longer a reason to play it again until my brain forgets it and I can reload it up. \n\nThey just don't make games like this anymore, and those days are gone. Now everyone needs a gun, action, and something to catch a 5-second attention span. *SIGH* \n\n*clicks self* C-A-A-C"}]}
