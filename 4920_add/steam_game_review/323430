Though it has to be said that even getting it at half price I still felt I didn't get too much bang for my buck with the whole game being easily complete-able in well under 2 hours.  But I still feel this is worth recommending.\nThe game consists of essentially 2 game modes.  One where you are free to explore as you steer your crow around a small open area, finding collectables (or \"trinkets\") and unearthing further nuggets of story.  And the story missions which functions quite like a semi-on-the-rails shooter (or slasher) as you fly about, collecting gems to allow upgrades, deploying shields to fend off incoming missles, and attacking enemies.  \nDeploying shields and issuing slash attacks is quite nicely implemented, as you have to press an action key and then draw the appropriate symbol onscreen with your mouse.\nThe game does not hide it's phone origins with its focus on drawing symbols and easy difficulty, but it offers a suitably unique experience that is worth having.  It marginally increases its difficulty over the course of the two hours but it's still on the easy side, with the end boss being the only real challenge which resulted in a couple of repeats.\n\nThere is a choice element at the end of each chapter, a simple binary good/evil choice, which I assume has an effect on the ending cinematic, an assumption based on the ending I saw.\n\nThere are also some optional challenge missions that function very similarly to the scripted story missions only they are repeatable, but weren't enticing enough to have me coming back for any more.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what else this developer puts out.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443809011, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443809011, "recommendationid": "18294412", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501807", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421024011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 115, "steamid": "76561198064614516", "num_games_owned": 12}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Wow...

For a mobile game, its fun and it has decent music to keep you engaged in the game. The downside is... that game is very short and once you do finish it, no replay value at all.\n\nAll in all, I usually stay away from Mobile ports but I'd say this one is actually a decent game to give a shot someday!

There is just a sliiiight delay on the movement when swiping with the mouse (which is also probably present on the mobile version) but it's nothing that keeps the game from being enjoyed. The fights are engaging and although repetitive they do pose meaningful combat to the story.\n\nIt has some flaws though, such as randomly freezing, where it doesn't really freeze but the crow just keeps on going without anything being able to be done (like pressing the spacebar). Eventually pressing escape blackens the screen and you have to quit the process in taskmanager.\n\nOther than that, there is absolutely nothing I can't recommend with crow. Maybe a little explanation would be helpful at the start as you're just put in the middle of the game with no background whatsoever, but after quickly understanding the story and what you are able to choose for in-game and the consequences that come with it Crow will simply fill your time with great a great experience that is better than many PC games that weren't even ported.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413226394, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1413805944, "recommendationid": "12479982", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494609", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447624925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8, "steamid": "76561198020883298", "num_games_owned": 24}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Cool if you wanna kill time and you have absolutley nothing to do, but otherwise it's a game on rails with no real choices, pretty boring A-B stuff, wouldnt pay money a second time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447625018, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447625018, "recommendationid": "19103863", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493937", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1412700352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 36, "steamid": "76561198019597873", "num_games_owned": 201}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "At least the splash screen looks cool.\n\nThis is a game where you play as a crow.
