It would be a very hard game if not the fact that there is no death penalty and every battle can be repeated as many times as needed.\nThe story and characters aren't particularly interesting and quite simple. The ingame (not battle) character animation is funny in jumpy-jittery way, it grown on me with time for some reason and I find it hilarious now. The characters are partly voiced (Japanese only), the important dialogs and combat, most of dialogue is just text. \nThe story ends in a way that makes apparent there is a sequel (not really a cliffhanger but close). I know it's the series, so no surprise here.\nCombat is probably most interesting part of the game, it's somewhat overbalanced with negative sides to everything, these are partly countered much later into the game. Character progression and growth is slow in this game and it's impossible to overlevel. Maybe not exactly impossible but close to it. If underleveled though, party stands no chance against stronger enemies and bosses, so a game does make you not to avoid battles, even if it is possible to run from all of those except with bosses. \nThe game has random encounters and uses overpainted monsters method to populate lands and dungeons, too much for my liking. \nThere is an arena, which gives no xp at all.\nDungeon design is boring and very repetitive, not being ingame dungeon maps too, it's too easy to lose or rather forget you way for this reason.\nIt might seem like a game is just bad, but it's quite enjoyable at first, it's a tad too long for it to stay this way.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423090156, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423093266, "recommendationid": "14331163", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573169", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488597301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 93, "steamid": "76561198058644751", "num_games_owned": 564}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 35, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have to admit when it comes to a computer game or video game for that matter, it really takes a good game to engage lengthy sitdown times to keep being interested in this game.

It's quite simple and does not try to innovate much, but rather it sticks to the basics and does it in a very approachable way.\nThis game was originally a mobile phone game, but were it not for some UI elements, it would hardly be noticeable. The port from phone to PC is surprisingly good, with one exception: You can't use a gamepad for this game.\n\n[b]Graphics & Sound[/b]\nAlphaida Genesis has 2 very different looks to it, depending on if you're in combat or not. The non-combat portions have a simple & colourful 2D look to it, that would be at home on the PS1 (the sprites are slightly too detailed for a SNES game), while combat is in 3D and looks more like an early PS2 game in terms of detail & style.\nThe difference between the two is jarring, and it helps give the game a very incoherent look. While none of the modes look bad, barring overuse of the same few tiles on the overworld, they don't mix well together. Personally I found the combat to look far more appealing than the 2D overworld part, which has a rather cheap look to it, with poor animations and the above mentioned overuse of the same few tiles.\nIn terms of sound, the game is very middle of the road. There's nothing really wrong with the music, but nor does it stand out. Sound effects do have some weight to them in combat, so that's at least something. The voice acting is generic. With generic I mean that if you've the least bit familiar with Japanese games and/or anime you can tell almost exactly what a character will sound like by just looking at it. Also, the voice actors do seem to overact quite often, and I can't tell if it's for comedic effect, or if they're just not very good.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nIn terms of gameplay, Alphaida Genesis is very traditional. If you've played SNES or PS1 era JRPGs, you know what you're in for. Random encounters, turn based battles, relatively linear character progression (though you do get some choices in what magic skills to develop for your character) and all that good stuff. If you like traditional JRPGs, you'll feel right at home here, if you don't, this game won't change your mind. One nice thing is that the game will warn you when you're about to get a random encounter, as the borders of the screen changes colour. This, and a relatively low encounter rate, made sure that the random encounters did not feel annoying.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nAnd here is where the game falls flat. The base premise of the story is not bad. You live in a world where synthetically made humans exist, and where they do a lot of the work. These are treated like second class citizens (so basically slaves), though there are people who want to elevate them to equals. A murder is committed by one of them, and after this there's talk of getting rid of all the synthetically made humans. It's not the most original story, but it could have been interesting.\nSadly the writing is just dire, and there's a lot of dialogue here. It's hard to feel invested in a game where the writing is as bad as it is in this game. The dialogue between the characters feels like it would belong in some second rate fan fic rather than in a game released on steam that's made by developer that's been around since the mid 80's. I just could not bring myself to keep on playing, as the more I played, the less I liked all the main characters.\n\n[b]Final thoughts[/b]\nIf it was not for the terrible writing, Alphaida Genesis would have been an inoffensive and rather generic JRPG that would have worked well as an entry level game. A modern day Mystic Quest if you may (though it's a bit more involved than Mystic Quest). But as it stands, this is not a game that I would recommend to anyone. The writing is not even funny bad, it's just cringe worthy, and makes the game nigh unplayable for me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461341764, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1461342652, "recommendationid": "22570043", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519906", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487827048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 2200, "steamid": "76561198086087452", "num_games_owned": 702}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "its a good jrpg, good story pacing...not too much but not so sparse that you feel the grind...good quality of life features for a jrpg make it easy to rack up hours.  graphics have aged well...has a phantasy star vibe to it.

This isnt an rpgmaker game though.\n\nI like that i was never lost, the secrets were not overly complex and more or less involved paying attention to your surroundings...travel times were short, the \"dungeons\" were all short enough to not over stay their entertainment, maybe other than the last part which felt a bit long.  I didnt need a guide at any point, everything was well explained and the in menu quest tracker, story tracker, and world map worked great to make progressing less of a chore and never confusing.\n\nUpdated after completion:\n\nStory leaves a lot of loose ends with little to no resolve, didnt do the second ending yet but it seemed to just end far too quick, not sure i really want to go through all the second ending quests for full completion.  Got to the point where i was just too strong maybe?\n\nEither way it was a good paced story, good character building, text was always short enough to read but seemed to build good story.\n\nI like that the game was sort of short, i did accidentially leave it on for about 18hours...its a good length game, not too short not drawn out and too long...however i wish they started concluding a lot of the story much sooner, i was actually expecting maybe another 12 hours of play when the game ended...maybe the second storyline you get with the clear save fills the gaps though...ill be honest the normal end...i felt the game abruptly ended with about a 5min wrap up that felt like a rushed conclusion.\n\nWas definately worth the money, would definately buy a sequel...just wish the normal ending was more of an ending and the extra ending and content maybe would be better incorporated into a single gameplay with perhaps different paths or whatever.\n\nill update again if i get around to using the clear save and doing the extra content with a different ending, not sure if its just a quick refight or if its going to provide enough content to properly conclude the story in any satisfying manner.

I will be using a \"Pro's vs Con's\" style of review because I don't personally believe 1 out of 10 type of reviews fairly portray the ups and downs of a game. You may enjoy different things than I do, and someone else may not mind something that's a pet peeve of yours and so on. I believe the best I can do is write good and bad and let each reader of this make up there own opinions to check this out or not.\n\nPro's\n\n-First and foremost for me was the 3d models in combat. You don't find that often in steam jrpg's.\n\n-Tons of hidden rooms and treasure chests through the the game. To give perspective there is an achievement for getting all 220 chests unlocked and I found over 200 in my lone play through.\n\n-Decent length to it for bang for your buck. It took me a little over 20 hours to complete the story.\n\n-Not hard to get achievements if you're an achievement hunter. I acquired 16/20 in my game buy doing  just the main story. The only one that's really hard is the aforementioned 220 chests achievement. \n\n-It does have voice acting in the game. However it's in Japanese so  if that's not your thing then you might not like this (I don't speak Japanese so I can't speak for the quality and I played most of the game with it all muted and Pandora underneath.)\n\nCon's\n-Meh story.. it definitely falls under the \"Bad guys doing bad things to innocents\" Kind kind of generic story for a jrpg but really more than that it's a love story between characters, love triangle included.So it wasn't for me but that doesn't mean that's not your cup of tea so to each there own.\n\n-The characters in Alphadia Genesis are as cookie cutter as they get. Know the stereotype? Well I'm sure it's in here. Fray is the protagonist who never gives up especially on his love. Aurra although my favorite is the younger sister of Fray and the smart one in the group. Enah is quite, Walter is annoyingly jealous until the last 10% of the game.
