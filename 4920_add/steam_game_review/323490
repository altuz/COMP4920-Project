The translation, as some have pointed out can miss a few points... I think at one point the game tries to call a rapier or long-sword a \"machete\"? But honestly I didn't find enough of this in the game to break the experience totally for me.\n\nThe game allows enough choices for you to delve into the plot more and piece together the whole picture of what's going on in the garden... It's a quite deep story!\n\nI enjoy it, done a playthrough or two, plan on more due to a legitimate interest in finding out every character's angle in this.\n\n\nTL:DR- Better plot than many visual novel like games, intriguing plot. An intellectualy awesome way to spend some time.\n\nAlso, makes me glad I'm not nobility.
