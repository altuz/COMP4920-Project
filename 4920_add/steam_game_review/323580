However, while the art style is nice, the game itself is relatively lackluster, and I lost interest.  The combat isn't super exciting, and the puzzles are more busywork than they are puzzling.  It *might* be worthwhile half-off, but even then, I don't know that I'd ever finish it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505687616, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505687616, "recommendationid": "35034574", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500991", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 483, "total_reviews": 592, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 109}}
