It's older than me. \nAnd it's great. \nThe remastered version of SoMI feels old, plays old, and doesn't hold your hand at all, but that's what makes me love it.\n\nPROS\n+The puzzles are really hard but very rewarding when you finally work it out.\n+THE HUMOR IS AMAZING--like, seriously: I don't know whose job it was to script this game, but the humor alone made me buy this game after seeing some footage of it on YouTube. I regret nothing.\n+It's very trope-y, but acknowledges this and goes bananas with it (see, see what I did there? Monkey Island? Bananas? ...yeah, never mind)\n+Guybrush and Elaine fall in love after less than 5 minutes of interaction, and it's still a better love story than Twilight\n\nCONS\n-This game does feel pretty old, so I can see it turning some people off\n-Be prepared for much rage at some of the puzzles. In Act I alone, I had to Google solutions to three separate puzzles. I'm not proud. \n\nOverall, a charming throwback to the golden days of LucasArts with a wicked sense of humor. 8/10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506671117, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35285645", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198045527176", "num_reviews": 34, "last_played": 1506670879, "num_games_owned": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 329, "playtime_forever": 329}, "timestamp_updated": 1506671117, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I'm usually a bit wary of games that claim to be \"funny games\" but the Monkey Island series really surprised me with how often I found myself laughing. A common criticism of point-and-clicks are how obtuse and confusing their solutions are. I don't really feel that with SOMI:SE. Indeed, it seemed like most of the puzzles were very logical and contained clues that could be found if you were paying attention.\n\nThe built in hint button didn't hurt either. ;)\n\nThis game is must-play for dialogue-heavy adventure game enthusiasts."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506637792, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35274920", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197982838535", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1488790429, "num_games_owned": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 222}, "timestamp_updated": 1506637792, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I played The Secret of Monkey Island as a kid on windows 98. If you have any interest in point and click adventure games from the 90s, this is a must have to your collection.\n\nI would highly suggest anyone playing it for the first time to play it in it's original pixelated state. It has a lot of charm to it and the visuals are more 'realistic' than the cartoony modern day graphics. I appreciate the voice acting and the cartoony style, but i think it detracts from the original atmosphere. especially in the SCUMM bar. \n\nFor the time, this was one of the easier games. The puzzles can be kind of 'what the heck' sometimes, but you couldn't die(with one exception) in this game, and that gave it a big leg up over other Sierra-style adventure games where you could end up getting stuck and having to restart with trial and error.\n\nThe built-in tip system is too much of a tease for me and i have a hard time with it when it's so accessible. \n\nIn my humble opinion, the internet killed the adventure game series, along with advances in technology. Back in the 90s, it was more viable to make adventure games because there weren't very good alternatives. \n\nNowadays, you can just google the answer to a puzzle in the game and there are (for the average person) more engaging games out there. but the charm, humour and style of this game still entertains me to this day. \n\nNot a lot of replay value, beyond nostalgia, for me. Once you've beat the game, that's it. Some of the puzzles can be more tedious that entertaining, as well. \n\nBut it's definitely worth picking up if you've never had the chance to play it before."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506033903, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35115425", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971757327", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1447789426, "num_games_owned": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 464}, "timestamp_updated": 1506033903, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good ol'times!"}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504913453, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492970", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34825222", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198005948355", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504913241, "num_games_owned": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 318}, "timestamp_updated": 1504913453, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Unfortunately nostalgia just does not make up for awful execution - pixel hunting, terrible interface, a lot of backtracking, you cant skip most of dialogs, not even intro and closing credits."}]}
