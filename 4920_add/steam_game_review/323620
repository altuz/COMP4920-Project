These are all stock objects from a bunch of Unity stores.  Think of this more as a students project rather than a piece of software.  Stock music, stock textures, everything...\n2.  Not even sure why this is using Unity in the first place... the backgrounds are all STATIC with some graphic overlays of snow, blowing sand, or other visual flourishes.  None of this required 3D at all and could have all been done using 2D saving a ton of memory/resources.\n3.  This  is NOT a screensaver.  In fact, you can't even START it from the screensaver in Windows/Linux or anything else for that matter.  It has to start through STEAM making the whole thing more or less pointless...\n4.  A whole *3* environments.... whoooo... three... wow.  For the money at least have a handful.\n5.  This barely registers as 'software' seeing as you can't use it for its intended purpose...\n\nNot even sure how this crap managed to get on Steam in the first place...

Almost nothing from the Unity Asset Store was used - except for the GUI system called Daikon Forge GUI. Why? Because Unity's own GUI system, not the new one introduced with the Unity 4.6 Beta, is rubbish and really bad on the performance side.\n\n2. It was planned to freely move around at some point. No ETA on this, though, as I'm currently implementing some basic Steamworks features as well as putting some fresh coat of polishing on the GUI and Environments.\n\n3. I'm aware about this and I can't really do anything about it. The only thing I could do would be removing the term \"screensaver\".\n\n4. More Environments are planned! They'll come with future updates. Initially, for this Halloween, I had a free DLC in mind. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it in time and so this idea was scrapped.\n\n5. It is a Software and so it's in the appropriate Section on Steam.\n\n\nOn a side note: A new Update is slated for the end of November / early December. An Announcement is coming very soon.\n\n\nBest regards,\nMaurice", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580819", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468776335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 54, "steamid": "76561197972703790", "num_games_owned": 79}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 54, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Far too simple at the moment.
