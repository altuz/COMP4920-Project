Try to do it without looking at guides or watching walkthrough. Some levels are difficult, some are tedious but all of them are logical, just be calm and think outside of the blocks.

Why? It's not making figuring out the solution any harder, it's making it tedious to paint dozens of tiles again to try a solution with a slight variable.\n\nSomehow even the story manages to piss me off because the main character is just trying to chew on everything including paint (he's hungry - that's the extent of his personality), and everyone else is a complete jerkwad who doesn't appreciate this kid doing this for them. Duh, of course it's meant for comedic purposes, but for me it's not funny, it's just slapping me in the face for having the audacity to play this thing in the first place. It's the game's characters genuinely treating me like trash for saving their lives.\n\nAnd every time you fail, you hear the main character make the disappointed, bratty sound of your own ears excreting. You desperately try to hit the retry-button to stop him from making that sound but it's always too late. I ended up muting the entire game and listening to conspiracy theorists on YouTube. It was an improvement.\n\nThe game wasn't fun. It was challenging at times, but very repetitive.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467259261, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1467259283, "recommendationid": "23944357", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501764", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490900638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561198033107016", "num_games_owned": 349}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1482940121, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1482940121, "recommendationid": "28755997", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488381", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
