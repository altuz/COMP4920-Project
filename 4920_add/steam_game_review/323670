If you like Mario Kart, it will suit you nicely.\nFor the developers: I would like to see some improvements like a Custom League or Race, where you'll be able to choose the tracks and rivals you want. Also, on the Time Trial mode, you could add some global rankings, maybe on weekly or monthly basis for each track, it would be great. Looking forward to see Battle Mode and some famous characters.
