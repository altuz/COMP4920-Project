It is also unpolished and buggy, but I could live with that if the game was complete.  Caffeine, as of this writing, v118, looks like what I imagine games in progress look like when they are about 60% complete:  the basic artwork is done, coarse world map is drawn, simple sound effects and background music prepared.  What's left?  Story, narration, combat, gameplay, NPCs, puzzles, play testing, optimization.  \n\nThis game is being sold well before it is ready for market and not labeled as early release.
