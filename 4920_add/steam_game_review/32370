Employs a lot of species from the SW Universe.\n(+)Simple RPG mechanics.\n(+)Gratifying experience IF you're playing as a Light Side main, though the game treats you more like a goody two-shoes oh gee whiz! kind of guy.\n\nCons:\n(-)Gameplay doesn't require much strategy and thinking.\n(-)Absolutely horrible experience IF you're playing as a Dark Side main. The game treats you as just some childish d-bag, instead of presenting an in-depth observation on the Dark Side of the Force.\n(-)Extremely buggy; some sidequests can't be completed, and it's possible that the game will break if you've encountered some of the more rarer bugs. As I'm writing this review, the last boss is just standing around and can't be interacted with, rendering the game unwinnable.\n\nFinished this game in my teenage years, loved it, and regarded it as one of the best games of all time.

It has a few small issues, but overall I would wholeheartedly recommend it, even to people who are just sort of interested in Star Wars and its lore.\n\nFull version:\n\nLikes:\nThe game is really fun and pretty, despite its age. The structure of the game also makes for pretty decent replay-value. Customization is a little lacking in my opinion, but it's still more than most other games of this type from its age. Everything is taught to you clearly, but rarely does it feel like your hands are being held.\n\nDislikes:\nThe boss fights are honestly stupid. I play somewhat casually, so I usually skip out on super good gear if it looks stupid, but make up for it by turning the difficulty to easy. This isn't a problem for 99% of the game. During boss fights, it's a HUGE problem. Every bossfight is the following: get all of my team to turn on shields, place all my mines, then spam stasis and critical hits, then use 5 healthpacks over the course of the fight (in addition to all members using Heal). Even then, boss fights last anywhere from a minute to five, just to kill 1-3 people. Like I said though, the rest of the game doesn't have this problem, so this is a small complaint.\n\nHates (huge spoilers):\nSERIOUSLY FUCK EVERYTHING ABOUT THE STAR FORGE. Every room is designed to take up as much time as physically possible, as they're all just big long rooms with disorganized waves. You can expect 10-30 people in any given room on the Star Forge. This makes it so you have to kill tons of people before your party can regen any force. Even if all your party has heal, stock up on healthpacks because you will run out of force halfway through a room, even with three Jedi. To top off this trainwreck of a level is the Malak fight. I considered going to my local church to ask forgiveness of whatever diety I angered to deserve such Hell. The Malak fight took me easily 20-30 minutes on the easiest difficulty, and required perhaps 100 or so healthpacks of varrying stregths. You CANNOT have enough adhesive grenades and healthpacks for this fight. Even still, you will get some form of cancer every time he sucks health back from a Jedi captive, despite the fact that it takes 3 minutes of spamming attack and healthpacks and nothing else just to get him there, and he does it maybe 10ish times. In addition to the clusterfuck level design and cancerous Malak fight is the fact that my favorite companion, Bastilla, dies. I don't know if there's a way to save her, but I'm not replaying the game to find out. It still hurts, though."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506668221, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35284769", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198176765602", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1473510032, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3668}, "timestamp_updated": 1506720486, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Straight up, if you play and finish this game then you could die a happy person.

The writing is so good and the environments so diverse that I have memories of a great adventure for every major character and location. \n\nNow, I am under no illusions that KotoR has aged well.  It is pretty rough around the edges.  The interface is clunky, and the graphics are, well, old.  Taris is a somewhat bland starting area.  But once you make it into space, the plot escalates into epic space-opera proportions.  Everyone can be talked to, and there are tons of unique side missions.  Each of your companions reacts differently to the same sitaution, and has a well-developed backstory.  Sometimes their past catches up with them.  Maybe yours will too.\n\nIn this era of gaming, does KotoR hold up?
