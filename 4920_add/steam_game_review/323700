Or better said, the protagonist of the story is hell-bent on scaring and freaking out, errr, his unwanted \"guests\".\n\nSince Ghost Master, and to an extend Dungeon Keeper, this idea never gets old or bothersome. The game has it's old school charm, but it can't deny it's modern touch [spoiler]ever noticed how the TV sets react when they are possesed[/spoiler].  Too bad, that this game is relatively short and that it's replayablity is next to zero - especially when you can get the \"Ghost Master\" exceptionally cheap. So, no, the idea is neither original nor new.\n\nBut it still has it's charm, and some ideas \"are\" original - at least to a lower extend. Is the game recomendable? For a fan of the specific genre \"play evil\" it surely is, also it might please some \"nostalgia-aficionados\" and the story of the protagonist is tragic enough to build up some... well, let's just say feelings of sweet revenge. \n\nOff course, it will not please all audiences, especially not those who already have developed the tripple A - syndrome, or, \"If it's not from a great company then it can't be good!\". I have grown very careful about great software developers like Blizzing or Actifishing - especially since the gread D3 *erherm* Catastrophe... No, I don't care telling you about it, it's even worse than you might guess. I need a bucket for just mentioning Blizz and D3 in one sentence, just in case ... but I feel suddenly very, very sick. It's like Kryptonite.\n\nNo, this game is not rocking awesome, it's a good mediocre game, a game I might recomend friends with the same tastes and of course with some spare money on their hand. If you liked \"Ghost Master\", you still might be disappointed by the game, because it's lacking the depth of \"Ghost Master\". On the other hand, if you like fast little strategy puzzles this game might be exactly what you are searching. It can be played as casual as you wish to play it.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425297223, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425297223, "recommendationid": "14723024", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505074", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451501554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 356, "playtime_forever": 203, "steamid": "76561197970314107", "num_games_owned": 1082}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Charm goes a long way in games. Charm is the reason I don\u2019t lose my mind when I get spiked on spikes in Spelunky. Charm is the reason I can put up with the insanity of E.Y.E. It\u2019s enough to forgive concepts that\u2019s aren\u2019t fully fleshed out or gameplay with rough edges, and that\u2019s exactly what it does for this title. Poltergeist will charm your socks off with its blocky furnishings and its hand-drawn cartoon cutscenes, enough that you won\u2019t mind the simplistic puzzles that form its core.\n\nYou take on the role of Henry B. Knight, vengeful deceased, as he scares the stuffing out of anyone who would call his mansion home. The game plays out in 60 puzzles across four time periods, with looks and themes unique to each era. Puzzles have a number of folks milling around, and provide you a limited number of ghostly powers to terrify them with. The powers range from jiggling loose objects to full-on possessing people, but their mechanical functions are all similar. Your hapless victims are divided across rooms, and the powers do a certain amount of \u201cdamage\u201d to the people in one or more rooms. When you do enough damage to a person, they vacate.\n\nThe actual puzzle, then, is figuring out what combination of powers in what order will get everyone gone. You might need to fling a lamp from one room into another to soften someone up for a shadowman encounter. Or you might have to send a ghost wolf to drive a lone inhabitant into a room full of people so you can explode the TV and mortify them all at once. There are special characters that block certain powers, and each era of puzzles ends with three boss fights against some entertaining characters with their own ways of fouling you up. None of the puzzles are terribly challenging, since they\u2019re just sequence problems, but they\u2019re gratifying enough to overcome. My only hangup here was the fiddly attention-getting power which works based on some unclear proximity rules that made it hard to complete a few puzzles, even when I knew exactly what to do.\n\nWhat really kept me invested here was the presentation. The graphics are a peculiar mix of 2D characters against chunky, voxelly 3D levels. It works better than it sounds because the features of the levels are all physics-enabled, allowing your terrified tenants to bang open doors, knock over vases, and up-end entire tables. The adorable visuals are coupled with some equally adorable sound effects of gasps, screams, and Sims-style nonsense. You also get loads of hand-drawn cutscenes for the eras and bosses, accompanied with some charmingly not-quite-right English subtitles. The goofy endings are also worth your time to see, capping off a perfectly enjoyable package.\n\nIt isn\u2019t groundbreaking in any way, but scaring the little pixel people half to death with your goofy powers makes it more than worth your time. If you\u2019ve played the classic Ghost Master, Poltergeist feels like a much lighter, more streamlined version of that. There really should be more games about haunting the adorably unwary, but until we get them Poltergeist will definitely scratch that itch for a few hours.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?
