And after completing it (under 3 h) felt a little disappointed. \n\nThis is a point&click type of game with puzzles. Indie lovers like myself will enjoy it for its super simple gameplay and a couple of mindfucks there and there. I did expect the story to be more extended which unfortunately didn't happen.\n\nI have to say that I enjoyed the spooky atmosphere of the game. Kept me tense throughout the play. Jumpscares are always a thing.\n\nGot the game in a bundle for about $1 CAD. Definetely would not buy the game for $10+. \n\nAt the end, I enjoyed my time with it and I would come back to unlock all achievements.\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502767973, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502767973, "recommendationid": "34248394", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500096632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 182, "steamid": "76561198082508468", "num_games_owned": 166}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Here is what I thought about Decay: The Mare\n\nPros:\n- Awesome soundtrack (cannot stress this enough... super good!!!)\n- Unpredictable jumpscares\n- Hint system\n- Cool cutscenes \n- Interesting and captivating story (everything makes sense in the end)\n- Weird but kind of cute comic relief character\n- Scary atmosphere!\n\nCons:\n- Hint system is more of a \"what room should I be in?\"\n- Not enough jumpscares!\n- Voice acting was a little... strange?\n- Puzzles were a little too vague\n\nOverall this game was a really good way to spend 3 hours.

Really loved the atmosphere.\n\nI also enjoyed the way key pieces of the story are revealed throughout each episode, but it felt strange that completing an episode kicks you out into a menu rather than continuing seamlessly on to the next episode. It was a little immersion breaking. The three chapters are distinct in that your inventory is cleared each time, and you are unable to return to areas in the previous chapter, but it would have been much more organic to throw up a title card and just let the game continue. I completed the first episode and honestly didn't even know there were two more until I looked at the achievements that described them.\n\nThat's not to condemn the game, though. It is genuinely spooky; a few of the jumpscares got me pretty dang good. And I enjoyed the puzzles overall but really wish they had been more difficult. There are a few somewhat challenging moments, especially in the excellent second episode, but often the hardest part was just trying to remember which room the clues were in. \n\nHarder puzzles with complex components (i.e. more steps than just use item A in location X) and a more nuanced relationship with their environment would be a huge improvement. Simple puzzles work in the original Resident Evil games because they have combat and inventory management, but in a game like this puzzles are the player's primary interaction with the game. Great puzzles grow organically out of a game's unique logic, and horror puzzles in particular should contribute to an inscrutable sense of dread. Hopefully Shining Gate will hone in on that kind of development with their next title.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499885078, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499885078, "recommendationid": "33486087", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503856812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 234, "steamid": "76561198078802590", "num_games_owned": 66}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's got tension and few jumpscare other wise not a bad game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503857363, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503857363, "recommendationid": "34535674", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495358269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198085093968", "num_games_owned": 304}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ignore this one.
