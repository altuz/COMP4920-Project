By that, I mean I bought it last Christmas and couldn't get it to work properly.  Basically, the music wouldn't play in the levels and me being a Windows 10 user was a bit frustrated.  \n\nThankfully, on August, there was a music patch, but that meant I had to start a new save file to hear it, which I didn't mind since I just gave up on the second level back then so I didn't get too far.  \n\nAnd now I finally beat this and it's an improvement over the first Dark Forces.  The familiar weapons like the blaster and the Stomtrooper rifle return.  So do the mines and grenaids.  Plasma rifle and pulse rifle.  They work just as they did in the first game, but the movement feels more fluid than ever.\n\nNot only that, but the level design is a lot less confusing and more straightforward.  And the addition of the lightsaber as well as force powers is a welcome addition to combat.  I ESPECIALLY love how depending on your actions in the game, you will get different Force powers.  Jedi have non-lethal powers like blinding and invisibility, while Sith have Destruction and Force LIghtning.  \n\nIt adds some replayability, even if player choice is basic.  Don't expect Mass Effect or Deus Ex levels of it.  All it really changes other than what Force powers you do have are some of the Dark Jedi boss battles and some cutscenes.  You don't get brand new levels for different choices or anything like that.  Just a different ending and a few new cutscenes that just come out of nowhere (like the ending just feels so out of character for a guy who just wants to avenge his slain father).\n\nAnd the Star Wars soundtrack is awesome, given how this is long past the days of MIDI soundtrack.  Not that I hated the first game's soundtrack since it was pretty charming, but I think it goes without saying that most would prefer CD quality.  Me being one of them.  \n\nBut the only thing about this game I can qualify as a negative is that, depending on how tolerant of the visuals you are, they haven't aged the best.  Thankfully, the cutscenes are in FMV, but even those look grainy on HD monitors.  I'm very tolerant of dated visuals, but I didn't find anyting particularly novel of the art style.  \n\nNothing really immersed me into its environment unlike games such as Quake, that while had dated 3D visuals, it at least made the most out of the lighting effects and coloration to still immerse me into it.  But to give credit where credit is due, it looks like a game set in the Star Wars universe.  \n\nAnd I think the bosses are garbage.  They involve a duel against a Dark Jedi, and all of them just amount to avoiding their lightsaber and tapping them, hoping they don't block them.  It sounds cool on paper, but the execution leaves a lot to be desire.  Some bosses are just outright annoying, like Boc where he just jumps around, being a constant nuisance.  Just wait for him to slash, then go forward and tap him while his guard is down, do it again, that's all the bosses amount to.  \n\nBut the positives heavily outweigh the negatives.  And given how they patched the music, I highly recommend buying this and its expansion I've yet to play, but they usually come in a bundle so why not give that a try as well."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506632063, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35272395", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_reviews": 362, "last_played": 1506630615, "num_games_owned": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "playtime_forever": 15}, "timestamp_updated": 1506632063, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is an interesting first-person shooter.

I had the CD-ROM version of this game years ago and never managed to finish it but today, today i finaly have and you know what? I enjoyed almost every minute of it, i wanted to finish this before moving on to the expansion called Mysteries of the Sith.\n\nBefore you go \"Oh awesome this game has had positive reviews recently\" just remember this game is old, 20 years old in fact but even then it still plays alright. \nIf you came into this game from Jedi Outcast or Jedi Academy and expect this to have the same epic saber combat you'll be dissapointed... Let's just say as cool as it is using lightsabers in this game it is definantly not a strong point in these early games... It can be difficult to hit where you want and the saber blocking is extremely hard to master, in short I pretty much stuck to guns the entire way.\nThis game has Live Action Cutscenes (Filmed with Actors) and they are pretty cool to be honest, the last time i seen anything like it was in the C&C Tiberium Wars series, quality may not be the best but come on this is a game from the mid 90's and having cutscenes like this is actualy epic!\n\nIf you have read this far in then you are probably considering buying this game, and i think you should! Just make sure you download dgvoodoo and place the D3DImm.dll & DDraw.dll in the game directory, this will allow you to use 3D Accelerated Graphics and 16bpp colours!\nDelete Jedi.EXE as you don't need it, deleting it will allow you to launch the game through Steam.\n\nMultiplayer is still alive in these games and there is a Discord group that orginises games and supplies the IP Addresses to connect with!\n\nhttps://discord.me/jediknightdarkforces2"}]}
