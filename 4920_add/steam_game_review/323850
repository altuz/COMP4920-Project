Unfortunatly it didn't work at all.\n\nOn Ubuntu/Linux it worked smooth, but it couldn't recognize the controllers. I played other couch-coop games with the examt same controllers and it worked so its definitly a game bug.\n\nOn a Windows Laptop (slow) the controller worked but it was unplayable becaue it already buged in the menue.\nOn my PC it worked but as soon as there were more stuff on the screen it became incredibly slow. My PC is old, but all the other arcade-couch-coop games work just fine on it.\n\nI see that there was a lot of work put in it, but this games code seriously needs to be fixed. I don't know why it is so slow, but right now its just unplayable for me and thats really sad.\n\n\nSo as long as you don't have a up-to-date PC with more or less high-end specs, don't buy this game.
