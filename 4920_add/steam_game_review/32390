I had the CD-ROM version of this game years ago and never managed to finish it but today, today i finaly have and you know what? I enjoyed almost every minute of it, the expansion of Dark Forces II called Mysteries of the Sith.\n\nI recomend playing Dark Forces II Jedi Knight before diving into this!\n\nThis game is old, 20 years old in fact but even then it still plays alright. \nIf you came into this game from Jedi Outcast or Jedi Academy and expect this to have the same epic saber combat you'll be dissapointed... Let's just say as cool as it is using lightsabers in this game it is definantly not a strong point in these early games... It can be difficult to hit where you want and the saber blocking is extremely hard to master, in short I pretty much stuck to guns the entire way.\nThe last couple of levels are extremely tedious and you'll soon make best friends with the quicksave button but they are at least interesting and if you love a challenge then you will love this!\nYou play as Mara Jade through majority of the game and she was once the Emperors Hand!\nMost of the level design in this is substantualy better than the previous game as well.\n\nIf you have read this far in then you are probably considering buying this game, and i think you should! Just make sure you download dgvoodoo and place the D3DImm.dll & DDraw.dll in the game directory, this will allow you to use 3D Accelerated Graphics and 16bpp colours!\n\nMultiplayer is still alive in these games and there is a Discord group that orginises games and supplies the IP Addresses to connect with!\n\nhttps://discord.me/jediknightdarkforces2"}]}
