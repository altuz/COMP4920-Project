I have done google earth vr, universe sandbox, zombie training simulator, irrational exuberance, and others. Although the framerate is sometimes not the best, I haven't really had much of a problem with motion sickness, and it has not subtracted from the experience significantly. So while it is not the best for VR, it still works.
