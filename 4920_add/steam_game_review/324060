There are ways to do things that make it a very absorbing game. I am mostly lost and finding myself wandering about but with a real purpose it gives me the opportunity to loose myself in space. Cool. Also too, there are achievements to find and some being obtained by serendipity. If you wish for a walking - sim, check this one out. I strongly recommend it.", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1505559091, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505559091, "recommendationid": "34993740", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498914", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
