This is not different to other things - you wouldn\u00b4t buy a TV, car, etc. without first reading the Pro/Cons before, right?\n\nRising World is a game in development, in Alpha stadium. That means it is incomplete and every update can change the whole game experience.\nThe content of the game is currently \"limited\" to building. Why i set \"limited\" into paraphrases? Simply because the game is yet incomplete and still, in my opinion, the best building game out there.\n\nIt has (yet!) no hostile NPC, no electricity or mechanics, almost no survival feature (only basic hunger / thirst). And still i tell you it is the best building game out there - why?\n\nWhen you start Rising World you start off with choosing your randomly generated world. With different biomes (grass, forest, winter, mountain, lakes, desert, etc.) that have a beautiful graphic.\nThe light effects, day and night cycle, weather effects (sunny, foggy, rainy) give it all the feeling of a living world.\nSome animals (hostile and neutral) do their business around you.\n\nBut thats not all. You start crafting a tent, a fire place and feel like a nomade. When you adventure futher you build some crafting tables that allow you to build a wide variety of differently textured blocks with many different shapes. Some furniture, decoration items, different lights (fire and electrical) and tools.\n\nSo far not exciting enough? Well, then have a look at the system of planks, beams and logs. You simply craft them from wood but can change them in size - and texture (via console).\n\nWhile the normal blocks can be placed like in any other crafting games too the planks and beams are objects that can be rotated, resized and placed in any way you can image.\n\nYou make them tiny and rotate them - craft a vase, a table, a grandfather clock, a spinning wheel, ...\nMake them the size of a block and place them freely like you need\nMake them huge and rotate them to build your round tower, tubes, etc.\n\nDon\u00b4t feel bound to a certain grid - just work with this amazing planks and  beams system. And save your masterpiece with the blueprints - or download those others provide and use it in your own game.\n\nThis system is it what makes the difference to other building games i know. Its flexibility and nearly limitless application possibilities.\n\n\n\nWhats for the future?\n\nThe next update will bring some more weapons and especially - character models that can be adjusted individually. Also the survival features will be improved.\n\nThe character models will be the basis for the next update - bandits, pirates, traders, hostile npc...\n\nAnd after? Horses, Trains, Breeding (a plug in already allows this!), electricity....\n\n\nRed51 is a passionate developer. Not the fastest - but for a good reason! Being mostly alone working on the game and having to depend on freelancers he does an awesome job about this game already and, at least for me, he has my trust to bring his vision into reality with Rising World.\n\nHave a problem? Just post on forums and he will answer, if the community doesn\u00b4t do it before. \n\nHis vision for the future is to raise Rising World to a new level. While currently almost completely a building game he wants to make it a game with each 33% for Building, Survival and Exploring.\n\nAnd the best thing is - nearly all features in the game already can or will be individually adjustable. You love Tigers but hate Bears - no problem! Just check out these nasty Teddys.\nYou love building but survival is not your thing? No problem - creative mode and easy switching is no problem.\n\nIs everything so great about this game? No. It isn\u00b4t. Currently i feel very lonely in this game. No matter if single player or multiplayer.\nDue to the missing challange of survival and hostile NPCs most people really focus on building on their SP games or on private servers.\nI sometimes feel too lonely and even though it tickles me to build another fortress or huge mine i retreat and play something else - waiting for better times (next update).\n\nTaking a break from the game doesn\u00b4t mean though it\u00b4s not good anymore. I just accept the fact that the game is in development and not complete yet.\nAnd that sometimes means to do a break and play something else - always lurking in the dark to wait for the next upate with....", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505646427, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505646427, "recommendationid": "35020589", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526418", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506421640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3505, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6891, "steamid": "76561198328071028", "num_games_owned": 8}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Bought this game a couple of days ago after years of playing games like BDO, AA, Rift, Rust etc and have spent 60+ hours on it already.

You need to be looking for complete games not Early Acces (EA).\n\nIt takes alot of time and alot of getting things wrong and making lots and lots of changes in game development, please be respectfull of the people who actually do make the games and know how to! If you think you can do better, then do it instead of moaning and complianing about it!\n\nI actually really like this game and It is based on building when it first came out, but has had alot of updates since. There is an advanced building feature to the ganme, where you can build just about anything you can imagine and save it as a blueprint for use on other maps or share with other people. I think alot of us are very patiently waiting for the player model and clothes update this September hopefully (finger's crossed!). The other part of this game it is designed to be customized how you want it to be. So the only person to blame is yourself and your own lack of imagination, (if it's not up to you're expectations that is!).\n\nAnyway keep up the good work JIW-Games and Red51 as I'm sure this will be a winner, as you are taking you're time to get the updated right before you post them.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505905674, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505905674, "recommendationid": "35081812", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495625", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507016475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 769, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1840, "steamid": "76561198063659502", "num_games_owned": 87}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "the devs need to up date more there ment to be an up date last moth but never happend so far this game is pretty good i enjoy it the only really good server on the game i got banned from but its ok ive found another either way hopefully the devs aint dropped it its got an awesome build system and style from minecraft style building to building with poles and boards awesome game if you wanna build a wicked house and what not ALSO THERES HEMP but you cant smoke it sadly but i hope you can in furure\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506078919, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506078919, "recommendationid": "35125405", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503012", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507173794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 828, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11197, "steamid": "76561197970571781", "num_games_owned": 59}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "[h1]First review after 173 hours[/h1]\nAfter months of intermittent play I felt compelled to write a review.\n\nThis game has one of the most robust building systems of anything I have seen.

If creative building is more your speed it is extremely flexible and the terraforming tools are very powerful. *See the gallery*  Survival play is coming along and improving.\n\nI am highly anticipating the upcoming avatar update and reworking of the animations.  I think this update may be the spark that ignites the popularity of this game.

The terrain generation is very good (Water update was great). I would like to see additional generation options such as... \nNOTE:  The following are not complaints but a wishlist :)\n[list]\n[*] Dictate larger biomes or select which biomes to include in the generation.\n[*] More varied seashores (rocky like the northwest pacific of the U.S. or fjords) in addition to sand and palm trees.\n[*] A density setting for cave generation and ponds.\n[*] A portion of mountaintops be more rounded (older looking) and longer.  Perhaps that would be a differnt biome?\n[*] This next one is way out there...(difficult)  An occaisonal water filled trench from the base of a mountain (Spring) to a lake.\n[/list]\n\nOkay.
