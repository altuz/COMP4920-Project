It is just roulette with players non-stop. You cannot stop anyone from signing your players and you cannot renew contracts with higher asking prices because players reject them. Players do not recognize when you offer them more wages in exchange for higher transfer asks. This is just a really awful game in all. I had a player whos agent asked me for 118,500 per season and a 850,000 transfer sum, well, I offered him 500,000 per season and a 25,000,000 transfer sum, he rejected. Tried again and offered him 10,000,000 per season and a 10,000,000 transfer sum and he rejected it. I tried this with every player just to test it and every player just declines.\n\nThere is no way to call this a football manager game at all.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457947940, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457947940, "recommendationid": "21831542", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571682", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1457193724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 45, "steamid": "76561197961424031", "num_games_owned": 294}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "awful, gimmicky, dull..... the match engine pays little attention to your tactics you pick, individual player orders are non-existant... training is shocking, i mean, you are limited to how many players you can train.... a number of language trnslation discrepancies within the game.... inability to 'sort' player by skill, position etc... having to go to one screen to do one thing then going onto another screen to another, and keep flitting about between screens is laboursome....the command function...Wtf?? really, just buy fifa if you want direct input into a football game, or buy Fm20xx series of games if you want a decent manager game.... this is very much like fifa manager , except(gasp....!!) less depth...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457320188, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457320188, "recommendationid": "21678847", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503997", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1457276471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561197980896334", "num_games_owned": 421}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Crash on hitting continue after first match.
