The protagonist, Sofi, is a young girl who loses her grandmother and then determinedly journeys to find her while struggeling to come to terms with her death. Lucidity is a not passive linear media, however, but instead is a game, and its specific gameplay is very much about quick thinking and adaptation, as the player is asked to help Sofi navigate constantly changing environments using a continually randomized set of tools.\n\n   These themes from story and gameplay seem to be oddly paired, especially at first. As the game begins, and Sofi starts marching forward on her own, the player is taught how to use certain tools to keep her safe until she reaches the end of the environment. Sofi is not entirely helpless (she\u2019ll climb up small rises with ease), and the game might look much like it belongs in the platformer genre when viewed from a distance, albeit one that plays itself. If left alone, however, Sofi will die, and on later levels, die often, falling victim to giant enemies and treacherous falls. It will be up to you to keep her away from those living dust bunnies and spiky pits by placing things like staircases, fans and slingshots in her path, enabling her to jump and climb past danger.\n\n   Lucasarts described Lucidity as a \u201cchallenging puzzler,\u201d and, well, I agree. The puzzle to be solved is fairly straightforward: get Sofi to the end of the level safely, navigating through a sometimes dangerous environment and around always dangerous creatures. I think it is important to point out that this particular puzzler does not derive its challenge from obscure solutions or mind-twisting scenarios; indeed, the game thrives on offering the player a multitude of solutions at any given moment. If the ground is covered in deadly plants, you might slingshot Sofi past them, build stairs to let her climb over them, place a jump pad to let her climb to a higher level of platforms, or bomb the plants out of existence. All of these actions would probably work with some degree of success. The challenge lies in choosing the best solution with the current tools available, and then in implementing the solution before Sofi runs into danger. The time pressure makes the relatively straightforward problem solving thrilling.\n\n   Lucidity deals with is treatment of grief by cleverly separating the bereaved character from the player, casting the player as the one helping the main character through her pain. The player must continually adapt while the playing field and pieces change, as Sofi must learn to adapt to the concept of death. The symbolic journey does falter a bit toward the end as the narrative pulls apart from the gameplay, unfortunately.\n\n     There are a few technical quirks that impact the experience enough that they bear mentioning. Because gameplay essentially involves placing level pieces on a grid, a gamepad offers a smoother experience here compared to a mouse (having a mouse cursor constantly snapping to a grid is an alien and unnerving sensation)."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1450379782, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524325", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "19751237", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198137376448", "num_reviews": 143, "last_played": 1450378614, "num_games_owned": 5646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 49}, "timestamp_updated": 1450379782, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Lucidity is basically a platformer with a tetris mechanic, in which you have to cross levels and collect fireflies. You don't control the girl, who's always moving forward--you just lay down pieces to build a path for her. I wouldn't call it a puzzle game, though.\n\nI'll go straight to pros and cons:\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Graphics are cute.\n\ud83d\udc4d Music is pleasant.\n\ud83d\udc4d A lot of content. It supposedly has 27 levels, and that's a lot of levels, since they're long and you'll have to repeat them if you want to 100% the game.\n\n\u00b1 It has some back story going on, but it's underdeveloped. The intro didn't make any sense. You're reading stories, then you fall asleep close to your grandma, then you wake up and start running forever after a red firefly that's eaten by a frog.\n\n\ud83d\udc4e The gameplay mechanic falls short and really gets boring after 1 or 2 levels. You basically get a piece, which you put in the environment or save for later (only one), and then you'll get a new one. Pieces are unlimited, so I found that the best way to succeed was laying down tons of pieces without thinking too much about it. And that's where this game lost its potential charm. Basically, doing everything fast pays off more than thinking about what you're doing.\n\ud83d\udc4e Beating a level is way too easy, while mastering it (getting all fireflies) is way too repetitive, and sometimes hard, because it's luck-dependent.\n\ud83d\udc4e Sometimes you have to replay the whole level just for one firefly you've missed. The bad thing is that she moves at a very slow pace, and you can't fast-forward. It got boring really fast.\n\ud83d\udc4e Health system is a bit weird. I couldn't figure out how my health was, some enemies hit you and you're sure they aren't able to, sometimes you think you've been hit because the girl moans when she falls or climbs, so this part is a mess.\n\ud83d\udc4e Sometimes it's hard to position a piece when the girl is jumping or falling. It feels a bit awkward.\n\nBasically, this game is really boring and repetitive. Don't be fooled by the LucasArts hype, or by that line up there in the description, saying \"From the team that re-imagined The Secret of Monkey Island\u2122, comes Lucidity, an addictive puzzle platformer set in the surreal childlike dreamscapes of the little girl Sofi\". It has nothing to do with Monkey Island, it doesn't feel like a puzzle, and it's really boring, and not one bit addictive. Don't be fooled by the cute graphics.

Some games are like that, they put everything they have right out from the get-go and don't ever push past that foundation. Lucidity certainly starts with plenty of promise in its storybook world and charming presentation. It's just when you actually get down to playing it that it falters.\n\nThe game opens in a quaint little house on a hill, where a little girl lives with her doting grandma. Your wee lass nods off while reading tales of adventure, and dreams of traveling to fantastical faraway lands. This is where the action is, in the dreams of this young lady, and it's up to you to help her get through her adventure in one adorable piece. And maybe collect some fireflies, too!\n\nI'm sure that all sounds peachy until you play it. See, Lucidity is one of those platformers where you don't actually control your character. Sofi (her name is Sofi, I had to look that up) trundles along to the right at a steady clip, only stopping if she literally runs into a wall. Otherwise she'll happily plunge off a cliff or smack face-first into a dream wasp. There's no jumping, no ducking, and while we're on the subject there's no way to speed up her slow stroll, either.\n\nTo help her not toddle into certain death like an idiot, you get to place objects in the world that protect her. These include planks and stairs to walk on, springs and fans to launch her, and bombs that can clear enemies away and take chunks out of solid surfaces. You don't get to place these freely, though, because each item is chosen for you, one at a time, Tetris-style. You can bank one item for later use but in general you're going to be working with whatever the game decides to give you at the moment.\n\nI suppose this could work with some clever level design but that's the last thing you're going to get here. Levels are vast expanses of blocky platforms and pits of death and enemies that require some quick thinking when placing objects. Honestly placing objects is always going to require quick thinking, because as slow as Sofi is she doesn't tend to give you much room to work with on her teeny-tiny platforms hanging in a deadly void. There's a huge amount of vertical space to explore as well, with elevated areas that you're only going to get to with a lucky combination of springs and fans anyway.\n\nThe end result just isn't any fun, and it's dragged even further down by a conspicuous lack of polish. The art style is a flat papier mache style but coupled with the sharp, straight lines that comprise platforms, levels end up looking like cheap vector art. Some of the backgrounds are nice to look at but others feature some terrible and distracting color combinations. The worst offender is your own interface, with flat yellow silhouettes for your objects, and flat blue silhouettes for the ones you place. It seriously looks like placeholder art, lacking any sort of effects or continuity with the world.\n\nPlatformers with indirect control are always a dicey proposition because the threshold for frustration is so much lower. You feel like most of the game is out of your hands, leaving you to simply react to what someone else is doing. Something like Kirby's Canvas Curse worked wonderfully because you had a huge amount of control over your character and the world around him, just in an indirect manner. That's not at all the case here, where you can't even choose how to save Sofi from her own stupidity, you just throw whatever you have at her and hope for the best. Coupled with the unpleasant level design and inconsistent art, Lucidity is more of a nightmare than the dream walk it's supposed to be.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

The premise is to help a little girl skip her merry way through myriad  imaginary landscapes, using conjured-up items (such as staircases, slingshots, bombs, etc) to provide her safe passage and remove obstacles and enemies from her path.
