Here's my review for each one:\n\n1. Moto racer, the bonafide classic. not many tracks, but the game is wonderful, old-school, and arcadey. A definate must-have! 4:3 only, use the \"black bars\" mode.\n2. Just like its predecessor, this game is wonderful and fast and arcadey. Much more tracks this time around, but the game is a tad more realistic and not quite as arcadey as MR1. If you add custom widescreen resolutions lower than 1024x768, usually they appear in-game.\n3. Moto Racer 3 is a departure from the second one as there is a heavier focus on \"arcade realism\". The COD of the Moto Racer series, but this game is very enjoyable still and as always, has a wonderful sense of speed. 4:3 only.\n4. The classic from ios, this game was created with auto-acceleration in mind. Play this with a controller and don't be as heavy on the throttle! The shoulder buttons are best for acceleration as button A is hard-coded to be Boost. 4x3 only, just like the older versions. This game is fairly faithful to its predecessors and is a good time waster, but not quite as good as the originals.\n\nOverall, i'd say if you are a fan of the series, by all means get this title. It's cheaper than buying each one on GOG, and it's great fun for all ages!\nThe game had extreme bugs on release, but on my windows 8.1, amd fx 8350, and nvidia gtx 660, these games run fine and have few problems.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415923707, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1415923707, "recommendationid": "12930790", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567565", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1412333333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561197995330335", "num_games_owned": 983}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 85, "comment_count": "7", "review": "This is a [i]collection[/i], so be aware that the original games have not been improved upon.\nThe store page is not ambiguous about that, but I'd rather reiterate because you might have different expectations in this age of HD remakes.\nHaving loved the original Moto Racer back in the day, a straight port was fine by me, except...\n\n[b]Moto Racer 1 [i]won't launch[/i][/b] on my machine -- launcher fails to set colour depth. There might be a way around it, like setting my display to 16-bit manually, but I can't be arsed right now. I might put effort into finding a workaround later though, because I recall this one being my favourite.\n\n[b]Moto Racer 2[/b] does launch, but there's [b][i]no sound during races[/i][/b], no music or SFX. Plays well, but feels weird because of that.\n\n[b]Moto Racer 3 [i]works[/i][/b] (huzzah!). Don't think I played this one back in the day (or not much); it seems less arcadey and fun than the previous two instalments, but that's just my impression after a single race.\n \n[b]Moto Racer 15th anniversary[/b] is the most recent entry (you can tell it's modern because you accelerate with the right trigger, not the A button!) and it's [b][i]utter garbage[/i][/b]. Not only does it manage to be uglier than the other, way older entries, but more shamefully it plays poorly. Not the game I cared about anyway, but dang, morbid curiosity is the only reason to bother trying it at all -- and even then I couldn't finish a single lap in a cross race. The way it handles just feels entirely wrong, like someone's first Unity game on XBLIG.\n\nSo all in all, if I find a way to make sound work in 2 and for 1 to launch at all, maybe I'll spend some time with this, reminiscing. But I cannot recommend it in good faith.\n\n[i](Oh, and I spent more than 5 minutes with this -- but Steam only counts time spent in the launcher apparently)[/i]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412333393, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1412333393, "recommendationid": "12336199", "language": "english", "votes_down": 38, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588188", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437614982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11, "steamid": "76561197980110975", "num_games_owned": 355}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Got this game on the Week long sale on 20/07/2015. \n\nFirst thing I gotta say, yes, it works.

There are unplayable areas (mostly when you're playing a dirt race with many competitors on screen) and MASSIVE slowdowns... Could be better.\n\nNow the biggest reason for the Negative review: they f*** up Moto Racer 2! Why was the great, perfect soundtrack changed? WHY? I do believe I left Moto Racer's 2 CD more time in my Stereo then in the PC, just for how great the soundtrack is. Then I load the game with high expectations for a battery solo to start the video and I get a totally souless music in a new intro video, and then the menu screen hits and where is the beautiful Punk Rock music?
