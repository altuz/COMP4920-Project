Held back by the pretty high price i first hesitated, but later bought it when on sale. What can i say, i really dont regret it.\n\nFirst i all my overall impression is basicly i would recommend the visuell novel Clannad to both, people who really liked the anime and people who are just fans of visuel novels.\nYou get to know and to like the Charaters in the story pretty fast and can spend several happy but also sad hours with it. I shed my first manly tears at the Fuko ending ;). Even if you only play the main-route (Nagisa) you at least need several hours to clear to thing, and you wont get the full experience. So i really recommend you to try several paths to get to know all the beautifully designed characters.\n\nAt last i just have to say is dont get scared by the price, even if you are short on money, you will really enjoy this gem.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505507238, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505507238, "recommendationid": "34980608", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504763", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507092354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6280, "steamid": "76561198327408456", "num_games_owned": 6}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "CLANNAD is the story if Tomoya Okazaki, and the lonely delinquent life he leads as his Senior year in high school begins. Lonely that is, until he meets Nagisa...\n\nIn short, CLANNAD is a fantastic game. The story, all the characters, my GOD, the music! The art is a little moe but it's not by any means a deal breaker. The player is immersed in the role of Tomoya, as he lives out his days in high school in the School Life arc, before graduating and getting a job later in the After Story arc, which becomes available after a number of playthroughs of School Life. However, I do want to point out, what I really liked, was that in the Misae and Kotomi route paths, the player, for a time, is immersed in the game as Katsuki Shima and Kotomi respectively. It's so interesting and unique how the player gets to play as more than just the MC and it really drived home just how heart breaking their stories are. \n\nEach story route in CLANNAD has its own unique qualities to them, and they're all worth experiencing. I do't have the time nor patience to go through ALL the routes and what each of them does well and not so well so I'll just give some important hilights. Baseball route is funny and pure comedy with no drama, it's a nice, relaxing route, but doesn't really pack the Key punch. Misae and Kotomi routes are two favorites especially with the immersion as different characters, as I mentioned above. Tomoyo's route in the first half is a bit annoying at times because they made Tomoya a really perverted MC, much more so than he is in other routes, but the second half of the route is nothing short of a masterpiece, and makes it all worth it. You see the effects and pain the passage of time can create between people. There is a character called Kappei who never made it into the anime and he is male which really intrigued me, but his route isn't all that amazing. Kyou's route is really nice and the character interations make it, but the pacing is a little too slow. It really drags for a while. Komura's route is nice, but too short. It's more of a scene than a route. Yukine's route hardly has drama and much of what they included in the anime is not included hereAnd of course, there's Fuko and Nagisa, who are just treasures who need to be protected. After Story is a whole other thing and in the essence of spoilers, I'll stop with hilights here.\n\nKazamatsuri made a really helpful guide you can use to get through the game. I highly recommend using it. Though if I had to point out one thing that disappointed me about the game is there are a good number of uneccesary choices. They carry no significance to the plot at all and really offer a 10 second snippet difference in story. It leaves the player (or me, at least) somewhat frustrated trying to figure out what choices to make when I shouldn't need to make one. Another little issue I had was not with the actual game, but with the translations. Not in the sense they are inaccurate, but they just read kinda clunky sometimes and sound unnatural. There are also a few typos here and there as well.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game. It's classic Key. Hilarious, dramatic and sad, has beautiful music, and the voice acting is great. There's also an option on the menu to listen to the songs as you unlock them in the game, which is a nice touch, and the Dangopedia is interesting too. There's plenty of material in here that did not make it to the anime so even if you've seen the anime, I still recommend you play this. I watched the anime first but still fell in love with this visual novel. Given it's running time, I'd say it's worth $50, but if you grab it on sale, you can get a prett sweet deal out of it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505336861, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505336861, "recommendationid": "34927279", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502526", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504985984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6067, "steamid": "76561198118823512", "num_games_owned": 72}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "WARNING: A totally subjective opinion!\n\nOne of the best Visual Novels of all time!

(And for people who don't want to spend 80 hours on a VN, the anime is a perfect substitute in this case!) \n\nI had always assumed that most romantic visual novels starred blank slate protagonists and cliched filled women, and served simple as wish fulfillment. I still hold that assumption for the majority of the genre still, but Clannad is different. Tomoya has a very defined personality, and is nowhere near a perfect character. And despite the fact that most of the routes end in romance, Clannad doesn't consider getting the girl to be the good end. The game puts the happiness of the characters first and foremost. In some cases, that means accepting that being apart is the better choice for both characters, In others, it has nothing to do with romance at all. Even though I feel like the female characters have some writing issues, the fact that acquiring their affection is not the overall point, makes them feel more real.\n\nDespite some issues I have with the writing, I think it hits at every single point where it counts, Not just the sad moments, but the joyful moments too. The amount of visual/audio gags that are pulled off through the simple presentation astonished me. I was rolling on the ground at points.\n\nSpeaking of the visuals, the artstyle takes a bit to get used to. I do not think its bad per se, but it is definitely not something that I love about the game. However, it looks crisp in 1080p. Only the 4:3 ratio keeps it from looking more \"modern\" although I am not someone who absolutley needs my TV screen to be filled up. \n\nAnd the music, oh man the music. It is so dang catchy, I was always humming along to most of the songs. And the ones that I was not humming along with, were causing me to cry instead. It all fits perfectly wherever it needs to be.\n\nThe VN did actually change my opinion of the ending. Its something I now think the anime did not nail as well. I want to get into that, so for anyone who isn't familar with the material, leave and play/watch this.\n\nSPOILERS BEGIN\n\n\n\n[spoiler] It never sat with me that Nagisa was saved at the end. I felt like it would have been better to end with Tomoya living with Ushio and leave it with that. I never felt like her revival was a deus ex machina, since it is built up since the beginning, but I did feel like it was too \"neat\". And that feeling started to develop even more when the VN started to confront the theme of change, much more than in the anime. Until I hit this dialogue: \n\n                      \"Is our reaction supposed to be to say 'Ah, everything is always changing...?' But we're human beings \n                        Living creatures with emotions. Who fight with everything they have to keep from being sad, and \n                        from losing what's important to them.\"\n\nThat's when it hit me: Clannad is not saying change is inevitable and we should just always accept it and move on, it's saying that change is inevitable but some of it deserves to be fought. In fact, this theme is also prevelant in Tomoyo's route. Her whole goal is to prevent the sakura trees from being cut down, because she believes its a change for the worse. Once that realization hit me, the ending made much more sense. Tomoya and Ushio refused to accept Nagisa's death as a change that was acceptable and did everything they could to stop it. It made the whole end feel much more thematically relevant than I had thought before. [/spoiler]\n\n\nSPOILERS END\n\nI love Clannad.
