This VN has a great story line, all the charaters had diverse personality. The MC, Ahri, had a very different personality from most otome MCs. Which I LOVED! The two love interest Kenta and Ryuu, were very different from each and both great choices. Since the story is very short you didnt get alot of back story from them, but somehow the game still added demension to them. The plot was really good. Only con was that it was short so I couldnt get much from the charaters as I would like. But that really isnt a big con. Also I was misinformed, I was told to be there was nudity in this game. THERE IS NONE!!!! \n\nArt: The CGS were AMAZING!! The art was wounderful also they had alot of art!! Also I reaaly loved the diverse expression there charaters had as well! Only flaw is I wish there was a way to save the CGs in game without a textbox over them.\n\nWriting: The writing was really good, each charater was written and scripted really well. Especally Ahri.\n\nI would of given this a 5/5 but it just needs more content.
