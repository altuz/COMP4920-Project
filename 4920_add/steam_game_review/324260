I've been looking for something like Solar Winds(Old 90's DOS game) and I've played a ton of space games but this is the one I needed.\n\nWay more polished than Transcendance, another awesome space game, but the same kind of gameplay. \n\nNow I need a space game that comibines Elite Dangerous, X: Rebirth, No Man's Sky and Starpoint Gemini 2.

Glad I did, this is a fun indie game.\n\nIf you are into space, flying around from various star systems, trading good, mining asteroids, hunting space pirates, fighting aliens, modding ships with cool tech, building up your character with new skills... if you are into any of that and more, then you should check this little gem of a game out.\n\nIf you are into making game mods... you can do that with this game as well.  Somebody made Star Wars ship mods that I have yet to check out, but look like fun!\n\nAs an old school gamer, who had fun playing games like Sentinel Worlds on the C64, and Hard Nova on the Amiga 500... this game kinda reminds me a little of those early RPG space games.\n\nWould like to see more games like this.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506537936, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506537936, "recommendationid": "35247327", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500118", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 199, "total_reviews": 279, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 80}}
