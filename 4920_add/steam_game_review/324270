Can't get this one to run, crashes 100% of the time trying to enter the game from the main screen. Changing settings and using compatibility modes on the launcher and main game executable did not work.\n\nThis game uses Unreal v3. There was a bug with the Unreal engine v 4.14 and later that was causing crashes on many newer video cards, the 9xx and 10xx generation of nVidia cards especially; I encountered this with another game. It was fixed by the dev updating the game to v 4.17. It's possible the crash is caused by a similar issue.\n\nSince the Dev has announced end of support for this title, I suspect this won't get examined, and am posting this information in a review to recommend that, if you do purchase this game, you test it within the 2 week refund period to be sure it will work for you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502424872, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502425267, "recommendationid": "34160741", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
