However, I have to say that after tinkering with the settings I got this game to run with really beautiful graphics and found it was strangely different from the old port I originally played. The abilities make you feel very powerful and there are lots of costumes and different lightsaber colors. I had no issues in gameplay after setting my video options correctly. I really enjoy this game though I'm only half way through."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505791738, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498363", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35057214", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197999384396", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506902117, "num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_forever": 991}, "timestamp_updated": 1505791738, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The ultimate Sith edition is much worse than the other versions of the same game. Having played both the wii and PS versions of the game, it lacks some of the missions that the wii has. In addition, the three extra chapters are poorly constructed and all end abruptly without any story line or plot continuity. They looked like they were started adn somone said \"Eh, throw a few tutorial chapters  in, change some character sprites and call it a day. Allt hree chapters seem unfinished and offer no resolution, leading the player to be vaguely pissed of at such shoddy game design."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506366600, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501241", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35208899", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198138287268", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506873853, "num_games_owned": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 334, "playtime_forever": 601}, "timestamp_updated": 1506366600, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Very poor controls, one of the worst PC ports ever"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505332291, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496863", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34926205", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198224416720", "num_reviews": 29, "last_played": 1505332177, "num_games_owned": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 325}, "timestamp_updated": 1505332291, "received_for_free": true, "review": "IF U DONT HAVE A CONTROLR FO NOT BUY THIS GAME\nthe combat is ment for it and at the camra angle it puts u at you will always die cuz u will miss and can not counter"}]}
