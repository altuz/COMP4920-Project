I run a high-end rig but get quite a bit of lag. Other than that, this game is fun. Three things you gotta remember when stopping bus to a stop... hit ALT to enable brake before you load passengers. hit F to kneel the bus. Hit 1 to open front door, hit 2 to open rear door. Reverse the process then drive again. Oh and you better be quick doing the math when giving change...LOL!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506271090, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506271090, "recommendationid": "35185402", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510981", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506559554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 294, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 294, "steamid": "76561198074500153", "num_games_owned": 29}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really enjoy this simulator. The controls are easy to pick up. The driving mechanisms are good. The game play is straight forward. The achivements are obtainable. It is a nice relaxing simulator. \nThe graphics are fairly good. The game runs smooth, no crashs. \nI recommend this game.

First bus simulator that actually works. I really enjoyed my first 2 drives. It's charming, easy to use, I'm not sure if it's a simulator or a arcade style driving game but I guess it's somewhere in between, which is perfect for what I wanted - just drive a bus, relax and enjoy the ride - this game gives just that! Well done!
