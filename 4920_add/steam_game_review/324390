(in game is a lot better than the screenshot )\n- immersive atmosphere if you like mystery sci-fi (the movie moon come to my mind)\n- the puzzles and combats are hard but always fair\n\nso great original idea, design and implementation. Can't wait for the next game from these guys!\n\nMinor flaws:\n- UI sometimes takes a little to long to disappear\n-  does not support all types of game pad\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454449250, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454449250, "recommendationid": "20919980", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501145", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484333008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 339, "steamid": "76561198282515370", "num_games_owned": 4}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Bought this game in sale and you know what? It's very solid. \nI was looking into some action adventure, this game looked interesting enough and the toon effect reminds me to borderland so.. why not?\nResult: wasn't expecting much but this game impressed me a lot.\nNice atmosphere, the action plays better then expected, using the blade is fun and the puzzles are very well done.\nCons? The graphic has style but maybe not the best (at least not the usual 2D game) but I think is more then enough. \nMany people wrote that the walking is slow.. it's sure not fast but for me it's super ok.\nBtw: it runs also with my super cheap GPU so that's also cool.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454955893, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454955893, "recommendationid": "21057961", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499810", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
