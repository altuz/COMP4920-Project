While the artwork and visual design of the Desert Ashes world is actually really nice, it is unfortunate that the developers did not spend as much time on fleshing out the story and world in the way that Advance Wars does.  If they added CO's with personalities and names and some investment in character writing, it would go a long way to making a connect with the game universe.\n\nDespite all the bugs, the lack of depth and refinement, the lack of story and universe, I'm still going to recommend the game on the strength of its visual assets and core gameplay -- which, though not as in-depth or interesting as Advance Wars, is still a fairly enjoyable casual turn-based strategy game that newcomers to the genre will probably find fun and addictive.  Just don't expect it to measure up to the source material it is trying to emulate.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446798080, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446814373, "recommendationid": "18904385", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540556", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1457904168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 28, "steamid": "76561198157269520", "num_games_owned": 159}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "STOP.

You purchase different units for various amounts of gold from your captured factories and bases on the map, and move them into position to defeat the opposing team.\nI feel that this game should of been sold as DLC for Desert Ashes, because so far I find there to be a lot less content and story here than Desert Ashes to warrant a stand alone game and price.\nThis game adds a new team to fight as called the Pocket Gods (Ooga Chaka), and you play as them in the campaign. In a very unusual move, the \"water freezing map event\" that occurred at 1 am game time in Desert Ashes was removed in this game. This was a rather useful event in Desert Ashes because you could travel on the frozen ice as if it were land for a couple game time hours, but now that it's gone, the game continues to tell you what time it is game time for no reason at all now.\nAfter 7 hours I have seen far less story scenes between campaign missions, and a much more simple tutorial. I have also found a rather unusual bug that happens occasionally, where I can not scroll down to the bottom of the unit creation screen to make a \"Dodo\" unit, and a large yellow Y appears on the screen when I try.\nThis strange bug was NOT in Desert Ashes.\nThis game basically just assumes you are familiar with Desert Ashes, which is fine, but this is another one of the reasons I feel it should of been sold as DLC instead of a separate game.\nAnother issue is the lack of online players.\nWhile it is nice to have the option to both host and search for online games at the same time (you can easily play multiple games at once both online and offline with the unique menu system) the lack of players is very obvious. You will find no one else playing for very long periods of time. This is ANOTHER reason why this game should of been sold as DLC, they have split the online community for this game further by forcing two versions of what is basically the same game.\nAs I mentioned in my review for Desert Ashes, I really like these HD colours, and unique artwork and menu system, but the game does feel somewhat unpolished and incomplete just like the previous game. I have finished campaign (15 hours) but it didn't feel like I was doing much other than the same generic maps over and over. It was a good length though if you play it through to the end, and a very rewarding final battle.\nComplaints aside... I DO recommend you buy this if you like games such as Advance Wars, or your a fan of turn based strategy games in general.\nThe gameplay of this series IS really fun.\nI picked this game up during the Holiday Sale 2015 for .54 cents CDN so I feel it was money well spent, but be aware of what your buying if paying full price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451690846, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452472598, "recommendationid": "20197231", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478284", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444098141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 494, "steamid": "76561198023219662", "num_games_owned": 1279}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Dodo bug not fix.\n\nDeveloper abandoned this game?\nNo response in forum.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444096970, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444098210, "recommendationid": "18349110", "language": "english", "votes_down": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471236", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440300251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 57, "steamid": "76561198141245323", "num_games_owned": 37}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "it wont let me get on", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440297348, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440297348, "recommendationid": "17670679", "language": "english", "votes_down": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455470", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483580531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 249, "steamid": "76561198055977195", "num_games_owned": 927}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pocket God vs Desert Ashes is an army tactics game available on Steam or on your phone/tablet. Different units are strong against one unit type and weak vs another unit type. Instead of medieval units such as knights, this game uses island pygmies and robotic invaders. The concept is simple enough, gain gold, buy units to counter enemies units, take over their temple. Being a port from app to computer created a few issues with the H.U.D. (Heads Up Display) where your pygmies would be hiding behind a frame box. The campaign mode is just a series of harder and harder challenges put against you with the enemy having a better and better advantage each level. Tactical choices can make or break you each turn. if you buy the wrong unit or forget to move an unit it can take many turns to catch up. Another big issue I had was trying to figure out what each enemy could do and what class it was. One of the only redeeming qualities was on the levels where you had a water hut, you could get a shark with a fricken laser. Pocket God vs Desert Ashes isn't a horrible game but it isn't a game worth full price by any means.\nPantsu's Rating (out of 5)\nGraphics: 2 I found the graphics to be a bit choppy and bland. The attackers would fire 3 magic balls yet 20 would bombard the enemy.\nPlayability: 2 The frame getting in the way all the time was very annoying, and on bigger maps when you had to move the map around it had a very fixed area that you could set it in, otherwise it would snap back into place.\nFun 2.5 It could keep you entertained for a few hours but I am guessing not much longer. There was a multiplayer option but it didn't seem worth trying.\nSound: 1.5 The noises the characters make are annoying at best. The background music is even worse. best play with the sound off.\nReplay Value: 1 After clearing the campaign all you have left is multiplayer, but being such an old game I doubt there are many people in queue looking for a challenger.\nTotal 1.75 Not worth seeking out but if it comes up for 50 cents why not.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1484211390, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1484211390, "recommendationid": "29199600", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
