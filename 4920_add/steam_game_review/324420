It really does run like a beta. The concept is great, but there are bugs. Lots of bugs. I have been completely unable to log in to play a multiplayer game, and the website that hosts the game evidently does not exist. That's a big issue, especially since several of the achievements involve playing multiplayer games.\n\nAnother wierd bug is the way you can have several games running at once. Okay, not an issue per se. But here's the problem. Once you beat a campaign or skirmish, there's no credit role, no returning to the title screen. It just stays on the \"game over\" screen, and you have to go to the menu from there and select a new game. So now you just have a bunch of games running that aren't really games, they're just game over screens from the games that you beat. I would love for someone to tell me if there's a way to change this. Maybe I'm just missing something? It's quite frustrating. \n\n In terms of gameplay, the game is fun, if not a bit easy. I beat all three campaigns in under six hours. You want a turn based strategy game that's going to challenge you and take up all of your time? Check out Eador: Masters of the Broken World. I got about 300 hours into it before my computer broke and I had to start over again on a new machine. But I digress. In terms of units, Desert Ashes works like a complicated rock, paper, scissors game. Flyers are strong against heavy and naval units, heavies are best against infantry, and infantry take our flying units. And you have a nice selection of each of these kinds of units with varying degrees of power. But after the first few battles (which take like 10-30 minutes), you find a set of a few units that works for you and you can just exploit that for most of the game. The \"unique day/night system\" doesn't really do that much, and once you develop a strategy, you're pretty much good regardless of the day and night. And using terrain to your advantage only matters in one or two levels, and that's if you choose to worry about all of that. All of this has potential--it just needs to be beefed up a bit, made a bit more complicated and strategic.\n\nThe storyline is... um... well, there is one. But in the third campaign you play as the bad guys, which doesn't make sense. Why am I taking the role of the people that I was just fighting against and want to kill all the civilians? The storyline makes them almost sympathetic, but does all these little things to make us dislike them. And SPOILER ALERT: the game just kind of ends. There's no resolution. The bad guys get the upper hand because that's the last campaign and you play as them, and then... ? Seriously, five more dialogue boxes could have wrapped it up nicely, but it just ends, leaving you going \"okay?\"\n\nI got it on sale for five bucks. Fine. No biggie. That's less than two gallons of gas, and I get much less mileage out of that. I don't feel gypped, but I do feel underwhelmed. I hope the developers see this, because there is a lot of potential for this game (maybe the addition of a fourth campaign to finish the story?), but as it is, it needs tweaking.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1416307144, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1416307144, "recommendationid": "12991805", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546198", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1415864781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 170, "steamid": "76561198110248700", "num_games_owned": 302}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 31, "comment_count": "9", "review": "The game at this point plays like an early beta release...\n\nThroughout the campaign mode the already weak dialogue is riddled with basic spelling errors, the game crashes occasionally, and when you try to create an account to play the online multiplier you are actually linked to a barren site that simply says \"Coming soon\".

(Sucks that 4 of its 11 achievements are based on winning multiplayer matches, though it only takes one for 2 of them.) Some problems are the port, but some are just built in.\n\nThe only way this game could be more casual is being pay-to-win (no freemium, yay), with its bright cheery graphics, easy money, and small levels that only take a dozen rounds each with little strategy. Although the day/night cycle SHOULD offer a game-changing twist, the water/ice is just an occasional convenience, and almost every single-player level can be easily won by zerg rushing the enemy. The AI isn't very strong, and the first player has an almost insurmountable advantage thanks to the order battles occur. There's zero randomness, zero specials, and once you know the units you can quickly min-max the game and win everything. A 4X player will find almost no depth here.\n\nAnd yet I think it's kind of cool. It gives some random casual iPhone-like entertainment in between meatier games, and making tons of units and wiping out everything can be surprisingly cathartic. I just wouldn't pay much for it.\n\nI wish it had been fully made for the PC, because so many things require you to sweep your mouse from one end of the screen and back just to give orders. It's ok for a touchscreen, though it'd still have some issues there, but a pain in the ass with a mouse.

This game plays very similar to Advance Wars on the GBA, where you capture locations to earn money, which is used to purchase units. All the different units have different strengths and weaknesses against other units, and the game offers an excellent tutorial explaining each one.\nThis game has a very unique visual style that reminds me of a robotic fantasy world. I've never seen anything like it. The artwork is crisp and colorful, and the game has a very HD look to it. It supports a variety of display resolutions and audio settings. The music and sound effects are very average, and the game has typos in the english language. I also found the game to pause briefly a lot regardless of visual settings before unit attacks, but for the most part this was pretty minor.\nI should mention that the unique menu system in this game can be moved around if you click the mouse and hold the image and pull it to the left and down. You will find visual options and the exit game button with this method of menu interaction. It's rather unusual and not very obvious.\nThis unique menu system allows you to play a campaign mission while searching for a game room to join online and hosting one at the same time. You can then easily switch between the game windows and monitor many in progress games or online game searches. I think it's really useful.\nIf you like such games as Shining Force, Galaxy Admirals, or Advance Wars, you won't be dissappointed here. This is a solid turn based strategy game and deserves much more notice than it seems to get.\nI picked this game up while it was on sale for $1.09 CDN and I found that to be a great deal.

Then you have two shortish single player campaigns, playing as each of the two factions in the game, where the maps are reasonably diverse and the AI is kind of okay enough to make you pay attention to what you are doing, although it is not hard to beat all of the missions. Still I don't think there isn't really enough content in the single player campaigns, or the skirmishes that would really capture your attention for long, they are more an introduction/practice venue.\n\nThe game is pretty well balanced - all the unit types have their benefits and weaknesses, and nothing clearly is always the best thing to build (although on certain large open water maps the long range sea units are hard to beat if you have a few, and unlike the land artillery there is no way to use the cheap unit swarming countermeasure to overrun them for most of the day). Both sides have the same units with different names/graphics, so the sides are implicitly balanced. The freezing of water at night adds an extra angle on some maps - what was a deadlock and chokepointed map can suddenly spring wide open, or as mentioned suddenly your dominating whale artillery squadron is suddenly immobile and vulnerable.  \n\nAs mentioned above you have to pay attention - the mechanics of buying units which then can't move or attack until the next turn means that if you start losing ground or end up short of units one turn then the opponent is probably going to stomp all over you very fast. This means you don't get long drawn out defensive rearguard actions slowing the end stages of the game, but also that you have to watch what you are doing - retreating your artillery a space or two before firing, or spawning a unit at a different factory so they are out of range of attackers, can be all the difference between winning and losing. Or using the nearest unit to attack rather than one moving up from the back so you leave the more forward one to capture a building, or attack the next unit further back which your other unit can't reach, etc.\n\nThe game menu UI is a little bit idiosyncratic (presumably designed for mobile devices), but usuable enough, and the in game UI is easy enough to use, with the odd exception where you want to move a unit in the corner of the map that is sitting under part of the UI, and dragging the screen to show the unit doesn't help as it snaps back and recentres before you can click on the unit. Checking your opponents movement/attack ranges in their next turn is also fairly easy/intuitive. However unlike, say, Hero Academy your moves play out immediately and there is no undo, so you can't experiment and work out an optimal strategy by trial and error, but there are far few variables in Desert Ashes so once you have experience this probably won't be a big loss...most of the time, until you start attack and suddenly realise there was a better option/order of doing things. On the other hand this does make for a more live/raw feel for the game when you can't just unkill a bunch of units and try something different as often as you like.\n\nThe multiplayer set up seems fine - you can set maximum turn lengths to suit how you want to play (24 hour limits for a more play by email type game, or 5 minutes if you want to play \"live\"), and you can play multiple games at once where appropriate, which is simple enough as you just exit one game, drag up and down the list if needed, and \"zoom\" into the other game to switch over, all fairly seamless and easy to use. Logging in seems to work from the Steam account, so no mucking about there, although there are sometimes connection issues with the login server it has always been pretty temporary for us. Creating new games is also fairly straightforward, picking either random internet people or friends as appropriate (although it doesn't filter to friends that have the game), and you have a few mildly different game types to try out.\n\nSo all that seems great so far - and up to this point it would be a definite recommendation for the sort of people that like these sorts of games. So the two core problems - lack of pickup multiplayer opponents (or at least ones that actually take a turn), which might not be a blocking issue for people who aren't reliant on pickup online gaming, and the regular and long lag to process turns. While some of the time (when playing inside the same room) we have had games where turns get processed and sent to the other person within a few seconds, most of the time we have tried to play it takes somewhere from a few minutes to sometimes maybe 10 minutes for a turn to start appearing on the other persons system - and even then it then takes 10-30 seconds per move the opponent made. So if you plan on playing people you know in 24 hour PBeM style games this might suit you.

It borrows heavily both in gameplay and in style from Advance Wars on the GBA but Desert Ashes is a bit more basic. Not that it suffers from that, in my opinion. Sometimes a bit of lightweight turn based strategy is just what I want. \nIt has come on since some of the 2014 reviews. I haven't noticed any bugs and the campaign maps don't require a return to the main menu screen any more. It's got a nice automatic save-game, which even saved the state of play when the game crashed once (I Alt-Tabbed). \nAll in all it's quite polished and does what it does well. It has some nice little touches like the ability to jump to any battle in the scenarios and the way it will save every unfinished game - even if you have several. \nThe only negative points are that you can't bypass the cut-scenes which can be a bit annoying when you are playing a scenario for the third or fourth time, the limited scenario battles (though it has a skirmish mode) and the rather basic AI of the computer opponent. So not for hard-core strategists but good fun for a quick turn-based blast if that's what you are after.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451518558, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451518558, "recommendationid": "20131776", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423517459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 72, "steamid": "76561198067113453", "num_games_owned": 99}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "How is this game not being sued by the makers of advanced war for GBA? it legit has the same mapping and battle scenes xD", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450495847, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1450495847, "recommendationid": "19774191", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471001129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 334, "steamid": "76561198127995630", "num_games_owned": 130}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun game but nobody online.\nAnybody wanna help me with my last two achievements message me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1471001422, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1471001422, "recommendationid": "24840756", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488246492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 835, "steamid": "76561198056752045", "num_games_owned": 430}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The gameplay is smooth, but IMO a bit too slow and simple.
