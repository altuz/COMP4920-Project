It was one of the first Lego games to feature quest hubs for all chapters to have as little backtracking as possible to unlock all secrets with alternate characters and features great art design and gameplay. \nThe only lacking part are the mandatory vehicle missions and contrary to the batman series and many other games within the Lego franchise, the vehicle sequences in Indiana Jones 2 really fall far and almost entirely off the grid. They feel grindy, badly designed and are highly repetitive, requiting the player to always destroy three waves of specific enemies while the rest of them keep spawning infinitely. They attempted to make it feel like suspense and momentum but ultimately failed in that endeavour.\n\nThat's one single aspect though and doesn't soil the rest of the game experience. It is especially fun in co-op, just like all other Lego games and well worth the addition in anyone's library."}, {"votes_down": 27, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500840422, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447172", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33751873", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198190052086", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1488658005, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 140}, "timestamp_updated": 1500840422, "received_for_free": false, "review": "bad game"}]}
