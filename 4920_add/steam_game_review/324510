It's going to be a social network in it's own right. It's simply amazing, and also in a very good state considering it's still an Alpha.\n\nNow, for the longer version of this review, I'm gonna start with the negative bits first because there aren't many at all and not really \"negative\" but more consequences of an alpha version of a game that hasn't been marketed at all.\n\n1) The game feels dead. This is because of it's early stage, so not really a downside, but for those like me who expect to see cities teeming with players (like in the trailer), you might want to put those expectations aside. There are still some select groups of players that are still active, mostly builders. The only con of inactive players is you can get bored pretty quickly if you're not too much into mining and building (on your own). Not a lot of social activities to do, although the forums are pretty active so if you try to bring people together, you will likely succeed.\n\n2) Leveling up requires work. Don't expect to do some little tasks and grow in level. You need to put serious work down, such as mining and hunting. The good thing is almost everything you do in game earns you experience, so if you're active you can still level up quicker.\n\n3) Complex skill system. I say complex because a beginner won't know where to start. Every time you level up, you get skill points, which you can use to learn all kinds of things such as crafting tools & equipment, crafting machines as well as abilities to enhance your character's speed, jump, tool usage, etc. There are literally a lot of skills, so before you start using your skill points randomly (like I did), have a look around all the skill trees and see what you can learn and use. You also get cleanse points with every level, meaning you can revert a skill back, but these CPs are limited, so you still have to be considerate when choosing your skills.\n\nNow that I've narrowed down the negative bits, I'll be talking about why this game is awesome and why it's gonna be huge.\n\nI see Boundless like the love child of Minecraft and World of Warcraft, with features drawn from a whole lot of other games as well.\n\n1) The game allows you to choose your activity. You can be whatever you want. You can be a builder, building things for the community to admire and use. You can be a business owner, having a shop that makes you a lot of money. You can be a hunter. You can be an explorer. You can be a begger on the streets of Therka Market or in the slums of Krakendown.\n\n2) Everything in-game is player made. All those huge cities and towns are built by players. Which is just amazing. Some of them are nicer than the others, but just the fact that a lot of people come together in one place to build settlements is just amazing.\n\n3) Great trading system. You can buy and sell everything using shop stands or request baskets (think auction house). No need to stay online and chase people to do manual trading. Although you can do that too, which is awesome because it simply allows you to trade anything for everything. Wanna trade some wood for some iron? You can do it. Wanna trade that iron for some coins? Nothing can stop you.\n\n4) Love the way using stuff works. You don't need to be special in order to use that high-tier item. If you got the dough, you can buy it. No need to gain skill points and materials in order to craft it. Although, if you're broke, yeah, you need to go down those caverns and get materials. Provided you don't jump in a lava pool by accident.\n\n5) Going back to building, it just works. A lot of flexibility in building structures. Not a lot of content in terms of furniture, but there are a lot of block types and variations and you also get those chisels which are used to shape blocks to add that extra detail.\n\n6) Again, related to building. Every player earns land plots with every level gained. To place a land plot, you need a beacon. Those beacons are using fuel in order to stay active. As long as a beacon is active, all land plots connected to it are indestructible by others. This means all your builds are safe, as long as you keep that beacon fueled up. This also ensures the land doesn't stay occupied if the owner is not active anymore and it also gives people incentive to play the game and keep everything up.\n\n7) Portals. The main means of transportation in Boundless is portals. Just like the ones found in Valve's Portal. They're just awesome. Imagine having your house on a planet, and the bedroom is on a different one. It's that easy. Just walk into the portal and go out on the other side.\n\n8) Planets. Everyone loves the idea of planets. Different places to go, with different flora and fauna (although there's not much diversity at this stage yet). But all those planets have a purpose, not just for the sake of it. There are 3 planets per region. Every planet has a level of difficulty which affects the level of mobs, the speed at which you mine and also the richness of resources. There are a total of 12 planets as of now, 3 for each region: Europe, Australia, US East and US West. What's crazier is each planet acts like a server. If you're from Europe, you can still visit planets from the US or Australia, but expect these to be a bit laggier than your planets.\n\nThere are a lot more awesome, tinier features, but these are the things that stood out to me. Again, the game is in it's early stages, so not a lot of players around which makes the game a bit boring at some point. But you can still meet people and have fun. Also because of the fact there aren't many people around, those who are are usually very nice and polite. Everyone's keen to help new players and build a family that will carry on through the main release.\n\nI'd recommend buying this game. Even if you get bored of playing it, make sure you keep an eye on it's development because it's gonna be some big and eventually, you'll buy it anyway.\n\nTake care and hope to see you in game! I live just outside of Therka Market, in the North. It's a big-ish modern house with a shiny blue \"P\" on it's roof. Come holla at me and also make sure to visit my pub in Munteen Paradise.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506506735, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506506735, "recommendationid": "35238891", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525681", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506046477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3232, "steamid": "76561198372325577", "num_games_owned": 2}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Amazing Game! loving it so far!\n\nThat being said if you don't like early access i would recommend waiting till the full release.\n\nPros\nMinecraft gone MMO (awesome player community check out the official Boundless forums!)\n\nPortals!

The non-existant player base is also a big problem. A whole lot of random player made structures that have been abandoned by people like me who palyed for 30m then quit for good.
