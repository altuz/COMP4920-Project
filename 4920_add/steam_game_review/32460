Prepare for some seriously cryptic puzzles. Only recommended if you have finished the first Monkey Island or are a puzzle game veteran.\n \n[h1] Review [/h1]\nThis remaster offers redrawn graphics, a cleaner interface, a highlight object button, hint system and voices (which are seriously annoying when they repeat continuously).\nI never played this when it was first released only hearing that it was the best in the genre. While i finished the first Monkey Island game practically without help I had to use a guide as well as the built in hint system from about half way through a 9 hour play through in this (which always feels like you\u2019re skipping the fun in this type of game).\nI had more fun in the earlier sections of the game where there were fewer areas and objects to use. After the beginning section there are a lot of red herrings and convoluted solutions that bog the whole game down.\nThe series is also famed for humour and there are some good lines and general good writing but there was a large amount of forced wackiness. I would compare it to Airplane! If you really like that kind of quick fire humour and gags i\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy this. As I said I got frustrated and irritated so I wasn\u2019t laughing at the puzzles by the 2nd half of the game.\nOverall I would recommend the first Monkey Island game over this, it had less annoying puzzles that were more fun to actually solve, so I\u2019m only going to recommend this if you have the patience of a saint.\n"}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499779942, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479532", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33456037", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031805461", "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1423540882, "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 704}, "timestamp_updated": 1499779942, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Friendly word of advice play Curse Of Monkey Island instead."}, {"votes_down": 16, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499619183, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469485", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33409055", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197966620952", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1499619154, "num_games_owned": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 249}, "timestamp_updated": 1499619183, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Incredibly poorly thought out puzzles made me give up after a while."}]}
