I watched the former and passed entirely on the latter because wow did the quality go in the crapper fast on Heroes. I loved Season 1, Season 2 was okay, and everything past that was pretty abysmal. Why then does this weird spin-off game that doesn't feature characters from the show have a positive rating? Well, it turns out the powers offer some surprisingly innovative gameplay. You get to use telekinesis to lift and throw enemies and objects, catch bullets and throw them back at baddies, slow time, look through time, travel between the same area in two time periods willy-nilly (which makes combat interesting at times), and...okay, so that's pretty much it, but it's surprisingly entertaining while it lasts. \n\nThere are a handful of environmental puzzles where you need to use your powers to progress, and when you come upon enemies, you kill them all to \"get a keycard\" (you don't even walk over the bodies) to open the exit, and proceed to the next section of the level. The game features two heavily (and somewhat poorly) scripted boss fights, neither of which was all that fun, and it's pretty short. The brevity of the game is good, because it would have gotten old if the game had gone on any longer. The plot was so throw-away, and the dialog was cliche and cringe-worthy - more than you might even imagine.\n\nSome folks had glitches, so I'll add that the only glitches I ever encountered were funny physics stuff, like guards dying with their heads stuck in the ceiling and their bodies wildly twitching after death. Not a glitch, but I was shocked by the decision to not let the player shoot guns or physically attack anyone. You kill plenty of people using your powers, and can even throw bullets you catch with telekinesis back at enemies to kill them, but you cannot pick up a gun, punch, stab, kick, etc. It's a little annoying, but the powers are the real reason I was here anyway, so whatever. This is the epitome of a B game, with most everything being rather garbage, except it has curiously enjoyable powers that made me have a pretty good time playing it. Get it on sale for like $5.00, but otherwise, it would be overpriced for what it is.\n\nOh, and your main character looks like she's cosplaying as Zoey from Left 4 Dead.
