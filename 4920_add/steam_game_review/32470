I don't write reviews ever so this might come out as \"shoddily written summary/review\" but hopefully you might consider taking a read.\n\n[b]tl;dr at the bottom.[/b]\n\n---\n\nSTAR WARS\u2122 Empire at War is an RTS that has held up exceptionally well for being a game from 2006 and it's probably my favorite RTS of all time even. Though it may be a casual RTS it can definitely be challenging when going up against other people, and if PVP isn't your thing; with the use of mods the AI can be incredibly challenging. Plus with a pretty active modding community you can easily get a lot of new content from the workshop or Mod DB. You can get more engaging gameplay with said mods and make your game look like it was made in 2017. Mods can also be used in multiplayer aswell. A great thing about this specific RTS is that it can be both equally casual and challenging, it's an entry level RTS. If you're looking to get into RTS games, this is a pretty good game to start with. (Might I also recommend Halo Wars?)\n\nA really big part of the game comes from the sound design, the use of the soundtracks are superb, the voice acting is really good, the authentic sound effects from the movies for each unit are great, it all comes together excellently. Just the feeling when you and your enemy's armies collide and the comms from your units start going off like crazy with the music changing from ambience to action is something to behold.\n\nThere is also a singleplayer campaign in which you can play as the Empire or Rebellion, in the Forces of Corruption DLC you play as the Consortium, I can't really say anything about the single player as I haven't much played it.\n\nThe only bug I've come across with the game is \"synchronization error\" which is a somewhat common problem when you play the game using mods (it occurs dramatically less without mods), or if there are a lot of players in a lobby.\n\n[b]tl;dr[/b] All in all Empire at War is an excellent RTS that caters both to veteran and new players with basic gameplay mechanics that can be both casual and challenging. Plus with a very active modding community and the recently added workshop support and revived multiplayer, this game is a must have for both RTS and Star Wars fans.\n\nThat's probably all I have to write down as of now, if you read the entire thing, thanks."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504740132, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518730", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34784897", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062824516", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506833516, "num_games_owned": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "playtime_forever": 15832}, "timestamp_updated": 1504740132, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of the Best star wars Games you could possibly get"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504667469, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512072", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "34768702", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120889064", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1506275603, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "playtime_forever": 3722}, "timestamp_updated": 1504667520, "received_for_free": false, "review": "There are three types of SWEAW players:\n\n1.
