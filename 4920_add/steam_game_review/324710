And he looks just like your FATHER!\" etc), though why they chose an American instead of English narrator for a work by Shakespeare is beyond me. I found the narrator detracted from the experience, and turned him off during the introduction. The good news is, the game is still fun as all text.\n\nI wouldn't spend more than $5 on what is essentially a lark, unless you REALLY need to learn Hamlet for that big test tomorrow. Yes, you could actually learn the play's story from this game, as the Shakespeare paths are all designated for you.
