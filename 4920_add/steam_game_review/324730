Sorry Steve Jackson, Ian Livingstone wrote the best books in my opinion. This is essentially the book put onto screen with all the foibles that brings. There are page references even through the links take you to the correct paragraph and even shut down choices you can no longer choose.\n\nThe combat is done in game, no more having to remember to bring dice to your computer!\n\nIt is what it is, a book on computer with nice music and updated visuals.

After the outcome of a turn you'll have the oportunity to test your luck but every time you test it you'll loose one luck point and you'll won't want that.\nI think the game is worth the price, i payed 54 mexican pesos, like 3 dollars on sale.\nSo it goes if you want a different kind of adventure and you like to read a little this is a great way to spend an evening.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438726007, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438726007, "recommendationid": "17390377", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534935", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499656317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 190, "steamid": "76561197994933717", "num_games_owned": 210}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 39, "comment_count": "4", "review": "I have not read the original Fighting Fantasy books, but I heard they were fun passtimes, so when this game went on sale I decided to go ahead and get it. I can say a few good and a few bad things.\n\nGood: The game is fun in a very retro way. I didn't know of these books when I was a kid, but I was a big fan of both D&D and Choose Your Own style books, so it's quite nostalgic anyways. The redone art is nice (aside from a few things, like a \"white dragon\" being illustrated with a brownish/copper dragon, but whatever) and the retro art definitely reminds me of my AD&D days. The stat system is alright, but I really wish they would have introduced a point-buy method for the digital release, as I find myself restarting the game every time I roll a ton of 1's or 2's in my character creation section.\n\nBad: The game is unforgiving. If you like darksouls, that's fine, and I'm not saying it makes this game unplayable. I am okay with a game that requires a great amount of skill, but this game requires a great amount of luck. For example (this is a real example but the items/names are changed), if I went to fight a large ooze, it would tell me I had to either have a bottle of alchohol in my inventory or I'd be consumed by the acidic beast. Basically, if I didn't turn left at the last of three T-junctions I die. Yes, that is what happened to me while playing a few times. Yes, it is the same solution (I turned right instead of left so I died). The worst part is there are no hints. Just a generic \"There is a T-Junction. Turn right or left?\" page. Occassionally you'll meet someone who can tell you which way to turn, but that's hardly ever.\n\nIn conclusion, if you enjoy trial-and-error, this game is for you.
