I'm old enough to have purchased and read those books many times during the 1980's, but had more fun playing this than I did going through Tin Man's earlier games from this system.  This system is a lot tougher (you can't spend 15 minutes rerolling dice until you get nice stats), but adds to the replay value of the game, particularly with the different characters available.  The combat can be very tough (especially against multiple opponents.  Even a group of 4 bats, which would be a joke in the books, is challenging here).  I failed my first several attempts through the game before finally finishing it.  I look forward to playing the available DLC and hope that they will add more books to this series soon.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505293462, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505293462, "recommendationid": "34915846", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507793", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506536347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 61, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 304, "steamid": "76561198009580057", "num_games_owned": 118}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Did you used to read the books???\n\nDo you like games that kill a little time??\n\nEnjoy reading??\n\nActualy sod all the questions this is well worth owning, I am just hoping they slowly release all the other books.\n\nIt may show little hours played but I have loved every second so far and died more times then I would like to say hahaha.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504817195, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504817195, "recommendationid": "34802366", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 111, "total_reviews": 139, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 28}}
