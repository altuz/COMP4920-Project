Usually, I feel the need to write a long review talking about what I feel is important. This is not such a case.\n\nIn short, it's a lot like Big Rigs, but better.\n\nThis game is... dreadful, but also kind of fun. The main reason its fun is because of how lighthearted it is, and how colourful everything is, along with the pleasent, if repetitive music.\n\nBut it's also completely broken is almost every possible way. The environments are glitchy, the car controls kind of crappily, the controls don't really work sometimes, and there isn't really much of a goal except to collect all the stuff in the level and go to the next...\n\nIt really just that simple. Here's a level, collect the stuff, move on. That's it. No racing. No real need to do stunts at all. It's just... here. Drive around and collect stuff.\n\nJust to give an example of how broken this game is, I came across a bug after 4 mintues of playing where, if I jumped, and then held the backwards key (\"s\" for me), I instantly started flying up into the air, and as long as I kept the key pressed, I kept going. While this is actually kind of fun, and I would hate to see it removed, it does sort of highlight how broken this game is. Also, every time I died, I couldn't access the first person viewpoint any more. No idea why, it just didn't let me. You can also drive directly up vertical walls, and your car goes faster going backwards than it does forwards. Once again, this is actually kind of awesome, and does have some fun in it, but I doubt they intended it to be like this.\n\nIt's a lot like Big Rigs in that sense. Terrible glitches, but ones that serve to be entertaining. Without them, the game would ironically be a lot worse I feel.\n\nAt the same time, despite all of this, the game doesn't really lie about what it offers. You can do stunts, I guess, though there's no reason too. And you drive a small car. It's sort of enjoyable, so what the hey. A thumbs up for now. Maybe I'll change my mind later, but right now, it's 3:20am here in Australia, and I need to get some sleep.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415981946, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428115529, "recommendationid": "12938158", "language": "english", "votes_down": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550194", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421318426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 580, "steamid": "76561198006369201", "num_games_owned": 1084}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very fun.

Sure it's got some bugs, camera issues, respawning issues, textures not loading, but for $5 it really isn't a bad game. The music for the game is very interesting and is fun to listen to, and the ideas for the levels are really cool (Mini Golf is probably my favorite). There is a nice small selection of cars to choose from and having to collect coins to unlock them, levels, and game modes let's you search every nook and cranny on the map. Some pieces are difficult to find, but it shouldn't take long to get all the coins on every level. Go Crazy is a neat feature, no time pressure or objective really, you can go nuts and drive to your hearts desire, blowing up your car as many times as you want. One thing I really wish that would have been added were nice backdrops. It gets boring looking out into the gray/black outside of the arena, though this is a smaller issue.
