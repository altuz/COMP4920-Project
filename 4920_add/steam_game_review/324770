The uniqueness comes from that you indirectly control her around the ship using the surveillance cameras that are at your disposal as the security operator. Some cameras are broken beyond repair, some have shattered screens, others are wired incorrectly; but most of them work fine - this creates an authentic feel of realism and desperation as you work together with Lea.\n\nThe basic premise of the plot is that Lea awakens in a fungi-infected ship. An experiment gone wrong or intentional disaster? As the security operator, you guide Lea around collecting notes, solving puzzles and learning more behind the mystery of the post-apocalyptic world of the ship.\n\nWhilst there is no combat there are enemies that can, and will, kill Lea; being a point and click: puzzle solving, atmosphere and mysterious algorithms are what you're facing. This is obviously a budget game but what money went into this game it does well, rather than being a jack of all trades, it specialises in what made the point and click genre in the first place. The animations are a bit clunky, there's minor visual glitches, a lack of system options and other problems that I feel are not enough to detract from the, mind the pun, eXperience of this game, but are worth pointing out regardless. As said, the cameras you control don't all work, this can create unsettling and tense moments when you can only hear horrific sounds with a handicapped vision - you must guide Lea through dangerous situations like this.\n\nSure, this isn't the best game ever made or the most innovative thing since sliced bread, but what it does it does well, but as a result the game burdens some minor flaws. No AAA polish here. Having said that, if you love mystery solving, puzzles, pure survival horror I think you will take a keen interest in this game. The way in which you collect notes/files has it so that, since you are the security operator, you must log onto the ship's data bank with a username and password (obtained from guiding Lea around) and search through the databse to your pleasure. Most of it is optional and provides a very, very detailed backstory up to the events leading to now, and other secrets that I won't spoil. But eventually, you'll need to dig around in order to progress. And the game gets real hard, you need to pay attention to Lea's comments and use the map wisely.\n\nOne thing I do love about the game is, well.... I won't spoil, but load your save game up a few days -after- you last saved. :)\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 7/10. Points deducted for minor technical flaws, poor performance in the latter stages of the game, slow pacing (the game is quit long, but that's a good thing!) and uninspired character development.\n\nThanks for reading.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414248742, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1414248742, "recommendationid": "12626182", "language": "english", "votes_down": 31, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.747711", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1414926189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 264, "steamid": "76561198116786626", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 31, "comment_count": 0, "review": "eXperience 112 is a point and click game with a difference.

Not such a big problem anymore, although I wouldn't say I like the actual ending and not knowing it all those years probably made me like the game somewhat more... Anyway, the game mechanics are the one thing that makes this experience worth it. It can be a bit slow. Lea sometimes require a lot of patience to navigate to any given objective, but there's a lot to read and figure out in the mean time. Controlling the surveillance system, searching for all those passwords and decoding them, taking controls of robots and other mechanized equipment (including bathysphere)... that's all just amazing.

Indirectly guiding a non-player character through an adventure using nothing but your own power over a decaying security system? \n\n\"Sign me up!\" I cried.\n\nThe reality unfortunately fell short of my high expectations. A good portion of the early-to-mid game is spent directing the focal character to each and every light switch in turn, just to make sure that she stops and searches EVERY SINGLE NOOK AND CRANNY for keycards and other important objects that you often CANNOT actually see yourself due to the awkward position and orientation of the cameras. For me, this was a frustrating and drawn-out experience. Not only because it often feels like Lea Nichols moves about with all the alacrity of a pregnant sloth, but she will potentially not notice important plot items if she doesn't specifically STOP MOVING at key locations. Prompt her to move a little faster to the next light switch, and she may just miss that all-important keycard, scribbled note, or whatever-the-heck else you need to progress to the next stage of the plot.\n\nIt feels like the story was supposed to carry this game, and perhaps in Europe, it did. The over-arching plot is tied together with topics ranging from secret societies and government programs, to secret terrestrial species, and secret office romance. But the delivery via the English voice-actors leaves quite a bit to be desired in the emotion department. The English-speaking Lea Nichols seems rather deadpan... Which actually contradicts what is written about her in the computer system that you're required to hack into on repeated occassions.\n\nSpeaking of \"computer hacking\" aspect, that aspect of the game was actually somewhat interesting, requiring you to decrypt or discover the users' passwords using a variety of methods. Browsing through all of the data does take time and patience, however, and your progress in gaining access to all the user profiles is hampered by Lea's ability to find and relay ID codes and passwords hidden within the environment.\n\nThere ARE interesting moments and discoveries to be made over the course of the game, but I am left feeling as though the parts of the game that I enjoyed were too few and far between for me to recommend this game to the general public.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1416149001, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1416149001, "recommendationid": "12968531", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514502", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488923278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 144, "steamid": "76561197998047169", "num_games_owned": 244}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So much potential wasted. :(\n\nThe interface is horrible and clunky.

Voice acting is bad. The interface/tiny fonts are bad. The inevitable desktop clutter of the camera windows, which don't align to the window but rather overlay one another in a haphazard way is the worst-and is also the main game mechanic. Expect frequent crashes, unhandled exceptions, and critical errors without any hope of a working patch. The greatest sin of this turd is that only 90% of the game was properly translated into English. This means that you will encounter confusing dialogues and unsolvable puzzles that rely on entering a code. Early in the game, a tedious set of puzzles involving entering codes, opening e-mails, and cross-referencing a chart results in a word meant to be used as another password. The NPC repeatedly keeps reminding you of what you should be doing, but the password doesn't work. Until you realize that no one bothered to translate one part of the puzzle. The numbers that tell you what word to enter result in a proper name-in French, but the correct solution is in English. This means the game is only playable with a comprehensive walkthrough or an intimate knowledge of French and pre-Christian Greek philosophers. [Seriously.] Set in the 1970's, but chock full of anachronisms, this could have been a fun, quirky adventure. Instead it is a lesson in tedium. Example: Open this camera. Try to find an object for the NPC. Open another camera. Spend a few moments trying to fit in on your screen. Click the light switch on the hard to read map. Wait for the slowpoke NPC to travel there. Smash keyboard when you discover the automatic camera tracking decided to open a third camera on top of your other windows, then switch the cameras you had previously tweaked by hand to new ones. Listen as the NPC complains that you are taking too much time. Finally get all three windows to a size and position to see the thing you want her to pick up--oops! Unhandled exception error CTD... Reload a savegame? Sure, but don't expect it to resume where you saved. If fighting the game controls, being berated for not doing so, and constantly worrying when the next crash is coming sounds like fun to you, by all means have at it.
