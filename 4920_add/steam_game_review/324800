It was fast, beautiful, challenging and just so much damn fun. The sequel builds upon that success by adding co-op, loot, crafting, challenges, more weapons and a reason to keep playing even after the credits roll. It's fantastic but in some ways too much and broken. A weak story, some underwhelming boss fights (outside the 1st) ,limited locations, useless weapons and some terrible online connections keeps the sequel feeling more of a side step than a step forward. Its still better than most and if you are a fan of loot games SW2 is a must own.\n\nShadow warrior 2 is set five years after the events of SW1(not required to enjoy the sequel). You play as the smart mouthed, funny Ninja warrior Lo Wang who is again hired to battle hordes of hell demons that have been released onto Earth by his nemesis Zilla. The main mission is to close the portal that has let the demons escape while also retrieving the body of young lady Kamiko whose soul has been placed in your body as a portal. The interaction between Kamiko and Lo Wang are the best parts of the story while the rest is just not very good. The dialogue with a lot of characters is cringe worthy and while the first SW nailed Lo Wang's attitude and humor this one is trying way too hard and  it's noticeable. What's weird, for you lore fans, there is a books worth, not kidding, of lore that you will collect while playing. Enjoy. \n\nWhat Shadow Warrior 2 lacks in story can easily be ignored due to the amazing game play. As in the first SW game play is fast, furious, rewarding, and challenging  as you slice,dice, shoot, and explode your way through hordes of enemies with sword(s) or guns. Game play is simple get a mission, go to location and battle hordes of enemies to retrieve, open, close or kill. There is a solid roster of  aggressive enemies(a lot more than SW1) and all are procedurally generated with different stats(more on this later) and they will spawn in different areas of a map during replay. Some of the enemies include ninjas who bicycle kick grenades(fckers),  some wield swords, guns or throw deadly uchiwas and some like the serpent snakes throw or stab you with their tridents(also fckers). There are also mechs, robot soldiers, and flying orbs and all will be buffed with(or shielded) with effects such as fire, ice, toxic, or electricity.\n\nTo battle the demons of hell you will be given an arsenal of 70 different types of weapons to choose. They range from the usual handguns, shotguns, machine guns, rpgs, and bow to the weird medusa head that spits toxic poison or the saw blade that, like it sounds, is a sword that's like a chain saw. All the weapons come with random stats of damage, critical, etc and most will also include effects like listed above. Each weapon also has 3 slots to place gems which are the main loot item in the game. As in any loot game, upon killing an enemy they will drop gems, money, ammo or health and its glorious. Gems carry numerous stats that can increase your weapons damage, armor defense and as they become more powerful, they will also carry negatives. Gems can also be used to change weapons by making them turrets, allow you to dual wield, and use explosive ammo to name just a few options. There are also special orbs used to permanently upgrade any weapon with more damage, larger clip for ammo, less reload, etc. You can also craft gems which is a dice roll of lesser gems + $$$ for a higher level gem. \n\nSkill points for your character can be added to a series of cards with multiple slots to move faster, increase health, carry more ammo, more fire damage, etc. There is a good deal here for your character(very familiar) but I would have liked some more uniqueness to the cards and the ability to do loadouts. This should have been a loot item as I only had an enemy drop a card once(already had it). Its the weakest part of the loot system as it just feels basic.\n\nGraphically SW2 is no slouch. Running again on their own engine SW2 looks beautiful. The use of color in the outdoor environments is more natural while neon highlights the city scapes. I would like to have seen a larger template of environments but what is here looks amazing. Almost everything is destructible(except buildings) and cutting, shooting, , burning, exploding particle effects makes the 4th of July fireworks look minor. It can get easily hectic especially with multiple players and its easy to lose yourself in the chaos but damn, it's fun. My system ran the game at a solid 50-60 frames at 2560x1080P ultrawide with every setting ultra and never had any serious drops. The main issue came online where no matter what the game would hard crash or lose connection all the time and probably a good reason why player count online is low.\n\nShadow Warrior is easily one of my favorite franchises and FWH is a one of my favorite developers today. Its combination of fast game play, awesome melee/gunplay combat and Lo Wang himself is unique to an ever crowded and growing market. Its a good game but because of some online issues, basic character development and weak story it doesn't outshine the first SW but damn its still better than most. \n\nNote: I would still be playing today if it wasn't for online performance. This could be attributed to most players being in eastern Europe region as US/US server connection seems to work fine. I play a lot of games online and this is by far been the worst from a connection pov.\n\nPositives\nAmazing Fast and Furious game play\nGood variety of enemies and weapons\nGraphics and Performance is really good(all Max/ultra settings 50-60 fps)\nSatisfying Loot and crafting \nTons of replayability with multiple difficulty tiers and challenges\nDLC and still being supported by FWH\n\nNegatives\nNot a lot of location variety\nNo loadouts \nComparing weapons/armor UI\nConstant online crashing\nWeak story\nPlayer hit box seems to be big\nDifficulty spikes", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505394199, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505394656, "recommendationid": "34948056", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507476", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498860182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 74, "steamid": "76561198120928091", "num_games_owned": 264}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Lo Wang is by far the best main protagonist ever in video games (in my opionion), his humor is by far the best out of any characters in any video games that I have played, the Gameplay is fast and smooth,all the characters in the game are awesome (in their own way) and the voice acting is also great, if you are looking for a fast pace FPS/ Slasher game, I would really recommend this game, and also the first Shadow Worrior game is also really awesome and is also a great pickup, 20/20 (Both games included)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507084451, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507084533, "recommendationid": "35461152", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507050", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507155629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1328, "num_reviews": 508, "playtime_forever": 1551, "steamid": "76561198034766576", "num_games_owned": 1127}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Seriously upgraded sequel.

I had high expectations for this since I loved the first Shadow Warrior done by Wild Hog. Gameplay wise, Shadow Warrior 2 exceeded my expectations! There are a ton of weapons and they are all really satisfying to shoot or handle, swordplay is once again an absolute treat. You can upgrade them to make them stronger or add perks like ice or fire damage. There's a really long list of enemies, though I still wish there was a little more enemy variety further into the game. It's sort of borderlands-ish, which i honestly didn't think I'd like. (I facking hate Borderlands) Game looks great too, very impressive visuals.\n\nStorywise Shadow Warrior was never too high up, but it held it's own and kept the game going. It was good enough to keep you invested as the game itself grew a bit stale of repetition. The first game had a really surprising twist that actually had me a bit emotional, which I didn't see coming at all. The second game totally let me down in that regard, it ends rather abruptly without any proper closure...I was staring at my screen for a few minutes in disbelief.

Some of my favorite parts of the game are the leveling/customization aspects and the weapon variety. Parts I didn't like include grindiness when trying to collect all the weapons/skills, a lack of area variety, and gameplay that encourages spamming overpowered abilities. \n\nPros:\n-The skill upgrade system felt great. Planning how I was going to invest my next few skill points was one of my favorite parts of the game.\n-Weapon customization is fun, with several gems (weapon upgrades) that unlock unusual gun abilities, such as piercing bullets for assault rifles and grenade launcher remote detonation. Also, weapons continue to be useful for a long time; endgame weapons are only modestly better than those from the beginning of the game, and some midgame weapons were still my favorites at the end of the game. \n-There's a nice variety of weapon types. Only a few weapon types felt like worthless additions, and some of those may only feel that way because of my playstyle. \n-Combat is mostly fun, and while there's not an overwhelming amount of enemy variety, it's sufficient. \n\nNeutral:\n-The difficulty is a little low. I usually play FPS games on normal difficulty, but I should have played this one on hard. I was expecting the difficulty to ramp up, but it never did - or maybe I just did a good job with my skill choices/weapon upgrades. Of course, you can always test one difficutly and change as necessary. There's a difficulty higher than hard, for those who want more of a challenge.\n-There's a New Game Plus mode, where you keep your weapons/skills/upgrades and gain access to additional mission rewards. I didn't play much of it, but it seems like a pretty normal replay of the game, making it a worthwhile addition, but nothing special. Note that you can use this mode to keep your old equipment but play at a higher difficulty. \n-The storyline is passable, but far from exceptional. \n\nCons:\n-Abilities are easy to abuse, and the grindy nature of most sidequests encourages this abuse. Most enemies with ability immunity can be made susceptible by a combination of the right skill upgrades and the right equippable item. After a Chi (ability energy) regeneration skill is maxed out - which can be done early - you can repeatedly disable groups of all but the strongest enemies. This could have been mitigated easily by adding ability cooldowns. While you can obviously choose not to abuse these abilities, it's much faster to pin down a group of enemies with an ability and kill them with melee than fight them in other ways; when you're just trying to clear out an area, sometimes you just want to do it the fastest way possible - especially when fighting the most annoying enemies (e.g., enemies that run away to shoot and enemies with knockback/bullet-blocking abilties).\n-I ran into several graphics/saving glitches. For example, I noticed unintended invisible walls, a floor that didn't load, rock walls and parts of roofs that unintendedly loaded inside houses, and two crashes during quicksaves. Quicksaves also frequently stalled the game, especially if I was moving quickly. (Note that while I have plenty of RAM and an Nvidia 1080 graphics card, I don't have an SSD; some of these issues may be less severe or absent if playing the game on an SSD.)\n-Areas are overused. If I remember correctly, there are only four or five main mission areas. This is mitigated by the fact that certain parts of these areas only unlock during a few missions, but I was hoping for a lot more variety. (To be fair, the areas are very large, so it doesn't feel like you're constantly traversing the same ground.) Also, a lot of assets were overused within each area. If you enjoy feeling like you're in a fleshed-out world during your gameplay, you'll be disappointed here. (If you're not a \"collector\" type of gamer, this may be less significant for you, as you won't feel like you need to play all the side missions to get all the unique weapons/skills.)\n-Characters mostly didn't do it for me. The secondary protagonist seems to be intended as a comic foil to the main protagonist during most conversations, but the conflict between them is more annoying than endearing. The main protagonist's relationship with the tertiary protagonist is more interesting, however. \n-The protagonist's voice lines were played too often for me. If they had been reduced in frequency, they would have been fine. A few of the repeated lines are funny the first few times, but hearing the same mid-combat quip over and over gets old quickly. (I once had the same line play three times in a row within a span of 10 seconds.)\n\nIn conclusion, I felt like this game was a decent experience, but wasn't anything amazing. I recommend purchasing it on sale if you like RPG elements in your FPS games and don't mind things getting a little grindy. \n7/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504626967, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504626967, "recommendationid": "34759356", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507181512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 857, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2141, "steamid": "76561198303080386", "num_games_owned": 57}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "One of the most action-packed games ever.\n\nMore guns, more killing, more swords, more blood, more Shadow Warrior.

A cool story, nice graphics, funny jokes everywhere and a really cool and sometimes challenging gameplay.\n\nBut this follower was a dissapointment for me. \nShadow Warrior 2 is very focused on multiplayer. You can almost do everything with your friend. You can play the main and also the side storys together. That\u00b4s a cool thing if you think about that, you get the same experience and the same weapon drops BUT you won\u00b4t have the same story progress if you\u00b4re joining a game.\nThat means if you go on with the main story and at the end of a mission it could be that a weapon is unlocked in a shop in the village, you can\u00b4t buy them because you aren\u00b4t that far with the main story. So you will have to play the main story to that point until you can buy the weapon you wanted.\nIt\u00b4s really annoying to not have the same progress and also if you want to play the story with a friend you will have to play it twice. Also you can\u00b4t really help your friend with the endboss. It happens to me that I was locked out of the area. I couldn\u00b4t really help him.\n\nBut still it was fun to play. The grapics are really good, you will enjoy to make Screenshots.\nAlso the jokes are almost as funny as they were in the first game. Lo Wangs jokes and also the ones on the fortune cookies, are unique and great. I really love them but in the end they just repeat themself it were to many wich were dropped.\nAdditionally the weapon drops are random and not as much as the cookie drops. But if there was a weapon drop, it doesn\u00b4t really made a difference. The weapons doesn\u00b4t look the same but have similar stats. Despite that it makes fun to arm your weapons with special gems. There so many and you need time to get used to it. For example there are gems for the elementary damage for your weapon. That means you can create a fire Katana for instance. There are four Elements, fire, ice, electricity and poison. Also the enemys have a vulnerability on some of the elements. For instance a fire demon is vulnerable through ice, so you can use a ice weapon to make more damage to him. That\u00b4s really nice and i really liked to have weapons with all of the elements equipped. \nAnd also the gameplay is really cool despite that they changed some of the abilitys you have in the first Shadow Warrior. It\u00b4s still like hack and slay every demon you can see on the map.\n\nThe maps are more open in this game not that straigt forward as I\u00b4ve known that from the first game. That would have been really nice and cool if they would\u00b4ve creating more maps. For the side quests, there are like 4 different maps to play. Sometimes there are addet one more when you go on with the main story. It\u00b4s kind of annoying to see the same map again and again. \n\nAnd also the side quests get very boring from time to time. There are 2 or 3 with a real story and the others are mostly like kill 5 of these demons to get these items from them and bring them to me or kill 40 special demons wich are spread everywhere on the map. \nIf you like nonsense running around the map and killing just for fun any demons in the same map with mostly the same kind of demons on it then it\u00b4s your kind of side quests if not then i would suggest to not make every side quest, to make just some wich have good rewards like a new weapon. If you still want to make all then it could get very boring in the end.\nAlso what I will have to see critical about the game is that the main story compared to all of the side quests is really short, it\u00b4s too short. You could rush the main story in about probably 4-5 hours but the side quests make that into a play time from about 30+ play time.\n\nAnother point is that you have skill points and you can spend them like you want to. It can fit perfectly to your own play style. And also you have some items or more gems for your character to make him better. To make him fit to your play style.\n\nTo put it into a nutshell it coul\u00b4ve been a better game the story is to short but ok, the side quests are really boring in the end, you just want to finish them as fast as it works. Then the gameplay is cool. the graphics are good and the most weapons make no progress in killing \u00b4cause they almost have the same stats.\nDespite all the first few hours are really fun to play and I really loved them but it gets annoying and boring after a while \u00b4cause it\u00b4s always the same. I know that I repeat myself there but i had to highlight it. \nI really loved to play the first game, it was great but if I compare the second game with the first one the second is really a dissapointment. I really would\u00b4ve loved to give this game a neutral or a good review but there are too many things that are not good or even bad and I want to add that this is a review about my own experience in Shadow Warrior 2.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506689085, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506689085, "recommendationid": "35292353", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498375", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504878359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 516, "steamid": "76561198080672751", "num_games_owned": 159}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "review": "All the impact of shots from SW1 to feel powerful?

It is one of those games, you would love to give a neutral review. Bear in mind please, that this is my personal opinion. \n\nFirst of all Shadow Warrior 2 is a fps/rpg hybrid game, that focuses heavily on the multiplayer aspect. You kill monsters, gain karma (experience) and level up your character to your own likings. You gain new skills, weapons and new upgrade gems (Will talk about gems later). The game can be finished in around 15-30 hours.\n\nLets talk about each aspect of the game.\n\n[h1] Story:[/h1]\nYou play as Lo Wang, which you already played in Shadow Warrior 1. The story itself isnt really overwhelming, but if you have played SW 1, you know about how funny and cool Lo Wang is. The story is often so ridiculous and Lo Wang spices the dialogues up in a funny way, that you really like to follow the story. Dont expect a great story like in Final Fantasy though. There are a few things you really saw coming, but in the end I liked the story. Not too good, nor too bad. Lots of funny lines. And yes I know. The game doesnt really focus on storytelling.\nMy personal rating is 7/10\n\n[h1] Graphics:[/h1]\nThe graphics are pretty good. Weapons and the enviroments look gorgeous. Everything is really nice to look at. There is no real complain on this part.\nMy personal rating is 8/10\n\n[h1] Sound:[/h1]\n\nNot much to say about it. Its just kickass!\nMy personal rating is 10/10\n\n[h1] Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nNow this is where it kinda is a letdown, at least for me and my friend I played with.\nYou will LOVE the first few hours. You will really LOVE to learn those fancy new moves and earn new weapons, to slice and blow up your enemies. You will drop new weapons and also gems that you can use to upgrade your weapons. You kill monsters and earn experience points to reach a higher level. Each level up comes with a skill point, which you can use to build your character to your own likings, like more health, more Chi (Which is the equivalent of mana) or melee strike moves and so on. Skills are either earned in quests, dropped by enemies or sold by the vendors. Unlike in other rpg games, you will drop a weapon only once. That means that you wont drop the same weapon twice, where one is a level 1 Shotgun, whereas the other is a level 10 shotgun. Best example for this is Borderlands 2, where you will farm the same weapon a lot of times, to have the weapon with higher base stats. But there is a way to upgrade the base stats of your weapons. For that, you will use gems. Gems affect your weapons and also your character in many ways. Lets start off with the elements. They can add one of 4 types of elements. These are as follows: Fire, Ice, Thunder and Toxic. You cant combine elements on your weapons though, so no fire ice akimbo pistol. Gems can also increase/decrease stats like critical hit chance, life steal, damage output and so on. You can also equip gems on your character, which will often give you bonuses like more xp or increased item drop chance and so on. Lets talk about the combat aspect. In SW2 you will choose between 2 types of fighting styles. Either you go full melee or ranged. Of course you can do both, but after a while, you will either love going full melee or ranged weapons. I went for full melee with stealth. Only in the beginning I used ranged weapons, which got totally obsolete, after I build my character for full melee combat with a 60% increase in melee damage but a 20% decrease in ranged weapon. While you progress in the story, you will learn new abilities. A total of 4, which will consume your Chi (Mana). For example, you will learn an ability to go invisible or to impale your enemies for a few seconds. The first few hours were so awesome, I played for 6 hours+ straight. Lots of tough enemies to kill and there are enough types of enemies to keep you entertained. Each monster has random attributes. For example, they can be immune to fire damage or immune to your spells (like impale). This means, that you have to arrange your equipment well for every situation. You see a fire demon? Use an ice weapon. Ice demon ahead? Use fire! Thankfully you can put 8 weapons on your shortcut keys. So you will always (hopefully) have one weapon with each element at least once. You might be thinking:\" This guy is praising the game so much, why the negative review?!\" Well the reason for that is simple. As I already said the game itself is really fun to play. That is, until you realize that there are like 4 maps in total, you will do over and over again. The only variation they come with are different types of monsters, a different sidequest, different chest locations (Which usually have money, ammo inside, RARELY weapons) or a different spawn point. Im serious. There are like 4 maps, you will see over and over again( I repeated myself here :O ). When you start the game you wont be noticing it, until you start doing sidequests. There is almost 0 variations to the maps. Each time I picked up a new sidequest, I was hoping to see something new, but it ALWAYS was one of those 4 maps. Once you did a few sidequests, it will feel like a deja vu. A never ending one. It turns into purgatory. For the first few hours, my friend and I always thoroughly cleared the maps, until we couldnt take it any longer. At around 60% of the game, we simply used vanish to go invisible and went from one objective to another, thus ending our boredom of seeing the same maps over and over again. The sidequests themselves are storywise ok-ish. But not their objectives. Go there and kill 10 monsters or pick up item x and deliver it to y. There are 3 types of quests. Main story, Sidequests and bounties. The main story is self explanatory, sidequests will have a little story to keep you interested. But bounties. My god... These are the worst. The first few bounty quests will be nice. They usually reward you with something interesting. Either a skill point (Actually EVERY quest rewards you with skill points, no matter if its a SQ,BQ or MQ) or sometimes even skills or new weapons. Normally it is a good idea to do bounties that reward you with new skills or weapons. But they become bland VERY fast. Each time I finished a main quest, I prayed to god that there was no new bounty quest. But my prayers always have been ignored. Lots of bounty quests. Lots of boring \"kill x amount of y type\" quests. If it wasnt for the side quests and bounties, the game wouldnt last longer than maybe 5-10 hours on your first playthrough (not really sure about this one. Im pretty sure that you can rush the game, once you know what to do) Dont get me wrong though. The combat system is satisfying as hell. It really is stylish and awesome, but unfortunately it isnt enough for me, to keep me entertained enough to play through the game more than once. \nAnd one big downside of SW2 multiplayer is, that it crashed. It crashed a lot. It crashed at least 5 times, which wouldnt be too much of a problem, if you wouldnt loose your progress. We had to repeat some of the annoying quests a few times because of this. Your progress is only saved if you go back to town or if Im not mistaken at checkpoints. There were also some EXTREME lags from time to time, for no particular reason. My PC isnt that new, but it also isnt a bad one either.\n\nNow before I conclude, I will list pros and cons:\n\n[h1] Pros:[/h1]\n\n- Combat is fun.\n- Lo Wang is pretty funny.\n- Game is really fun, if played with friends.\n- You can slice and dice your enemies into pieces.\n- Lots of ways to customize your character.\n- The soundtrack is just awesome.\n- Lots of different weapons.\n- Cool eastereggs.\n- Returning characters from SW1.\n\n[h1] Cons:[/h1]\n\n- Repetetive\n- Boring after a while.\n- Only 4 maps you will see.\n- Kinda easy, even on hard.\n- fps drops for unknown reasons.\n- crashes for unknown reasons.\n\nFinal rating: 7/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506454775, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506454850, "recommendationid": "35228858", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495588", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505731859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1048, "steamid": "76561198036533290", "num_games_owned": 564}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Mediocre, but could've been amazing.\n\nFeels incredible early on but the more you play, the more the fun is sucked out by a poorly executed loot system, randomized enemy attributes, melee weapons being too OP, and the fact that the game is trying to ape from Borderlands rather than being it's own thing.\n\nGet on 50% sale only.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505733000, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505733000, "recommendationid": "35043192", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490466", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3214, "total_reviews": 3609, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 395}}
