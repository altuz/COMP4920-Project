I purchased this game before their was even a free version to play . I have played Unreal Tournament and Quake.So I wanted to see how similar this game was to them. It was spot on. The maps are great to play on, the graphics are smooth,  you have different game modes to play cell capture, bloodlust, etc, and the settings are simple. It's just like if you where playing Unreal Tournament. I say if you like the old style games like Unreal Tournament and Quake check this game out. Now their is a downside to this game their are hardly any other players online to play with. So get your gaming crews together and play mutilplayer matches with the bots, or find a server that you can all get on and into to play.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506115551, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506115551, "recommendationid": "35138012", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507115", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507008142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 183, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 183, "steamid": "76561198343518415", "num_games_owned": 27}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really awesome and Fast paced shooter.
