As a stand alone game, this title is beyond satisfying. If you've played the first one though you know that the development team knows better than to give us what they did. It's like comparing a good burger to a gourmet meal. The burger is great, but if a gourmet chef made it you'd feel as though you weren't being taken too seriously. The clunky glitch fest from the last game is in fact gone though so the overall experience is a lot more consistent. The graphics are outright dazzling and at higher reolutions you might find yourself marveling at how little processing power it takes to run this title at max settings. It's gorgeous. The mechanics are snappy and so exciting to use. The music is mostly tracks from the Star Wars movies so they do a fatastic job. The story is frustraingly short because the little bit we get is really interesting. That's this game's boggest problem. It's way too short and the level design feels really shallow at times. Despite its shortcomings the first game's combos and level design were exhilerating. This game's renditions feel like a diet version of the predescesor. Still, it's a great experience. Too bad we have to wait for Star Wars IX before we even get a chance at seeing the third installment..."}]}
