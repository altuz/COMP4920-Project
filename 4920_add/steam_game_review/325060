[/b]\n\nEach puzzle involves 2 maps (differentiated by their use of white & black). You move between these 2 maps with portals, with the objective of reaching the \"goal\" (exit) point. Not only do you have 2 map layouts for each puzzle to work with, but, well, the portals and some of the platforms rotate on their x-axis or y-axis at the push of a button... Yeah.\n\nThe aforementioned mechanics result in having to move between 2 maps for each puzzle, while rotating various portals and platforms, in order to orient yourself towards the exit point.\n\n-Graphics sometimes seem more \"bare\" than \"minimalist\"\n-Somtimes you have to spend the first 5 minutes wandering around to learn which switches rotate which portals/platforms\n+Bends the brain (forces the player to imagine the 2 maps twisted into different states)\n\nRecommended if on sale for those who enjoy first-person puzzle games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498883322, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498883322, "recommendationid": "33067738", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 59, "total_reviews": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
