I've noticed it's now $4.99. Personally, I wouldn't give that much for it, perhaps, $2.50 at most.\n\nAlthough I enjoy this game, I think that there are many who would not. The graphics are retro, very pixelated, which some may not like. Also, the game is somewhat simplistic, not too much thought involved, reminding me of those 8-bit games from years ago. Another con is there is no music volume control, except on/off. \n\nThe basic notion of the game is to time your blocks, while attacking the enemy in-between time. The whole premise is to learn the patterns of your enemy, so as to not attack too soon/too late, or fail to block their attacks. The enemies always have an indicator they're about to attack, although it can be a subtle or very quick gesture. \n\nAdded on that, the same enemy types can vary. On one encounter, you'll memorize the patterns of a dire bear, only to discover the dire bear on the next floor has changed patterns, which adds to the challenge of the game. Also, some enemies will punish you severely for not blocking, so beware! \n\nAfter completing dungeons, you are rewarded with gold. You can use these to upgrade your skill trees for your three classes (Crusader, Mercenary, Witch). You can also buy equipment or potions from shops. That being said, I think the items and skills are a bit expensive, which means you may have to grind old dungeons some, to save up the gold. Also, you can only take one equipment piece and only one item (which can stack) with you to each dungeon.\n\nIf you fail a dungeon, you can choose to keep 10% of your gold losing the rest along with equipment/items, or take a chance at recovering half of your items you have on hand (a slot machine type of thing). This makes failing somewhat disappointing, but adds an element of hardcore to the death aspect.\n\nThere are also missions to do which, when done, reward gold. These are similar to daily quest rewards from other games, except that you can do them anytime, with up to three available at one time. Each completed mission is replaced with a new one. The rewards for doing these are fairly decent, so I generally spend more time doing them than anything else.\n\nOverall, I'm satisfied with the game, given the price I gave. If you're thinking of buying it, I'd recommend doing so during a sale. That, and watch any videos of gameplay beforehand to make sure it's something you'd enjoy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499617730, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499618680, "recommendationid": "33408551", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511826", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500588462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 104, "steamid": "76561198171033130", "num_games_owned": 115}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ignoring some of the obligatory fantasy women outfits; a very well designed simple arcade game where players stand on one side of the room, the enemy stands on the other side, and it is up to the player to press the right key to attack the enemy and press the left key to defend against an incoming attack.\n\nThe game makes use of multiple well placed mechanics for both the player and enemies to use to help build onto the simple gameplay, without betraying its simplicity. While the structure of the game itself is very Role-Playing Rogue-like. Gathering equipment and consumables which provide specific benefits, are lost on death and often found only in the dungeons. Players also able to level up and customize their build between four statistics which are wiped back to base each death, and buy items outside of dungeons from shops. Meanwhile there being multiple characters to play as, each with an upgrade tree of permanent customizable passive abilities.\n\nThe game has many different maps and arrays of enemies, all with fantastic looking sprites, animations, and decently varied attack patterns. The only field that the game really fails in is the generic fantasy world, with of course generic fantasy women outfits. But in terms of gameplay and design everything is very well done.\n\nConsidering how high the production value and just all around sensible design of the game is, it really should be worth a little more.
