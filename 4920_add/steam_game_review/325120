Those stories are what sets this VN apart to other VNs out there. They also link up beautifully with the main story that I won\u2019t mention due to spoilers. Bear in mind that the pacing is slow and it takes several chapters to get the \u201canswers\u201d, but that is a given since this is a mystery novel.

The initial review I wrote on Steam mostly focused on the disappointment I felt. After I spent another 10+ hours on this game, I did notice some more praiseworthy aspects of the game that had not been featured (much) during the first playthrough. So I re-wrote part of this review to reflect the new experiences as well. \n\n I will avoid spoilers and keep a discussion of this game's themes general. \n\nStructure\nThe game consists of two parts, rather pompously titled the \"Alpha\" and the \"Omega\" stories. At quite a few points during both parts of the story the player is asked about his (or her, although the main character is always a guy) attitude or state of mind regarding certain characters or events. And in the Omega story, the choices the player makes will have consequences. Although there are also some more regular choices, such as if you want to explore further in a certain direction or not. But the choices that seemed to inquire after the player's attitudes towards something were more frequent, at least in my mind. And that is my first gripe with this game: how can your attitude or state of mind about what you encounter in the game be \"wrong\"? I simply answered honestly every time the game asked me how I felt about something, and this led me to a Bad Ending that could have been accompanied by an achievement titled \"Too Stupid To Live\" judging by the dressing down the main character got at the end. After more playthroughs (and reading through the excellent guides provided in the community hub), I realized that there is no way for the player to solve the mystery on their own. The player always fails the investigation and always gets a dressing down for it... \n\n\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"\nDuring the deduction show that is provided in part II, all the so-called \"clues\" that the player should have noticed during part I are pointed out. Unfortunately, just about all of these clues barely qualify as circumstantial evidence, let alone as hard evidence that proves anyone's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The person revealing the clues tries to undercut this criticism by saying that these aren't the sort of clues that you would encounter in a detective novel, because real life isn't like that. Perhaps not, but neither would these \"clues\" be enough to convict anyone in real life. They might not even be sufficient to warrant further questioning at the police station (not that there are any police in this game, which is another dubious point that the player is expected to swallow). \n\nThemes\nThis game seems to have a hard time deciding just what its theme is supposed to be. At first, much emphasis is placed on the fact that the town's glory days are over and how decay has set in. The player character is rather bitter about his chances on the island and his remarks on the subject distress his longtime love interest. \nThen, the game veers off sharply towards the slasher genre with several gruesome murders being depicted and some more horrors being faced in dreams. Oddly, some rather lustful choices are provided in the game, that resonate rather oddly with the heavy themes of serial murder and tragic love. \nNext, things get more philosophical when the game asks questions about the nature of reality and each individual's personal version thereof. As if that wasn't enough, some intertwined dark love stories follow that seem to be inspired by the classic 19th century novel \"Wuthering Heights\". And eventually the game reveals itself to primarily have been a detective game with the player either succeeding or failing based on how much (s)he has managed to figure out. Not exactly \"L.A. Noire\", but it certainly tries to take some pages from the same book. With so many different themes, this game doesn't really manage to do any of them very well (although some of the love stories certainly stand out). As a result, fans of most of these genres will probably feel this game leaves a lot to be desired. As do I. \n\nTo V-N or not to V-N? \nSince this game contains quite a few choices-with-consequences, it is technically not purely a Visual Novel, but an adventure game. The problem is that much of the content (especially in the middle of the game) has very few (if any) choices and feels like a pure Visual Novel for quite a while. So much so, that I found it hard to escape the impression that this \"game\" started out as nothing more than a Visual Novel, until someone decided that there really needed to be a player character who is more than a mere spectator. The result is a rather curious hybrid adventure / visual novel, of which large parts cannot be influenced by the player in any way (since the player character often isn't even present during these parts). Since the visual novel parts are quite compelling, sitting through them doesn't feel like a chore at all. Once or twice, that is. Unfortunately, this game sports 14 different endings. So even if you decide to stick to the game guide after your first playthrough, that means that you will have to sit through the Visual Novel quite a few times. And even when using the maximum possible speed (by selecting \"Skip to Next Item\" from the dropdown menu), it still takes quite a while to replay the game. Even when only altering a few choices. \n\nThings worthy of applause\nThere is also plenty worthy of praise in this game, such as:\n- the nice artwork for surroundings and chase scenes. Although it's nothing fancy, it's nice to look at;\n- the music starts out a little hit-and-miss (with an occasional synthesizer tune that feels like it belongs in a futuristic game like those in the Mass Effect series), but improves a lot as the game progresses. Towards the climax there are even a few songs that are actually quite nice;\n- the story is quite complex and deep, although it relies a bit too much on extremely violent twists. Not that all of the violence is senseless. Some of it is quite understandable. \n\nVarious more critical remarks\n- An island that does not belong to any country and does not have any sort of government or law enforcement. Seriously?\n- An underage boy explores an enormous forest (it takes a whole day to walk from one end to the other) in search of a serial killer, but no one from civilization comes after him, not even his parents?\n- The player character is expected to know when other murders have taken place in the forest, which given its enormous size is patently absurd. \n- Since the player can never really be sure whether his surroundings (and the people he meets) are real or not, it's a little odd to expect the player to sift out clues from the odd mixture of real and unreal things and people he encounters. \n\nThe Verdict\nAlthough some of the characters were sufficiently appealing to make me wonder where the other routes might have led, this game simply tries to fit into too many categories to truly succeed in any of them. That being said, this game has no shortage of potential saving graces, such as the deep story, nice music and pleasing secondary art. However, if you're not into gory dark love stories with supernatural elements and some sleuthing thrown in, then this may simply not be the game for you. \n\nOver-all, 3 out of 5 stars seems a fair score, factoring in the modest asking price. Still, seeing as this was written and programmed by one single person, it's hard not to be impressed by how much is done right. That's one reason why I changed my initial thumbs  down to a thumbs up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502217206, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502568396, "recommendationid": "34109339", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502296", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500919576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561198352488645", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Excellent Game with Great Music. 10/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500919280, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500919280, "recommendationid": "33771025", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495439", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "total_reviews": 63, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 24}}
