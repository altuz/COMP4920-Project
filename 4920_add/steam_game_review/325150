Add to that the fact that one skill has charge-up and two of the skills have a period where you can't activate your other skill so everything you do has to be prepared in advance. It's a memory game, not a reflex game.\n\nPlus even hitting the upper half of a corner isn't enough when the character is falling or jumping, it will just kill you. Even when you think you can just run over a gap onto the next platform, the character will stub their toe and you will die. I swear I have never seen a platformer be this petty about landing onto the edge of a platform.\n\nIt's cheap and the powerups mixing between levels are interesting, but the art design fails to grasp proper contrast to your surroundings at high speed. I wouldn't pick this up for serious play, it just stays in a rainy day-pile.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494255944, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494256093, "recommendationid": "31627453", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509572", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507152362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5027, "steamid": "76561198119454027", "num_games_owned": 184}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a solid runner, though there are a few unfair patterns.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498088469, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498088469, "recommendationid": "32630176", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503497", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 44, "total_reviews": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
