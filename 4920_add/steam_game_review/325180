The engine is constantly being developed and expanded, the devs are totally hands on and active in the forums, and it's just incredibily easy to learn and use.\n  \nWhile it's 3D capabilities don't have all the bells and whistles of Unreal or Leadwerks, if you are making smaller games, or mobile or HTML games... it's more than just competant. Supporting two languages BASIC (which is a intepreted scripting language like Lua, but easier), and direct C++ linking; this engine has everything a budding, or even experienced, developer could want for projects that don't require a hefty 3D engine. But, make no mistake, the 3D engine it does have is no performance slouch, and runs incredibly well. \n  \nThis is, by far, one of my favorite engines ever; and because it is, primarily, code based there's no limitations or boxing in of what kind of game you can build. \n  \nAppGameKit is more than worth its price, as are its DLCs; and given the constant updates and supports, the price is worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506094830, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506094830, "recommendationid": "35130858", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502329", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 51, "total_reviews": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 9}}
