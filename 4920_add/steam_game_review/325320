It looked like they used original graphics, original music and sound, and an original idea. All of this couldn't make up for the incredibly and insanely difficult combat system. I read prior reviews and even had the forsight to put the difficulty on the easiest possible. The very first enemy, was way beyond my ability to even hope to kill it. Even using all the healing items at my disposal, I could not survive long enough to wittle it's health even below 50%. Other than that aspect however, the game looked really fun. I wish I could say something better as it's very obvious a lot of work went into making this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494344157, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494344157, "recommendationid": "31648538", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512489", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 20, "total_reviews": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 10}}
