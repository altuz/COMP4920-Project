If you like old-school 2D puzzle games like Adventures of Lolo, then this is for you. At first, Nova-111 seems like a typical turn-based puzzle game on a grid. But quickly you learn that some elements in the environment are in realtime. For example, you have to juggle turn-based enemies with realtime laser turrets. This makes for some very fun maneuvering. At first, all your ship can do is bash into enemies, but as the game progresses you gain some additional abilities like a smart bomb and a teleport gun that lets you move two squares in one turn. (And more powers that are better left a surprise.) Overall the game is not very difficult but if you want to save every scientist and find every secret area (while also minimizing your damage and number of moves) then you can make yourself a real challenge. The enemies are fun and varied with interesting patterns to memorize. Not to mention a lively sense of humor and polished art style.

Visual and auditive feedback are present in every action making the game instantly pleasant to play.\n[*]It's very visually consistent, with great colours. Scenery looks spacey but lighthearted and everything fits together nicely.\n[*]Enemies! The enemies are by far the best designed foes I've seen in my humble experience with games that feature turn-based movement. They all telegraph their attacks and have specific patterns the player must do to dodge effectively. \n[*]The real-time blend with turns forces you to take action quickly but doesn't devalue tactical play.\n[*]Music is pretty, fits the ambience and doesn't get repetitive as far as I've played.\n[*]The story isn't indepth but Dr. Science's comments are fun to read\n\n[/list]\n\nCons\n[list]\n[*]Although the scenery visuals look great, sometimes tiles feel misleading about their collision. \n[*]The lack of equipments, loot, upgrades and randomization doesn't make this very likely to be replayed once it's finished unless you care for getting a better score at the areas.\n[*]Sometimes the real-time elements feel tacked on or way too simple.\n[*]Difficulty is rather low, but this may change once I progress further.\n[*]Definitely not the kind of depth I was expecting, don't let the Roguelike tag fool you\n[/list]\n\nOverall [b]8/10[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1480003400, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1480003420, "recommendationid": "27219138", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506671", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441467334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 987, "steamid": "76561198138977661", "num_games_owned": 2}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Disclaimer: I'm a personal friend of the developer and I've witness the journey Eddie and his partner Kalin have embarked on to bring this game into fruition.

It's a fresh and funky idea that hasn't been thoroughly explored until now. You control the Nova spaceship and transverse through space and time to unlock the mystery and the aftermath of the Great Experiment.\n\nThe game plays out in a level by level fashion where you explore a 2D grid and utilize precise and timed movements complete each stage. Each stage adds a new level of complexity that enhances your toolkit as you progress forward.\n\nWhat I like about the game is that you can play the game in bite size pieces, squeezing in a level when you have a moment but also replay stages to unravel all of the secrets for the completionists out there. Not only that, I really appreciate how this game pays homage to the classics that preceeded it (wouldn't want to spoil anything for the avid gamer). \n\nUnsurprisingly, I'm a huge fan of Nova-111, from the conception of the game, watching it come to life through beta testing and demos and now being able to fully play through it.

Destination: Nova-111. Dr. Science could you explain to us what this game is all about? Well yes, in a jiffy, my good lad! But don\u00b4t go and science to hard please! Aye!\n\n[h1]First look at the game: [/h1][url=https://www.twitch.tv/captn3mo/v/94983663]also available as VOD on twitch[/url]\nNova-111 is a game that combines turn-based exploration with real time events. You have to set your mind to this fact or you will not be able to beat this game. Here is what happens: \n[list]\n[*]You are in control of a crashed science vessel (lets call it \u201cship\u201d). Your tasks are to a) survive the dangers of an unknown planet/area/habitat/region/time/space and b) rescue scientists on the way to c) reaching an exit portal.\n[*]While doing the aforementioned you collect upgrades for your ship that are becoming more and more important parts of solutions to different puzzles/challenges the game starts to confront you with in a very moderate speed. You can take your time to learn the ins and outs of science \uf04a\n[*]You become more and more versatile at defeating enemies and removing obstacles. But there are also bossfights, and secret areas, and more upgrades and a lot of different enemies and other hazards such as falling stalactite.\n[*]You have to manage a lot of different information to do the right thing per turn and sometimes also very quick decisions and fast planning are necessary. Very intriguing concept! Also seems unique to me. That is a bonus point in my book! \n[*]You have to solve multiple zones per level per world. So I think there is enough content in this game to keep even a dedicated player at it. The global Highscores do help in that department of course.\n[/list]\n[h1]Look and feel and sound: [/h1]\nDespite its cute and colorful comic/hand drawn art style, one may even suggest casual look and feel in the beginning, the game gets really demanding and tougher by the level. You get some time to get into the zone for some levels. But if you don\u00b4t improve, the game will bite you in your ship\u2019s hull a lot. The music and sound accompanying the turn based/real-time movement are working perfectly in unison with good controls and generally well designed levels.\n\n[h1]Captains Orders:[/h1]\nIf you can combine smart gameplay with the need to adapt every 2 minutes in between more relaxed puzzle parts in a game that looks good, feels solid and well done. Go for it. It may not have tons of replayability if you are not into achievements or time racing. But for what it offers in one first play through, I still say go get it.  \n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1] \n[b]Treasure![/b] Not because it is the largest awesomest game in the last 6 month, but because it is instant fun! It takes you in or should I say lets you in real quick and then demands a lot of brainpower and/or quick reaction on the player part. I enjoyed it a lot!  \n\n[h1]For more Reviews visit  [url=https://captainnemoweb.wordpress.com/]CaptNemo's Log[/url][/h1]\n[h1]For Gameplay Videos and live streaming visit [url=https://www.twitch.tv/captn3mo]CaptN3mo's twitch channel[/url][/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477030458, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1477030759, "recommendationid": "26140714", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495922", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465115859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 613, "steamid": "76561197978351587", "num_games_owned": 337}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Definitely giving this one a recommendation.
