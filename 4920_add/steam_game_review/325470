Looks great, runs smooth, and the possibilities are endless. We'll need a navy for Norway, armies for Israel, etc., but that's part of the bargain. It's all very easy to do with Notepad ++. I just copied all the commanders from Time of Fury, made the necessary text changes, and have 100 commanders. Of course, I have no interest in building a game with the actual historical military commanders from 1953 :)\n\nIn fact, I am considering downgrading the superpowers' unit levels to maybe \"3\" to give them more to research, while Hungary would be Level 1. Also interesting to bring Turkey into the mix on the NATO front to give USSR something more to worry about. Not really interested in the nuke part of the game, but that may well be very important for the design.\n\nOnly bug I found so far is when you open the Diplomacy box, it blocks the other hex box options and I can't close it. I could be missing something, of course. So for modders, a very nice engine and template has been provided here. For regular users, it plays okay, but backup those csv files and give modding a try.\n\nA big part of the war (I guess) would be getting U.S. men and materiel to Europe. I don't think this is handled by the convoy system (I leave it on automatic), only supply (PP). I think U.S. builds must be made in America (gotta check that).  It might be nice to allow these builds on European ports. Otherwise, the game will have to come up with some kind of cargoship mechanic to get U.S. units over there - while possibly avoiding WP anti-shipping efforts.\n\nAnyway, I was pleasantly surprised. Not to be rude, but Fall Weiss (IMO) was the worst.
