So why the 'not recommended' ? \n          This game says that it uses D&D 5e rules to difine its gameplay, however, I beg to differ. there is an incredibly limited number of playable races and classes, even after the first (and likely only) expansion (which added one race and one class). Many of the flavor blerbs and tool tips mention classes that are canon to D&D, but not present in the game (such as Bard, Barbarian, Monk and Druid)\n         There is no class balancing to speak of (wizards are borderline unplayable until at least level 7 (mine was level 6 when I deleted him)\n         There are a number of abilities which span multiple classes (Grappling Hooks as a weapon are not a thing in D&D unless created by the player at the table, but are a thing for the Cleric, Ranger, Fighter, Paladin and Rogue, which leaves only 2 classes out)\n          Clerics are better at everything that makes a paladin a paladin, except that they dont get Medium Armor and slightly limited weapon selection, meanwhile\n         Every class in the game shares one tree of \"basic skill proficiencies\" which can be purchased at level up at the cost of not buying abilities for your class. While I understand this choice (because there is something cool about casting magic spells as a wizard in full plate armor) they all feel VERY samey, and none of them really stand out as being particularly interesting.\n         The Warlock in particular seems poorly designed\n         Ability scaling is TERRIBLE!\n         VERY often it is WAY more efficient to purchase a single rank in a spell/ability than to max it out because of how the scaling works. EX: spells often deal 11-24 damage for first rank, 12-28 damage for 2nd rank, 15-30 damage for 3rd rank, and 16-36 damage for the final rank. consider that enemies have much, much more HP than 1) they should and 2) feels appropriate, your character is doing substandard damage from the get-go, and continues to, meanwhile enemy damage gets much, much harder to deal with.\n\nNUMEROUS bugs that somebody should have seen.\nthere are a few classes with passive abilities which, after purchasing the first rank and then clicking on each successive rank, grants the benefits of the unpurchased ranks. this is only good because the Warlock (whose Familiar via Pact of the Chain has this bug) is otherwise an incredibly weak combatant. my 6th level Warlock is running around with 44Armor Class (he never gets hit and, by rights should have less than half of that)\n\nin Tabletop, without spells, the highest Armor Class (the number which determines how easy/hard you are to hit) a Fighter (who can use the heaviest armor in game plus a shield) can achieve without magical items is 21. that means that the enemy has to have a combined total of 21 or more after relevant bonuses. generally that means that almost any enemy in game can only hit you, at best, on a 17-20 on a 20-sided die (20% of the time) \nconsidering that the PC game is supposed to be using the same rules, having a 44ac means that there is a zero percent chance of ever being hit by anything which makes an attack roll, outside of receiving a Critical hit (which does extra damage and has a 5% chance of happening, ever).\n\nthis game looks alright (but not great) and sounds alright (but not great)\nI paid 15 bucks for it, so, i have definitely gotten my money's worth. it is fine, and interesting for a while, but Dungeons and Dragons it is not, save in name only", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504683058, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504683058, "recommendationid": "34771057", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520007", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506959605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1273, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2071, "steamid": "76561198002315853", "num_games_owned": 317}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The first time I played this game i lasted about an hour before I uninstalled it.

I played through the entire game in single player and didn't really notice any of that.  So I guess it's just a matter of how picky you might be.  This game is fun, and deserves a better rating that the current \"mixed\" in my opinion. \n\nIf you're on the fence, and you're not a super hardcore dnd fan (or you're able to realize it's just a game and you can overlook little details), I'd give it a try, well worth the modest price.  The only issue I had with the game was that in some sections there was quite a lot of backtracking where you spend several minutes just running through areas you've already cleared.  There really needs to be some kind of \"return to entrance or exit\" feature once an area has been cleared.

So many design flaws that completly ruins the experience.\n\nExploration/Controls sucks, its a clicker game, but i need to move the CAMERA with W,A,S,D. Like really? Map is also bad, why i need to push MIDDLE fucking mouse to pan the map?? It could be the same controls to move the camera, or could have been left click, so many better options than middle button. Map should be also more descriptive.\n\nQuests are too slow paced, takes too much time, too much unnecessary exploration and the controls are already bad, so it felt heavy and exhasting just to play the game, to make it better, there is no point mark to where you should go until you are actually in the place of the quest! How genius! Because of that, many people get stuck with the main quests, if this game wanted to focus on exploration and no guides marks, controls should be fluid like Diablo, PoE, etc.\n\nGameplay design is somewhat a worst clone of dragon age's design. I felt that i have so many useless skills, and not much of \"combos\" options. For exemple i have firebolt, frostbolt, and lighting bolt they are all cantrips that do the same damage to the enemy with no variations or singularities unless you spend points to make them with unique proprieties, but those proprieties are not relevant at all (like 3% chance to stun foes with lighting), do you think i will spend 1 point in this shit, when i can get a much useful skill??\n\nI think the friendly fire killed most of the value of AoE skills, like thunderwave and fireball. Also the D&D combat mechanics simulation makes combat too long, it should be removed completly. Action bar skill placement should be easier to customize and intuitive, something so simple this game fails again. Skill trees are too broad, should be more class especific and with better value to each class. \n\nMost of the itens are completly useless and with no gear value, just junk to sell for gold, most itens to buy from merchants are also junk and too expensive.\n\nThe only really good thing in this game that kept me playing was the story and the D&D setting, but i can't take it anymore, this game is too slow, with bad controls, and not so good combat.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505175997, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505175997, "recommendationid": "34892588", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488249", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 896, "total_reviews": 1574, "num_reviews": 7, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 678}}
