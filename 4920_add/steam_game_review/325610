Like Medieval 2 there's an army walking past in the background on the main menu. Age of Charlemagne further hammers this point in to the point I think it's safe to say this is as close to a Medieval 3 we'll get until the official Medieval 3 is released.\n\nNow, the game has some very serious optimisation issues. I have a fairly beefy computer but the framerate grinds to a halt when more then 2-3k troops participate in a battle. There are also a problem where unit animations become choppy with too many troops on the screen at the same time.\nThe battles though are excellent with many small touches here and there that brings the battlefield to life. Like the peasants walking about that really doesn't add anything but still is a really nice touch.\n\nThe campaign though is where the largest changes have taken place. Some factions start as hordes or can form hordes when chased out of their last province. The hordes wander around looting and raiding in the search for a new and safe homeland. This essentially cuts out what could be tedious campaign gameplay and letting the players focus entirely on the series trademark battles. On the negative side I still can't get behind every army needing a general or the province system. I think Shogun 2 had it perfectly nailed down and Rome 2 tore it all to shreds and for whatever reason Attila has to repeat many of the same mistakes.\n\nAnother thing I can't get behind is the skill trees of agents and generals. It doesn't lead me to remember their names and characteristics the way the original Rome did. Agents also feel more useless then ever and I can't recall myself ever thinking that I need anything other then priests to keep the ludicrous barbarian late game public order issues in check.\n\nAt least they brought the family tree back. Good on you CA.\nIt's a mixed package. I'd still say this is a must have TW title very well on par with Medieval 2.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504770790, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504770790, "recommendationid": "34790002", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506170510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 442, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6555, "steamid": "76561198018023390", "num_games_owned": 116}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Rome's glory has ended, her days are numbered. A large power vacuum is created as a result. This is basically a game of carving up the Rome-cake between the rest of the world and forging new, powerful Alliances. Attila is moving on Eastern Europe, do you stand and fight? Assymilate or Flee? The choice is yours and this will be your Epic \"Story\".\n\nIf you want to play the Rome of post Gaius-Marius reforms, buy Rome 2, this will not give you that experience. This is set a few hundred years after this time period, which in my opinion makes it a more even playing field if you are wanting to play Factions other than Roman. \n\nMultiplayer only increases this games appeal to me, being able to bring a good friend along the windy road of Empire building is truly the cherry on the cake of an already fantastic game, And i much recommend this to anyone wanting a decent Co-op experience. Not to mention those wanting PvP Strategy.\n\nVery fluid and intuitive controls in battle, UI can be a little confusing at first if you are used to another TW's UI, but overall very good.\n\nBreath taking graphics for the machines that can put a little more Horsepower through it, i run on medium settings and it's more than acceptable. \n\na bit miffed on the DLC's as i think some should have been shipped in the base game, Nonetheless they are worth a grab on sale.\n\nThe way to really make this game sing is with Mods! Fantastic modding community and easy execution with Workshop integration for quick and simple mod installation. Just click + Play.\n\nOverall, Delivers exactly what you expect from a Total War game. If you enjoyed the others then this is definitely for you, Just don't go in to it expecting Rome 2 Clone. This game is about the Underdog's of European history...
