More than a few folks have expressed their distaste with the developer and frankly I can't help but join them.\n\nI REALLY [i][b]REALLY[/b][/i] want to like this game, but its less a treat to play and more of a chore.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494056776, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494056776, "recommendationid": "31575226", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441808", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1425256571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 641, "steamid": "76561198057728093", "num_games_owned": 68}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Let me put this as politely as i can....this is crap. \n\nThe devs promised the community way more than they could or would have ever been willing to deliver and this basically is not a game. I purchased this on good faith in beta some time ago because the idea of this type of game seemed awesome and i've been waiting for more to happen with it but the team behind it has basically abondoned it entirely, taken their money and run. This pile of garbage is why i now refuse to support games in beta for the most part. Myself and all those other people who were excited about this idea got absolutely and utterly screwed. This had a ton of promise and didn't just fall short, it never really began. \n\nIf anyone from Steam is reading this, do the community a favour and remove this.
