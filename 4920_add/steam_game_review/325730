The pacing is a bit sluggish, the UI is kind of primitive, and there are a very small number of units available to you, described in a way that suggests there were a lot more planned (you've got a barracks \"for light infantry\" but literally no other building for producing military units). There are also a very limited set of enemies to face, there's basically no soundtrack, and let's not forget the graphics remind me of Age of Mythology or, if we want to be very generous, Warcraft 3 - it's not ugly, in fact the units are visually well-designed all things considered, it just looks like an RTS from the early 2000s. There are also flying units that don't actually move differently to anyone else - I'm guessing they didn't have the bandwidth to build out distinct pathfinding and combat logic for flying units. All of this makes me think the developers had grand ambitions and ended up having to cut corners, which kind of sucks for everyone.\n\nThere are a few things that are just genuinely bad, though: the dialog writing and voice acting. For a story-based RTS, they've actually got a pretty interesting high concept and some neat ideas (there's no clear good and evil for the most part, there's a neat sci-fi backdrop, there are a lot of weird races and ancient history, the ecology implied is kinda nuts), but every time a character starts talking it just feels stilted and awkward. The story did little to help me care about my faction or any of their characters. Units in combat also don't have much weight - impacts don't register strongly visually or aurally, so things feel a bit floaty.\n\nThat said, I do think this is an interesting game worth considering if you're into RTS games. Aside from the interesting story concepts mentioned above, there are a few things here I really appreciated. Some were small AI innovations - if you tell your army to attack-move somewhere, your healers will automatically move along and start healing any units they can instead of running at the enemy, which is nice. Others were balance things - resources are pretty scarce in this game, as befits something set entirely in a cave, and a bit part of the challenge is using the few resources available to you wisely, which is a big part of what an RTS is all about.\n\nThere are also some enemies with complex boss-style attacks, and while the UI is primitive and the pacing is off, they're well-telegraphed and force you to consider what units to apply and how to move them around to keep them alive. One of the most interesting dynamics is the fact that loot and equipment you find for your units can also be broken down into DNA, which is needed for research - so do you keep a persistent item that can buff any one unit throughout the campaign, or do you melt it down into points for persistent research that unlocks new units or boosts all units? It's an underdeveloped system, but it was an interesting trade-off to have to think about, and one I've never seen before.\n\nSo, long story short, we have here an interesting but flawed game. Why am I saying recommend? Well, I think that if the developers have the chance to develop the (heavily implied) sequel, and if they learned good project management lessons from this game, they could actually be onto something really special. There's potential here, and I can appreciate potential in a game even if the execution isn't great, to some extent. So if you're open to something with a lot of rough edges, maybe give The Hive a try, and you'll find something kinda interesting.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500869320, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500869755, "recommendationid": "33758408", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502446", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500342889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 880, "steamid": "76561198031481122", "num_games_owned": 56}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Honestly the game feels incomplete. The story is nice and the visuals are excelent, but the overall gameplay is... lacking. Only 4 buildings (Hive/Spawn, Barracks, Storage/Science, Turret) and decidely limited units.

The same necromancer -_-). Certain aspects of the game make no sense (how can a flying unit not cross territory unless land units can?) and a few pieces that feel like they could have been done much better (there is no real lead-up to the final boss except a few notes that it exists.
