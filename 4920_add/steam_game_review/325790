Bad voice acting, very basic missions, so-so tactics.  On top of that, there are some glaring bugs that just make playing this annoying.  Chief among them is the games propensity to hang if an enemy kills itself during its action.  Since you can't save during missions, any hang of the program forces you to redo the entire level.  I could ignore some of the issues I have with this game, but 12 hours into it I have had the program hang on 5 separate missions.  I don't have the patience to cope with that.  Also, I absolutely hate how it will close random encounters when the last enemy dies.  Looting that critical sniper ammo becomes a chore and a half because the sniper has to die and be looted before the last enemy falls.  All in all, very disappointing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500407765, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500407765, "recommendationid": "33637057", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517944", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 27, "total_reviews": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 57}}
