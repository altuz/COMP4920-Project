The reason you ask?  Quite simple... The incoming creatures are farm animals like chickens, cattle, and pigs being processed for human consumption!  Since you get paid by the pound, the fatter these animals are before going into the packing facility, the more money you make!  Don't let them die of hunger, thirst, or alien invasion before they are packaged up and you are rewarded for their weight!  \n\nUse the money earned to buy more hormone injection guns, more corn-firing food guns, and antibiotic guns as well as upgrading them all!  Also money earned helps you buy power ups, farm hands, and upgrades.  \n\nIt's a comical, very cute and amazingly challenging tower defense style game that pokes fun at the sad state that is our current food industry.  It's all about the money in this game, and the animal caring folk need not apply here!\n\nI'd give it an 8/10 for both challenge, originality, and sheer number of options and features... and this game could easily get even better as the game evolves through it's early access process!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414119553, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1414119553, "recommendationid": "12604969", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504102", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421275214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 432, "steamid": "76561198003936682", "num_games_owned": 73}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fat Chicken is exactly what I expected going into it: a cutesy, fairly easy TD game with a slightly unique concept. Despite the fact that you're fattening up animals instead of killing them, it plays almost exactly like any other TD game on the market. Here are my main criticisms of this game:\n\n- Really easy and shallow. Most tower placements are no-brainers and the game never puts up much of a fight, even though the final mission initially seems impossible. Getting three stars on every level isn't hard at all.\n- Too short. After the main campaign, there aren't any \"bonus\" levels, or ideally, way harder versions of all the existing levels. When I finished, I wanted more.\n- Occasional bugs, such as security guards failing to chase away protestors and a MurderBux counter that stops updating (both of these happened in the final stage by the way.) However, I'm extremely forgiving about this kind of thing and considering the size of the developer and how recently it came to Steam, the level of bugs is actually impressively low.\n\nDespite that, I enjoyed Fat Chicken. I'm a sucker for cutesy stuff like this and the music is actually kinda catchy. I'd recommend this game to casual players specifically, as hardcore players like myself will ironically be hungry for more after completing the campaign.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421206651, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421206651, "recommendationid": "13978097", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515555", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429469502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 380, "steamid": "76561198083682264", "num_games_owned": 15}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fat Chicken is an interesting twist on the strategy genre.  It's made by some industry vets who have worked for Insomniac Games, Red Storm Entertainment, and Westwood Studios.  The creative director was heavily involved in the Command and Conquer series (a personal favorite of mine in the strategy genre) and the experience behind this title shows.  You spend each mission trying to make as much money as possible beefing up farm animals (including poultry as the name suggests) using towers to fatten up, genetically enhance, water, and medicate your animals.  While I have not experienced all of the perks or upgrades yet (I am still in the process of finishing the game) I would like to mention that you are not limited to just a few tower options.  Special skills and tower upgrades are available.  It's got learning curve that makes it easy to get into and a lot of ways to get the most money and meat out of your animals.  This is a definite buy for originality, personality, and just plain fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431367212, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431367212, "recommendationid": "15790151", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499679", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1419660430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 152, "steamid": "76561198094435824", "num_games_owned": 307}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An awesome reverse tower defense game!

What? That's exactly it! In Fat Chicken, instead of warding off a throng of enemies, you want to fatten up livestock and welcome them into your slaughterhouse as bloated and fat as possible! The concept may sound disturbing, but it's so silly and exaggerated that you can't help but chuckle. As a matter of fact it was the sheer level of ridiculous that drew me in! The graphics are pleasant and hilarious (gotta say, my first exploding cow absolutely floored me!) There's a wide variety of challenging and different levels, and you can choose your upgrades as you earn enough stars to buy them. I love being able to re-spec my tower upgrades depending on the level. I love that the 3-star challenge changes from level to level, adding a challenging element and making you think!
