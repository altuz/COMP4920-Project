I certainly have but I can\u2019t remember what movies were featured. And then you fell asleep and a nightmare begun.\n\nIn this nightmare, you become the hero of one single B movie where you have to fight many known  badies like Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolf man and others.\n\nArmed at start with your Baseball bat, you have to hack and slash you way through to the next level.\nBut do not worry too much about weapons as you will get guns and traps along the way to help you in your nightmare.\nGreat graphics and the control works fine.\n\nFor $4.99, this game is worth every cent. This is fun and challenging. Maybe too much challenging at times.\n\nPositive:\n~~~~~~~~   \n-\tFun to play\n-\tLots of achievements\n-\tGreat Graphics\n-\tTrading Cards\n\nNegative: \n~~~~~~~    \n-\tMaybe too challenging at times\n\nGreat game to have in your library.

You can see how much I've enjoyed by my playing time! It's very easy to pick up and play and lose a few hours! Graphics and sound are suitably atmospheric and it runs well altogether. It's fun trying to find all the coins and there is the urge once finishing to play through again on hard or to get more achievements (some are a bit of a grind though). It has cute little trading cards too which are impulsive to attain.\n\nThere are a few negative points:\ncan become very repetitive on one sitting\nsome glitching on movable boxes\nsome areas not unlocking meaning you have to restart the level\nfurther on things such as moving ledges can be very annoying due to being out of sync\nThe 3 \"bosses\" are the same and almost impossible to kill the last on Hard setting\n2 of the achievements seem to be broken\n\nHowever if you like cutesy, straightforward fun, you could do lot worse than pick this up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424171584, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424171584, "recommendationid": "14512584", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505613", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1420446686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 50, "steamid": "76561197977016810", "num_games_owned": 1158}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A quaint little hack'n'slash kind of game.

Enjoyable & easy to play, (the 2 basics to a good game) just keep on swinging for the fences and/or unloading your range weapons and you'll get where you need to go. The only downside to this game is the jumping mechnic I feel is off, like you cant jump 'out' you have to jump 'up-then-out'.

A very casual game but actually challenging. One of the better mobile ports I have played. What stood out for me right out of the gate are the enemies voices and sound effects. They're hillariously bad, and really add to the B-movie theme. I laugh out loud every time I encounter a wolfman.\n\nIf you like games like Bunch of Heroes or AZMD!, then you'll like CoP, which is better than the aforementioned games. I enjoy finding new weapons, I like how they have a survival mode as well as a campaign, and I really dig the B-movie themes. CoP is a steal at its current price.
