There is a weapon quick select bar on the top of the screen.\n\nBut nope. Same crap starting sword with its same crap range for the entire twenty minutes I played it. This is like if one of the older castlevania games refused to put any throwing daggers or axes in any of the candles for the first three levels. Of course the game is going to utterly fail to maintain my interest if it doesn't let me do anything interesting. Twenty minutes is a long time for an action game. I don't think it is too much to ask to do something but a single basic sword sweep during that time and haven't seen anything like that outside of coffee break flash clicker games from the year 2000. \n\nI will give it one thing - the enemies have some really neat designs.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1478542231, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1478542332, "recommendationid": "26477372", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498007", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483363007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561198095519520", "num_games_owned": 290}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I think this is the first negative review I've made.\nTL;DR you play as some chameleon-eyed ass mother fucker who can't jump right and is really bad at finding cool things.\nIt's been said by basically everyone; the map design and controls combine to make an experience that is very difficult to enjoy. But none of the reviews I read really went into detail about why the controls fail. The original Castlevania was even more static than this, but it was fine because the enemies were also very rigid in their movement and attack patterns. In this game, you're expected to be making wall jumps and avoid flying enemies and projectiles that can move at any angle while still being stuck with very stiff movement. In short, the enemy and level design are in direct conflict with the fundamentals of how the game plays. Half the time you'll engage with an enemy, but have nowhere to jump because the hallways are all too short, and no way to back off quickly enough to avoid whatever it's probably shooting at you, and with the starting sword, you have be just about inside of an enemy to hit it. I found a shield once, but it had a durability bar that didn't recharge, and you couldn't move while using it, rendering it just about useless. The shield was also the only thing I found during my playtime besides health potions, so I can't even speak for any cool powerups to be found.\nThe problem with the platforming is that your jump momentum remains constant, even if you let go of whatever directional button you had pressed. I'm a novice when it comes to programming, but this should be an extremely fundamental problem that would take very little change to fix, but the devs have ignored it regardless. Wall jumps are wonky, and with how often you have to do them, it gets old quick. With the movement and combat as it is, trying to navigate the dungeons, I feel I'm fighting the controls more than the enemies. It simply lacks the mechanical fluidity we expect of a modern metroidvania game. \nThe idea is nice, and with some polish, it could be a great game, but it's received no love from the devs. The game's main saving grace is that the pixel art environments look pretty good.

Crystal Catacombs can be quite difficult but, unlike many rogue-likes, is seldom unfair. The controls might take a little bit of getting used to (jumping is a bit floaty) but once you get over that minor hump the game is a blast. I really like how the save game functionality works. Similar to Rogue Legacy, whenever you defeat a final boss (i.e. complete one of the 5 worlds), that world is marked as completed even if you later die. However, progress within a world is not saved so you do have to complete each world in one go. I think this strikes a great balance between real challene and a sense of progression. If not for this feature, I likely would have given up due to the difficulty of the game. Being able to save completed worlds really gives a nice sense of relief when you have a good run.

Beautiful, but buggy. Clever, but a bit confused. \n\nThe game is a difficult platformer with inventory and limited character development, and procedurally generated dungeons. It has many small bugs (on Linux, anyway) but only very occasionally did they interrupt the game. \n\nCrystal Catacombs does a great job of setting a particular, claustrophobic mood. Lovecraftian monsters, an intentionally tight field of vision (made more-so by darkness), and random maps populated by both easy and brutally difficult enemies all add to this vague sense of panic. The music, which I adore, is also unusual (is it modal? Is that right?) and adds to the experience. \n\nThe beautiful pixel art is the main attraction, but the graphics are not nearly as retro as the gameplay. That's neither an insult nor a compliment. While it's a platformer, the level design and advancement are a lot more true to the spirit of Rogue than glut of roguelike and roguelite cousins. Death is common, especially at first, and sometimes can seem unfair or arbitrary. Again, not really a insult or a compliment, but if you're approaching this with a strictly modern sensibility, I have a feeling you're going to be frustrated. And yes, the controls are difficult. Perhaps slighty more difficult than other similar retro games, but I didn't find them dramatically so, and I don't really think this is necessarily a bad thing. The game is very obviously designed to be difficult.\n\nThere are a handful of game-mechanic innovations I haven't seen anywhere else, also. As an example, the use of exploding...  flower-petals? I don't know that they are supposed to be, but they slowly drift down the screen on later levels, and do a fair amount of damage when hit. Usually easy to avoid, they sometimes make otherwise simple encounters more difficult, and provide an added source of urgency. This  is either genius or criminally unpleasant, depending on your expectations. I go with the former, but it's a matter of taste. \n\nEverything about this game feels like it was a labor of love.
