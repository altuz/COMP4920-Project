It's very intuitive to use after following along with Allegorithmic's video walkthrough, which takes you through all the stuff you need to get started. The normal maps this program generates are miles better than anything Photoshop generates, and you get all the other PBR slots like Height maps, and whatnot, which really pushes the texture to new levels. This is a must buy for anyone serious about environmental art.\n\nThe only \"gotcha\" is that some maps are exported as greysale, which Unity can't read naturally, so you have to change thme to RGB in photoshop, but once you do that you're gold.
