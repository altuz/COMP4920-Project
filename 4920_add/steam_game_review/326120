You can think in [b][i]Space Invaders Extreme[/i][/b] going to bed with [b][i]Donkey Kong[/i][/b][/h1]\n\n[i]Horizon Shift[/i] is one of the most brilliant single screen shmups ever created, that it\u2019s heavily influenced by Taito contemporary classics like [i]Space Invaders Extreme[/i]. But it also succeeds on putting a lot of masterful new design ideas on the table, trying to break the player\u2019s preconceptions regarding the genre in disruptive and fully original ways.\n\nIts main gimmick, the possibility of switching between two differentiated action spaces that sometimes get mixed with bullets crossing the horizon line, it\u2019s on a par in its ingenuity with [i]Ikaruga[/i] and its polarity design. And the double jump button becomes a joyful mechanic that adds a rare sense of accomplishment, while the player is dodging bullets, destroying ships and trying to jump over moving spikes and other obstacles invading the horizon line. This wise sum of design elements make of [i]Horizon Shift[/i] a rara avis, in his combination of shooting and plattforming elements in a cohesive way. You can think in [i]Space Invaders[/i] going to bed with [i]Donkey Kong[/i].\n\nBut where [i]Horizon Shift[/i] truly shines is in its scoring system, that highly rewards the risks taken by the player. And as life itself, an error can give you a better opportunity for improvement and to scoring high. In [i]Horizon Shift[/i], every single mistake, every ship that invades or destroy a fragment of your horizon, it will increase your scoring multiplier. So the best strategy to scoring high is play in a schizophrenic and bipolar way, missing enemies intentionally, let them invading you horizon, an then use this mistakes to destroy the rest of ships with a higher score bonus. But as life itself, a sum of errors can become your perdition. With every single mistake, the scoring opportunities are higher, but it\u2019s much harder to dodge and jump between bullets and the invading enemies or broken parts in your horizon. [i]Horizon Shift[/i] laughs in the face of all the traditional and conservative STG\u2019s players that will try to destroy every single ship, forcing them to radically change his misconceptions regarding the genre. [i]Horizon Shift[/i] it\u2019s a Dogma 95 shmup directed by Lars Von Trier.\n\nAnd do you remember the Charles Mingus jazz song [i]\u201cOh Lord, don\u2019t let them drop that Atomic Bomb on me\u201d[/i]? Since the time of the first [i]Raiden[/i], the STG\u2019s players have been trained in not to use the bomb in shooting games if they want to score high. [i]Horizon Shift[/i], like [i]Battle Garegga[/i] before it, laughs one more time in the face of this conservative players. In [i]Horizon Shift[/i] the bomb not only destroy all enemies and rebuilds your horizon line. Also serves to bank your chain score. So if you don\u2019t drop the atomic bomb on them, Oh Lord!, you will lose all your hard earned multiplier points. [i]Horizon Shift[/i] forces you to create a right strategy, using the bomb in the most hard parts, and ensuring that you can survey the next waves until the bomb meter  is fully recharged.\n\nAll of these mechanics and its perfect tuned score system are accompanied by a brilliant level design. The game never becomes boring, and it has a design philosophy inspired by Nintendo classics. With new elements, obstacles, enemies and patterns that appears at a slow but constant pace. The new obstacles always appears in individual levels that serves as tutorial. It explodes every single mechanic in a lot of creative ways and original situations. And the difficulty curve is sublime in its balance.\n\nWith a lot of brilliant design ideas and absorbing visuals that resembles Tetsuya Mizoguchi, Namco or Taito contemporary creations, [i]Horizon Shift[/i] has become with [i]Pacman Championship Edition DX+[/i] one of my favorite arcade experiences in Steam.\n\n\n[i]( The writer of this review is not an English native.

While the axis-flipping mechanic is not new, the game does bring some interesting platforming mechanics into play complete with enemies being able to destroy the line creating jumpable gaps. On the negative side, the visuals are nothing special. I played with a keyboard and also a controller, and both felt decidedly awkward for what is a simple game although I only tried one of several configurations for the controller.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Its cheap\n+It can run on a toaster\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-While there are some interesting platforming elements that are new, it wasn't enough to keep me interested.\n-Artwork is bland.\n-Music is generic.\n\nPerhaps I did not get far enough to see something great, but I doubt it.
