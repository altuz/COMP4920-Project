To have had the experience of being baited with very long cooldowns, gem for cash offers, unlock a feature for facebook shililing offers, watch a video for a few more in game currency, and moving into a port like this one, it is quite the eye opening experience. They gutted the free bonus section, you can see ads for other monument builder games but they yield no reward, rest of the buttons are unlocked later as a reward but all they do is show you some concept art, and some in game historical fluff text about alcatraz that you collect by beating levels. The game lowered all gem costs to 1, and gives you enough gems to constantly buy all the power ups at every level as long as you have three stars, which isnt hard with the power ups. The game becomes this super fast paced clusterflock of automated workers, ultra fast cooldown, and hastened building production. Levels are beaten within minutes and you realize just how little gameplay the original tablet games really had once you removed all the hassle out of it. As a sit down experience on the PC of course this kind of cooldown game is very innappropriate, it was always meant as a pick and drop experience where the game mostly plays itself. This game is made worse by the fact that you dont ever even see the alcatraz prison from what I exerpienced so far. You are just in presumably neighbouring villages fixing roads, clicking on little gangsters to make them go away, and clicking away debris. Its a lot like playing Tapped Out Simpsons from EA except without the sandbox component and with silly missions instead. The monopoly knock off mission giver and the whole storyline is all rather derivative and forgettable. You got to feed cupcakes to pelicans to get rid of them? All in all this is just library clutter", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494984896, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505094475, "recommendationid": "31797411", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
