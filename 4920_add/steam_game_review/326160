However, if you appreciate R.G. games for the things like\nnot being able to run through people, day/night/weather cycles, having to talk to NPCs to learn their names, etc. Then you will appreciate this game for what it is. \n\nI have been playing since Feb 2017 And noticed right away that even though players are able to pay their way to the top with real money, its just as easy to work your way there. The economy can be a bit hard to follow at first, but it gets quite simple if you just try to stay up to date on things, and kind of keep an ear in the community. \n\nSpeaking of community, there are lots of great players and groups on here waiting to help new people make a start. I have met many wonderful people on the game. all very well mannered folk. (I find it easily has a similuar social style to UO, which is really all the mattered to me). That being said, Its important to understand that lots of those great towns your running through, some of the books youre reading, and even some of the songs you hear on avatars radio, are all from the community. Which really shows how lots of people are building this community better, and better. \n\nI recommend this game to people looking for an Ultima Online style game, that can keep an open mind.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507140099, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507140099, "recommendationid": "35477378", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499629", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 208, "total_reviews": 423, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 215}}
