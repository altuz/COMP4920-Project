A very unique game considering you cannot run and gun like the Half-Life's and Quake's that came out around the same time. Great military simulator and huge levels! Such awesome memories with the campaign. Can be intense and frustrating but that's what happens, just push through. The missions are good, and actually having to get to EZ's when the mission is complete and yet there is still enemies on the map can be tense.\n\n\"Alpha One is down, Alpha Two is down, Alpha Team is down\"\n\"Charlie One is down, Charlie Two is down, Charlie Team is down\"\n\"Bravo, proceed on mission\"\n\nYeah next time just send me in alone!"}]}
