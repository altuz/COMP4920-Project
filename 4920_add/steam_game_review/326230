Despite zero polish, the game is a fun \"one-more turn\" experience, and if you let yourself, you can get immersed in the setting. However, Smugglers V: Invasion is the exact same game, with a little less variety. The hook of Invasion is you can no longer play as the factions: Coalition, Syndicate, and Outer Rim, but can now play as the Kilrathi from Wing Commander.\n\nThere are some improvments from Smugglers V to Invasion, but it's price tag of 10$ is just too steep for the same game again, and I'll probably just go back and play Sumgglers V vanilla cause of the faction variety.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414193831, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1414193831, "recommendationid": "12617307", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623627", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1420827464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 21, "steamid": "76561198205130760", "num_games_owned": 5}, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I bought both Smugglers 5 and Smugglers 5: Invasion before they launched on Steam.
