Here are my pros and cons:\n\n+ beautiful design\n+ good voice acting in comparison to many other games in this genre\n+ puzzles are interesting\n+ use of tablet as communication device, camera, UV-light, night vision ..\n+ nice music, and I loved the ambient sounds\n\n- I like it, when you can adjust difficulty levels to customary preferences, here you only have the three default difficutly levels - they are ok, so no major thing\n- game crashed once when I switched to desktop, otherwise it ran without any problems\n- although I found the story interesting, I could have done with a little less dialogue or more playable content between the existing dialogue ;)\n\n\nIf you like HO-games with adventure elements, I can only recommend this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507107639, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507108265, "recommendationid": "35466684", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500424", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506354609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1283, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1283, "steamid": "76561198015324296", "num_games_owned": 465}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Mystery of Neuschwanstein is a classic Hidden Object Scenes game, with casual puzzles and mini-games.\nThe plot isn't very exciting, nor sophisticated, as most games of the genre. At least it's not full of monsters, beasts or other unrealistic creatures and fantastic events. And it refers to real historical figures (mainly Ludwig II of Bavaria who commissioned the construction of the splendid Neuschwanstein castle) and some true facts about them, which is a good informative and educational attempt. \nEven though most unlikely, the events of the story remain credible. The storyline and the characters are pleasant enough to peacefully travel from mini-games to HOS and kill several hours of time till the end of the game. \nSome HOS may require you to use some of your inventory items, which adds something to a classic HOS. \nAchievements unlock easily and can be obtained with a unique playthrough. \nThe voice acting (English version) is fine by me. All the documents you're supposed to read can be listened to by clicking on them, which is nice if you're playing after a hard day's work or if you're lazy when it comes to reading. \nI regretted the lack of music. Well, there was some but it was either very slow, somewhat sad and almost unnoticeable or either too loud (action cutscenes). \nYou can skip all cutscenes and dialogues. Important facts are still available in your phone and no achievement depends on watching them. \nI wouldn't recommend it at full price because as most games of the genre it has a low replayability value and this one is quite short to finish (don't take my shown hours of playing time into consideration : I've let the game running on the start menu for hours while i was at something else and it took me 3 playthrough to write some guides since I had forgotten to take screenshots etc..).\n\nOn sale it's a good acquisition.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506355357, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506361310, "recommendationid": "35205614", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500420", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
