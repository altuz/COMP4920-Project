Enemy ships comes in endless waves.seems NO ONE ON YOUR SHIP HAS BINOCULARS, so you can't evade hopeless out-numbered battles, please enjoy restarting at nearby port.\n\nYou can't build fleet. You command only one ship. when you buy a new and larger ship,your former ship just disssapears.\n\nTo build a larger ship, you must defeat that type of the ship in the battle 10 times.\nWhen i play, i was forced to fight Galleon ship with my tiny briganteen.\nJust one enemy galleon  ship smashed  me and my faction's ships and overran all my ports.\n\nDID DEVS TRUELY TESTPLAY THIS?\n\nInstance map is a trap.\nIt creates one-time only challennging map matched with your level.\nBut this game gives much XPs for trading and developping ports.\ni'm an ordinary solo player and when i come close to clear my first world, and want more powerful equipment, i try instance map.\n\nI CAN'T DAMAGE ENEMY SHIPS AT ALL WHILE TINY ENEMY SHIPS DESTROY MY SHIP IN 5 SECONDS. \nAll i can do is looting the wreck AI allies make...HOW FUN!\n\nIf you are a solo gamer like me, you can enjoy only half the content.\nThis is a kick stronger enemy and get stronger equipment and get stronger and stronger game.\nSo if you have tons of friends or never hesitate to Co-op with unknown players, you can enjoy all the contents.\n\nSOLO PLAYERS CAN ONLY ENJOY HALF THE CONTENTS.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505272082, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506164149, "recommendationid": "34912375", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490483", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503238427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561198002731946", "num_games_owned": 166}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "boring", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505941635, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505941635, "recommendationid": "35092155", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475816", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1080, "total_reviews": 1345, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 265}}
