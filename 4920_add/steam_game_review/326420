I WILL UPDATE IT  IF THE OTHER EPISODES COME OUT. But if they dont this is getting a negative review. Sam Glyph is a an adventure game where we play as Sam. He is a detective who is out of work but one day he gets a job offer he cant refuse. After that he is pulled back into the game after a failed assasination attempt. So how is Sam Glyph ? I really like the first episode and its shows alot of promise for the game but theres a bunch of negatives i want to talk about right now. The game has bugged achievements so if youre a completionist just skip this one. But be carefull cause this game might be a scam. The devs of this game promised the next episode to be huge as it was in development for almost a year now. The dev in october stated that the second episode would be out before christmas. But the dev went silent for over 100 days and there is no updates for the game so i think this might be a scam. To get this game just for the first episode is now worth it cause its only like 15 minutes long. Only get this if episode 2 comes out and youre interested in it. I give Sam Glyph Episode 1 a 5/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422749234, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454103130, "recommendationid": "14269888", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455347", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480804188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 69, "steamid": "76561198114563643", "num_games_owned": 286}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Sigh . . . this was an interesting concept, but unfortunately it's been abandoned.

I'm not a huge fan of the blocky graphics but that is mostly just a personal preferance.
