A simple game that has a lot of content to unlock in terms of new weapons, upgraded weapons, new maps, improvements to your tank such as better tracks, more armor and more critical hits. I have played the game for more than 200 hours and I am still playing. The only negative I can say about the game is that it can become fustrating at higher levels. Even though the game is fairly simple (just move your tank, aim and shoot) some players don't realize what they need to do to help their team at higher levels. At the begining of the game the area effect weapons are not very powerful. It doesn't matter if your teammates are close together. But at higher levels, as the area effect weapons become more powerful, it can really hurt your team if they bunch up. It can be very fustrating if another teammate moves close to your tank because the enemy will target you with their large blast radius weapons, knowing that they can hit two tanks with one weapon.\n\n     Overall I highly recommend this game, it is a great value for the price and alot of fun. Just be prepared for some fustration at higher levels if you don't have good teammates on your side.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504656815, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505855968, "recommendationid": "34766804", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507175125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 345, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2303, "steamid": "76561198032085263", "num_games_owned": 71}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I've enjoyed the Worms series in the past, so when I saw this one being played on YouTube, it held my interest.  Since I've played it for the last few weeks, I haven't been disappointed.  The graphics are simple but bright and eyecatching, the physics are well-done, the weapons are fun and funny, and the upgrade system is interesting and encourages you to use as many types as possible rather than just stick with a favorite few.  Tanks are also upgradable with armor, movement, damage, and luck, and can make for some interesting builds.  \n\nAlong with all that, there's extras like shields, teleports, and jet packs, an in-game currency won during matches to buy goodies like bonus weapons, battlefield customizers, and victory music.  And if you don't feel like fighting against real people, there a challenging (and occasionally frustrating) single mission mode to help introduce you to the game, various weapons, and concepts like bumpers and portals.  It's also hard to believe this game is early access; it shows much more polish than some more expensive and bigger name games I've played in the last few years.\n\nMy one complaint with the game is one that usually befalls multiplayer games; there are the odd occasions where you have rude, stupid, or rage-quit players.  This is pretty much expected, though, and to be honest I've encountered far more nice players than trolls.\n\nOverall, its a fun game with a surprising amount of complexity for a simple concept.

The two communities a lot of games need to survive. Shellshock Live houses both of these communities perfectly. Wether you spend the few bucks just for some laidback turn-oriented gaming, or you buy it because you have already squahed every player in every other game, it can be fun for either types of people. This game features a few different gamemodes, my favourite is assassin, that either hit or miss for the player. There's deathmatch, team deathmatch, assassin, juggernaut, and a few other more...[i]degenerate[/i]...gamemodes. The community in this game is pretty chilled out, of course you may come across the young kid who can't play COD on his comp because it's from 2008 or the sweaty tryhard, but what game is complete without the good and the bad? This game is a HD throwback straight to the newgrounds era (infact I think I found this game originally back on Kongregate, a shittier version of newgrounds). If you suffer from [u]\"flash game nostalgia\"[/u] it's definetly a game worth trying out. \n\n   Now on to the gameplay aspect. [strike]God, the gameplay[/strike]. It's great, it really is! There's just one problem: Weapons. The weapons in this game are either really epic and overpowered, or they are something like shooting goldfish in bags at the enemy. I'm not lying, that's a real weapon in the game. The weapons become better as you play and level up the weapons and earn more, and even though the weapons are simply herendous when you first start playing doesn't mean that all of the early weapons you get are terrible. Some of them are really fucking awesome! \n\n  Overall, I highly recommend this game to everybody. Now, why did you spend all this time to read this review I spent too much time on?
