A lot of that comes down to personal bias and what appeals the most to me. IMHHW is not a story about epic conspiracies, mind-blowing plot twists or time travel. It's a simple, feel-good story about a school's glider club with some bittersweet drama thrown in.\n\nSo why do I like it so much? In short, IMHHW has a ton of emotional appeal. Some of that is because of its stunning visuals and amazing soundtrack. I'm a sucker for bright, vibrant colors and this VN delivers them in spades with some truly gorgeous background art. As for the soundtrack...well, take a listen for yourself:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZv8xFnAkOk\n\nI still get chills listening to that. It's not just about the music and visuals though. The characters are interesting and some of the routes really surprised me with how much they kept me invested. The endings got some tears out of me, not because they were sad, but because they were powerful. And that goes right back to IMHHW's core strength: it will move you.\n\nIt's not without its faults though. The translation is shoddy and particularly bad in Ageha's route (which is a shame because it's one of my favorites). What that means is sometimes you will be confused as to what exactly is happening, but fortunately it straightens itself out enough by the latter half of the route. There is a fan retranslation in progress which should fix these issues, so if you're on the fence, it may be worth it to wait for that. My only other minor complaint would be that the sections explaining how gliders work in detail can be a bit boring if you're not into gliders.\n\nOverall I highly recommend IMHHW if you want a VN that draws you in emotionally.

The better part of this verbal incontinence surely doesn't contribute to the plot in the slightest.

Its theme revolves around adolescence. Through easy-to-look-at artwork, relaxing music, and believable teenager characters, and story that doesn't go too far out of ordinary, it does deliver on that central theme.\n\nHowever, It has an exceedingly long storyline coupled with ultra slow pacing. And that wouldn't be a problem had the story been interesting. Unfortunately, whatever appeals this game had in the beginning starts to wear off 5 hours+ into the game when it still does the same thing. For example, I am a fast reader who skipped a fair bit of texts. Eleven hours in, I am still not finished reading the common route, which details our protagonist's everyday life...\n\nPersonally, I can only give a negative recommendation since I dropped this VN.
