Despite the warnings from the professionals, I bought the game. I wish now I hadn't spent my money... on the physical copy I bought more than 10 years ago. Did I regret on Steam? Well, I just wanted to see if I didn't exaggerate my feelings back then. I didn't. Really I didn't. So, I hope you don't mind that I took some parts of an old review published in 2008 and updated it.\n\nBut before revealing why I regret my action, I think that I'll point out some good points. First is the diversity of the playable factions. Well, when I say factions, I meant soldiers. Not enemies.\n\n[list]\n[*] SFOD - DELTA (US Army Special Force Operational detachment - DELTA): Basic soldier moving faster than anyone\n[*] GREEN BERETS (USA): Heavy gunner, they like M60 or M249\n[*] SEAL TEAM 6 (US Navy): In the game, they're doctors only for the multiplayer. They're the best swimmers AND they don't like sound so they're using weapons with silencer.\n[*] CIA SOG (Special Operations Group): They're snipers. So, they're moving less when they're doing their job.\n[*] SAS (UK): The Bristish counterpart of CIA SOG - snipers with all the advantages.\n[*] SASR (AU): The Australian version of SAS. But they're more into grenades than sniper rifle.\n[*] JTF-2 (CANADA): Basic soldier, faster than anyone.\n[*] RANGER (USA, 75th regiment): Counterpart of SASR.\n[*] MARINE FORCE RECON (USA): Heavy Gunner.\n[*] CSAR (US Airforce Combat, Search and Rescue: See the SEAL description...\n[/list]\n\nWell, for the weapons choice, you have 14 primary weapons, 3 secondary ones, 5 sidearms, 3 explosives. My favorites are the OICW Assault Rifle with 20mm grenade launcher (a zoom of 6x, 3 modes of firing, great design), the PSG-1 Suppressed Sniper Rifle (only silent weapon for sniper with a zoom of 4x) and the M82A1 Barret Sniper Rifle (14x for the zoom but the problem is the sound, it's very noisy). You can also ask for an aerial strike; you have the laser designator for that. Not as fun as in Conflict Desert Storm or Vietcong though. Delta Force isn't a game that is difficult to play. I mean, it's intuitive like most of the FPS games. You just need to shoot. Infiltration phases aren't so difficult if you're used to the concept. Graphics are correct; Novalogic is known for developing its own graphic engine. But I must admit that it's inferior to what was done at that time. Neverless, Delta Force TFD is the same as Land Warrior, the previous game. Soundtrack is also a very good point.\n\nNow why am I whining about my purchase? Well, the fact that I didn't finish the single player campaign. Because of there being too many enemies AND the fact that I was killed in the first seconds of the last mission I've played - which in which I'm stuck again. I do hope that I'll finish it.\n\nBut the atmosphere from DF Land Warrior is missing: you don't have your boss speaking at you, you're just a poor guy alone, even the briefings are just readable, nobody is reading them for you.\n\nAnother problem is the 3rd person perspective. You can play it in this FPS, but it's unplayable. Why include the possibility when it's a scary view in this game?\n\nBack then, I was really bothered by the scope zoom on the side. Clearly, I've changed my opinion about it because it didn't bother me anymore. BUT yeah, it's unplayable: the enemy is in the crosshair? Aim lower because your shot will be higher than intended. And even without the scope, it's sometimes the case. Yeah. Weirdly enough, from my previous review, I never said anything about it. Anyway, I'm saying it now. Land Warrior was great, Task Force Dagger is just lagging behind despite being the game released just after.\n\n\nIf you want to try, I can't prevent you from doing it. Seriously, if you can get past the freaking aim lower thing when zooming, the third player view (which is not the default view), the lack of atmosphere, the lack of real character with a background, as you're just an unnamed soldier and the outdated graphics (well it's outdated given that the game was released 15 years ago but it's still pleasant for me), buy it - but at a discount, because 10 bucks for it is too much. However, feel free to buy other Delta Force titles, such as Land Warrior, my favorite in the series."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1491889781, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509378", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31072938", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025137577", "num_reviews": 36, "last_played": 1480589128, "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 40}, "timestamp_updated": 1491889781, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's still fun but it really hasn't aged well.
