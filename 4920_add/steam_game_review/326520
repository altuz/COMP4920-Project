It's best summed up as \"Tetris in zero gravity\". It's a bit of an oversimplification, but it's workable. Not going to lie, though, in comparison to Chime Superdeluxe, the track lineup is sort of weak. While SD had big-name electronica producers (Fred Deakin of Lemon Jelly, one half of Orbital, Sabrepulse, Moby) bringing some fantastic tracks in, Sharp is mostly made out of indie composers. The most notable names here are Chipzel and Chvrches, and I'll be honest I'm not even sure about Chvrches. None of the tracks here are bad in any way, but they're often kind of mediocre and fail to match Superdeluxes' fantastic lineup. In additon the gameplay has changed up a bit: Now, there's only 3-minute Standard mode, and 3 new gamemodes. Sharp is the most notable gamemode, as it sticks with this game's theme of trimming edges and minimalizing. There's no time limit in Sharp, but every Fragment you leave counts down your lifemeter. It sounds easier than Standard, but Sharp has every ability to kick your puzzle-lovin' behind. There's also Strike mode, which has a non-extending minute-and-a-half timer, and a quicker timeline. It's kind of weak compared to Sharp, honestly, but a welcome addition. The third mode is Challenge, which I haven't gotten to yet because 3-minute Standard is HAAAAARD, so i'll leave that up to somebody with actual skill to look at. Overall it's got a lot of fun additions, although it's sometimes a bit weak in parts.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498431457, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498431457, "recommendationid": "32792121", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494822", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494040785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 178, "steamid": "76561197960852791", "num_games_owned": 289}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I have to admit, Im not enjoying this game.
