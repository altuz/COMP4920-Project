While this to most won't sound like a real problem, this game is actually kind of hard to beat so having and endless supply of enemies will become a problem really fast. It's a dumb bug that should've been fixed. \nI apologize for not reviewing any of the other games, but I've only played Wings and Defender of the Crown (which by the way works fine, thank you).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503640593, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503640593, "recommendationid": "34474473", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504821", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 21, "total_reviews": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
