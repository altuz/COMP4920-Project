With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1445241820, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516427", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "18564484", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198004399420", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1441006921, "num_games_owned": 713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 38}, "timestamp_updated": 1445241820, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[b]TL;DR: If you're looking for a game that's similar to the older Delta Force games, look elsewhere. This game had almost everything that made Delta Force what it was stripped out of it.[/b]\n\nI grew up with the Delta Force games, more specifically Delta Force 2 and Delta Force: Land Warrior. I played those games very often, and I liked the semi-realistic fighting involved. You had to choose your loadout and your playstyle. Did you go with a silenced small weapon and sneak into the objective, or did you grab a sniper rifle and pick off targets before moving in? Combined with this and the fact that you only could take a few shots before you died (no checkpoints here), Delta Force was a beast of its own, and it took a completely different approach than the Quake-like FPSs so prevalent in those days. Delta Force: Xtreme, however, took this formula and turned it on its head.\n\nHere are some of my grievances:\n\n[list]\n[*]To start out with, you are limited to only choosing your primary and secondary weapons, and you have a very limited selection. Do you want to be a sniper? Here, have a selection of ONE sniper rifle. The extensive customization of your loadout is completely absent from Xtreme.\n\n[*]Drivable vehicles are in the game now, which seems like a nice idea. However, the controls are extremely floaty, making the vehicles very difficult to control.\n\n[*]The entire experience does not feel realistic at all. You can take multiple shots before dying, and you can pick up ammo packs and health in buildings. If you die, you respawn where you started with your mission progress saved, making you trek all the way back to your objective. This is especially egregious when you die and you're meant to use a vehicle to get to your objective. The game doesn't respawn a vehicle for you to drive, making you go in on foot. I wouldn't mind the respawn mechanic if it was actually complete.\n\n[*]This is a small thing, but it still irks me. In older Delta Force games, I had a habit of keeping the objectives list open, as it was small and it neatly fit into the corner. The objective list in Xtreme is needlessly gigantic, and leaving it open obstructs your vision.\n\n[*]The price for a title of this quality is extremely high. I would expect to pay a maximum of $10 for this, especially considering how old it is. It is twice that price. There are more recent, higher quality games for the same price.\n[/list]\n\nTo conclude, this game should only be bought if you [i]really[/i] want to own all of the Delta Force games, and [i]only[/i] if it is heavily discounted. Look elsewhere for your military FPS needs."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1455251467, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500660", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "21143547", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198033603362", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1498802226, "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6358}, "timestamp_updated": 1455251467, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The classic FPS game that is multiplayer.  \n\nstrategy is required in most Multiplayer maps.  they are not simply a RNG map.\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1468175166, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "24237301", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198043108500", "num_reviews": 162, "last_played": 1468174972, "num_games_owned": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 235}, "timestamp_updated": 1468175166, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Well its more or less of a reboot to the original Delta Force but theres something I noticed thats missing.
