What an absolute steal! Seriously, it's worth full price.\n\nThis game is not like Football Manager. It is not attempting to be Football Manager. It's more like a business simulation whose central product is Football. Its name doesn't do it any favors - it makes it sound like a cheap FM knockoff and gives new players the wrong idea. It should be called Club Chairman or something of that nature.\n\nYou generally don't get attached to players - they're a commodity. Everything you do, you're thinking about the return on investment. Winning with a small or no profit is not as good (at least in the early phases of the game) as being mediocre and investing the money you save. You can't get fired... the only way to lose is bankruptcy (which can creep up on you if you're not careful. \n\nMy one knock is that the English isn't very good at times in this game, but it's easy enough to figure out what to do. Also you can only play as a German team. Do they actually have a championship there called the 'D-Cup'? hehehe\n\nAnyway this is a light, very fun, sports oriented business sim. Nothing more, nothing less. If you like businessy or trade sims and like sports, this game is fantastic.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496036161, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496036161, "recommendationid": "32035593", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506990", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 8}}
