This means that the strategy of the game comes more from character choice, equipment, and tactics rather than making different character builds by leveling up stats and abilities.  The old board games had static level-ups for each character that could not be altered, the choice was who you took and leveled up, not how you leveled them.  \n\nThat is reflected in how this game plays out and, with the deluxe version, you have a fair cast of characters to select from.  Plus there is the ability to delete characters from your roster and have new ones take their place, but you have to level the character up at least one level to do so which can be a pain (because you are probably just deleting the character because he was too hard to level up in the first place).  Characters gain exp based off of how many kills they had in a dungeon run (with no exp gained if they died), so if a character has a low hit rate and can't kill enemies, they are prevented from leveling and improving their hit rate.\n\nBut, these old board games were designed to make it hard for a party to finish the adventure.  These were co-op games (maybe playing against a GM), and what fun is a board game if you are going to win every time?  That difficulty is reflected in the game with frequent misses and large hordes of monsters that can quickly overwhelm your party.  This isn't poor video game design, but a mechanic imposed by the board game so that each adventure wasn't just a walk in the park.  As this game is recreating that board game experience, so too does it recreate the high chance of failure.\n\nStill, I wish they would have added a die roll for attacks and such (just a little die shaped icon with a number popping up would have sufficed) so that I know what my chances are for hitting enemies with each character.  Maybe they are underpowered for that enemy type, or maybe they just had bad luck.  Without some indication of the math that is going on, it makes it harder to choose targets and attack types with the different characters in my party.\n\nAs far as the in-game purchases go (I'm always against those), I say only buy the deluxe version.  The content is priced way too high and should have been included with the base game.  And you should probably wait for a good sale on the deluxe version at that.\n\nAll in all, the production of this game is quite nice with animations for the towns, beautiful artwork and music, and fluid dungeon battles.  Even the quests are presented with short story texts just as they had been in the board game versions.  If you are looking for an immersive game that has that old adventure board game feel, this is a nice ambiant recreation of that experience.  If, however, you are looking for a more straight forward, turn-based, strategy video game this may be a little too oldschool for your tastes.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500753961, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500770573, "recommendationid": "33728739", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527558", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501665672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 127, "steamid": "76561198019988173", "num_games_owned": 368}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Do you like DnD style rpg's or board games?

Some of the interface options had to be changed around (there's the \"how do I get the inventory? On the tablet I rotate it...\").

If you do buy it, you're going to go \"ug, touch interface, don't recommend, give me a refund\".\n\nGetting past that, its a good dungeon crawl game.  With the extra content (buy it a steep discount sale), its a good game that you won't be looking at the \"$2.99 for a new character?!\" screen and delete it out of spite.
