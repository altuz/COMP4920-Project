One of the better classic games still sitting on steam. I would recommend the game to anyone looking for a cheap single player campaign to run through. It's certainly fun and worth playing just for that.\n\nBy now the multiplayer aspect of the game is either dead or shut down so I'm confident you won't get any action there. However, if you can strike up a group that wants to  play and try the game out than it's worth it. I'd recommend the game only if you can find it on sale and have a group that wants to try it out for a weekend.\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505820557, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502279", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35062515", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198268537934", "num_reviews": 44, "last_played": 1505801588, "num_games_owned": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4098}, "timestamp_updated": 1505820557, "received_for_free": false, "review": "There's nothing like the initial shock.\n\nThis is my first played Delta Force series game.
