In the screenshots it looked as if there were some convincing recreations of classics like the '59 Fairlane, '61 Thunderbird and first generation Corvette. The last time I can recall a notable racing game focusing on this subject was EA's shortlived MMO \"Motor City Online\" back in 2001 which only survived a couple of years before the servers were shut down. \n\nSo what do you get for your money with this game? Well, not a lot really. The cars, it seems, have not been officially licenced, so although they look convincingly enough like the real things, the names of their manufacturers have been changed. However, their actual model names are in many cases preserved. For example, there is a '53 Chevy 210 which is actually called a '53 210 but supposedly built by \"Oceanic\". There is a '53 Cadillac Eldorado called a '53 Eldorado but by \"Belvedere\". The models have Chevrolet and Cadillac badges, respectively, and have \"Chevrolet\" and \"Eldorado\" lettering, respectively. Perhaps it costs big bucks to actually use the manufacturers' names in a game, even when the vehicles depicted are sixty years old. So maybe we should not be too hard on the developer about this. What we can be hard on them for is the rest of the game. \n\nThe actual gameplay itself is not very interesting. The driving challenges are rather boring, the AI of the drivers you race against is horrific and the game is beset by bugs. There are fewer now than at launch, owing to a patch, but others remain. The developer stopped engaging on the community hub after releasing the patch, so it looks like those bugs are here to stay. The aforementioned car models are quite pretty, but the car handling physics are awful and you might be stopped in gameplay by invisible objects on the road.\n\nYour AI competitors can collide with each other and with you, and you can collide with AI traffic. However, the AI competitors do not appear to have any sort of collision detection with traffic and just drive straight through it. The AI cars get a headstart over you in each race, with you always lagging behind to start but, then again, they also find it difficult driving down a straight road without spinning off.\n\nThere is a progression system, where you gain levels by earning points for winning races and for \"style\" by doing things like overtaking, driving closely behind a competitor (called \"slipstream\", but why bother with this acheivement?), cornering \"perfectly\" (although you can be awarded this even for massive imperfections), \"drifting\", and \"speed threshold\". The progression seems capped at the end of level 10 (i.e. you do not progress on to 11, although it is apparent that you are supposed to be able). However, thereafter you continue to get the end-of-level-10 rewards after earning even a single point in any race, which include a special vehicle. I have now more than twenty such vehicles in my \"garage\". This would not be so bad, if there was a facility in the game to sell these cars, but there is not, so I keep accruing them. The car awarded is a \"1936 Emperor\", which itself has a rather buggy 3D model and which is at odds with the quality of the other vehicle models. It looks as though its suspension has collapsed, and it has wheel hubs appearing lower than the wheel centres when you change the rims.\n\nThe biggest let down for me was the customization of the vehicles. Vehicles are presented as having four different performance characteristics: \"Acceleration\", \"Speed\", \"Handling\" and \"Grip\". Each one is awarded a percentage. There are eight ways to increase the performance of each vehicle: \"Carburetor\", \"Supercharger\", \"Engine\", \"Torsion Bars\", \"Transmissions\" [sic], \"Suspensions\" [sic], \"Brakes\" and \"Tires\". Each component you can change has three levels of improvement over stock. \"Carburetor\" and \"Engine\" improvements affect \"Speed\", but not \"Acceleration\" (who knows why). \"Brakes\" improvements affect \"Grip\" but not \"Handling\" (again, don't ask me why). This is too simplistic to be in any way interesting, and pales in comparison to the customization options in Motor City Online more than a decade ago (which were not perfect by any means).\n\nThere are also visual customization options: each car has available four each of \"Front Bumper\", \"Rear Bumper\", \"Side Skirts\", \"Hood\" and \"Muffler\". Changes cost in-game money earned in races, but for some reason have escalating prices, despite not offering a performance benefit, and the most expensive part not necessarily being the best looking. Some of the changes, like \"Side Skirts\" are too all-encompassing. This option also changes the front and rear fenders and door panels, and is available regardless of whether the car model you are modifying actually has side skirts or not. It would be better if you could change aspects, like the front and rear fenders seperately, or the front bumper without changing the grille, for greater customization. You cannot chop the roof of your '49 Merc (or '49 Belvedere Bonanza, as it is known in the game), or lower its suspension. You can change the paint, but the range of paints is not very pleasing, and some body panels are frustratingly unpaintable if the car has a two-tone trim, which is quite common.\n\nThere are options to change the wheels and tyres (called \"Rims\" in the game, seemingly an anachronism), but this does not always work, despite the fact that a lot of wheels have been unlocked, they just cannot be selected. Some of the wheel models are broken or missing, so when you do select them the car's wheelrims disappear or they appear incorrectly.\n\nThere is no drag racing. There is no option to just drive. There is no damage modelling. There is no dashboard camera, views being restricted to either the front bumper or a chase view. When you change the speedometer reading to miles an hour (instead of the default kilometres an hour, in a game set in 1950s America!), the distances remain given in metres. The music is a few tracks of boogie woogie instrumentals. Derivative modern compositions, obviously, and nothing faithfully from the era. These are played repetitively and there seems to be one track for the main menu, one for driving in game, one for finishing a race and looking at the score board, etcetera. At first I thought the music was by default a bit too loud, but when I turned it down to hear the dreadful sound of the engines I was glad for it. The engine noises are another major disappointment. The engines sound more like four-cylinder Datsuns than American V8s in this game. The only exception, so far as I can tell, is the Corvette, which does actually have a V8 sound.\n\nThis would not be such a bad game if it was available at a much lower price. The full price as of this writing is \u00a314.99. This is what I would call a premium price range and this is a long way short of being a premium game. I have had plenty of better games through Steam for a lot less money.\n\nTo cut a long review short, I would not recommend buying this game unless, like me, you must have virtual representations of classic American vehicles on your computer which you can race, albeit in a limited fashion. [13/12/2014: In light of a patch, I have re-written parts of this review. The game is, however, still in a broken state owing to the level cap bug and its awarding you the same car again and again which the patch did not address.][07/04/2015: The devs implied that the patch released in December of 2014 was only the first, but it now looks like it was also the last. Game abandoned by developer maybe?

The game definitely pushes all my nostalgic [i]Street Rod[/i] buttons.  Can't wait to build up a garage of custom classics!   You definitely need brakes to take corners, so it's not 100% arcade racer.\n\nThe Bad:  Music is loud and repetative (volume seems to reset after races).  Controls are awkward to set (prelaunch menu w/o labels) and default setup is strange (shoulder buttons for manual shift).  Sound effects are mediocre, definitely missing the rumble of leaded fueled V-8s (in the early game, anyway).  AI opponents clip through NPC traffic but you do not (!!!).  \"Drifting\" was called \"powersliding\" in the 60's.  ;)\n\nThe Ugly:  Being a Unity game, graphics settings are bare bones (resolution and low/med/high).  Cars do not shade when driving through tunnels.  Controller vibration does not work with 360 controller, so there is very little feedback or road feel compared to other racers.  Only two camera views (bumper and 3d person), but camera controls (left stick for pan, Y for look back) are sufficient.  No car damage.\n\nBottom line:  Yeah, pick it up.  Play it a weekend.

I usually try to find the positive in any game I play. This game has the potential to be a good, decent budget racing game but with the current problems it has at the moment keep it from being that. First off its a simulation game that thinks its a arcade racer at times. I played this with a PC controller that\u2019s shaped like a Xbox controller and a wired Xbox One controller. And with both controllers the steering is a little too sensitive at low speed. Even with a car fully upgraded its still real sensitive. No matter which car it was it would want to run off the road with just a slight push. Speaking of off road, when did dirt and grass feels like driving on ice? The road itself the game is fine. But once you go off-road, it feels like you're taking your car with street tires onto a frozen lake. There\u2019s absolutely no traction at all once you're off the road. Even with one of the tracks having what looks like short cuts, they offer no traction at all. So its best just to stay to the road. The AI in this game are as smart as a box of rocks. Starting with the first race all the way to the end, the AI makes some REALLY dumb mistakes. Almost all the time one of the 3 AI in a race will just swerve itself into a wreck and the other 2 will wreck each other while you cruise to a win. This happens in all the Sprint, Race, Knockout, and Escape. And don't expect the AI get wreck by the cars on the track. They just drive through every single one that isn't a race AI or you. But don't expect yourself to run through them because most of the time if you even tap a car, it would almost put you in a dead stop. That\u2019s right, you can be doing 160 and tap a car and you're down to 0. As for the race types, you have the 4 I have mention, you also have Stunt Trial (which appears 1 time) and Lap Record (Time Trial). So you have a good set of race types for the 5 levels in the game. For each level you have 4 races you have to do but you have to complete 4 objectives to compete against the boss of the level. So for the 5 level its rinse and repeat 5 times. And for the simulation part, you have a level system that gives you \"upgrades\" to nitro and special cars. I never noticed any nitro upgrades and the special cars are nice till you hit the level 10 bug. Then you will get the level 10 car over and over and over after every race. And with no option to sell cars in the game, you are stuck with a lot of the level 10 cars. The game is imbalance in a way that I took the first car you get, upgraded all the way, and won races all the way up to level 5. They game isn't worth the price they want for it in its current state. But with some work and some spit shine, this could become a decent budget racer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451352908, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451352908, "recommendationid": "20053027", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519331", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1416722083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 164, "steamid": "76561198007164263", "num_games_owned": 359}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Initial look is that this is a good fun game. Very simple graphics and simple game play put together to give a fun game. There is similarities to the very old Street Rod game and this is actually the reason why I purchased the game in the first place.\n\nAfter playing for a few hours you get tired of the glitching graphical bugs, the game possibility of a game breaking bug that gives you a negative 214,000,000 points for a progression acheivement. And of course putting all that behind to realise that not only is the game very very short (3 to 4 hours repetitive game play, but it is impossible to complete. There is a race map with a graphical glitch where you cannot see the road or ground at all. And of course the game will not let you progress until you place in the race without ground.\n\nAlso a note on the full controler support. This game was built around a controler so much so all the menu options are \"A\", \"B\" or \"X\" with each not actually corrisponding to actual keyboard keys. I would be shocked is this game was not a direct port (cheeply done) from a games console. You do NOT neet a Joystick or Game Pad to use the game at all. You just need to use the force to find where the keys are.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis is not a Need for Speed, but an old school racing game with some very cool cars to play with.

Prior to purchase I read all the negative reviews, so I was wary, but \nI decided to give it a chance, for the sake of the Fifties cars.. First off I must say that this game is loaded\n with glitches and bugs. Every error you've read in any review is true. I've had the game freeze, my car fall \nthrough the map etc. Never the less I managed to get gold in all events and unlock all achievments. \nSince the game doesn't come with an instruction manual, this causes some issue for some who play it. I personally recommend you own an xbox controller if you want to play this game. To stop the annoying music you must turn it down in options then press 'A' to save it. To drive the cars in the game .. and win, you must be very carefull when driving through water, or dirt. This will cause your car to lose traction. Your car comes with nitrous, which you activate via the \"a\" button. To build up your nitrous meter, you must get driver achievments during the game like drifting, which you activate by pressing the'B' button for emergency brake. \n\nThe most difficult track is Keegsquaw peaks 'Spring water laguna' . It's extremely difficult to get through this track, \nwhich you need to do to progress. It's likely the game makers intended this to be a dirt track, as any car\nbehaves terribly on the surface. This map is also likely resourcce intensive for the game engine, and the car wanders left and right continuously . To get past this level, you need to buy the right car, with the right handling upgrades.. and drive the aoppropriate speed in the right areas. I also  lowered the game graphics quality to the lowest level, to stop the frame twitch.\n\nMy main dissapointment was from the advertisement clips on youtube for the game say \"25 sixties cars\" .. well, there are only 15 game cars you can drive in this game. I was looking forward to driving the 1956 chevy which, is pictured on the website, and in the game. But the car was cut from the game ansd replaced with a 1949, merc, and given some generic name. This car was likely cut from the game by the developers, in addition to wheel selection, likely because these game elements were causing game bugs.\nThe Ai is so terrible that the game becomes unintentionnally funny, as the cars continuously drive into each other.

But you know I think I I might of been too harsh. So here is my new review of the game, if you can even call it that.\n\nIf you asked me to sum up Motorama in a few short words it would be. S h i t heap of broken physics and gameplay.\n\nWell Motorama seemed like a very good game on paper but now that they have made it this game should have been thrown in the bin and set fire too as soon as it was thought up. The games physics are just outright broken and glitched. The other racers have a tendency to just give up and sit the rest of the race out and let you do endless laps because the race never ends. This game was so shit I decided to contacte the devs for a refund but no. They said that they couldn't do that as Steam had taken variosue taxes from it. But these guys couldn't just send me the \u00a312 I spent on this game straight to my visa account. Ahhhhh. Customer satisfaction seems really to be key with these guys.\n\nIt was like they don't even care about the game and that they have released it. \n\nLead Game Developer: \"DONE! Job done guys we can all go get wasted even more now then whilst we were making the game. GG guys GG\" Thats what I can imagie was going through thier heads when they released this pile of horse poo.\n\nI refuse to buy anything from this developer for quite a while. I mean they are used to making 2D platformers but I guess this was just to big for them.\n\nNever again.
