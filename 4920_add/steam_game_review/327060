The art style is striking (even if the silhouette style is a bit overdone now) and the animation is fantastic. FEIST is an atmospheric physics based puzzle-platformer that draws you in with clever puzzles, avoiding traps, and pitting forest creatures against one another.\n\n...and then about halfway through all of that goes out the window and it's replaced with frustration, cheap deaths, and fiddly physics puzzles. I get what FEIST was going for but for such a short game (which speedrunners will probably love) too much of it feels like it's down to chance and I just plain hated a good deal of the later puzzles and levels. The final boss is sort of fun but overall FEIST left me with a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nPick it up if you like games akin to Limbo and Inside and have a tolerance for difficulty with a tinge of unfairness. Skip it if you can't deal with frustration or you want a deep or long experience.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493862627, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493862627, "recommendationid": "31534139", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527016", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498497982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 243, "steamid": "76561198179488025", "num_games_owned": 584}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Basically Dark Souls if it was indie platformer game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497398999, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497398999, "recommendationid": "32400533", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504109", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 124, "total_reviews": 169, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 45}}
