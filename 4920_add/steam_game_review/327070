I will say it defiantly needs some work, with combat and a tone of bugs. Though with combat, if you take you're time with it, it actually works.. For example, blocking.. After striking an enemy (Only twice) prepare for a block and wait a second or two after the block (They will attack within that time) then proceed with the attack asap. \nAlso there's bugs everywhere, but most are avoidable (Thank goodness) for example jumping over some fences tend to f#$k you up.. So, just take your time running around them. \n\nBut what i love about the game is well, it's medieval and it does it really really well in most cases.. I love the normal MMORPG style, going quest to quest, doing side-quest and doing anywhere, fighting anyone, anytime.. (Though it's odd fighting one guy and another just watches until you hit them (That's the mmorpg thing, remember!)  \n\nAnother few things i love, but yet to attend (Because i'm only low level as of now) is the faction bases PvP, PvP area, The big amount of gear/loot, farming and so forth. \nAlso i suggest the developers add horses to the game because it's a huge open world and sometimes feels tedious just running to places far away. \n\nI do suggest the game, it's defiantly something with an original concept and extremely fun! \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505241025, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505241025, "recommendationid": "34906245", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500788", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507056062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 56, "steamid": "76561198430228994", "num_games_owned": 1}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Might be a bit rought by the edges at first but enjoying it actually. \n\nNot many people on lower levels but what I have heard its designed to work even without a big community on endgame, will edit my comment when I will reach there!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507055825, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507055825, "recommendationid": "35453928", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506863702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 629, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 629, "steamid": "76561198052376424", "num_games_owned": 55}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Yes, it's raw, but it is already nice to play.

Using a bow is ok, damage/accuracy/terrain management is nothing smart  like in MnB (boom!!!head shot from the top of the hill!!! ahahah!!!). \nthe npc s from what i ve seen (lvl8-10) are complete meat bag waiting to be butchered and loot.
