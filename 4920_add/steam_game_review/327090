I spawned on the beach, saw a house went to check it out, got stuck. Write in the chat for help, devs come help me asap and I get invited to some epic boat event they were hosting on the server. All players got a boat with cannons and went out together to try out the boats. 10/10\nExcept that its a very good game alot of fun to do and everything goes alot quicker than regualar survival games. I had alot of fun with other players and alone, there are so much to do!

I have 2 ARK accounts with well over 4k hours between them and left ARK some time ago when they introduced Power Armor and Lasers and all that bunk. I was looking for something not so crazy and unbalanced as ARK and discovered this game on sale for $7.50 and thought, what the heck, let's try it out. The idea of being a pirate and having a ship with cannons seemed to appeal to me. My 7 hours of initial play were on an official Standard server called Timberfrost or something like that. Ping was around 53. My computer is about 5 years old with a GTX 670 Ti Video card and on high graphics I am getting a consistant 43 FPS. The graphics are nice, not too shabby at all, reminds me of ARK so they are probably using the same engine. \nYou wake up with a broken ship's rudder as your weapon/tool. Do the basic collect this and that, while you are guided by a tutorial questline that teaches you the basics and advanced elements of the game. Learn to hunt, go into caves for metal, yada yada. I was in a cave and came across some poor smuck and killed him for all his booty. I'm a pirate after all! 600 copper and 100 tin he donated to me, after which he logged out and probably rage quit. Sorry bud! I'm not really much of a PKer but what the heck. I built a little wooden base and logged out after 5 hours to take a short break. Upon logging back in about 30 minutes later, I heard a knock-knock, knocking of my door. Seems someone was trying to bash their way in. I patiently awaited on the other side of the door and after a couple more swings, he was in. Or rather he tried to get in because at that moment I leapt upon him and whacked, smacked, and cracked him with my bronze axe. Down he went... and he was only able to hit me once. Boy he had lots of loot on him, including a steel axe, some seige bolts, and a flintlock pistol with 10 bullets, along with some pirate armor. Oh Boy! I repaired the damage he did to the house, fortified it, and then moved away, knowing he would come back eventually when I was offline. Now he can waste his time bashing down the 20 doors and extra walls I placed just to find nothing. \nSo I'm having fun... and this is what playing a game is about. Heck I would pay full price for this at $15 but at $7.50 it's a steal. I haven't noticed any bugs in my short time. Sure it's a slowly evolving game but all the elements are there for you to enjoy. The server population might not be the greatest but so far I'm content with not running over a bunch of other players all the time. Anyway, if you buy the game, come to Timberfrost and look up Jadeheart.

Most of the time, the game time is used to gather resources and craft/build stuff - like a house, a small port for your pirate ship, armor and different weapons. Exploring the map and the Islands with the pirate ship is fun. \nImprovements should be done in the building function (a lot of places it is impossible to build, which is very annoying) and the functionality: be able to sell (not only buy) to the big pirate ship? different pirate ships? build your own? more damage to buildings when using weapons on it? (as it is now, it is impossible to destroy the different pirate bases around on the Islands), possible to take over a pirate base? A \"Kraken\" in the ocean? Possibility to meet angry pirates while traveling around in the ocean? Just some ideas.\n\nAnyway, it's already a great game that I want to play all the time. Very addictive.
