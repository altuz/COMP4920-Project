If you are looking for a hardcore f-16 sim then this is not for you, try Falcon 4.0 instead. If you are looking to shoot down 20 to 30 enemies in one mission then this is not for you, try Ace Combat or HAWX. If you are looking for something in between those two ends of the spectrum then this is for you.  There is a learning curve to the game, but it would not take more than a few training missions for most to jump into the campign. There are a few bugs to the game, but nothing major that detracks from the fun."}, {"votes_down": 19, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1497553121, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459116", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32448771", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198043693378", "num_reviews": 225, "last_played": 1488400656, "num_games_owned": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1497553121, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not for me."}]}
