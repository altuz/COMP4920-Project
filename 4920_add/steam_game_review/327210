Game prompts you to plug it in. Game has low production values, and the flash game grade audiovisuals made me very biaised against it. However it puts everything it has to put together an over the top save the princess narrative full of derpy looking characters, and did so with enough charm to get a passing grade on that. Mechanically it is a very simple to grasp platformer, you jump on a planet, rotate around it until you are in reach of another planet then jump on that, gather foodstuff and exit level. Each planet reacts differently and there are a few critters here and there to mess with you. Planets and critters have a lot of character as well and trippy looking. Some of the music segments looped too much and started irritating me and making me unable to enjoy levels. However once I beat the level the sound clip was changed to something different. Dont know how much variety there is in total but I suspect there is a chance that you would have to turn music off at some point. The game is suprisingly difficult, you constantly have to keep track of if you are up or down as this reverses your directional arrows, and there are a lot of hazards to kill you. You respawn fast and there are no lives limits. There are basically necessary items which must be collected in order, which are little crystal looking things, and cakes which are bonuses. There is often only one way to gather all the crystals in order and it takes a bit of trial and error to explore and engineer the correct way to get those and that does hurt the flow of the game and becomes a little bit of a chore. All in all it is hard to tell if this title has enough staying power to earn a permanent place in your library. I will have to say that it is too rough\n\nSummary:\nPros:\n+Derpy, has character\n+Xbox 360 controls\n+Easy to mentally grasp but hard to fully master level navigation\n\nCons:\n-Getting items to end level can get tedious\n-Audiovisually cheap\n-Trial and error in level exploration, cannot see full level using a button or by zooming out or anything", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495773250, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505094904, "recommendationid": "31965104", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
