It is consitent with quality visuals, and sound. It has witty and cute humor, that seems appropriate for all ages, with some 'wink' jokes for the older crowd. The best aspect is probably the story, especially the side characters and story elements which are reimaginings of classic fairy tales. The puzzles are mostly reasonable, not too challenging, a bit on the easy side with a couple head scratchers. I would say it is of medium length for an adventure game, maybe 10-15 hours, or faster if you follow a guide. I can't place it high on my list, but it is a solid entry in the point and click genre, and worth a play to any fan. I additionally recomend it as a game to play with your child. However, be prepared to do some explaining and console them at the ending. The final act and ending is a major positive to the game, and also in a way the major negative of the game. It reveals a dramatic twist to the story which I won't tell you, which is quite insteresting (perhaps a bit cliched, but it comes together quite nicely), however it disrupts the flow of the game due to the major contrast so late in the game and the length of the segment. In addition *SPOILER* the game sort of hints at it leading up to a disney esque fairy tale ending, and then it abruptly ends with the brothers grimm version *SPOILER* All in all, I give it a B+", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502658213, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502660621, "recommendationid": "34222747", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515467", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500285806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 453, "steamid": "76561198089627947", "num_games_owned": 117}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Straight to the PROS and CONS\n\nPros\n____\n1) Instant-likable protagonist (Unlike Deponia's Rufus)\n2) Cheesy and hilarious text and voice acting (Needle in the haystack was on point)\n3) Most of the time, the puzzles are straight to the point. (Only tough ones are the bear cages and piano keys)\n4) Nice voice acting and soundtrack and AFK animations\n\nCons\n____\n1) Some of the challenges are just impossible to get through unless you randomly got it or go through the walkthrough (eg : Swan Prince and Bear Cage)\n2) Sometime in the story, Anna can be a little funny.. Naive as she may be. She doesn't seem to be yor average Jean Gray. Her telekinesis can be useless in many parts where it seem possible to do so.\n\nThe cons can be easily ignored as they dont really break the game, just that it can improve on those points. Also, I see many complaining about the game, giving it negative reviews because of the Grandpop's attitude and overprotective'ness.. Christ sake, the outside world took Anna's dad and mom.. Play the prologue before ya';ll review.\n\ni'd give a solid 9.5/10 as this is one of the rarer nice point and click straight to the point games. will play it again to get perfect achievements. Still, I dont think its worth $20. get it at half price maybe..

While that is technically true, leading your game description with that phrase does this game a huge disservice.

This dark fairy tale requires you to listen, observe, and solve problems. Each level includes a variety of elements and tools you must use to solve the puzzles placed before you, but the answers aren't always as easy as you may think and require clever choices. For example, in one area you must get a key from a rat, and your options to do so are limited. The answer involves tricking the rat into giving up the key, but how you do it is up to you. Many of the solutions are tricky and can take some time to figure out, so younger players may become frustrated.\n\nThe game has ghosts, witches, kidnapping, and other dark themes the animation is beautiful and drew me in quickly while the story unfolds like a movie as Anna proves she has the power to overcome evil to return to her grandfather.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500580617, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500580617, "recommendationid": "33679997", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503505", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 126, "total_reviews": 141, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 15}}
