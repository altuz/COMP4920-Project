PLEASE...) And there's not much innovation as the levels go on (and what little abilities DO Get introduced are rarely used throughout the game) which makes the gameplay stale after a while...\n\nPerhaps my biggest complaint is how punishing it is when you die. If you spent like 2-Minutes going around collecting Diamond things and get killed (and there are A LOT of insta-kill obstacles, as if only having 2 HP and only One Health Pick-Up IN THE ENTIRE GAME wasn't bad enough...) Anyway, if you die, you have to start ALL THE WAY BACK at the beginning of the level as all of the collectibles mandatory for finishing the Level Respawn. If Pac-Man respawned all of the Pellets you have to collect after Dying JUST ONE TIME, I'm pretty sure that game wouldn't be fun for too long either...\n\nMy recommendation for fixing this error would be the ability to continue your progress in a level. Say for example: Give a player 3-5 Lives, and if they lose all of them before completing the level, THEN Respawn all of the Diamonds and Stuffs!\n\nHonestly, I'd like to see a possible sequel to this game, as there is SOME level of talent and competence in the people who made it and there's a lot of potential with this kind of material (despite my frustration with this game, I'd still be interested in seeing levels for the Neo Geo, Turbografx-16/PC Engine, Game Boy Advance, Possibly even 5th Generation Consoles, or... Dare I say it... Retro-Like Indie Games from the 2000s and the 2010s!)\n\nBut unless they fix up the issue with Collectible Progress (preferably by taking the suggestion I made eariler) and maybe fix a few Glitches I noticed while playing through this, I wouldn't recommend the game unless you're REEEEAAAALLLY interested in the concept...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499657250, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499657250, "recommendationid": "33421207", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 76, "total_reviews": 104, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 28}}
