You go on adventures to grow in rank through your starting country while looting gold, stealing cargo and ships, attacking a town, and more. I found looting to be very satisfying. Part of the reason it's so addictive is it takes work to earn gold, everything you do is risky meaning you could easily screw up and lose everything you have, but this fact makes me want to keep at it to see how much I can get before I lose. Another positive about the game is the variation. You will sail across the sea one moment, and sword fight the next. \n\nYou will also fire at ships and attempt to board them, a similar mechanic has you attacking towns and i'm not a fan of this. The idea is using the wind to dodge shots from forts and get to land. But the wind changes at random. The idea is to leave if the wind isn't in your favor, but leaving can be just as hard which has got me killed. The graphics and sound design get the job done for a dosgame, though I found my crew yelling YO-HO-HO when they see a ship to be really annoying. Those are my biggest issues with the game. Now the steam version does have issues, it ran very slow to the point of being unplayable. You need to mess with the cycles in the config to fix this.\n\nThis was a nice suprise. While not perfect, I personally had a blast. It was addictive and fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504536985, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504537000, "recommendationid": "34736522", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 6}}
