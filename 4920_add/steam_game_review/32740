All Novalogic flight sims are excellent. Still, there are a lot of keys to remember in order to master this. However you can get by using only the suggested keys in the tutorials. Not too complex as Falcon 4.0 or Janes F-15 in which both require the use of a joystick. I hate games that forces players to fork out additional money to use specialized hardware. I don't have time, nor money nor space for that so i KIV till last. I believe there's nothing those games can offer in which other games can do just as well with keyboard and mouse.\n\nGraphics still hold-up to this day but only support up to 1024 x 768 resolution. Tutorials are well made with excellent voice-overs; choice of English or Russian radio chatter. Aircrafts look good and sound realistic. Plenty of camera controls and views to keep an eye on what's around you.\n\nDefinitely a flight simulation but intermediate level, not arcade like the recent Jane's Advance Strike Fighters or HAWX or HAWX2 with their ridiculous weapons loadout and many other gameplay methods that cater only for fun and not realism. If i just want fun, there's tons of space combat with spinning balls in space. \n\n[b]Correction:[/b] My bad. [u]There's also a similar option here; it's called double loadout. That means that the Mig-29 can load twice as many weapons without any weight penalty. So that's like arcade or essentially cheating. Normally it can carry a pair on each pylon set, with double you can load 4 of each type of ordnance[/u]\n\nGameplay is similarly excellent because there are many tactical commands you can issue to your wingman. Here you need to learn to land not just shoot; an ace who can't land is just a joker right? \n\n[b]Correction again[/b] [u]My bad. Landing is optional for most missions. This applies to both Quick Missions and Campaign mode but if you opt to land, you get a higher score which carries over to the next mission and gets you faster promotion. I'm not sure if the landing score applies to Quick Missions and Multiplayer mode though. So far it doesn't seem to add to the score in Quick Missions.[/u] \n\n[b]Update Jan 8, 2017 0329hrs - About landing[/b]\nThe manual states that landing in Quick Missions can get your plane rearmed and repaired but in Campaign mode only rearmed. Well that was obviously outdated. Your plane gets instant repairs in Campaign mode too. A bit of cheating yes? Wait Wut? Manual? lemme see that. Hahaha some peeps just can't be bothered it seems.\n[b]end of update[/b]\n\nNot sure which sim came out first but of the 3 fixed-wing crafts in Machines of War, this one is based more on analog instruments, very retro, so i think i should complete this campaign first. Definitely a keeper since there aren't many new modern military sims in the market. \n\nIf you're even slightly serious about flying, you should give it a shot. Highly recommended 8/10.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kW3dVSqnp6M\n\n[b]Update 2 Jan 9 2017 0014hrs[/b]\nFinal mission of campaign 1. There are more campaigns but it has to be completed in sequence.\nhttps://youtu.be/EIO9ErMzxsA"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1420052087, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506071", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 6, "recommendationid": "13743491", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006566326", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1430003089, "num_games_owned": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1210}, "timestamp_updated": 1420052087, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[unzips MiG-29]"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1438131834, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501098", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "17274899", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197988512539", "num_reviews": 91, "last_played": 1437440062, "num_games_owned": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 16}, "timestamp_updated": 1438131834, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Chalk another one up for the simulators this one has you piloting the MIG-29 Fulcrum.

The graphical department are very similar to F-22. Controls are still as unintuitive as F-16 and F-22. No tutorial / training mode can be found in the game much like other Novalogic Fighter games. The gameplay is slow and bland/boring. Don't seek out this game for the multiplayer as it is quite dead! Maybe you could give it a shot in LAN but I haven't nor I am willing to give it a shot! Did this game improved at all from F-16 Multirole Fighter? Barely! The visuals are a tad better but that would be all.\n\nPROS:\n+Works on modern computers. Also, XBOX 360 gamepad is supported, but barely, like F-16 and F-22.\n+Improved visuals from F-16 but F-22 are slightly better looking.\n+Simulation seems adequate from what I played, cockpit is well modelized, just like previous F-16 and F-22.\n\nCONS:\n-Dated visuals, graphics compared to modern gaming.\n-Game doesn't completely support full screen as you see the window.\n-Controls aren't very intuitive. Same controls as F-16 and F-22.\n-No tutorial / training mode so you are left out figuring the controls for yourself.\n-Boring gameplay.\n-Poor audio (sounds and music).\n-While in-game, can't access the options menu nor view/edit the controls which that is quite unacceptable in my book.\n-Dead Multiplayer (to be expected though).\n\nOVERALL:\nWell, barely any improvement from F-16 and even F-22. I'm not sure how this game did back in 1998 but now in 2014, I prefer investing time on more modern games, as should you!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nSame as F-16 and F-22, I would recommend MiG-29 Fulcrum to flight simulation purists and gamers that dig old school gaming only. But in my book, you should stay away and look into modern games instead!\n\nAlso, since you cannot buy a single Novalogic classic and \"forced\" to buy the Novalogic Classics Volume One: Machines of War package, you better think twice before investing in this as I only found one game worth of purchase, Commanche 4. If you can find this package on a very good and drastic deal, give it a shot. Better, look somewhere else if you can buy a single game at a time.\n\nRATING:\n2.5 / 10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1497340607, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32383105", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198094678400", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1488474623, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 27}, "timestamp_updated": 1497340607, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Hard to control but is ok \ud83d\ude02"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500571902, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33676863", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198055017341", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1501777057, "num_games_owned": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 439}, "timestamp_updated": 1500571902, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game!
