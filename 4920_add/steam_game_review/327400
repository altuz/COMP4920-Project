I didn't grow up with dos games at all, so I never played anything this complex before, and it blew me away. You start as a small group trying to colonize a new country and to describe everything that can happen is...difficult. This has layers and layers of ways you can do this, but it starts with building an economy,working with natives(till they become hostal towards you), fighting other countries, devoloping trade routes,ect. It gets very dizzying and sometimes overwhelming. I could see some finding this too steep a learning curve honestly. \n\nBut if you stick it out you will be rewarded with a deep engrossing game that hooked me in for hours at a time. While the visuals and sound are dated, it doesn't hurt the experience for me. The only nickpick I have is combat is a little random, and although you can stack the odds in your favor, sometimes your attacks will just fail, then again, the same goes for the opponent.\n\nPoint is, I love it. And if your any kind of fan of strategy games I highly recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504537103, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504537103, "recommendationid": "34736571", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 117, "total_reviews": 129, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 12}}
