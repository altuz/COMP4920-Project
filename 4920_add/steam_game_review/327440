It's my own fault really, but I'm dissapointed. Looking at the screenshots, the game looks fairly good. Heck, it looks fantastic. I miss when games had such nice colours in them, and such visually enjoyable environments. Nowerdays, everything seems so dull in an effort to be more realistic.  Watching the trailer and seeing that you could pick up coins and stuff made it seem like this game would take some classic elements of videogames and that it could be a lot of fun. Sadly, even though I've only played through one full mission, I'm not seeing it.\n\nA bunch of people are probably already going to hit the thumbs down button on this review because it's negative, and they are fans of Avenged Sevenfold or something and can't accept the fact that they could be accociated with a bad product, but I am a fan of them as well. I'm not a hardcore fan of pretty much anything, but I enjoy their music, at least some of it. But you need to understand, I don't want to give this game a bad review, it's clear that effort went into this, as for how much though... I'm not sure.\n\nThe biggest problem, like it is most of the time, is just the gameplay. It's... well... there's nothing to it. Nothing to it at all. Do you like clicking the mouse button? Does that one thing alone make a game fun to you? Then I guess you might like this. But that's really all there is. There's no complex mechanics here for fighting. It's literally just pressing the left mouse button to swing your sword over and over, or the right mouse button to fire a quick magic spell. You can't even aim in this game, your mouse is used for clicking the buttons, and pressing \"next\" on the text boxes in the game. You do not, you CANNOT, actually aim with it. The mouse cursor is on the screen at all times as well, but that's not a big deal really. \n\nWhat is a big deal, is the fact that to actually hit an enemy, you need to walk towards it first. \n\nThis doesn't sound that bad, but when the only possible way to dodge attacks is to walk AWAY from enemies, this makes it practically impossible to avoid damage a lot of the time, unless you play the game as though you were a manual balloon pump, taking a single swing, moving backwards, and then moving in again to take another single swing, for however long it takes to kill a single enemy, which judging by the enemies in the first level, is about 5 seconds per enemy. With quite a decent number of enemies, combat becomes very boring, very quickly. If it was fun to kill enemies, this wouldn't be a problem. But it's not fun. There's hardly any feedback to your blows, and it just doesn't feel good smacking things around with your sword.\n\nWhy is it like this? Why is this game so utterly mind numbingly simple? Well, probably because this is a mobile port.\n\nYeah, a mobile port. Hopefully this made some of you turn away already, because you know how badly this usually ends up. Mobile ports of games don't really change the gameplay, and since they were made for mobile devices, they are generally VERY simplistic in terms of gameplay. Oh, and it used to have microtransactions, though those are not in here any more. Take that as you will.\n\nSo, what exactly does this game offer? It has fantastic visuals, that I can't deny, it has pretty good music from what I can tell, though not all of it really sounds like what Avenged Sevenfold would make. And the voice acting is... non existant. Punishment for death is pretty much non existant as well, as every time you die, you just respawn at a frequent checkpoint with no consequence. Seriously, not even more effort, as enemies do not respawn. Except for the bossses of course. And with no way to dodge attacks other then just... moving slowly... bosses can be somewhat annoying to a degree. As like I said before, you need to move towards an enemy to attack them, and cannot attack while dodging in pretty much any way.\n\nThe incredibly simple and obvious mobile port type gameplay is not something that can be overlooked, and leaves this as a very boring and occasionally frusterating game. It's a shame really. I did not have high hopes for this, but it looked good from the screenshots. It ends up being more of a chore than a fun game. If only it was a bit more complex, or at least made it fun to kill things, this could have been good... but alas, it is not.\n\nWant to keep updated on games I recommend? I'm a curator!

It's the exact same game in every way. There are no graphical options, the resolution defaults to your desktop resolution. The UI is still decidedly touch oriented, and gamepad support is lackluster requiring you to reach for the mouse every time a menu or pop-up box appears. You won't be playing this on your couch undisturbed. But it is a fairly smooth port that looks and runs about the same as its mobile counterpart. You won't be impressed, nor will you be disappointed.\n\nFor those who have yet to play it and want to know what the fuss is all about, the answer is not much. Hail to the King: Deathbat claims to draw inspiration from games like Diablo and Legend of Zelda, yet it sheds some of the most enjoyable elements of those games. All that awaits you here is a linear hack and slash with one button to slash, one button to shoot magic and movement keys. That's it. Equipment is limited to a weapon and items are limited to barely more than health and magic potions. Most of the levels share a similar design, typically a dark gothic appearance and consist of decent textures slapped on low-poly models and maps. The games story is decidedly lackluster and the only time the games music gets good are when an instrumental version of Unholy Confessions plays during the boss battles. Outside of that, it's Psuedo-Retro sounding tunes with Arin occasionally bashing his drums over the top. Hardly a terrible soundtrack, but a waste of what could have been a memorable one. \n\nA rebuttal to the common prasing of the games difficulty: The game gives you five lifes and makes you restart the level should you lose them all. Aside from that, there's no other real consequence. The game isn't hard by any stretch of imagination and offers but a gentle slap of the wrist for repeated failures. \n\nAll things considered, the games price reflects the game itself.

The characters' quality is also on the low side, but this could be improved with an update.\n\nThe playable characters look kinda lame, ( I expected something that would reflect them like their live performance) Matt  looks by far the most amazing of the six playable characters.\n\nI would rate this a solid [b] 9 out of 10 [/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417812394, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1417812394, "recommendationid": "13242934", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499162", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430092027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 605, "steamid": "76561198040530105", "num_games_owned": 107}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is definitely NOT the \"sell-out\" to gamers that many people accuse it of being. Avenged Sevenfold, a fantastic Heavy Metal band composed of longtime gamers, decided that they wanted to write a love letter to the classic dungeon crawler RPG games they grew up playing. This is what [i] Hail To The King: Deathbat [/i] is.\nThe game was made to play and feel like the classic dungeon crawlers, like [i] Zelda, Diablo, [/i] etc. The graphics resemble those of the original Playstation, so some people may be disenchanted by the lack of graphical fidelity that today's gamers are used to. It's important to keep in mind that this look was done on purpose, and that it helps cement that fantastic retro feel. If you keep the right mindset, you might just be overwhelmed with nostalgia.\n\nEvery enemy requires a slightly different approach to defeat, the bosses especially. Beating this game is [b] not [/b] easy and will require the player to get a good grasp of the game mechanics and enemy patterns. This is one of the reasons that this game is such a great homage to the golden age of RPGs; no hand-holding. This game will kick your butt unless you really commit to playing it well.\nThe controls are simple: wasd to move, left click for melee, and right click for your ranged magic attack, which can be charged for a large special attack that varies with the weapon one uses. The controls may seem button-mashy at first- and they kinda are- but this is not as unpleasant as one might think, because it gives all the more reason to really work at mastering the gameplay.\n\nThe soundtrack is superb, and you'll have to play the game to appreciate it; not much I can say to do justice to an awesome band writing a video game soundtrack that melds 8-bit music with modern instruments perfectly. With every boss battle, a hit from the band's catalog will play in an instrumental version, accenting the change in dynamic and upping the energy for the intense showdowns.\n\nAll said, you don't have to be an Avenged Sevenfold fan to love this game. Try it. It's made for hardcore gamers and was created with the utmost love for the classics.
