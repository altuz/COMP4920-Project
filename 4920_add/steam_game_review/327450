If you enjoy the Reemus games then this is a must buy. If you are new to the Reemus series I suggest you play the games on Newgrounds before considering buying the game.

While being presented as a conventionally unattractive man with a conventionally unattractive job, overshadowed by his famous brother and being known for property damage, Reemus still has many genuine qualities and virtues, and a personality that is not entirely defined by his failures. Townspeople still makes jokes about him from time to time, but not every single line of their dialogue is an insult, and they are in fact mostly amicable towards him. He is not their hero, but is also not their scourge, he is just a guy that sometimes causes a bit of trouble.\n\nThis extends to the gameplay and puzzle solving as well. Reemus is not the brightest man and is impulsive and aggressive, but is also not completely clueless and can solve his problems with more than just luck. Solutions most the time involve finding items that can be identified as useful to solving the immediate problem, (instead of having to find an old boot so that you can throw it at an cat chasing a mouse so that when you later get captured by thugs the mouse can come and gnaw the ropes binding you) with Reemus and his sidekick Liam many times providing clues as to what their intentions and ideias are relating to the item. Both protagonists are active and play equal parts in solving their problems; even when Reemus seems to be acting lazy and is relaying on Liam to do the dirty work, as soon as he is given the opportunity he starts working as well and even risks his life doing so.\n\nLiam the purple bear, by the way, is great. I didn't expect his voice to be as deep as it is but I also appreciate him not having a gimmicky annoying voice. His relationship with Reemus is heartwarming, and contributes a lot to subvert his loser jerk adventure game protagonist archetype. (The moment when Reemus grinded a photo of Liam into a potion of trust will be guarded and treasured forever in my heart)\n\nThis is a very genuine game. Instead of being a barrage of meta-jokes and parodies of popular things it has its own world and sense of humor, focusing on its characters and their interactions. Even when the joke is \"Man, bacon sure does make everything better!\", at least it's not \"Here I go picking random items on the floor to solve some dumb puzzle, these adventure game writers sure are lazy people, am I right you guys?\" There are a few fourth-wall breaking jokes, but they are brief and unobtrusive. The world and humor derive from the creators' tastes and inspirations rather than a anvil-on-the-head postmodernist dump pandering to cynics, like so many adventure games were.\n\nThe art and animation is superb, and was the reason I started playing this series in the first place, back when it was still a series of flash games on Newgrounds/Kongregate. Colorful and unique, expressive and full of personality. \n\nAs for the voice-acting, while the recording quality of some of the actors leave a bit to be desired, the talent itself is pretty good. I didn't like it at first, and played the demo with the voice muted, but after buying the game I gave it a second chance knowing better what to expect and thought that it greatly enhanced the experience, and brought the game closer to the 90s/early 2000s adventure games it emulated. Save for a few of overacting characters (a Moth and a Bee in particular), I enjoyed all the voices. (after getting over the mic quality of some of them...)\n\nMaybe I just have been stumbling into too many bad, unintuitive and fourth-wall demolishing adventure games with unlikable protagonists, but this one was a gift from the heavens and rejuvenated my interest in the genre. Even when not compared to bad ones, It's a very good game, with a lot of care and love put into it, by very talented and imaginative people. It's funny, well produced and has its own unique charm. Very much recommended if you're a fan of adventure games.
