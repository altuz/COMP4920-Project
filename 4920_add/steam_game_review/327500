Reminds me of 'Every Extend Extra' (on the PSP), which shares similar traits despite being excuted quite differently.\n\nThere is a faily tough difficulty curve after the 1st two levels. Phew ... things get tough. However, 'getting better' never feels like it is out of reach.\n\nThe macro mode is also pretty good. Fleshes out the overall game a bit more, giving you a more rounded experience instead of just vertical-scrolling shooting.\n\nIt's simple; fun to play and watch; and overall atmosphere is pretty unique for this often over-saturated genre.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503079001, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503079181, "recommendationid": "34333517", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502410015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198016632416", "num_games_owned": 717}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a pretty bullet hell game.
