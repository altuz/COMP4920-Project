But if you're fine with that, then you may get some satisfaction with this game; otherwise don't bother, stick to Fallout and the likes. Now I spent 9 hours just to finish ONE cooler(which is like a vault in fallout) and felt greeeeeeeeeeeaaaaat satisfaction upon doing it. These are the basic mechanics of the game:\n\n- This is a rogue-lite so there's a permanent upgrade but you can only get the upgrade once you've completed a cooler\n- This is a permadeath but another character replaces the dead one(like in Rogue Legacy) but without any items\n- All items that were on the dead characters stay lost unless stored in a shared stash(like the Courier Mailbox or your Home)\n- You raid coolers which have multiple floors\n- All floors are randomly generated\n- A very high level enemy appears on every floor after a set amount of time if you quickly don't proceed to the next floor\n\nNow I find this game fun because there's always a sense of thrill whenever you raid coolers because there's always danger. There are also rewards that the player can benefit. But the main selling point for me was that this game makes you think, and it makes you think hard and fast.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502634798, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502634798, "recommendationid": "34215160", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505728", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502881587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1077, "steamid": "76561197972562830", "num_games_owned": 775}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "cute rogueish fps.

What more could you ask for?\nI don't really feel like going super in-depth with this review, but trust me when I say it's well worth $12.99.\nThe game pays homage to fallout in a great number of ways, and is primarily centered around vaults, or, \"Coolers\" in this case.  The lead developer (Mr. Podunkian) seems to be a very chill and open person when it comes to discussing development of the game with the community. He's very good at communicating current problems with the game, plans for future updates, as well as assorted development related mishaps and goings on that would typically be 'hush-hush' for most game developers.\n\nNot-so-long story even shorter, this game feels like it has more heart than fallout (or at the very least the more recent ones of the series) with just a bit extra to really draw you in.\n\nMy only real complaint would be that the game feels like it gets exponentially more difficult as you progress, in terms of enemy health, weapon damage, and ammo scarcity. Granted yeah I get that's just the difficulty of the game bearing its teeth, but in my opinion I feel like it could afford to be smoothed down just a bit, as I feel it would make the whole experience just 'that' much more fun.
