It has a great storyline as well. On the downside, it was a bit difficult to control the main character especially when lifting and rotating objects. The savepoints were also too spread out so I had to restart a whole scene which can be tedious. The drawbacks were tolerable though and would totally get the sequel if it was ever made.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502571096, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502571096, "recommendationid": "34199646", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468473582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 375, "steamid": "76561198098339227", "num_games_owned": 300}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I honestly loved this game. I had it on my wishlist for a year waiting for it to go on sale and when I finally got it, I cleared it in one sitting >.< :P it has a very unique and intereting world. I love that its got some puzzling with minor combat more so than actually going around killing everything. \nYou play as a kid who is trying to find her father, and end up learning so much more about the world in your adventures. I did beat it in about 6.5hrs and with the way it ended I am REALLY REALLY hoping for a Sequel! <3 PLEASE let their be a sequel lol.
