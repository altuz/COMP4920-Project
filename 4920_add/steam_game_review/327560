Pretty basic story but kept me engaged. Not enough content and not enough replayability for the price.\n\nThe game mechanics themselves were fairly repetitive - besides a little bit of inventory management and crafting ~5 item recipes and ~5 upgrades, there was only fetch quests running across the map trying not to get lost. I still enjoyed it to some extent because I love exploration.\n\nPlaying at a leisurely pace, completing all optional objectives, exploring as much as I could, and wandering back and forth for a half hour because I couldn't find the quest item because it was poorly described and difficult to see... It was still only a 3 hour game.\n\nUltimately, have to say I wouldn't recommend this because $17CAD for no more than 3 hours of repetitive gameplay with basically no replayability is just too expensive. If you ever run across this on sale for $5 or something, go for it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505453868, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505454143, "recommendationid": "34964812", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510231", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499903036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 219, "steamid": "76561197989290281", "num_games_owned": 1203}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "https://youtu.be/ODCG4oCyQPE\n\nThis game is a breath of fresh air. Pure adventure survival against the elements, no zombies, mutants or robots. Basically you are trapped on an arctic station, in the middle of a storm. As the storm gets worse, you need to find and fix items to survive and ultimatley escape. There is also limited crafting of items to aid your survival. \n\nGraphically it is pretty good, and the environments really feel isolated and bleak. Controls are smooth and the game is well put together. There is only a little voice acting but it is well done. \n\nThe only real issue is it is somewhat short, but there are several difficulty modes to up the challenge. Well worth the cost if you want a more pure adventure driven survival game. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506969314, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506969314, "recommendationid": "35425790", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500412", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505800597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 30, "steamid": "76561198251023714", "num_games_owned": 88}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a poor man's \"The Long Dark\".
