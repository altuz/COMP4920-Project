(areas feel the same, score is similar; few note changes; puzzles feel the same; you can tell which ones aren't ripped from Professor Layton because they're the ones that are boring/easy)\n[b]If you have played the Professor Layton games and you enjoy them, then I would advise that you don't buy this.[/b]\nThe puzzles are easy, and the game shows little innovation or changes to the game that it tries to immitate.\nNot only that but some of the puzzles are incompletable without the use of hints, purely because they were poorly thought out. For example, a few puzzles in the game require that you look at the puzzle description for the answer (i.e. the answer is  a sequence of letters in the puzzle description). This makes little sense to me; as all the information that you require to solve the puzzle should be given through clues (i.e a riddle provides you with all the clues to deduce the answer) or hidden in the puzzle area.\n\nFor \u00a33.49 I still feel that I purchased a game that could've been better, had the developer taken some more time to improve on Professor Layton instead of attempting to copy Professor Layton.\n\n3/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413550397, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1413550397, "recommendationid": "12523578", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543927", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494306783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1090, "steamid": "76561198040583605", "num_games_owned": 746}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A great little break from the majority of brainless gameplay you see in most games. \n\nThis game is made up of puzzles, which can range from incredibly easy, to game breaking (need of guides) hard. The music they've decided to use quickly becomes stale, which is easily corrected by using music players (ergo Spotify) with ambient tunes that help you think. I don't mind doing this but some people might.\n\nThere's not much going for the story other than finding Tery, and the plot quickly becomes more odd as the game progresses. However there were enough twists to keep me occupied, and it was only after I finished the game that I realised the the main character, 'May Stery', sounds like 'Mystery'. I'm that thick.\n\nThe main story has 100-somewhere main puzzles to completed, which excludes the 100 additional bonus puzzles, which I will probably never do. I am slow so most people will take half the time I did to finish the game. Many of the puzzles are similar to puzzles you already know, eg 'How do I move everyone across the river but I can't leave these people together because they don't like each other?' So you may know the answers to some puzzles off the bat.\n\nI haven't played many puzzle games before so I don't really know what to base this off.\n\nAlso, May's voice is adorable.\n\nAlso, FUCK THOSE RHYTHM PUZZLES, THEY ARE SO DIFFICULT", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413715208, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1413715208, "recommendationid": "12565778", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519008", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431800277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 618, "steamid": "76561198051304382", "num_games_owned": 468}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "As many of the other commenters have said, this is a game that aspires to be a Professor Layton game. Except, of course, there are a number of giant flaws that make the game completely unpalatable, unlike Professor Layton.\n\n1. Puzzles are rather easy for the first three chapters (\"Find the gigantic name scrawled on the wall and input it into the answer box.\") and suddenly spike up to \"lots of brute force required\"-difficulty (\"Which of these four hands of cards has the best chance of winning a game of Variant Poker?\") during the last chapter. It's as if the developers had no idea who their target audience would be, so they just mashed up a bunch of random puzzles and riddles and called it a game.\n\n2. Puzzles are ambiguously worded in many cases (The bug spray can't be \"next to\" the bugs? Is that \"orthogonally\" or \"orthogonally and diagonally\"?), thus making it impossible to determine which solution was intended. In some cases, multiple solutions are accepted, but in others, they are not.\n\n3. The rhythm \"puzzles\". The game asks you to repeat the rhythm of a certain tune it plays. That's it. No puzzle elements in it whatsoever, so I'm really not sure what it's doing here. If I wanted a rhythm game, I would have bought a rhythm game, not a puzzle game. On this note [pun not intended], the tune always plays twice, save for one exception right in the middle of the game, which only plays once. This is unnecessarily annoying and time-consuming in the first instance, and disorienting in the second.\n\n4. Completely unbalanced hint system. Either the hint system is useless (in that the information it gives you is information you already know), or that it gives you information you yourself couldn't work out (which defeats the whole purpose of a puzzle). In one particular case; namely, a puzzle asking you to count the number of mate-in-ones on a chessboard; the hint itself gives completely false information (a king moving out the path of a rook can only give discovered check in six ways, not seven).\n\n5. No explanations for your answer's truth value. It only tells you whether your answer is right or wrong. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem. However, given the problems noted above, this just makes the game ridiculously unplayable, and turns the game into one of \"Guess what the person who made this puzzle was thinking when he came up with an incorrect answer which we won't hint at!\"\n\n6. The puzzle resets itself if you get it incorrect (which, during the last few chapters, is practically inevitable). You got it incorrect due to a slightly misplaced piece? Have fun placing them back in.\n\n7. Sliding puzzles. There are at least 40 of them in the game. However, as far as I dare to check, they are all of the same size (3x3), and there is a trivial method for solving sliding puzzles, making these pure timewasters.\n\n8. Plot holes everywhere. What happened to the balloonist? Did Lukatello make it out alive? Is Doyle really completely incompetent at this whole \"keeping one's intentions secret\", and is May TRULY so stupid that she doesn't suspect a thing until Doyle meets Uter (yet is apparently intelligent enough to be able to solve brute-force 4-piece dissection puzzles in her head)?! How do we even know that that person IS Uter (and not one of Uter's lackeys), and that Doyle isn't merely Uter in disguise?!\n\nThe key difference between this \"puzzle game\" and any game from the Professor Layton series is that this game seems to want to be at odds with puzzle-solving immersion, as if the creators of the game hated puzzles with all their fortunes and wanted to intentionally ruin peoples' puzzle-solving experiences while raking in money for a garbage product.\n\nAll in all, it is an absolutely horrible game with no respect whatsoever for the player's time. Your \u00a36.99 would be far better spent on, say, Braid, QUBE, or Sokobond; where the creator has actually test-solved all the puzzles and verified that they aren't completely outrageously impossible or broken.
