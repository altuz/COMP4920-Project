This game is nigh unbeatable as of the writing of this review. I heard talk it got some kind of significant up in difficulty, but it's just not winnable. I played Puzzle Quest Warlords, I know how hard these matching games can be. However, medium missions put you up against enemies who are two or more times more powerful than you. You never have enough scrap (and enough never drops during the matching part. All upgrades require more scrap than you will ever get from a single mission, even if you don't repair. \n\nIt's just not beatable. If you have three levels of shield  and walking expect to take decent damage. If they have that, expect to miss or do flat 0. It's impossible to win in the long run as you're always falling behind on upgrades, and what upgrades you can make are often immediately useless by the next mission. Luck plays such a dominating role in the game that you might as well just pull a slot lever. If the game decides it's time for you to lose, you lose. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499438322, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499438322, "recommendationid": "33344521", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511185", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499736247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 200, "steamid": "76561198011540788", "num_games_owned": 311}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a match-three game what got steampunks in it.\n\nIroncast was on my Wishlist for quite a while.

Sometimes you can't fire, raise shields, walk, or get enough coolant to do anything because of what drops. Plus the enemy almost never seems to not get what it needs but is limited to two attacks per turn. Only rarely does the enemy not do much per turn which really just feels like a \"balancing feature\". That doesn't even take into account will any good gear drop, or decent missions types to give you any chance of winning your run. Then the worst for me is the BS evade chance. I can be at 50% or higher without dodging any attacks for an entire battle. Yet the enemy at 10% you can miss 3-4 times in a row fairly regularly. Nothing is consistant whether is missions, evade chance, scrap gain, nodes dropping, or getting decent skills. Now I know thats a lot of complaining and its because its all rng. Skill has almost nothing to do with this game besides some basic pattern recognition. So if you like match 3 and can put up with rng kicking you most of the time until you get that good run its worth a shot.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501962277, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501962277, "recommendationid": "34045139", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501205", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 318, "total_reviews": 407, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 89}}
