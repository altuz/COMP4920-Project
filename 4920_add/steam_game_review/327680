The secound one being even shorter than the last.\n\nThe graphics isn't bad, and is just about the only part of the game that could be considered somewhat \"finished\".\n\nThe combat is kinda repetetive, besides the basic attack there are only two special abilites to use, which I found to be quite useless as I reached higher levels with my character, something that leads me into my next complaint.\n\nThere isn't much challenge to find in the game. By just doing the few quests there were along the way, I easily beat the game in around thirty minutes. Could've probably done it faster if I wanted. The only time I was remotely close to death (besides the houndred deaths I had to grind for one of the acheivements) was when I faced what I believe to be the final boss, and that was only because I was careless due to the lack of challenge elsewhere in the game.\n\nThe quests there were to do were few, and there were only two kinds of quests to accomplish just with increasing quantity. The NPCs were basically the same, just one of them had a slightly different name. And the shop stocks were the same at all the vendors. You probably could get all the things the shops sold within the first few minutes of gameplay. Another contributing factor to the lack of challenge in the game.\n\nThe game does atleast have Steam trading cards and acheivements, though the acheivements were tedious to obtain due to the lack of incentive to continue, as there were no more unlockables or content to explore. Out of the 93 minutes I spent in this game, I think 60 of them were a boring grind for acheivements after finishing the game itself.\n\nNot to mention the trading cards seemingly only being images of mediocre quality in-game screenshots, kind of dissapointing to be honest. Although the badges and emoticons are kinda good looking, I found the backgrounds to be unsatisfying. Thought I'd include this since it's apparently one of the game's major selling points.\n\nIn addition to all of this there were some other minor details that bothered me, such as the pause menu not actually pausing the game itself, despite it proclaiming to be a pause menu. Also the fact that the ragdoll bodies of the enemies might glitch out sometimes and go crazy, sometimes even knocking the potion the enemy dropped to oblivion, something which is slightly annoying when hunting for the collect 200 potions achievement.\n\nSo, in the end, I was left to grind for the acheivements more than the actual in-game content.\nNot exactly getting me into my zone.\n\nIf you really want to try this, I recommend getting it at a sale.
