I remember not being able to join friends and after a few games, I decided the game wasn't for me and just another clone.\n\nBeing bored and only seeing games with no depth in gameplay and just essentially imitating the original MOBA/FPS formula, I decided to give Gigantic another shot after it came out for Steam. I'm originally from DotA and MMORPG pvp-style games, so having a MOBA-esque theme with third-person gameplay actually fit my needs.\n\nSome elements I definitely like about the game are the strategy involved, artstyle, animations, colorful particles. \nI mean your nexus/core actually jumps to the other side of the field to crush the enemy nexus/core? WTF. These Guardians are huge and makes you feel right there on the battlefield. Not to mention the fact that Clash mode completely changes the map.\n\nOn the surface, the game seems pretty simple. You lay minions on control points, you kill other people, and you win the game by killing the enemy boss. What you don't see are the strategic elements in the game. Some examples being:\n\n[*]What limited creature do I summon on this point?\n\n[*]Do I spend my focus on upgrading the creature to an adult or keep it so I can use my ultimate?\n\n[*]One of the Guardians (Boss) is going on a rampage, do I defend/attack the Guardian or do I attack a control point to put more points into the next round?\n\nThen you add on to the defending, healing, sprinting, dodging, engaging, killing, wounding fast-paced part of the game, it becomes quite immersive. Seriously, this game is [b]fast-paced AF[/b] (game time and movement speed). I don't think I've played a game as fast as this. You sprint literally everywhere.\n\nAnyway, back on topic. Motiga isn't a big company, but they seem to be on track with feedback and updates. \nWhether this game gets popular in the future, I definitely plan to stick with this game. A game formula that I actually enjoy with amazing art is rare for me.\n\nI mean this game is F2P. Give it a shot and try it out for yourself and mold your own thoughts.
