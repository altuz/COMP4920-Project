Apparently this has always been the case. You can just google it. There are some \"fixes\" for it online, but none worked for me. This makes playing on anything but easy completely pointless in my opinion, since your main weapon requires precise aiming. It's also just not fun, so consider that before you purchase the game.\n\nOn to the actual review: Apart from the problem above the game runs absolutely fine and offers some of the best stuff the FPS genre has come up with. It completely sticks to the theme of you being inside an actual computer. That means that all the terminology and all the game's gimmicks have been adapted to fit that theme. For example you're collecting build points to improve yourself, the user. You need to aquire a certain number of build points to get to a new build version, i.e. a level up and so on. You'll also not use weapons and skills, but systems, which you can aquire in containers or from enemies. These also come in different release versions (alpha, beta, gold) and need to be slotted into your character, while the available slots change with each new level. There are systems for quieter walking, higher jumping, getting a zoom function, a sniper rifle, a \"shotgun\", etc. However, it is perfectly viable to just use your main weapon, the \"disc\" throughout the entire game. It is also the only weapon that does not consume energy and energy is important to download new systems, emails (only for fluff) and permissions, which you need to open doors, activate switches, etc. They've really made it feel like you're actually in that computer.\n\nOther highlights are the level design, which is vastly different each time, and the pretty good music. Yes, the graphics are a bit outdated, but also kinda timeless. Fighting against the \"Kernel\" and his programs never gets old. The further you progress the more difficult the enemies become. There aren't a lot of them in total, but anti virus programs, corrupt programs and resource hoggers all fit the theme and all behave differently.\n\nThe game also features some light cycle passages, which are, frankly, unplayable due to the non-fixed camera. Controlling the camera with the mouse at such high speeds while making frequent turns and having your view obstructed by structures just makes these all but impossible. THANKFULLY you can skip these parts of the game after you've died about 3 times. The game will just nicely ask you. Which is great, since, you know, light cycling has nothing to do with an ego shooter anyway. It's great that they're in the game, but the implementation is really bad.\n\nApart from that I can't really say too much negative stuff about the game. Maybe the difficulty is a bit too high, even on easy, since enemies still do a ton of damage and the game is not really comparable to other ego shooters. Think about your main weapon as a slow moving projectile that returns to you when you hit something, but flies off into the nether if you miss, meaning you have to wait an eternity to get it back...Switching weapons also takes an eternity and like I said, using the same resource for weapon discharge as you need for progress in the game seems rather stupid.\n\nThe story, on the other hand, is nothing to write home about. It's bland and it's presented in an even blander way, but the setting at least makes up for it.\n\nFor 10 bucks, however, you'll easily get 10 hours of fun out of this old classic.
