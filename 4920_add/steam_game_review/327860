I guess it's called that because this game is full of islands and pirates; well land based pirates at least. Though there are a variety of ships, I've never seen another soul on the water.\n\nThis game has a lot more loot variety than most of the others; not including 7D2D. You have several types of armor, weapons, and accessories. I haven't needed to build a base yet, so I'm not sure if that's a thing.\n\nUnlike the other games, Salt is populated. There are merchants, pirates, inns, etc. However, they are spread out amongst hundreds of islands, so you might not see anyone at all or a small handful depending on the island size and the resources.\n\nCombat is with other humans/ mostly pirates and cultists. There are no wolves, bears, etc. You can swim a long ways too, though even a raft is much faster. I found an abandoned pirate ship, repaired it, and now I ply the waters in style. It seems weird to control a 60' long ship by myself though\u2026.\n\nFood has to be scavenged and is always low. Trees bear fruit and deer are plentiful but shy easy so killing one takes patience. It is unlikely that you will make a clean kill with one shot, so you'll be chasing them down. A head/neck shot does massive damage though so you might get lucky. The flee AI for deer is great. You won't guess which way they'll run unless you box them in somewhere.\n\nThe map has to be populated by you. It's just a blank sheet of graph paper with longitude and latitude marks. You can find or make a sextant and compass to help with this and you can also WRITE NOTES on it. How nice that someone finally got this. It's so nice to be able to write stuff down. Things like \"chest I couldn't open in nw corner of the island at 5E 12N, etc. I don't mind maps that hold your hand but sometimes it is quite fun to do your own. Note that there are several markers ready made for the islands too.\n\nThere are lots of chests, buried treasure, ancient ruins, etc. Exploration is HUGE in this game.\n\nWhile there is no multiplayer just yet, it is in the workings. The author wants some form of multiplayer because they're going to add cannon to the bigger ships and then you'll be able to have ship to ship battles in multiplayer. For us single-player folks the cannon can take out shore-wandering pirates and deer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505230450, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505230450, "recommendationid": "34903424", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563600", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506610329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 381, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1390, "steamid": "76561198113706417", "num_games_owned": 65}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game so far!

The very act of sailing is deceptively simple, just point your boat and go, but then there's the act of going back to an island for a quest which requires genuine planning.\n\n1. You need a Sextant to know exactly where you are in the world.\n\nThis is an easy tool to use. Just hotkey it and press the button and voila, you now know the grid your in. Go to your map and locate said grid and mark it with an island if your on one, otherwise leave it blank.\n\n2. A compass to make sure your going in the right direction but the compass is a little weird. \n\nIf you want to go North-West then make sure the red arrow is pointing north-east and the white arrow is pointing south-west, think of it as North and West with the white arrow being your East-West bearing and the red arrow being the North-South bearing. Once I figured that out, it was smoother sailing.\n\n3. Understand that the map does NOT automatically update!\n\nMake sure you know how to work the map grids and how to document an islands location and you won't get lost. It's immensely satisfying to see your map grow and to find your way back from a long journey. \n\nSadly it has one big bad point. aside from being the best way to travel, sailing is boring. The devs have hinted to spicing up the ocean with roaming pirates and I hope that means ship to ship cannon battles and even some more dangers like sea monsters but that depends on whether or not the game is going to be realistic.\n\nThe main source of content is on islands. Islands however are fun, they allow you to collect resources and gather food for long journeys. You can also hunt, fish, barter, quest and play music (like buffing yourself) as well as document key features on an island to your map such as pirate activity, hunting potential, dangerous creatures, hut locations and so on so forth.\n\nAgain, sailing is boring but at the same time it's not awful. It works well and can be fun on short journey's but the ocean needs more activity aside from fishing.

Do not get me wrong, I definitely think there is more than $5 worth of content but oh man the game doesn't feel even at 15% completion. It feels like a pre-pre-pre-alpha where developers are saying \"ok as you can see, we will have land here, and NPCs will stand over here\" etc. I probbaly would have even kept the game (I mean honestly it's cheaper than a movie) but this one.....annoying thing..: When you are walking through an island/land birds will chirp. Sounds good right?...well, in this case, you know that buzzing sound you have when you are playing a track/song on *loud* but there is this silence with the electric buzzing in the background, that crackles and gives off static sound when you connect or disconnect your headphones or speakers? That's exactly how the birds make them selves known in this game: crackling connect/disconnect sound, speaker buzz, birds, speaker buzz, connect/disconnect sound. It's not even for the fact that it breaks imersion when that comes on, you seriously do not think about it that way....but it is strictly because that buzzing and crackling annys the crap out of you. Its makes you feel as if you are on the phone menu and there is a button you can not skip, so you mentally make the \" *sigh* T_T really?\" face while you wait through it. In fact, it literally made me want to rush through an island and GTFO outta there as fast as I could. The game also feels dead and completely lifeless.

The ocean water is completely flat, there are no waves to battle or manouver around storms or something like that, its like sailing in a big hotel swimming pool\n\n- there is no real need for a food meter, as it doesnt add anything to the game, is this a survival game? Yes? then why cant I chop down trees to make a fire. Is it an exploration game? Okay, then why keep me busy instead with hunger.....\n\n- there are quests in the game, but I would hardly call them quests as they are so mondane and boring\n\n- everything is presented to you in text form, you find books and literally have to read like 4 pages of a book to get some quest information, I didnt like that at all, I dont mind reading, but here it was way too often and way too long\n\n\nDont tell me this is just an early access game and its going to get better. Salt is in early access since 2014, the boring and bland core gameplay is not going to change.

There's not much in the realm of building, besides ships.  You can't just chop down trees and dig, this is not a minecraft-like game.
