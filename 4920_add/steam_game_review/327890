The controls are hard, especially with the controller when it comes to gripping. Very low FPS happens even with the low video settings and everything just becomes harder and less enjoyable. It just feels boring. However, I only liked the part where it crosses over to other games, but everything else is just....\"meh\". How frustrating and tedious. I couldn't even enjoy this one bit and hardly ever completed the first mission successfully.
