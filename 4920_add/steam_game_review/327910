I still have nightmares</>\nBut jokes aside. This is 7th legion. An old epic megagames rts which holds up because of 2 things - technotrash soundtrack , which is kinda awesome (at least half of it), and because there is ability to play 'cards' from hand right on the battlefield applying buffs, debuffs, dealing direct damage and/or summoning reinforcements, like you playing some sort of ccg. That and the fact that you don't mine resources - you kill enemy, more enemies you kill - more resources you get based on timer+there are random missions right on the battlefield like 'kill 4 enemy turrets, reward 40k cr'. \n\nIt appears that game were patched, units does not stuck as much as in original version and it crashed only once before launching on win 7 64-bit. However. Rest of the bugs is still here and demands patching - main menu videos timing is still fucked, Pathfinding although partially better, still makes units stuck. That and lack of hi-res support, which is, especially with large onscreen unit size, is 'buolz' for the lack of better word. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414144026, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1414144026, "recommendationid": "12607757", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538092", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447825512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 917, "steamid": "76561198006999027", "num_games_owned": 266}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a no-frills re-release of the 1997 Game. If you liked it then, you'll like it now. No fresh coat of paint, no additional features, nothing. For better or worse, it is exactly as it was. \n\nFor the uninitiated, 7th Legion is an RTS about two factions, the 7th Legion and the Chosen. The Chosen are comprised of the rich, powerful, and uber smart that evacuated Earth when pollution rendered the planet uninhabitable. The 7th Legion are so-called because they were the ones left behind, and this is the seventh generation after the evacuation. The Chosen come back from deep space to reclaim the planet, the 7th Legion resists, and that's about it. There's no real story beyond the intro video.\n\nAs far as play styles go, the infantry are mirrored on both sides. It's in the vehicles and Assault Chassis (mechs) that the two factions diverge. The 7th Legion has hard-hitting vehicles, and The Chosen have awesome AC's.  \n\nThe game's economy is gifted in regular intervals of time. The player's rank will determine how many Credits are given during these intervals. Rank is achieved through a hidden XP system. Killing units, completing objectives, and destroying buildings all contribute. Credits can also be earned in the same fashion plus some additional means such as collecting crates and from \"card\" effects (more on that below). \n\nThe game has a unique system that adds an additional layer of strategy, playing cards. These cards are gifted every other interval or found in crates and have a wide variety of effects. They can instantly grant soldiers, burn the enemy in an area, gain control of an enemy vehicle, or steal credits. These cards are outlined with colored borders to indicate how they should be played: green for play on yourself, blue for neutral, and red for play on the enemy. Exploiting these cards at the right time often will have devastating effects on your enemy. The enemy has their own cards that can be played on you, too, so be careful.\n\nThe game's missions are challenging, and maps are usually large enough to explore different routes. The 7th Legion's missions tend to be more strategic, expanding beyond merely amassing an army and steamrolling across the map. In one mission, you only have one guy with a bomb, and you have to blow up a base with it before you are granted reinforcements. There are a few others where you don't even have a base, and have to make do with small squads and limited resources.\n\nThere are also infantry based missions indoors. In these scenarios, three soldiers enter a facility to either get to a certain point on the map or kill everyone inside. Each member of the squad can be equipped with three weapon types, the default laser gun, grenade launcher, or a sniper rifle. Frankly though, the sniper rifle is vastly superior, and it's the only weapon I use. The game for either faction will last a handful of hours to complete.  \n\nAlthough the game is a lot of fun, there are a number of caveats. It's far from perfect. Pathing in large groups is an exercise in frustration. Units will get stuck behind trees, on different elevations, or will ignore orders altogether. They do this thing I call the \"F You\" response. Say for example you want to attack a vehicle bay. Instead of doing that, sometimes tank turrets or AC chassis will spin 180 degrees and just sit there. Or just as bad, units sometimes won't recognize move and attack orders that are placed very near to the unit.  \n\nThe enemy AI is about as intelligent as a pile of rocks. My favorite tactic is to wall off paths to my base,then build power plants or barracks until I can literally build well behind enemy lines. They never destroy the walls and only attack buildings that are invading their space once in a while. However, never is the AI's stupidity more evident than when playing a particular card, \"Armageddon\". It wipes out the whole map of friendlies and enemy alike, destroys every building, and critically damages both bases. No matter how intricately the mission map was planned out, the AI won't even repair the base. They build one or two power plants, barracks, basic infantry, and that's it. Left to its own devices, the AI is worthless.\n\nThis game was developed in a time where balance wasn't a huge factor, and patches were difficult to distribute. It is possible to upgrade infantry to the degree of being near-godlike. With top armor upgrades, some infantry can survive being crushed by tank treads quite handily. Sure, you can upgrade vehicle and AC armor and weapons, but upgrading infantry is much more economical and effective.\n\nIf you are willing to forgive the game's shortcomings, there's a lot to enjoy here. Some of the cut-scenes are pretty cool, and the title theme is still an awesome jam. The card system and how the economy works are both unique features that I haven't seen reproduced in any RTS since. For the price, give it a try.

You'll also notice the main menu animations going way too fast, but the in-game cutscenes work as intended).\nAll in all it's a pretty interesting title from the era when we saw the creative peak of the genre, it's a deeply \n\nflawed RTS, certainly not at the level of classics like Dark Reign or Total Annihilation, or even Krush Kill 'N Destroy but over all I think it's worth experiencing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414275555, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1414275555, "recommendationid": "12632378", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509447", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451686684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 13, "steamid": "76561198006458260", "num_games_owned": 238}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Buy the game, install it, go to the SFX folder of the game and look for files with the extension XM. specifically look for BGM6.XM. and then just google for a XM to mp3 converter and you are done.\n\nthe game price is worth it for that track alone.\n\nthe game on its own its ok, i bought it on GoG some time ago and years before i played it on my old MMX pentium.\n\nthe AI is dumb but the dreadful pathing and the completely overpowered and ridiculous card system will make the game challenging enough. if you are expecting a strategy game you'll be disappointed, most of the time you'll make a small group of units and make your way to the enemy base and then win the game with a combination of cards and units. cards like teleport are incredibly useful, it makes your units teleport to their next move command, which means you can teleport an entire army to the enemy base and win... but then the AI can smite your units, or just play a silly desperation card like Armageddon and end the game in defeat for EVERYONE.\n\nthe missions can get REALLY hard because all it takes for the AI to get a few good cards in a row and your mighty army will get blown up. a lot of missions will end with you trading bases and abusing positioning, personally im fine with that.\n\nit can get quite frantic, specially paired with the lack of resource system, you get credits for killing enemy units and periodically in a system similar to the FFVIII SEED system. the better you do the better pay you get, and you can get promotions by completing the randomly generated missions.\n\non top of all this there's constant random drops all over the map, so keeping a big army spread all over the map can be of great use.\n\nthe unit design is all right, but the old resolution looks pretty dated, specially on the FMVs. there's some HEAVY Warhammer 40k influences here and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nlate game balance is pretty screwed, the blues get long range missiles of doom that avoid most pathing issues, paired with a triple barrelled tank... while the reds get a wonky spider bot that gets stuck on terrain all the time and a heavy hitting tank with a short range... as you can see unit pathing is bad enough to affect game balance.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451687819, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451687819, "recommendationid": "20195788", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506279", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444698791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198135538727", "num_games_owned": 1343}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you have problems getting the game to work then forget using the enclosed DXWrapper.

Heavily underrated.  It's gameplay features many common RTS elements such as tech trees and base building mechanics. However, it also features so unique features. Its first unique setup is that instead of farming resources, you're killing enemies. This allows boosts to your periodical budget allotment, which gives you free money. With a much heavier emphasis on combat, its nice to throw aside your usual chains to resources and just mow down some Chosen scum. Its other unique mechanic is Cards. Just like your perodic budget allotment, every few cycles you'll get a unqiue card. These Cards all feature different effects. To illustrate, the Chaos card causes all characters within it's radius to start fighting each other, friend or foe. The Stealth card cloakcs your units, kaing them invisible, etc. This might sound like tacky gimmick, but this is a real game changer, these cards can easily turn the courses of battle. \n So, unto my problems with this game. Firstly, THIS GAME IS UNOPTIMIZED. In order to play, download DXwind and look over the game's forums here on Steam to find more in-depth tuts. Also, there are two factions in-game: 7th Legion and the Chosen. The Chosen quit the Earth centuries ago when it ran out of resources, and left most of humanity behind. They returned later on, thinking humanity had died out, only to find several warring factions, whom all teamed up when they found the Chosen returning. So, now both sides are fighting for the Earth. I haven't beaten the campaign, but the story seems paper-thin and more just a backdrop than anything else. the two in game factions are just recolors of each other; one being red and the other blue. I don't believe there is any stat differences or unit alterrations.  \n So, to summerize, this game features some unqiue mechanics and an awesome soundtrack, only really held back by my nitpacks. However, the fact it is on Steam but not optimized at all for newer tech is practically heresy. It is disgusting to see them merely throw something on Steam with little reguards for the consumer, and force the consmer to work for hours trying to get their product to work. Consumers shouldn't have to waste time on trying to fix a product. That's the developer's job, if someone puts a game on Steam, even if its an older game, they need to patch it up. Period. Due to the nonexistant optimization, I must downvote this game. Should the publisher patch the game, I'll upvote it.
