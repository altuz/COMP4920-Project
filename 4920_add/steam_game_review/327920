As a teenager I`ve been playing it for weeks, trying to figure  out all the puzzles and quests, find every recruitable NPC with unique items\\ inventory graphics, installing every possible cutting-edge cyberware, jury-rigging protective suits (about 12 of them) and weapons from junk and spare components. Background artwork is simply beautiful, music is haunting and atmospheric. Combat is complex and intense - in some situations it is highly recomended to use extra gear like doppelganger, virus-loaded data spiders against drones at TransTechnicals, holy water and wooden stakes against vampires (aim for torso, nothing else will work). You can kill almost anyone you want to at will, but please be carefull not to harm guards at Hellfire Club - it breaks the plot, making game unbeatable (learned it the hard way back then). Narrative is also intriguing, with many interesting characters and subplots.\n\nIf you are a fan of cyberpunk genre and Gibson`s Neuromancer, this game is a must have! The main drawback imo is somewhat obscure UI and general difficulty level, especially for modern player. Takes some time to get into it, and a little bit of thinking - no one is going to hold your hand and explain what to do next. \n\nP.S About subtitles problem - you can activate them by turning off the sound in game options.

After refunding it, I ended up buying it on GOG to give it another try.\n\nI first want to preface this review by saying I went in totally blind. I have no nostalgia attached to it, and I come from a background of loving point-and-clicks. I also seek out any game of the cyberpunk genre I can get my hands on.\n\nThat said, I wanted to like this game, but it felt impossible to. I saw it and I thought it was some kind of miracle I hadn't played it already. Even its subtitle \"The Cyberpunk Vampire Game\" seemed perfect (as well as amazingly corny) to me. The screenshots made it look fantastic in that old time-y gritty moody kind of way. I felt like whatever its cons were, I wouldn't let it keep me from enjoying a game that looked like I would love. But despite playing for long enough to get a handle on it, it still didn't work for me.\n\nRight off the bat the introduction has dialogue remeniscent of a real terrible early 80s B-movie, and the entire game follows a real similar note. I love B-movies, but I like the ones that have some kind of substance to them. To those who do not discriminate amongst the B-grade film and enjoy them all, you may enjoy the game's dialogue and story. I came in expecting cheesy shlock but the interactions in the game are just completely unentertaining and soulless. There's too much of it, and it all felt incredibly empty.\n\nAt first glance Bloodnet looks like an adventure game, but it's very much an RPG as well as point-and-click. Even moreso, I'd say. You construct a character in detail from the very beginning. After making one, you're thrown in with absolutely no explaination of how anything in it works. I fumbled around with the controls and tried to figure them out, but they were so convoluted and made so little sense I ended up just getting frustrated, on more than one occasion. It's very, very easy to get frustrated at this game. \n\nThe game's combat get a special mention for making absolutely no sense. After taking more than a few hours of mastering it I still have no idea how it works. Imagine arranging a bunch of sprites on a wallpaper and mashing a few keys on the keyboard; it would be about the same experience, and the only difference is doing the latter would save you from all the needlessly complicated aspects of the literal sprite-war. Speaking of, one of the more amusing things I noticed while playing was that moving your character around on the screen makes very little difference whatsoever ultimately, because you can just drag all the items in the room around the screen anyway.\n\nThe music, while I initially thought helped add to the mood and atmosphere, eventually got grating to a point I had to turn it off. It's a mish-mash of totally random notes thrown into a midi blender and forcefully churned out. I turned general sound off too because not only was voice acting painfully sub-par, but it's neccessary in order to see subtitles/text. I was just playing it in total silence at that point, which wasn't too pleasant.\n\nI love games that throw you in with no explaination and don't hold your hand as they play, but Bloodnet goes too far with this. Even with a walkthrough, it's unbelievably difficult to get any sense of progression.\n\nVisually, however, this is where the game succeeds. It does an absolutely fantastic job setting a mood, almost unlike any other game I've ever played before. This is what had wowed me when I first found out about the title, and the screenshots essentially secured my purchase. It reminds me of Synnergist, which is a relatively unknown cyberpunk point-and-click adventure that was released in 1996, 3 years after Bloodnet. It really puts it into perspective -- it's amazing how well even now Bloodnet works on its visuals alone. It's what sparked my interest and it's probably what's going to spark others' too. Atmospherically it's a spectacle to look at and simply experience, and if only the rest of the game followed, it could have been something a lot more.\n\nThere's a lot of potential. But I feel like the designers were too ambitious and tried too much at once. It ends up overall being a mess. It's a neat-to-look-at mess, but an unplayable one. Like others have said before me, the easiest way to sum it up is to say it has not aged well in the slightest.\n\nRecommended only to those who have the nostalgia factor I don't, or an insane amount of patience. Looking through the flaws and figuring out all the nonsense would be tough, but there are things to like about it for those who are willing to stomach its more unpleasant aspects.\n\n___\n\nEdit.\nHere's my in-depth review of the game:\nhttp://www.hardcoregaming101.net/bloodnet/bloodnet.htm", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435823603, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1473766819, "recommendationid": "16839878", "language": "english", "votes_down": 26, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573863", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423264949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 139, "steamid": "76561198021378479", "num_games_owned": 327}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 53, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[b]A game that hasn't aged quite well.[/b]\n\nEven with the manual and a walkthrough in hand, Bloodnet remains confusing and nonsensical.

I didn't explore it [i]that[/i] much during my playtime, but from what i saw; There's a lot here for the patient person. It is a truly non-linear game with no hand holding whatsoever.

First off the controls are not intuitive at all, over complex, and after two hours i still hadn't figuerd them out.\nAnd the lack of direction...i get that you've got a limited time to free yourself of the vampier curse before it's permanent, but how one goes about doing that i don't get at all.
