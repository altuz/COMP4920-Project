I guess.  \nA truly fun classic RPG in the grand style.   What, it was written in 1992?!  It is deeper and better games than many new titles.  You have to play it for a little while to appreciate it.\n\nThere is a main story line, but, the whole thing is non-linear, and, you can play however you wish (you can even have characters, eventually, die of old age!).  The magic system is unique (alchemy and prayers to saints).  Comabt is fun (more complicated than it appears to be).  \n\nThe game has a personality all its own.  The quality that went into Darklands is suprising!  If you enjoy single-player RPG, then, give this one a try!\n\n[BTW, please read through the manual - it is thick but entertaining, and, necessary to understanding the game.]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503361170, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503361170, "recommendationid": "34405366", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507465", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502826455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561198403769223", "num_games_owned": 6}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game is great for killing some time but if you get bothered my pixels and hard to read words this game is not for you i give this game a 7.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502825515, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502825515, "recommendationid": "34262439", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499153", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499929192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 383, "steamid": "76561198010811784", "num_games_owned": 674}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": " I thought I would love this game.  It looked awesome.  It's really hard to figure out and get into, though.  It does very little to explain itself to the player.  Originally, the player was expected the read the manual and whatnot that came with the game.  Thankfully, all such documentation comes with the Steam version of this game.  However, having read all of that, the game is *still* not very transparent.  It might be a good game for someone who has the hours to devote to learning it, but that person is not me (and I have devoted a lot of hours to several other classic RPGs).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503761739, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503761739, "recommendationid": "34507715", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494400", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 69, "total_reviews": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
