[i]Dragonsphere[/i] is an old school point & click adventure, originally developed and published by Microprose in 1994, and carries all qualities of its genre from obscure puzzles to incredibly rich narrative.\n\nWe take a quick glimpse on the land of Callahach, a medieval realm with high fantasy elements. 20 years ago, the evil sorcerer Sanwe was defeated and sealed into his own tower by the King, young prince Callash and court wizard, Ner-Tom with the usage of the Dragonsphere. 20 years later, the seal begins to wear off and once again, the realm is threatened by Sanwe's probable release. Prophecies of old call - now King Callash, to finish the battle started 20 years ago. After his coronation, our King decides to take the quest of facing the evil sorcerer and see to his demise once and for all.\n\nHere in the land of Callahach, our fair hero is to embark on a journey to collect aid from neighboring nations in hopes of defeating Sanwe. Callach is to solve faerie riddles, deal with cunning shapeshifters, drink and gamble with the Caliph of Soptus, tread the Spirit Realm, wrestle with beasts of deep realms, avoid deadly traps and even prejudice of his own people. In the end though, the deceit comes from our one blind side, of course, with the addition of one major plot twist.\n\nWithout revealing further details of this beautiful, yet short story; let's take a look on what [i]Dragonsphere[/i] has to offer. The game hails from the day when we used MS-DOS to play games, and it still uses a DOS BOX, which is both nostalgic and cute in my opinion. If you are in favor of realistic and magnificent graphics, this surely is not it. Yet, with the technology of the given era, [i]Dragonsphere[/i] doesn't fail to deliver an elegant and beautiful display, accompanied with surprisingly catchy midi music. The movements of characters, background art and interactive animations do seem like art: pretty and elegant. I'm sure that some people made this game with much time and love spared. Voice acting is a bit hoarse and unimaginative, but script itself makes up for its own.\n\nGameplay menu presents you a list of actions and an inventory, in which you can combine actions with either items or the environment. Combinations are not always logical, but always imaginative. For everything you look at, you are rewarded with detailed narrative descriptions which enrich the setting greatly. Puzzles are really hard, I won't lie. For the first puzzle of the game - the Faerie Maze - you have to go through a logic puzzle, which did take 3 hours for me to figure out! When I finally figured the correct combination out, I was about to shed tears of joy! Aside this one, you will be encountering movement puzzles, language puzzles and lore puzzles, all obscure, yet imaginative and well thought. There is no replay value at all, but one playthrough is challenging enough.\n\n[i]Dragonsphere[/i] is certainly not for everyone. I'll recommend this game for the nostalgic and the one who'd like a real challenge in brain gymnastics only. Also, I have to inform you that the game is free for you to grab in GOG, so you may prefer not to pay for it here on Steam. I, for myself, was happy to lend some financial provision for Microprose, for the old times\u2019 sake.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445107708, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1459030089, "recommendationid": "18532457", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571845", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1414455123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561198015972042", "num_games_owned": 419}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 78, "comment_count": "18", "review": "H!, here is a great quest with well made animation ,artistic voice acting and magic story wich you have to uncover holds a lot of suprizes, it starts a  lilttle slow but  just to fool you a bit.Dont want to tell you a lot just jump in this world folks, fully recommended.

The game is not bad but it is not great either. The story is nice with a plot twist in the middle. And the feeling that you are on a quest is there. But the puzzles are not well done at all. Many are just guessing and often you miss an item on the ground because it is just a shade different than the ground itself. Also combining some stuff is hard to figure out. Difficulty and challenge are okay but here it borders on ridiculous sometimes when clicking through combinations of items and the 10-action menu. And even though I failed a lot of the times and I spend hours combining stuff it still only took about 5 hours to finish the game. This is clearly a game for people with a liking to the old-school feel of adventure games and to those I recommend getting it on a sale. To everyone else I advise to pick-up something else.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432423689, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495266614, "recommendationid": "15974055", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528489", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505198413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198099260702", "num_games_owned": 190}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I remember this game being very unique for its time. Definitely a classic in my book gaming through the 90's. This game is very in style for Microprose. Another one of theirs that I really liked was the Return of the Phantom, which is not yet on steam. The graphics with Dragonsphere were very good for the time, and a very different style to what Sierra was doing. I think that with Dragonsphere, the vision was very big with the animations, but the technology was limited. This game is also quite difficult as were many point and click adventure games of the time. They alwasy left you wondering on what was next to do, and you would spend hours traveling around and clicking things to find the next step. I have no idea how I did it when i was younger with very little access to hint systems. I replayed this and many other games so many times I could usually start new and from memory go through each of the points in the game and finish it within a few hours, or less than a days time. Its fun to go through these classics for the nostalgia, but I am also surprised at how much I have forgotten and how new feeling it can be too. Even though I probably went through Dragonsphere a several dozen times as a child, I would be totally lost without a walkthrough now. \n\n\nSome negative reviews have noted about the 'meh' story line. I think the plot is very simple, but the game is filled with all types of content that I have never seen anywhere else. You do have to dig a little deeper than just the introduction and your first venture out of the castle. The story is not going to blow your mind, or get you too emotionally involved with the characters. But it has some interesting things non the less. The voice acting is also a bit 'meh' but for me the nostalgic memory of the time was in awe over the fact there were voices at all. CD-ROM and voice acting in video games were just starting to make an appearance. This was like magic and this game and several others were pioneers to the craft. \n\nI think the price of the game is worth it for what you get.
