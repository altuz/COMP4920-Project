I would give it a 10/10.\n\nPros Great fun ok graphics.  easy to pick up.  Plays well with a gamepad.  Can capture monsters and use them in your group.  Only they dont level up disappointing.  Awesome Game just completed all the chapters in 11 hours flat short but loads of fun.  Probably coulb beat it faster but enjoyed every minute a must buy\n\nCons  Hero is bald!!! yuck!! With out the latest patch the game minimizes to the task bar but does not shut down semi annoying with patch it seems to be ok.   Lame attempt at humor.  If you are looking for humor than get Doom and Destiny.  You notice the extreme lack at attempted humor when the first monsters you fight are Biggs, and Wedge??????  FFVI?????  so lame and it only gets worse if you can get around that it is worth every penny Loads of fun.

The first chapter is the meat and potatos of the game while Chapter 2 & 3 add other perpective to the story but are much shorter. The fourth chapter, or the intermission, is more of a joke chapter that can be skipped.\n\nThis game follows the jRPG formula to a T. If you don't like jRPGs you probably won't like this game but if you love jRPGs then you should love this one as well. It doesn't try to be unique and then lack to deliver, it tries to be exactly what it is: a classic.\n\nThe only negative thing I can stay about this game is that the short chapters leave you wanting more. They are ended abruptly and don't feel like they have been concluded.\n\nYou can view my playthrough of the game here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZ9okxhtZI", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430855702, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430855702, "recommendationid": "15703626", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498853", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465131059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 731, "steamid": "76561198108615315", "num_games_owned": 31}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Fun to play and just fun to watch all the conversation and sillyness lol Minecraft chapter was pretty cool with all the game self-awareness hahaha Definitely recommend!
