Are you a major LOTR fan who likes/knows the lore of this universe?\n2. Do you have at least 1 friend to play through the game with?\n3. Did you like the old hack and slash LOTR games such as \"The Two Towers\" or \"Return of the King?\"\n4. Do you need a game that can be beaten in a good weekend session? Maybe even replayed again for fun at more difficulty?\n\nIf you answered yes to these 4 questions, this game is a great value. THREE ANNOYING THINGS THOUGH YOU MUST KNOW IN MULTIPLAYER. \n\n1. There is an in game voice chat that can't be turned off. HOW YOU GET AROUND THIS: You plug in another mic, tell steam to use that mic, turn the steam mic volume to 0, and then have your chat program such as Discord use your main mic plugged in to your rig. You'll never hear it again, though you'll have to set this up quick every time before you play\n2. Anyone who is not the host will not get some of the story achievements which is annoying, but their achievements... who really cares ;)\n3. By the end of the game on your first playthrough on Normal (highest difficulty you can play without beating it first) you and your friends will be a little too strong, and so the game's difficulty really tones down which is a shame :( this is fixed in repeat playthroughs on New Game + where you keep your gear and start over but everything is harder.\n\nThis is a really fun game with a few quirks, but had me and a LOTR fan friend of mine pretty interested to see what would happen next during the story. Overall I'd give the game outside it's quirks an honest 7 or 8 out of 10 WITH AT LEAST ONE FRIEND. SOLO THIS IS BORING AND GRINDY AS SHIT SINCE FRIENDLY A.I. IS GARBAGE.\n\n It's just plain fun for the 12-14 hours or so you'll get out of your first run (can run much quicker if you don't explore all dialogue). Also supports LAN connection gaming which is cool.\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506230611, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513122", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35171443", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198374875828", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1506450756, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "playtime_forever": 117}, "timestamp_updated": 1506230611, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game has a talking eagle.
