Anticlimactic as hell. I'm on Kubuntu LTS for crying out loud, and my graphics driver is the native supported Intel, I've played several Steam games with modern 3D graphics and they NEVER crash, so it's totally unacceptable for a pixel art game to have a Linux port here on Steam, and be this much of an unstable afterthought. It just disappoints people. I have a feeling that this is a quality JRPG, but I won't get to enjoy it.
