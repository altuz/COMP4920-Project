Especially for the low cost it was worth it.  Like it says, it is a combination village builder and tower defense.  If you liked Banished but got bored becuase it felt a bit too static, this would be a good one for you to try.  And even though it is early access, don't let that scare you away.  The game is functional, seems balanced at this point, and plays well.  The true sign is like any good game, I keep finding myself going \"well, I just want to build this one thing before quitting\" and playing too long.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504715164, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504715164, "recommendationid": "34778700", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505650", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507039928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2380, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7279, "steamid": "76561197968506244", "num_games_owned": 147}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty impressed so far. Despite using the very latest bleeding edge dev unstable release, I've only had one problem and that was performance wise (quite a lot on the screen admittedly). I Checked the forum and instantly found a fix that the dev had posted/ just literally released!  It amounted to an AI reset button in the UI. Reloaded to incorporate the updated downloaded, pushed the button and everything was fixed! So pretty damn good support I would say.\n\nIt's pretty adictive already. I'm looking forward to a bit more later game stuff, although I must admit I've tended to play on the easier (I think) traditional game as opose to survival etc. You may find that your save game is no longer valid after some updates, which is understandable given it's early release status, but be aware!\n\nI find at the moment though it tends to stagnate a little bit when you have taken over most of the particular zone you start in. I suspect I am suposed to try it in  a harder mode. Maybe there could be more of a campaign mode or additional challenges, quests or some such to keep up the pace?\n\nAll in all a bloody good game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505397500, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505397500, "recommendationid": "34948992", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505366837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1834, "steamid": "76561198035679010", "num_games_owned": 444}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1]Is this game finished?[/h1]\n[b]No[/b]\n\n[h1]Is this game worth $9.99[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n\n[h1]Why is it worth $9.99?[/h1]\n\n30 hours in, and I'm still enjoying this game. The base game is finished, the engine itself feels as if it has polish and care put into it. In my opinion, it simply needs a few more updates to be taken out of Early Access.  \n\nThe developer is still actively developing this game as of 9/14/2017, and seems to have no intention of stopping. \n\n[h2]Games that it's like:[/h2]\nBest way I can describe this game is a mixture of Dwarf Fortress, Black and White, and a standard style Tower defense. It doesn't have as much micromanagement as Dwarf Fortress, but still has that same sort of watching your workers work based on their internal AI. You are allowed to interact with the world via various godly abilities, and gain power based on various things throughout the world. \n\nIn the end I would highly reccomend this game. There aren't many good city builders now a days; espeically ones with such depth as Rise to Ruins.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505365976, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505365976, "recommendationid": "34942647", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506979467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2062, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3868, "steamid": "76561198039040465", "num_games_owned": 230}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's like a three way with a TD, RTS lite, and Sim City clone, in the Dark Ages.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506898840, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506898840, "recommendationid": "35398738", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506843797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561197968557589", "num_games_owned": 137}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "The whole game is a bit of an illegible mess.
