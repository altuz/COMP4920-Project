It's filled to the brim with sexism and transphobia, and it doesn't really have any redeeming qualities besides. The storyline and writing is mediocre and the gameplay and puzzles aren't terribly engaging. The only reason I bought this game was for the sake of nostalgia; I remember playing this on my grandpa's computer when I was much too young to understand any of the sex jokes.
