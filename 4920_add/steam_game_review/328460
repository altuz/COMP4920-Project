The Steam version is the same as the one on GOG, so don't expect that one to be any different. Both are at version 1.1 (the menu will say 1.0, this has always been the case, the patch never changed that number, so ignore it, and ignore all the people in the forum thinking they have to install the patch. That does nothing.)\n\nThe game's level design is pretty bad, but otherwise it was a fun FPS that also had decent car combat (and every car had an interior camera view!). It was fun blowing up bad guys into red chunks, and the way your weapon would transform into different versions was very cool. The animation for turning your assault rifle into a buzzsaw or sniper rifle was always entertaining.\n\nSadly, as I said, the game has a ton of issues currently. I was able to get it running on Windows 10 (though a lot of people in the forum can't get it to run at all. I did nothing special, so I have no idea why others are having issues getting it to launch), however you cannot change the resolution any higher than 1280x1024, the framerate is capped at 30fps, there's no way to increase the extremely small FOV, and if you use one of the fanmade patches to get a higher resolution (I was able to get it to launch at 1920x1080) the game will not run through Steam. Hence why it says I've only put a handful of minutes in the game.\n\nAmong other smaller issues is that the mouse will go wonky in some menus, slowing to a stuttering crawl, making it very hard to change keybindings and graphic settings. The soundtrack is screwed up and every single level starts with the same loud song (track02, which you can find under the Bonus Content folder), which plays for about 2 minutes and then stops. It doesn't play any of the other 8 songs this game has, it doesn't loop that one song, it just.. stops.\n\nThat one song will begin playing once a cutscene starts, too, so if you haven't turned it off (it's the \"CD Audio\" setting) then you'll have an impossible time trying to hear any of the characters.\n\nIf you don't mind playing with no music, a tiny resolution, mouse issues, and the often crashes, then it's a fun game. The level design is, as I said, kind of awful, and you'll get lost a good bit of the time. But the weapons are fun, the vehicles handle nicely, each one has an interior view, and the characters are pretty goofy and entertaining, especially whoever voiced Bork. Goodness, that voice.\n\nAnyway, I can't recommend it, it's too buggy. Not even for the $0.97 it's currently at. I hope that this game sooner or later gets an official patch to fix at least a handful of the issues I've mentioned, but until then just play something else. You aren't missing too much. This is an entertaining, but altogether forgettable game.\n\nIf you really need some Redline in your life, why not just listen to some good ol' King Kobra?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrjpsjLntm0", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458104218, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1458104218, "recommendationid": "21864140", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530493", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1418488618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 36, "steamid": "76561198007722114", "num_games_owned": 939}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": "2", "review": "A truly unique experience.
