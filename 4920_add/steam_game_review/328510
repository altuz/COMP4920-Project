I highly recommend this game to those that like this genre or wanting to get into it.\n\nThe gameplay is very solid.  There are 4 different characters to choose from, they all play the same, but differ from their looks.  There are various passive buffs you can equip, up to 3.  As for weapons there is a handful of different guns you can use, not much of a huge selection, but enough to satisfy.\n\nCurrently here are 3 different stages,  all procedural, and have their own theme.  Each level consists of completing an objective and going go the next level.  You do a total of two objectives and 1 boss level to complete the stage.\n\nMy favorite feature is the weapon heat system.  Weapons don't use ammo, instead the more you use it the hotter it gets.  After constant use the weapon will overheat and be put into a cooldown.  This may sound bad, but it really isn't that bad.  I feel this system is far superior over an ammo one in that you don't have to worry about finding ammo and can just focus fighting (which there is a lot of).  And you get to keep your favorite weapons on hand instead of having to swap.\n\nA couple of negatives I have about this game is how short the stages are, I feel another level can be added to give each stage a bit more meat to them.  Lack of mid-game/mid-stage save is something I would like to have.  Once you exit the game that's it, you have to start over again.\n\nOverall this game is great, lots of huge potential and best of all the dev's are very active in the forums and listens to all feedback.

The controls are solid and the gameplay keeps me coming back for more. Honestly, it's one of the better and just flat out fun games I've purchased in a while.

I use keyboard/mouse controls.\n\nOverall: I really like the Gauntlet-style play, the variety of enemies and the procedurally generated levels. Despite a number of shortcomings (expected for early-access stuff), I would totally recommend this game for anyone in the mood for an arcade style dungeon shoot-em-up.\n\nNoteable things I appreciated:\n- The variety of enemies is great. I had expected variations on a theme across the \"worlds,\" but was happy to encounter totally different concepts.\n- The map size of most levels is great.\n- The system changing the goal per level is a nice way to shake things up.\n- Vast assortment of items/weapons.\n- Weapon overheating system is (in general) used effectively to control scarcity\n\nThings I'm less keen on:\n- The game is currently permadeath which is a bit of a shame considering there is a home base of sorts and a number of things to collect. Adding some manner of save system would help immersion tremendously. It just feels like a missed opportunity to me.\n- Boss battles seem outlandishly hard by comparison to the standard levels, and with permadeath this gets immensely frustrating really quickly.\n- Health and damage items don't show stats of any kind to help the player gauge their value. (I may just be hankering for more RPG-style play that was not the goal of the developers.)\n- Keyboard/mouse controls are tricky to get the hang of. Especially controlling the camera as you move.\n- I hate to mention it because I\u2019m sure it will get bigger as time/money allow, but it is currently a rather short game to play through.\n\nNote: This review is for the early access release, and probably won't be very useful as things change and improve.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1471466194, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1471466194, "recommendationid": "24980397", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500854", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496551926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 461, "steamid": "76561198155656396", "num_games_owned": 14}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I was quite hyped about this game when NorthernLion reviewed it on youtube. I went on steam, bought it, and kicked back with a friend and started playing. In the beginning, it was OK. The graphics and gamplay was an obvious inspiration fro Nuclear Thrones. The gameplay was smooth, the guns are decent, and the 3 maps that were given are decent. \n\nThat's it. \n\nTwo months later, I found this game somewhere in my folder and decided to see if it had any changes. It had not. \n\nThe gameplay is horribly short. The story... wait, what story again? The guns and pickups are repetitive. You lose EVERYTHING after you die, and there is no way for you to save your progress. Take the binding issac for example, the game forces the player to play over and over again to unlock more stuff. As you progress through more levels, you get more powerups, you get better tears, and you actually feel powerful. Yes, this game allows for you to use your coins to purchase powerups after you finish a level, but the powerup system is HORRIBLY linear and forces the character to choose, instead of having the unknown variable of obtaining a good or bad powerup. This game fails on all points of that. Although it may be true that this game has only been out for less than half a year, the first binding of isaac has WAY more content, and it costs less than half of this game. There is no objective whatsoever, and don't you dare tell me that the \"quests\" that pop up after every stage is an incentive for me to continue playing this game, because it is not. This game even fails to even incorporate a minimap, a key aspect in ANY rogue-like games. \n\nI am deeply sorry for whoever bought this game for more than $15 just to finish it in less than 2 hours.
