Mechanics are thin. Not worth the library clutter or waste of time.\n\nSeries of mini-events in which you can usually adopt a response that follows a stealth/charisma/brute force kind of approach and at which you can be more, or less, successful at based on how you answered early game character creation questions, and potentially RNG although I dont really know either way. Engine is all white background, black text, simple buttons. No audio or illustrations. Does not seem to be much of a game, scripting wise, to determine success or failure or allow more freedom, which you would sort of expect on a PC version of this format of entertainment. All in all pretty disappointing with a fairly derivative, \"famous thief\" plot, trying to outprestige each other. Sigh. Kind of annoying to get to the end, fail a roll for unknown reasons, and be forced to either quit or click through all the dialogue all over again, replay value is lower than you'd expect.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504732762, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505073960, "recommendationid": "34783383", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 17, "total_reviews": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
