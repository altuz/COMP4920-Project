I think this should be closer to $10-12. This is mostly based on the length of the game. \n\nFirst let me start with what I didn't like. Opening doors. It felt like a real pain in the butt most of the time. Eventually I learned that there were some doors that I could open partway and forcably walk through without having to spend ages dragging my mouse. \n\nI was kind of bummed with the length of the game for the price tag. I've played 'meatier' games for $5 so I would have really liked to see a bit more. What was there was very well done in my opinion. Maybe I can keep my fingers crossed for a possible DLC with some back story about the family and it's journey through the generations with the curse. :)\n\nI found the controls while handling the axe or hairspray-torch to feel a little clunky. But I did like that I could still interact with objects while holding them. I just had to be careful or I would drop them a lot. \n\nThere were lots of things I did like. The graphics, the ambience/atmosphere, looking for those pesky matryoshkas, chasing achievements, and the story. I even found a piece of poop that I could pick up and fling to appease my inner primate. Oddly satisfying. But I digress. \n\nThe jump scares were a little meh for me, but I'm pretty desensitized to them so I don't fault the Devs for that. That being said, I found the artwork for the monster to be quite well done and very scary. I would not want to ever see that thing in real life. Yikes. \n\nI liked being able to interact with almost everything. I got to briefly relive one of my fond memories of Amnesia: Dark Descent by flinging books and random objects wildly around the room.... I really like to fling things! Don't judge me!\n\nAt the end sequence, the game broke. :( Luckily, I was able to return to the main menu and reload without having to kill the exe. Bonus points because I'm lazy. After I reloaded though, my mouse sensitivity felt broken. I turned it all the way up and noticed no difference, it was really hard to turn or look anywhere. Eventually, it sort of fixed itself in time for the ending sequence again. It went ok the second time so I didn't have to reload. <3\n\nI'm still processing the ending. It wasn't amazing and it wasn't terrible. So instead of 'Whoa!!' my reaction was more of a introspective 'Hmmmm...' because it sort of tied the pieces of the story together. Spoopy but not terrifying. \n\nAll in all, I had a good time and will probably play this a few more times for achievements and cards. I look forward to supporting future projects from these Devs. :)\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504699697, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504699697, "recommendationid": "34774269", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547728", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504835601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 114, "steamid": "76561197991269066", "num_games_owned": 202}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I've been waiting for this game since last year, and was happy to have it finally come out. I was hoping to play it as my first VR horror experience, but after its release date got pushed back a few times, Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul ended up taking its place. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite stack up to my experience with that, but it IS a pretty darn creepy game by its own right!\n\nThe game sort of feels on-rails at times, taking you on a tour of the house rather than encouraging you to explore. You have a cell phone that will buzz to let you know where to go next, and doors that squeak open mysteriously as well. Most of the time, you are lighting candles in the dark hallways and just getting a feel for the mansion and the growing dread as the excellently done sound work has you looking over your shoulder within the first fifteen minutes, even though nothing major has happened.\n\nThere aren't too many encounters in the game, but when they do happen you are thoroughly freaked out. That said, the ending was definitely my favorite bit, and gave me the chills.\n\nBeing brand new, there are a few bugs that could be worked out. I'd like to have a way to carry more than just the cell phone on my hip, like the map, for instance. I'd also like the option to run, as the super slow walking locomotion, while appreciated, is just mind numbing when you're back-tracking for stuff you've missed.\n\nI do recommend the game, especially now that we're closer to the spooky season.

Price point is a no brainer, especially since the overall length of the story is maybe slightly shorter the PA but pretty close to the same.  PA does offer actual danger however where this game is just you progressing forward with maybe two or three scripted scares.
