I have played the first one and so far from what I have seen the core gameplay and campaign havent varied from it, so I will just take my experience from there over here in matters of which I am sure have not changed.\n\nThe game is brutal stragety. No RNG. If you lose its not the computers or the games fault, just yours. Matches against the computer ar fair, the AI doesnt \"cheat\" and matches in multiplayer are always an interesting experience. The tutorial gives you the basics, but some things you have to figure out on your own. Playing against pros usually teaches you some new tricks, even if you have been in the game for a while. So how does this game work? You have a bunch of different units, all with unique skills (Sniper good at long range, shotgun good at short range, rocket guy goes BOOM! and so on). You give orders to these units, for example move there while aiming there. You can also give orders to the enemy units. Then you simulate what WOULD happen if the enemy moves exactly the way you expect it to. You can simulate and give orders to infinity until you are happy. Then you click on the button to actually activate your actions and once the enemy has done this as well (auto against AI) you see the actual results. The closer it is to what you expected and planned for, the more damage you usually do. You win if you kill all enemies or capture certain things, depending on which mode you are playing. All the modes also have a \"Light\" and \"Dark\" version. In Light you see the enemy units. In Dark you see them at the beginning and then after that you can only guess where they are (which can get your heart pumpin if its coming down to an all or nothing one on one hunt). The music is nice, I personally can't agree with the \"OMG SO AWESOME!\" that the others rate it though, it fits the futuristic style of the game though. The looks are also futuristic, but...I dont know why, but I kind of dislike the way the game looks. Its very subtle and experience will of course vary with others. There is a pretty lenghty campaign with a story that has rather confused me more than anything else so far, but I guess if I read every single text I probably would understand more of it, since the game gives a LOT of background information about its world. The campaign also contains some gameplay features that arent in the multiplayer, for whatever reason. Since the multiplayer matches are turn-based it sometimes takes weeks to finish a match because the opponent goes offline. Once you are in the game and while you are in the game you will be told if in one of the games you are playing a new turn has occured. The controls with the keyboard are a bit clumsy and I would reccomend using the mouse and maybe one or two keyboard buttons for functions that you use often. All in all, if you like a game that is really nothing more than simple strategy I can totally reccomend this. \n\nNow to the comparison:\nThe game looks a lot different. While I dont like the new looks I like them more than the old ones. Sometimes the old looks were just TOO simplistic for my taste and left room for interpretation. With the new looks I know exactly whats going and to going to go on. There is also a killcam now, which is fun to watch so far, expecially since in the old game I sometimes had \"how the hell did that kill me?\" moments. the controls are...worse? better? I cant tell. I think they could have been done better in both games. I have to say that it is a lot easyer to give orders while waiting though. The best addition really is the new order. You can tell your unit to always look at a certain spot even when moving. So now you dont have to change the field of view every few steps, which in my opinion was a much needed update. One thing, that I am wondering though: where did the riotshielders go? I never figured out how to use them in the old game anyway, but they could have at least used them here as well, without DLC. I havent quite figured out the new arena mode yet, so far it just seems like a normal match on a pretty large map to me. One thing I am uncapable of finding is the chat in multiplayer. If they removed: MY GOD WHY? If they didnt: where is it? A change of look that I am liking is the.. I'm just going to call it interface, of the campaign. Where you view background information and talk to people. I just..looks better in my opinion. Now to the main question: \"Should I buy it if I already own the original?\" Cant answer that one, I know I am glad I did it, but that is, hoping, that there will a couple of updates on this game.\n\nUPDATE:\nplayed again after a while and from I have seen the multiplayer is fucking dead. so if ya buy it, do it for local play and singeplay", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1416000484, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1426174402, "recommendationid": "12941934", "language": "english", "votes_down": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543929", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1416504824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 464, "steamid": "76561198037405698", "num_games_owned": 375}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 31, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I have very mixed feelings.

I HOPE THIS DOESNT CHANGE THE VEIW FOR NEW COMING PLAYERS, IT IS A GREAT GAME.

(thinking about who installments work-) they must have alot of new features too, like maybe a suppression option, new campaign, and maybe even a new unit.\" so, without second thought, I bought the game with alittle extra steam money left over from I dont even know.\nafter loading it up, i took to the campaign to play the tutorial and see what was in store for me. after the loading screen went through, I was placed in the game with the same AI that was with me the first time. the tutorial looked different. saying to myself,\"ok, shows that they work on the game maybe.\" I found that the game layout made me press weird buttons to open up menus. For instance, I have to press \"X\" to open the menu that allows you to change where your aiming, ducking, etc. , and then the \"F\" button does something that changes how you move or something, they never really went over that much. you still have to double click to place movement. on the plus side, its easier to see whether someone is disengaged or ducking. all in all the annoyances outweigh the easy-ness, making the controls very uninviting compared to the last. now, getting tired of writing, ill put it sumple, the campaign is exactly the same as the old one, they didnt change a thing. they only added the strafe (basicly aim but the point is fixed) and check, which is a quick aim that automaticly goes back in a second. stick with the original.\n\nNEW PEOPLE REVEIW\n\nDespite what i said before, this really is an awesome game. I am inept at describing things but here i go. frozen synapse prime is a game in which you are an AI that controls a group of robot soilders and you and others are trying to take down an evil corparation. In this game, you control a group of up to six soilders usually, you can pick where each of them go, how they move where they look, etc. the catch is, they cant see anything other than their feild of veiw, you control their every move in a very detailed way, it is amazing. usually the objective is to either clear the map, or get to a base. In multiplayer you must outsmart your opponent to win. If you become skilled enough you can combine different actions to look behind corners, pop up out of cover to have someone be able to get a shot on them and duck back down before they hit you, etc. It is a very fun game I do reccomend it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1416867690, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1416867690, "recommendationid": "13072392", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505908", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429525527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 46, "steamid": "76561198047249585", "num_games_owned": 256}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A much prettier frozen synapse, featuring more blood and kill cams :D\n\nControls can feel unresponsive at times but overall I think it fun.\n\nthis is ported from the ps vita.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1416542307, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1416542307, "recommendationid": "13023442", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499755", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443924583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 373, "steamid": "76561198092295564", "num_games_owned": 315}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "1", "review": "At the moment, there is not much reason to buy this over the original. If you already own the original, then you're probably better off just keeping the original.\n\nThat being said, this game does have some nice touches: it has all the charm of the original game, and plays a bit more realistically (you can't just have units spasm between looking in multiple directions) and the music is mostly the same, with a few new additions.\n\nThe controls are interesting. I think that they could be better since this is a passable port right now, but I'm pretty sure they'll be improved in the future.\n\nI do wish for a way to enable higher-contrast graphics or something to make the walls pop out more from the floor, though.

And some bugs\n\n1. The first hour is a pain, you have to get used to the 'bad port'. Almost every possible bad port syndrome are here\n     - no decent graphic options\n     - no rebindable controls\n     - big ass texts \n     - .... \nBut since the game is relativly simple (controle/graphic wise) it's still acceptable\n\n2. The gameplay itself is pretty cool. I spent about 8h playing with a friend. We had a good time. \n\n3. Some strange bugs happend at some points. here is 3 of them that was game breaking\n     - Some times if you play 'live'  the sync between players broke, and you have to exit to the main menu to get the notification of the new turn\n     - in 1 game, One my guy died,  and resurected on the last round, to kill my friend's last guy .... pretty raging\n     - in 1 other game, we had a really desynched game, where I killed one of his guy, but for him the guy was still alive... I've been able to finish the game, and it crashed.\n\n\nSo I Put a \"recommand\" on the game. Because I Had mostly some fun with the game. But keep in mind that you'll probably get some raging moment too.
