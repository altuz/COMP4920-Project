The game itself is quite challenging. Like most brawlers the enemies are recycled with different abilities. There are zombies that walk, crawl, run at you, barf acid on you, even zombie dogs like in resident evil, zombies that are fire that explode a bit after you kill them so be sure to give them some space after taking them down. Also there are landmines tha you can coax zombies to run over that blow them up, just be sure not to walk over them. lol Its a litle more difficult when there are landmines and a horde of zombies running after you. But you can fire a shock wave at them to thin them out pretty quickly, but that needs to be replentished, which is a nice touch, surprisingly theres a lot of thining and strategy in this game. I haven't played this game much, just got it for 40% off and glad I did, at first it kinda sucked, hard controls etc. But the level up and coin system is pretty cool. Graphics arent bad but aren't really great either, but the smoke and rain effects really do look cool in a 3D backdrop. I LOVE the back ground music, I find myself nodding my head as I play! This is a very unique game directed at a very small audience. Theres not much play time to finish the game, but for the price I do feel it warrants a buy and see.

It features a female band that are like a cross between the Runaways and some band from an anime cartoon, it has a lot of cool hard rock/heavy metal reference and music (all made by the game developers, there isn't any licensed music in the game), and it has a very cool 80's like horror vibe to it.  However, it has a few flaws that hurt the game.  The controls on the 360 gamepad aren't very responsive at times, the saves are stored in the registry rather in a directory on the hard drive so if you're like me and use CCLeaner quite a bit to clean out trash, you'll lose the progress you've made in the game, and the achievements don't unlock on Steam until after you exit the game so some may think you're using SAM since you could have 8 achievements that are unlocked and all at the same exact time.  I was hoping that the devs would release a patch that would allow saves to be synced on the cloud, that way when CCleaner is run the saves would merely be restored when syncing up with the Steam cloud, and I was hoping they'd make the achievements unlock on Steam as they are unlocked in the game but no such luck.\n\nHowever, if those issues aren't issues in your eyes and you dig campy 80's horror, zombies, and hard rock/metal themes, you may want to check out the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456179679, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456179679, "recommendationid": "21394654", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446517397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 246, "playtime_forever": 386, "steamid": "76561197978705200", "num_games_owned": 1533}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Like B-movies, I tend to gravitate towards games that look like total shlock. Maybe I'll discover an unpolished diamond, or maybe I'll end up with Rock Zombie. I probably shouldn't complain too much, because thanks to this game, I got a foil card drop that sold for $8. That's more than triple what I paid for it and-oh wait. I'm a game reviewer, I'm supposed to complain too much.\n\nIt's that time of the year folks! It's another zombie apocalypse and only a trio of badass witches with guitars can save the day. The store page mentions Golden Axe and yep...you guessed it, Rock Zombie is nowhere near as good. I'm not even the biggest fan of Golden Axe, but it's still a competently-made hack & slash. Rock Zombie on the other hand suffers from a sincere lack of effort. It's like the developer actually tried to do as little as possible. \n\nLet's start with the characters. Zoe and Crystal (red & blue) look okay, but then Sasha (yellow) looks unfinished. She's definitely missing polygons, and certain textures (like her eyes) don't look right at all. Each of the gals has the exact same attack animations and moves. I think they also have the same voice, which really doesn't make any sense. To top it all off, while you can unlock clothes and weapons that boost stats, it doesn't really mean anything. Zombies take and do about as much damage as they always will, no matter how much health and strength you think you're supposed to have.\n\nDuring a zombie apocalypse, you expect the greatest threat to be the zombies, right? Oops. The zombies in this game are only here to waste your time, because you have to kill them all to progress. They'll do their meager little swings, and even attempt some groping maneuver, but you can clobber them easily with the guitar. Puking zombies are actually dangerous, but you can just hit them with the [i]Dragon Ball Z[/i] beam. There are also spiders and marines, but they're not even worth considering. Your moves auto-track, so as long as you're facing the general direction of an enemy, you'll hit them. The whole ordeal is so mind-numbing you'll be lulled into a stupor.\n\nThe bosses really aren't any better. The first guy is a puker, so you have to be careful, but I created a fool-proof strategy within seconds of fighting him. I call it the \"HORSESHOE OF UNDEATH\". Basically you hit the guy, run around him, hit him again, and run back the original position. Alternatively, just picture a clock going from 3 to 9 and then back again. This strategy is what I like to call \"TIME TO DIE (again)\". You don't want to mix the two, because it could be troublesome. The second boss is a giant spider, that does nothing but lay eggs. The third boss is beaten as easily as running up to him, hitting him, and then running away. The finale is \"difficult\" in the sense that the wonky hitboxes will cause you to take a lot of damage and probably die a few times. On the bright side, by the end of the game you should have more lives than you know what to do with.\n\nSo if the zombies are weenies and the bosses are pathetic, how could you even lose? Well, it might have something to do with all the crap on the ground. Land-mines, spider-webs, puke, and all sorts of other dangerous objects are just lying around for you to run onto. This game is so boring you're liable to be half asleep while you play, so you'll trip over everything. As I said, puking zombies are actually something to worry about. So if you run onto two mines and get vomited on, well that's a guaranteed death. \n\nEven then, I don't think that's any cause for alarm. There are plenty of extra lives to collect, and you get unlimited continues + game saves. The occasional death merely serves the purpose of reminding you that you're playing a videogame. This reminder tends to wear off quickly. Without any challenge, you'll fall back into the stupor, and mash buttons until the next accidental death. You can't even sucker a friend into playing this game with you. There is no co-op play of any sort, which is weird because the gals are perfectly color-coordinated for just such an event. \n\nThere are also vehicle sections, because of course this garbage game would have vehicle sections.\n\nI played through Rock Zombie twice.

I think i paid around $2.50 on sale. It was fine for one playthrough but i'll never play it again. \n\nCombat is ok but slow. Theres around 20 levels (i think) and some of them drag on forever. Also there is one type of enemy who pukes and your character takes an absurd amount of damage from. There's also only a handful of bosses which are fairly easy to kill. \n\nYou earn coins to get upgrades but everything is so minimal its a huge grindfest. Not only that but when you go to spend them everything is listed with \"???\" so you have no idea what youre paying for. On top of that, they throw in artwork and action figures in the same list too. \n\nThe story is ok and includes static comic book like images with text bubbles for cutscenes but many of them are horribly compressed or zoomed in. The music is generic butt rock. \n\nIf they sped up the combat, tweaked said puke enemy damage, shortened some levels and revealed the upgrades youre paying for it would be a better game. \n\n4/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488122358, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488122396, "recommendationid": "30198444", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502969901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 341, "steamid": "76561198107779127", "num_games_owned": 342}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game not bad", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502971569, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502971569, "recommendationid": "34305855", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496073", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449121715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 216, "steamid": "76561198034116281", "num_games_owned": 738}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Blah, blah, first impressions count, blah, blah, bad foot, blah, blah. But seriously, this game has gone out of its way to make me wonder why I even bought it, and (at the time of this writing) I've barely played it at all.\n\nThe keyboard controls are horrendous, stiff and unwieldly like a shopping cart stuffed with a cow being guided by one of those slow, lumbering push button robot abominations that the 1950s assured us we would all have in the space year of 1982. It still amazes me how people assume they can get away with making crap keyboard controls for a PC game (or port) simply because you can now easily plug controllers into a USB slot. If you're going to make a PC game and/or port, MAKE THE FRELLING KEYBOARD CONTROLS ACTUALLY WORK. Don't make me constantly have to fight with your crap just because you assume we all want to use a controller for every damnable game.\n\nSpeaking of fighting, the combat in this game are all about how poorly hit boxes are implemented. In a classic case of not knowing what they're actually doing, the devs (or maybe just dev, who knows) have committed the mortal sin of allowing an enemies hit box to extend to you, yet your hit box doesn't do the same when you're a very tiny fraction of a degree up or down from them. This also rears its ugly head when you're facing upwards or downwards, where I have literally whiffed more air than Mighty Casey despite being almost right on top of an enemy.\n\nThe landmines either have an alarmingly large hit box or their timers are much too short, because I have never once been able to set one off to explode and then gotten away without taking damage. Plus the person who decided to stick a landmine right in an area with heavy glare so I couldn't see it until it exploded in my face and killed me has a special place in my colon.\n\nSaid special place is open for the person who figured that this horrible, wannabe faux rock music blaring constantly was an excellent idea. You can literally not be able to throw a dime and not land on some tiny little indie rock band who would willingly pleasure you in very lewd, dehumanizing ways for a chance to have any kind of attention paid to their music outside of the rat hole gigs that they always have in some two bit dive provide you with some actual, passable rock music for your game.\n\nOh, and of course the game can spawn money, the thing you need to be able to unlock extras, outside of stage bounds. Try all you might, those coins will forever mock you.\n\nDespite all of this, I'm going to give the game more of a chance. Maybe I'll find some kind of treasure under all of this crap and have to revise this review. Or maybe it will simply pile even more onto me that will make this into an even more negative, bitter review.
