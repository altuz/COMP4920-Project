Is it worth it?\n\nWell, it's very early access, and some pretty obvious glitches are exposed in my first look gameplay video linked above.  However it seems to run and play smooth.  I haven't played nearly enough to see the depth of this game, but it looks to have a pretty deep and rewarding discovery crafting system and tons of different resources that you can collect.  \n\nThe infected (zombies) are much easier to kill then they are in Unturned, so this game is going to need to rely on PvP and other players to created a challenge if that's what you seek... at least at this very early point in development.  Right now, the balance seems to be on the \"easy\" side as mushrooms grow everywhere and can heal you for about 20% of your life.  The infected mobs would be lucky to get one hit on you, and just one of the over-abundance of red mushrooms could quickly fix that and have you running at 100% again.\n\nI will post more details about the online aspect of the game when I experience it, but when I played this game about an hour after it launched in early access, I seemed to be the only play online playing.\n\nAs I stated at the end of my video, I give the game about a 70% right now with what little i have experienced, and if the online aspect turns out to be as fun and smooth as my first hour alone, then that score could jump up because my \"value\" rating would go up for sure.\n\nDefinitely a 'two thumbs up' right now, but for those looking at the price in disgust, you might want to check out your free alternative here on Steam called \"Unturned\"\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430250963, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1430250963, "recommendationid": "15601397", "language": "english", "votes_down": 31, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500455", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464378547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 334, "steamid": "76561198105635631", "num_games_owned": 108}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "review": "authough this is a small game it has alot of thought put into it and shows alot of potential for a game worth alot more than it curently is, and as it is well worth purchasing already it can only get better", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435412714, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1435412714, "recommendationid": "16740218", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504508", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440643246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 623, "steamid": "76561198083541607", "num_games_owned": 76}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a defitanly a must buy just recorded a quick gameplay and the game was just awesome.

Starting off must say this game needs alotta work.\nThat being said, I was going to give a neg review before I realized the 64bit dont run correctly.\nSwitched to 32bit and could finally play.\nNow that I can play, I can see great potential in this game.\nWhat sold me was after eating a can of tuna, a couple of minutes later I FARTED. Yes my character broke wind.\nAnd it was an achievement. Clever.\n\nPros\n1) Great graphics even on low. Awesome on high.\n2) Really good lighting and shadowing. Climbimg ivy exquisite.\n3) World looks clean and polished-for the most part\n+ Has good texturing\n4) Has a great feel to the game\n5) Runs surprisingly smoothe...Did not expect that\n6) Appears to have a weather biome\n7) No (Sl)enderman...lol\n8) Definitely does not feel like Minecrap\n\nCons\n1) World gen needs sped up. Too slow. Buildings kinda odd shapes sometimes.\n2) Sometimes spawn above all and can't move and must exit after dying\n3) Better help guide (all though you will figure it out)\n4) User interface could use some tweeking\n5) 64bit will not run correctly. (looks worse than 32bit counterpart)\n6) Starts you with weapon that has no ammo\n7) Reticule goes away when using tool or weapon\n8) Not enough gamers supporting Indie games\n\nOverall\nI think this is an up and coming title and more people need to geet it for support.\nI will buy this for my friends to show my support.\nI do believe this game can eventually go toe to toe with Minecrap\n\nSo in conclusion Dev, good job.\n---LDK\n\nPS- Would really like full controller supprt :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440656048, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1440656249, "recommendationid": "17734036", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505292", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443717726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561198242161712", "num_games_owned": 202}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "2", "review": "At the present time, this game is basically unplayable for me.
