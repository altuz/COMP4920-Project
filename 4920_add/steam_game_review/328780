The vampires will day in the sunlight so you will have to rotate the rooms around and make their path safe. The game will instruct and build up slowly for you so you will get the hang of it. There is a timer and rotate award. Completing it within X ammount of turns or time will grant you an award. There is bronze, silver and gold. So the only thing what you will do is to make sure the vampires will make their way to the exit by avoiding sunlight and other deadly things. They will keep walking forward.\n\nOkay replayability.\nOkay graphics.\nAlot of levels.\nBronze-Gold award on each level.\nSlowly build up.\nVery repetitive and could get boring quickly.\n\n\n[h1]Other things.[/h1]\n\nIf you are into lemmings you will like it, but i would recommend to get a discount none the less.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 4/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502926152, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502926200, "recommendationid": "34296145", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509116", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
