Initially the game wasn't great, the menu navigation and UI wasn't amazing, but after playing around with it for a while you get the hang of it and are able to move between sections easily. Whilst the graphics aren't great I don't think that's what this game is about. The in game player base is awesome with great depth. The match mechanics are okay, not a big fan but if you get the hang of the plays and what not it can be quite fun.\n\nSo yeah that's a broad look at the game. The killers for me however are more minute.\n\nThere's a few big problems IMO. First and foremost is the unrealistic simulated games. You can have a team of 'World Class' players and lose to a team of 'Nationals'. Look I know Rugby and I know you can't count anyone out and what not but this lead to a lot of head scratching from me.\n\nSome players are not up to date; e.g. Duane Vermeulan was argueably the best player in the world this year and he's rated as 'International'. So yeah there's a few cases like that, some players over rated and other underated. Which once again left me scratching my head.\n\nSometimes I felt as though my team simply sucked for no reason. I would have an awesome back line, they would have a crap one, set my tactics to play a more expansive game, and strangely, I lost. More head scratching...\n\nOverall though it's a fun game to play, if you're not a rugby fan, don't buy this unless it's on sale, I don't feel like you'll get $40 worth of satisfaction. I'll continue to play this game and learn more about the mechanics (still learning!). \n\nCons\n- Confusing/clustered UI\n- Unrealistic results\n- Some players not up to date\n- Bad graphics\n- One or two crashes\n- Players brought up through the 'Colts' and 'Academy' when selected for international duty don't have a name unless edited\n\nPros\n- In depth teams\n- Aweosme development of your players through your teams system\n- Accurate coaching system\n\n\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418204150, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1418204150, "recommendationid": "13303417", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530025", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442054331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 822, "steamid": "76561197968765147", "num_games_owned": 9}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Interesting first attempt, and given time I reckon this could become a really strong series for rugby fans.

Particular highlights include the colts system - being able to bring young players through and shape them into world class players is what will keep me playing in the long term, and the player stats are generally not too bad, with the editor there for those which are questionable.\n\nFor me the biggest negative is the interface, which is frankly a bit of a mess and needs some serious thought going into it. The game really doesn't flow very well, and there is a pretty steep learning curve to be overcome.\n\nI've also noticed that the number of knock ons and penalties in a game is incredibly high, not sure if I'm doing something wrong but surely you shouldn't have to manually give a command to make players release the ball at every ruck, I'm currently seeing about 10 penalties against me per game for this and its beyond frustrating.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game, as it is a very strong first effort which will only get better with incremental updates and I hope the developers will listen to the feedback they receive\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420040189, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1420040189, "recommendationid": "13739667", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505570", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475076640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 33344, "steamid": "76561198028289632", "num_games_owned": 73}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great first effort and the best rugby manager game by a long shot.

Despite being under no pressure.\n\nWhen your own fly-half kicks the chase is always horrendous and if their 15 runs at you he will normally do very well.\n\nTHis is a real pain as the second issue is that turn-overs from rucks are extremely rare and I have Sam Warburton playing 7 every game!!!!!!  I have also on instances driven the oppostion back from my 22 to theirs without gaining possession The issue with this is that the computer can have possession for almost an entire 1/2 especially if you win it back to just knock on! More turnovers are essential.\n\nThe game also doesn't notice things like the touch line when running or when a player is blatantly isolated.\n\nFor some reason when it gets to 80 or 40 mins even if you are 5m out from opp try line your fly half will kick the ball dead.  Not useful when you are on 3 trys and need the 4th for a bonus point.\n\nWhen players make a clean break through the line they will often stop and pass to a heavily marked player rather than continuing themselves (this has cost me several games/bonus points)  or they will not give the ball when there is a ridiculous overlap that is guarenteed a score.\n\nIt is very intermittent as to whether a player will try to but the ball down between the sticks after crossing the line unapposed, \n\nThere also seem to be some really basic back moves that seem to end up with a try.  Especially as some defenders run all sorts of crazy lines that completely miss all the attackers.\n\nFinally the back row never break off the scrum.  This ties into the point above, especially during a blindside move as it creates a ridiculous overlap.\n\nSO in conclusion this is a very good game and I do enjoy it greatly.\n\nHowever with the bugs/glitches mentioned above I don't believe it is currently worth it's premium price as the bugs glitches do somewhat ruin it, especially when games are tight and you feel like the computer is just cheating you.\n\nEdit: So as mentioned above the dev has issued an update that introduces more turnovers etc to the game that does give it a better feel.  There are still of course other bugs present still but the developer is continuing to update the game and is committed.
