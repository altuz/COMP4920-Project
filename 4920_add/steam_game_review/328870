The match engine is fine, it has more to do with the interface. One example is when you go to draft a player in the NBA draft, only to see no players available. Deselecting a position in the player filter and reselecting fixes this, but it can lead to some confusion.\n\n[Strike]More annoying is you will occasionally get an exception error while playing. My recommendation is to click okay, save, and then quit and restart the game. This has been an issue with 3 as well, but as the game is updated these bugs get narrowed out. Unfortunately I was unable to get the gamecast function to work as this error would occur every time. 2D play works fine, or you can quick sim. Hope they fix that.[/Strike] [b]EDIT: The crossed out issues can be fixed if you run the game as an administrator.[/b]\n\nYou can expand the league to new cities if you wish (Seattle and Las Vegas are the default new cities), or you can customize the game settings to your liking. Real rosters are included, though team names and logos are different. But that's fine for me, since real players are all I wanted to begin with. You can also generate random players.\n\nPlaying games or quick-simming them is an option, and there is a full free agency period and coach hiring phase as well. There is some commentary during the draft, though it can be a bit buggy if trades pop up after a selection is made.\n\nCoaching is well done, and you can play as both a coach and GM, or as either alone. Your owner will have expectations for you in GM mode, though you can disable GM firings if you wish.\n\nOnce you get the hang of the new interface (quite different from 3 and 2) it seems to navigate well.\n\nThe market is quite shallow for good basketball management sims (World Basketball Simulator is not worth recommending). This and the 2K series are your best bets.\n\nI enjoy this franchise immensely, so give it a shot if a deep management sim is what you're looking for.
