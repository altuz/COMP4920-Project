Most of the time you're adventuring with punctuated periods of Hidden Object finding. The Hidden Object stuff is better than pixel-hunting as things are usually out in the open. When they're not, it's because you have to perform a series of actions to create the necessary object. (e.g. load a pistol with a bullet to fire it at a target so that you can pick up a \"target with a bullet hole\".)\n\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect is that some of the objects you find are important parts of the plot. This is MUCH more satisfying than your classic pixel-hunt nonsense that ultimately made adventure games so unpopular.\n\nThe story is chick-flick/romance clap-trap for teenage girls and lonely women, but if you can look past it you'll have some fun. You start in a space setting (fun!) but eventually move to a medieval setting after you \"crash land\". Again, just chillax, don't take it too seriously, and you'll have a good time.\n\nI got this game on sale and thought it was a fun way to waste five hours. You will probably enjoy this game if you're a huge fan of adventure games, hidden object games, a casual player trying to relax, or if you fit within the target female demographic. Anyone looking for an epic story or hardcore action should probably pass.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417385979, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1417386114, "recommendationid": "13171737", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557877", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480546848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 220, "playtime_forever": 86, "steamid": "76561197988012862", "num_games_owned": 3564}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "First impression: not really bad as a hidden object game, but it is marred by technical problems.

The ambience is good and it has a nice soundrack, although the graphics are basic and it's well stocked with grammatical errors and mis-named items. There is no voice acting. It contains some of the hardest puzzles I've encountered in a HO game in a while and I found myself skipping a couple to avoid the time I knew it would take me to solve them. The story is, at least, different to the standard HO fare, which makes a change and adds to its appeal. It would be hard to recommend at full price but given that it can be had for a few pennies on sale it's worth grabbing at the reduced price if you need something to while away a few hours.
