Prior to this I played fritz 5.32 as white and Windows chess as black. In friend mode the program is quite sharp without being impossible. I've only played 3 games so far and each of them was very instructive. Fritz pushes the margin and makes you think. It doesn't play mechanically where you have to survive 20 moves then it makes an obvious blunder. It plays a full game and not a gauntlet you have to survive through. The 3d chess pieces and manual board orientation offers the perfect viewing angle as if you yourself were leaning over a chess board pondering.\n\nIt offers a lot of tools for practice and such but I play chess for fun and am not too critical. The evaluation profile window and the main engine window with the control board are staples of fritz for reviewing your games to see how you did. For positions where you don't understand why the computer uses the line it does in the main engine window you can use the analysis options to analyse a given position and it will show the branches saying why this and that doesn't work.\n\nThe only downside to Fritz for Fun 13 is it only supports one core. The only real downside to that is you can't use the 8 core Houdini engine to evaluate an opening in great depth and see what works and what doesn't(This is assuming you know the basic openings e.g. kings gambit declined, pirc, english, dutch ect.). You can get around that however by downloading the Arena GUI and running 8 core houdini from that.\n\nConclusion: Perfect game if you like playing chess for fun; this is to say you play to match your wits against the computer and not to memorize chess databases and pantomime.\n\nAfter playing 13 games against the engine I found the friend mode to be too soft compared with fritz 5.32. You can blunder your way through a game and still win. With 5.32 I've played about 500 games and win on average 1 in 5. With fritz 13 I've played 13 games and have won 4 and lost 1. The longest time spent on one move might be 5 minutes. Longest game might be 20 minutes. I've played 50 minute games against 5.32 because it creates more difficult positions and if you make a single mistake you lose unless you are better than the base engine which I am not. Also it seems the fritz 13 engine has disappeared entirely. I only have the option to use the fritz 6 engine. The only way I have been able to get it back is to do a second install with the setup file which spreads files across multiple hard-drives.\n\nI played another game against fritz and lost my queen at the beginning of the game and was down -6 and still managed to end up with a draw. I think I was even +3 eventually. I played another game where I had hanging pieces(trying out a new chess set) and the computer didn't capture them. Brutally obvious captures on the control board the computer ignores.\n\nAside from the generosity of fritz there is one particular position that I have difficulty playing against computers and that is roaming queen positions. e.g. Rook, minor piece, 2 pawns vs a queen with other pawns on the board. It's difficult simply because of the number of moves a queen can make on an open board and the computer calculates them all instantly. e.g. move 1 it can make five viable moves. Move two it can make 5 viable moves from each of its previous 5 viable moves. Continuing with induction by move 4 there is 625 move combinations(identifying the permutations is labor intensive). Harmonizing pieces and taking advantage of the fact the queen can't be traded still results in a difficult position where one of 625 possible positions being a fork can result in a loss. There is no end game exercise for this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434580526, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438460644, "recommendationid": "16483817", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508403", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486097613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 302, "playtime_forever": 1092, "steamid": "76561198043346855", "num_games_owned": 226}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The best chess program I've ever used.

You get the Fritz interface which is great and has with lots of options and utilities. The engines it comes with are single core but still very strong. You can easily install any UCI engines you want and there are plenty of good ones out there like Houdini 1.5, Komodo 4, Stockfish etc. You might want liquid cooling if you run all of your cores though - they get pretty warm looking at 10 million positions/second.

I prefer a program to remove everything (files, registry entries etc.) when you uninstall.
