What I expected was a metrovania game where you're a deer.  What I got was -Super Run to The Right The Game-. Never before have I been so disappointed by running to the right for 2.7 hours.   Fortuntely, the game was short and sweet.  I beat it in about 2.7 hours and will never return to play it again.\n\nOn the positive, it looks like someone put a lot of heart into this game and I respect that.  The game has some beautiful areas and an easy listening soundtrack.  If you're looking for a casual, peaceful gaming experience and don't mind the repetitive nature of runnig to the right for a few hours, this game is for you.  If you're looking for a deep gameplay experience and excitment, perhaps you should move along to another game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499490755, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499490940, "recommendationid": "33363720", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516845", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 87, "total_reviews": 147, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 60}}
