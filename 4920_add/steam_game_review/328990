This was neat. I enjoyed watching my difficulty level go up as I played the game.\n-Several weapon choices to choose from. This was also quite neat.\n-Fresh spawns of enemies frequently. This keeps me busy.\n\nCONS:\n-This isn't flashy at all. This is simple, elementary gameplay.\n-There is... Quite honestly... Only one type of enemy.\n-The game is beaten extraordinarily fast. There is little to no replay value.\n-Several things are NOT explained in the game. This is bad.\n-The music you hear in the trailer? Yeah... That's not in the game.\n\nEssentially, you are a... Human? With an arsenal of weaponry. You're trying to kill the Alien Race. This is nothing special. Nothing spectacular. There is no such thing as a \"Story\" in this game. Period.\n\nThe weaponry is basic and nearly everything is the same. It's nothing to gawk over. Different fire rates... Different power levels... But essentially the same weapon.\n\nThis game will be beaten once, then probably never played again, unless you thoroughly enjoy this type of game.\n\nOverall.... 6-7/10, but ONLY for the price it is listed at. I can probably milk an hour, hour and half out of this game. I highly doubt I will get much more.\n\nEDIT: This game is currently experiencing crashes. I'll update my review at a later time when these crashes are no longer persistent. Unfortunately, I will need to change my \"Recommend\" to a \"Negative\" Due to this aspect hindering gameplay.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414455990, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1414456681, "recommendationid": "12663248", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572828", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1414454518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 55, "steamid": "76561198024559107", "num_games_owned": 223}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 29, "comment_count": "6", "review": "Beat it in 20 minutes. The \"campaign\" is about 10 levels.

Not worth even on sale for $3.50. Maybe 0.99 cents it would be worth.\nKoya Rift has a a bug where everytime you access the weapon color details page it crashes when you exit it.\n\nThe only thing that would extend this game would be to have more upgrades for your character and with that an endless survival mode.

Adaptable difficulty, randomly created maps, upgradeable weapons, and multiple playstyles. The core game starts out tactical but can turn into a power trip with some careful upgrade choices. With that said, simply bumping up the difficulty(via Battle Mode) or hinder your upgrades will create a truly difficult experience. \n\nI saw a few reviews condemn the shorter campaign length I thought it fit with the overall idea of the game. The game has a fantastic pick up and play mentality that seeps into the campaign as well as emphasis is placed on replaying the game. Taken straight from the store page, \"[Koya Rift] is built around circular, adaptive gameplay that emphasizes replay value.\" As a parent I don't have several hours to drop into a game anymore. Being able to play a quick session here and there fits into my lifestyle so much better than longer sessions and the quick campaign means I can actually finish the game in a reasonable time frame. \n\nThere are a couple of bugs but the developer is active in the Steam Discussions and says they are being worked on.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415276058, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1415276058, "recommendationid": "12814952", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494485", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421437215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198083972252", "num_games_owned": 325}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this is shit dont fall for the low pirce", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415420045, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1415420045, "recommendationid": "12838419", "language": "english", "votes_down": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459797", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
