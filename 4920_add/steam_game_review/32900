I Bought this second version with high hopes and was pleased with the new campaign. \n\nSomething i was disappointed in was the lack of improvement in graphics between the first and second version. Some better graphics would make this game so much more satisfying to play nowadays. The graphics seem arcaic when played today.\n\nOtherwise the game is highly recommended by me. It is very enjoyable and it works well."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505784341, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502598", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35055942", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041671894", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1491441025, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5567}, "timestamp_updated": 1505784341, "received_for_free": false, "review": "First off Do Not Buy the first game. Buy this 1 it comes with the first game and basicaly adds an exspanssion to the first game. This game comes with the full first game. That said this game was a fun game for $20 however I bought the first game and played it first was quite dissapointed to find out this game has both 1 and 2."}]}
