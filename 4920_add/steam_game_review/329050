Back when i was still playing DMC 3 special edition, still playing to this day, i've always thought that vergil was a very cool character to play as but back then he had his limitation like: with his judgement cut hold time. When DMC 4 came out i was super excited for its special edition, though we had to wait a long time. I mean DMC 4 has one of the best combat systems of the franchise. i always thought of how fun to play as vergil with this kind of style. Now the only downside for me about this game is the overly high graphics which kind of makes my game lag like loads. However despite all that it is a very good game. Its a great game definately recommend if you like games that has loads of action, cool game play and making huge combos which in my book i consider as an art all on its own.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505026906, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505026906, "recommendationid": "34855052", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505650", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505392269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 8437, "steamid": "76561198061810788", "num_games_owned": 243}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really enjoyed the game because not only it kinda reminded me the DmC 1 for PS2 console but i loved it's story, graphics and it's whole new content.

How come didn't they even touch in the worst parts of the game?\n\n- The camera is mindnumbingly dreadful, especially in small rooms where there are bunch of enemies with powerful ranged attacks. \n\n- Platforming sucks! It is terrible with the new characters and with awful camera issues I mentioned above.\n\nAnd okay, they added really fun-to-play three characters and some cool costumes... But really, DMC 4 do have some gameplay issues and repetitiveness. Especially the latter one is the worst part of the game. While in the vanilla form you have to face each of the bosses THREE TIMES, now in order to unlock new costumes you HAVE TO DO IT WITH EVERY CHARACTER!!! And you do this with no tiniest variation in the level design (except some indispensable addings on the platforming sections).\n\nPlus, I really expected more GAMEPLAY content from this pack like:\n-one or two new cool combos for Nero and Dante\n-at least one extra boss (It would be awesome if this was Vergil)\n-one or two new type of enemies that are compatible with the gameplays of Lady, Trish and Vergil \n-new attack types from the vanilla enemies\n-and hell, at least 1 unique level to each character! Would it be really too hard?\n\nIt almost make no sense when you beat the original story with Nero and Dante facing the same bosses three times, and you pick up Vergil beat the same bosses three times again. You cannot feel any connection, the barely existing story line obviously is not making too much sense.
