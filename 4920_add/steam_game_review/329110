I want to cover four quick points.\n\n[h1]Lack of balance part 1 - the reason for nearly all negative reviews here (and a workaround!)[/h1]\n\nIn Gems of War the primary gameplay is broken down into games you either play against AI created teams in a variety of scenarios, or in games you play against real teams created by other players that the AI controls. The balance for the AI created teams is a bit messed up. It starts out trivially easy but scales up incredibly rapidly and caps at around level 50. The problem is that you'll soon find yourself unable to effectively compete against the AI teams. At this point it seems lots of people decide it's either go pay-to-win or call it quits.\n\nThere's a much better solution. Go play PvP. PvP will pair you against more fairly matched teams. You'll get better rewards and be able to continue leveling up your cards and team. Since the AI team scaling stops at level 50, by the time you come back to it - it'll be a cake walk. It's counter intuitive but yeah. Start by playing against AI teams and then after that do PvP until you're ready to face the AI...\n\n\n[h1]Lack of balance part 2 - the fun is strictly capped[/h1]\n\nThe cards in the game are in no way balanced or is there any major attempt to balance them. Rarer cards tend to do everything less rare cards do... and more... and better. The problem is that this strictly caps the room for creative team design. You are left to take your best/rarest cards, add a mana generator (turning gems of a certain color into the one your 'win card(s)' need), and that's pretty much going to crush any other team you could make. This is really fun at first when you're regularly finding more rarer cards and your decks are constantly shifting and changing in new and interesting ways. But as you start to collect most of the top cards - the fun starts to stop. Suddenly there's not much to look forward to, and since less rare cards tend to just be worse in every possible way there's not really any sort of room for creative team design. \n\n[h1]Monetization - you can, but don't need to and I wouldn't want to[/h1]\n\nThe major 'grab' in this game is chasing the carrot of rarer cards. With real money you can buy these cards - or at least keys to chests that give you a very high chance of getting them. However, everything relevant that you can buy you can earn through regular play as well. I actually find this a bit frustrating. I'd love to toss the developers a few dollars since I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this game, but just about everything you can buy is going to just decrease the hours of enjoyment you can have with the game. A recurring problem with free to play games that don't just focus on aesthetics purchases.\n\n[h1]Overall - Great game.[/h1]\n\nOverall yeah, give it a go. It's by a wide margin the most fun I've had in this sort of game and there's hundreds of hours of entertainment in this game for those that enjoy the fundamental gameplay.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488123687, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488123687, "recommendationid": "30198941", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529640", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506543294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23988, "steamid": "76561198007273271", "num_games_owned": 126}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I saw this game on my friend's profile and saw that he has over 200 hours logged on it.

So player is either have to lose fight after fight to far better equipped ai(about 3 times better) or cough out some cash to keep up with ai difficulty. And since this game do not require particularly complex ai, there is absolutely no reason for it. That instead of making ai battles scalable based on player team strength and difficulty. \nAi level apparently scales with player level, its half of player level value. Problem is that player level means little to none(aside of small chance to gain extra mana from select color). So now i hit lvl26 and my band of misfits(1 lvl7 rare, 2 lvl6 rares and 1 lvl5 common) are faced by lvl13 ai teams that include highest rarity units on a regular basis. Essentially im nearing ceiling that non-paying player can reach, as player do not receive anywhere near sufficient resources to upgrade his cards to keep up with this moronic ai level progression system. Id love to play this game, but since ai is close to 4 times more powerful than my team, its just loss after loss after loss. Latest explore game - ai team total attack power is 39, my team is 17.\nThere is also pvp, but it suffers from same problem, as vs ai, with players who spent some cash will have considerably better troops of higher level.\nNot to mention that system feels(i might be wrong, i used sample of 81 battles) to be rigged to favor ai in battle, as chance for beneficial drops for ai were 62% vs 45% for human player.

Is there anybody who always wins in blackjack or poker? No, obviously not, you've got to lose occasionally. Do you get mad when you lose? Sure. Does it make you stop playing? No, not really. So, just get over it. There are some bad boards when you will lose no matter what you do. The main idea is to minimize these instances. Which is achieved through strategic development of your kingdoms, the cards, various stones that give the cards certain powers and through your guild.\n\nThe game does not have a real time PvP, all battles are against AI.
