While admittedly, the AI needs some serious polish, it behaves in a way that you don't see in games of a similar genre. Rather than it's goal simply being \"Kill the player\", it actually appears to be \"Reproduce and Survive\". Almost everything is dynamic, including the flora (It actually reproduces). This game gives the impression of a living, and breathing organism, constantly in flux (It is worth mentioning that nothing is simulated outside of your \"vision\", which is for obvious optomization reasons). I love watching smaller ships collect resources from plants (Once they or their seeds die, they turn into 'Resource'), and larger ships acting as predators. Anywho, while many aspects are very, very, rough around the edges, I would seriously recommend this game for any fan of the genre.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504981727, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504981727, "recommendationid": "34843748", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513203", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505503626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 67, "steamid": "76561198087328979", "num_games_owned": 410}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "great game, but how the hell did you miss that bug in the control area where, you hit flight controls and they are just glitching out in the menu", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505503682, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505503682, "recommendationid": "34979547", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492970", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498353323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561198271412250", "num_games_owned": 34}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "its ok", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504967346, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504967346, "recommendationid": "34838676", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491086", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506324585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 635, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 8695, "steamid": "76561198034112506", "num_games_owned": 173}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "23", "review": "Hard to call an event a 'bug' when it happens every, single, time.  spawn a ship?  stuck inside your ship.  get spawned by a ship?  stuck inside their ship.  can't save and reload, puts you back into ship stuck status.  changing your ship only works sometimes.  \n\ngame check, 'is your ship currently stuck inside another ship or is another ship stuck inside of your ship'?\n\nif yes, then separate those two ships.  what is coding?", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504998409, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504998409, "recommendationid": "34848729", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487805", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1073, "total_reviews": 1154, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 81}}
