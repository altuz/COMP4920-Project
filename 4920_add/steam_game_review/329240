There is nothing \"rogue\" about this game. This is just an arcade action game stylized as a dungeon crawler but doesn't really play like one. It's just an arcade game where the graphics look like a dungeon.\n\nSome people think \"rogue\" means \"you unlock things between runs\" and that's the only thing this game does. You play a run, you reach a point where your current stats just doesn't cut it anymore as enemies take longer and longer to kill and then you die. You respawn in the town and can spend your obtained currency on upgrades and then start the so-called dungeon over again. That's it. \n\nSee, the true key to the fun in roguelites like Binding of Isaac, Spelunky and dozens more, and even classic roguelikes on Steam like Tales of Maj'eyal and Dungeonmans, is the fact that every run has the potential to offer something new. The very first item you pick up might be something that completely changes the game, and you might find said item in a myriad of different ways. Like how you can blow up a rock in the first room in Isaac and find the Small Rock, or maybe you open your first chest in Dungeonmans and out pops a skill book that lets you use an ability you've never tried before. Since The Weaponographist doesn't offer any items of any sort, every run is the same. Enemies drop currency and replacement weapons since the one you're using breaks in a few kills and that's it. No item rooms, no cool drops, nothing to switch things up and keep it fresh and addictive.\n\nThis game doesn't even let you explore anything. The screenshots make it look like Zelda, I know, but the thing is that only one of the doors will open when you clear a room and there's no other place to go but forward. It's an extremely linear game that offers no minimap, no strategy and no exploration. Just head from one room to the next to kill the same boring enemies over and over, have your weapon break and pick up a new one. Die, buy upgrades and go back in. Repeat, repeat, repeat.\n\nThis game is just flat-out boring and not a roguelite, certainly far from a roguelike as the store description calls it. It's just a shallow and simple action arcade game that gets real dull real fast and expects you to grind to make progress rather than survive by your own skill.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498295148, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498295148, "recommendationid": "32718057", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 4}}
