That being said, there are a lot of improvements that need to be made in order for me to give it a thumbs up. Yeah I got it, its an early access game, what did I expect? Well I'm posting this so the Dev's can see it and hopefully take my thoughts into consideration. \n\nFirstly, not everyone wants to play multiplayer matches. The single player skirmishes that you have are adequate at best. Currently there is only 1 map which does get old very quickly. The map itself is.. odd.. Its named Avalon plains but its packed with mountains. I got laugh out of that. Try making more maps and in all different types of terrain. Also, try making the match set up a little more intuitive, let me choose what factions I fight, and what is up with the time limit in a single player skirmish? That doesn't make a lot of sense. \n\nPlease add more units and buildings, better factions with noticeable differences, special units depending on the faction that you choose, and Vikings.. You have to add Vikings.. haha. Maybe make an empire mode for single player instead of just multiplayer. Whats up with the Veteran infantry looking like Roman soldiers? I thought it was medieval times.\n\nOne thing that really bugged me was the way you place walls. Its really clunky and time consuming. In an RTS you can't have its take 10 minutes to lay walls down. The walls don't connect to the gates and vice versa. It looks like you tried to make it so you could place a gate in a section of wall and have it built there. This only causes the gate to get built in the same space as the wall and no units can go through. But I'm sure this will be fixed. \n\nAt its current state I would give its a 5/10. I will reevaluate it again after more development has been done. Good luck Dev's and thanks for reading.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462763112, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1462824522, "recommendationid": "22874016", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552065", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462123043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 81, "steamid": "76561197970189587", "num_games_owned": 830}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": "7", "review": "What a surprise! \n\nI heard about the game first, when they annouced to release on the same day as the new total war. Now SEGA moved that game away - maybe they were afraid? ;) However, first I could play the game at PAX East in Boston, a few days ago. There I found it very entertaining. It does a lot of things right for an RTS and finally we got one in a medieval setting again. Hell about time. \n\nThe graphic needs some improvement, also the controls in combat are not optimal yet - but that is what early access is for. \nIf you have any love for the battle-part of the Total War series but want to have some basic base-building and ressource-gathering in realtime in it - here you go! \n\nI really hope Early Access will help the game to grow content and quality-wise, then we can have real RTS-Diamond. \nSo, please devs, keep on the good work!

Though it seems like the Developers are putting in work and taking time to listen to the community, which is something I really appreciate.\n\nThe Good\n\n-The city building is pretty well done and certanly feels a bit like AOE. \n\n-The map is very beautiful and has good terrain. (Notice the lack of plurality, I'll get to that later.)\n\n-There's a nice level up system for your profile, which lets you upgrade stats like the endurance of your units, percent increase in resource yield and decrease build times.\n\n-The units are aesthetically pleasing on come in nicely packeged squads.\n\n\nThe Not So Good\n\n-Sometimes unresponsive units.\n\n-Seems to be only one map.\n\n-The in game tech tree that doesn't really explain what the tech does or how much it costs.\n\n-There needs to be more emphasis on formations. It's very dificult to set up lines of units or to organize your army which often causes battle to turn into a mosh pit of random units.\n\n-I'm not sure if I'm just blind or what but I couldn't find a Fire At Will button for ranged units. Adding one would make city razing SO much easier. \n\n-Lastly the AI is currently battling at the same tenacity of a two year old with a yet newspaper.
