This would add a lot of potential that the dev can't fulfill all the time. Just a thought doe. Anyways, to the review!\n\nOkay, so I haven't ever seen an upstarter game that I ever thought could I have potential besides Terraria, but this does. This has a LOT of potential. But unless the developer works soon, it may not see it. What it needs is more ores, and more levels of mining. Not just one, it has to have at least 10 levels, and the bottom level be some kind of underworld. It needs a lot more ores, biomes, etc. There is also a rare glitch where sometimes when you spawn, you're in the middle of the ocean... yeah, that sucks. But Multiplayer will SERIOUSLY add awesomeness to the max. But, there needs to be things to make multiplayer become mainstream. #1, the developer needs to look at Minecraft for inspiration. Famous servers in MC have things in common, Texture packs, custom named items/potions, and redstone contraptions. This game needs these three things to become, well, AWESOMER THAN POSSIBLE! Well... in my opinion :3\n\nNow then, there needs to be an elevation system too. Jumping higher and higher, bla bla bla. This can add some amazing builds, and cool land features. A minimap would be nice too. Sprint ability is a must. But yeah, I realize this is Early Access, so what am I saying anyways? XD\n\nPoint is, if you have the money, GET THIS GAME. This game needs it, it will become great but remember that what this dev needs is money. Thanks for reading B-T-Dubz, :P :D\n\nedit: Just read over my review...
