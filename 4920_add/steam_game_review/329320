It's not unplayable, just frustrating, and requires the player to have extreme finesse with keystrokes/mousewheels. You know what would make it better? click & drag to rotate, spacebar to drop\n\nUnlike tetris, this game requires you to be precise with 2 aspects when placing blocks: rotation and gravity, whereas tetris just has the gravity aspect. this is a curse and a blessing because while it adds a layer of complexity, it also adds a layer of frustration if you've lined up a great match, but move your mousewheel up a tiny bit, making the whole move useless. it's similar to the feeling in tetris when you slam down a stick piece only to have it be off by 1 block and instead of racking up points, you now have a mess to clean up. HOWEVER, in tetris, that's 100% your fault. in this game, other factors like mouse wheel sensitivity and randomization come into play. combine that with no indicator of whats coming next, and sometimes this game feels a bit unfair. Less intellect based, and more luck/reflexes. \n\nWould be a much better game if they had at least the option to have an incoming drop indicator, to adapt to different play styles\n\n\nI can't say that this is my favourite puzzle game, or that I'll even go back to it very often. but I definitely feel like the pricepoint is fair.
