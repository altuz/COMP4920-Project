And I'm glad it finally reached Steam.\n\nNow allow me to say two things about this game. It's VERY SHORT and it's VERY HARD.\n\nWhy this game is hard?\n\nWhile this shmup isn't a Danmaku, cloudphobia's difficulty lies in the 3 conditions to get a game over. By dying, by allowing the mothership to be destroyed or by running out of time. To beat a level you need to finish it under 3 minutes if not you'll be obliterated. Your mech have a booster that allows you to navigate throught the stage and quickly reach the boss but the main issue with this is if you let enemies escape, your mothership will be damaged and you need to reduce your speed to take care of them properly. Something to take on account is the fact the game have a hitstun if you're damaged. Something that's crucial for a game where time is a base factor of the gameplay mechanic.\n\nAs if it wasn't enough, upon finishing a level the ammount of points you made in the stage will be responsible for your mech and mothership's shield recharge and the missle stock as well. The more points you make, the more shield and missles will be recharged. And you acheive a big score by not letting yourself or your mothership to be damaged at all, how many enemies are destroyed with a salvo of missles and the bread-and-butter of the game: Kill as many normal enemies before going for the commander (the red enemies) as they'll multiply the ammount of enemies destroyed so far with a larger bonus point basically.\n\nAnd why it's short?\n\nThe game have 5 stages and you can beat this game under 10 minutes if you do it well. If wasn't the fact this game don't offers a continue (so the only way to beat this game is by 1CC'ing) cloudphobia's replay value would be greatly minimized.\n\nA part of me wished for cloudphobia to be lenghty but considering the game mechanic, I think it's great in the way it is. If you want a shmup game that offers something other the the classic old-school or your typical Danmaku shooter, cloudphobia is a nice game to consider.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491021560, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491021560, "recommendationid": "30867839", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487450104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561197972443975", "num_games_owned": 291}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game was originally released in 2003 as a single level demo.

Needing to watch both your own health bar and that of the mothership, which takes damage from any enemies which you fail to kill before they leave the screen, forces players to take on an offensive playstyle. Every stage also has a time limit of three minutes, and you'll need to make use of the boost ability to finish before the timer reaches zero. Boosting comes with its own risks and rewards as using it constantly can lead to the screen flooding with groups of enemies, which can potentially lead to you or the mothership taking a lot of damage, but which can also be a great way to increase your score. \n\nThe weapons you can choose between, a sword and a gun, also have wildly different playstyles with the gun being a traditional weapon for the genre while the sword requires more finesse to use at close range with strong single slashes for tough enemies and a weaker whirling attack for clearing smaller enemy swarms. There are also significant changes between the difficulty settings, including not only the number of bullets in enemy attacks, but also which enemies you fight and in which quantities as well as the placement (or lack thereof) of various environmental obstacles.\n\nIf you're a fan of the shmup genre and want something a bit different from usual, you should definitely check out cloudphobia.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486150040, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486150040, "recommendationid": "29676102", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503123", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493717913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 420, "steamid": "76561198233644000", "num_games_owned": 77}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "2", "review": "If you're a fan of horizontal shmups I'd say this is worth picking up, especially if you're new to the genre. Although the the fact that stages are timed may be a turn-off to some, by getting to grips with the boost mechanic the time limit will become irrelevant as you get better at the game. As for the difficulty there is no phase level to worry about or lives of any sort. You have a shield in this game which can be refilled at the end of each stage by the points you've earned in that stage. The more points the more hp both your mothership and you regain. \n\nIf a bullet goes through your character sprite a green dot will appear in the centre. This is your hitbox and as long as no bullet collides with it you will be able to graze bullets through your sprite without having to worry about damaging your mech. The hitbox is not visible throughout the majority of the game and only appears when a bullet goes through your sprite(this is called grazing in shmup terminology for the uninitiated). Cloudphobia is also much more lenient when it comes to how much damage you can take as 1 hit will not make you lose a life(because \"lives\" in this game do not exist). Because of this the game is much easier than it may appear. \n\nAs for those who were browsing through steam or Rockin' Android's steam page and found this game because of your playtime in gundemonium recollection, gundeadligne or any other shmups, I would reommend this game based on the fact that I guarantee you will like it. It may not be the most intricately designed shmup on the market but if you want to add another one to your collection or just want a short game to blast through then I'd say go for it.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1490938776, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1490938776, "recommendationid": "30847057", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
