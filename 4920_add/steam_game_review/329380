I thoroughly enjoyed the first game and thought it was wonderful. Alas, this isn't a review for the first game. It's a review for the Stealth Inc 2. I went into Stealth Inc 2 with great expectation because of my experiences from the first game. I'll tell you now that I was not let down at all. Stealth Inc 2 is a wonderful game and a fantastic follow-up to the first. \n\nThe gameplay remains much the same: manipulate various parts of the environment so that you can access terminals which you must hack. Once all terminals are hacked, reach the exit and you're done. In Stealth Inc 2, this formula is still present but also added on to. Instead of just navigating through menus to select the level you want, you must proceed through a metroidvania-esque world, solving puzzles to reach each level. Being a huge fan of metroidvanias, I love this change and thoroughly enjoy it. Scattered around this overworld are various pickups that you can obtain to unlock different hats and suits. These hats and suits are purely aesthetic, and this bit of customization to differentiate yourself from all of the other clones is a nice addition. Another difference between Stealth Inc 2 and the first game is that instead of there being a hard-to-get collectable on each level, there are clones that you must rescue. The locations of these clones range from being incredibly easy to get and almost unmissable to hidden fairly well. Finding these clones is a lot of fun, and escorting them to the exit can be quite the challenge.\n\nAs far as the audio for the game goes, it's done quite well. The music isn't intrusive, and that's a great thing when it comes to puzzle games. Just because the music isn't intrusive doesn't mean it isn't good, though. The music tracks are done quite well (especially the 8th level of each \"chapter\"). It isn't the sort of music that will ever get stuck in your head, but I didn't find myself wanting to turn off the music, either. It is certainly fitting for the type of game that Stealth Inc 2 is.\n\nGraphically, the game is a huge improvement over the first. Everything looks crisp and clean, and it stands out well. It's a pleasure to look at, and after my 3.5 hour session with the game, my eyes weren't feeling sore or tired. The game does a good job of differentiating between light and dark. Given the importance of these elements in the gameplay, this is a VERY good thing. Dark isn't too dark, and light isn't too light. It's just right and that's a wonderful thing.\n\nWhen it comes to controls, I only have one gripe. Aiming the tool with the right stick (or aiming lasers, by extension) can be very awkward and very frustrating since it isn't precise. One of the levels requires you to walk straight ahead while also aiming a laser in that same direction. Although it wasn't overly difficult, I felt it was harder than it should have been because keep the laser trained in the one spot while also having to walk was very awkward. Other than this gripe (which really isn't that huge of a deal), I found the controls to be nice and smooth. I use a controller while playing, though, so I can't really comment on keyboard/mouse.\n\nOverall, Stealth Inc 2 is a wonderful sequel that surpassed my already high expectations. I look forward to exploring all the nooks and crannies that the game has to offer. If you enjoyed the original, you'll love the sequel. If you enjoy puzzle platformers, I'd recommend this game as well.

It is still the same kind of platformer that you can expect from the first game; same dark humor, same dark visuals, same dark story; but it throws on a bit of a touch of cuteness every now and again with the new sounds and with the slight change in character design; making the player character look more like how he appears in the little images featured in the first game.
