It is a fun little game, it's challenging, it's nice to look at, it plays nice. It basically is Super Mario Galaxy but with sonic the hedgehog, and it's got my favorite voice cast of any of the games. \n\nBut please for the love of GOD. Wait for it to go on sale. It really isn't worth $30. Pay $25 for it when the Sonic Bundle goes on sale. At least you get a ton of other games like Generations and the Adventure Saga (and it also bugs me how Heroes had a windows release but Sega never brought it to Steam...come on). But don't kid yourself. This isn't worth $30.

This is [i]the[/i] prime example of a video game hastily thrown together without any insights around what good game design means.
