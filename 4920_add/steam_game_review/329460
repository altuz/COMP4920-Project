You control a T-rex with rocket boots, flying through space. \nIf that doesn't already convince you I'll list all the positive things about this game:\n\n- Tight controls (they take a bit getting used to, but they work SO well)\n- Funky / upbeat soundtrack; especially the boss music is awesome\n- Loads of challenges, levels and different modes to keep you entertained, including co-op!\n- Tons of items to buy to customize your T-rex. Go crazy!\n\nBottom line: this is an amazing little gem of a game. You might not spend countless hours on it, but if you want to get everything done you'll be busy for at least a week or so. Plus, the co-op mode is incredible. Highly recommend it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503874204, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503874204, "recommendationid": "34540813", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 129, "total_reviews": 132, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
