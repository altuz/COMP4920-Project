Not because the story is bad, it starts out pretty good to be honest.

(Almost a year later) and although the developers said that they would fix the translation problem.., it's still a brutal mess. Most of the time I'm just so frustrated by trying to fix the mess I read on screen, it makes me feel like I'm taking somekind of grammar test; \"Detect the 15  failures in the small block of text.\" That's how bad it is.
