This game was amazing when it first came out, in the heyday of Close Combat and Panzer General. This game isn't the easiest and it sure ain't the purtiest nowadays, but if you love World War 2 strategy with BN/CO level leadership thrown in, then I highly recommend this game. If you're more of a quick  game/or pretty graphics  type though then this probably will disappoint you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415828103, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1415828103, "recommendationid": "12916153", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530481", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451341309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 463, "steamid": "76561197964363682", "num_games_owned": 405}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Game is a lot worse than I remember, must have been wearing those rose tinted glasses\n\nPositives\n+ Fighting in a tank at the same time as commanding the force is a fun concept\n+ Campaign gives a sense of progression\n+ Interesting time period and combatants\n+ Reasonable depth (unit variety and off map support for example)\n\nNegatives\n- Fighting from your tank is a lot less fun than you might think given the tiny screen. You'll be shot across the map without seeing what killed you.\n- Interface is bad (want to cancel an ongoing artillery barrage to save your suicidal tanks? Nope)\n- Interface is bad (want to know how long until your artillery barrage is ready again? Nope. You're not allowed to know that)\n- Interface is horrible (want to see a company's waypoints? You have to hit the company info button on the toolbar, navigate to the company with the left and right arrows, then hit waypoints, then hunt around the platoon map for the lines because they don't appear on the strategic map)\n- Interface is really horrible (want to give your army a simple move order? How about setting your army's starting orders from the same screen you deploy them? Nope, you have to give each company individual orders, and you have to quickly cancel the automatic starting orders if you want control over how the engagement proceeds from the start)\n- The AI of your units is completely unpredictable. Will the \"assault\" order make your company chase the enemy across the map, turn around and flee, drive in circles, or scatter in every direction? Roll a dice! It could be any of these!\n- Combat is completely unpredictable. There're no indications as to which units can see the enemy or even what the range of their weapons is. Foot infantry can defeat medium tanks. \n- The pathfinding is almost braindead. Your units often head in the opposite direction to the waypoint you gave them. They will rush into enemy units when you told them to stay still. They will move around a forest when you told them to take the road going through it.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451146460, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451146460, "recommendationid": "19966813", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531690", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502556179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 201, "steamid": "76561198030355818", "num_games_owned": 1280}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is an interesting one, i have a real fondness for this game, it was trying to be like Harpoon but for ww2 western front tank combat. unless you have a love for retro games and all the difficulties they present UI wise some of them, you wont like this one. It offers the option to play at just a platoon level up to companies and battalions - at the platoon level, there is no much you can do. You can deviate from teh rest of the company but if you do so you will likely be destroyed as soon as you come across the enemy. it offers a 3d sim window but it is a novelty at most- you wont be able to get close enough to see the enemy before they destroy you, so its better to leave gunnery up to the AI unless you are with alot of support.\n\na battle can be confusing as to what unit you are in, at first, but you get the hang of it. the ai on all sides will go back forth on the battlefield as morale and loss dictate though it can just look like every unit is just running around like a headless chicken. despite all the flaws, i like teh game for what it is trying to offer and it can play as a strategy game, though if you wnat something more current then go with Graviteam Tactics Operation Star or the Close Combat games", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1416914258, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1416914258, "recommendationid": "13076954", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522039", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445701787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 160, "steamid": "76561198028501074", "num_games_owned": 451}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty awesome game.
