Played it when it first came out almost 25 years ago and still find myself booting it up. I'm glad it's on Steam now. If this game had modern graphics and was re-tooled for mobile or ipad, I imagine it could sell. Here's my pitch.\n\nIts beauty is its simplicity. Infantry divisions, tank divisions, air wings, carrier groups, destroyer groups, submarines, cities, bases, oil fields. That's pretty much it. And spy satelites for certain scenarios. World War I, WW II, WW III (NATO vs. Warsaw Pact, WW IV (~ WW III), and WW V. I suggest World War V to start- cities are randomized on the map. You start at one city and your opponent starts in one other city with no spy satellites allowed.\n\nThe elephant in the room is the graphics. Admittedly, I cut it some slack because I grew up with it, but, honestly, it doesn't affect the gameplay, which is solid.\n\nFinally, for STEAM, this games NEEDS a manual (for basic UI and minutiae)! For players, you may find tips and shortcuts elsewhere on the web. One tip - the menus are at the top of the screen window - just hover your mouse near the top and the menus will appear.

You capture cities for money and places to purchase new units. You capture oil fields to keep your army gassed (sort of the supply food cap of Blizzard RTS games). Units are kept simple. On land you have infantry (can just barely capture empty cities, weak on attack, strong on defense when dug in) and tanks (faster than infantry, stronger, but cost twice as much and get no defense bonus). That's it. \n\nYou have a single type of air unit (expensive, can fast respond over a long range, conduct a heavily damaging air strike against units but takes a long time to recover).\n\n3 different navy units. Destroyers (cheap, toe to toe naval unit), subs (hidden but weaker in direct combat than destroyers), and carriers (long range, can carry ait unit, but expensive). Any naval unit will almost instantly sink an infantry or tank if it's caught being transported across water.\n\nThe games comes with 5 different scenarios representing world wars 1-5. Honestly I would recommend only playing on world war 5. Both sides start out with a single capital, a small amount of money, and go from there. A typical RTS starting point. Other scenarios are either too narrow (world war 1) or way too complicated (world war 3 & 4). Some have additional options like satellites, killer satellites, nukes and foreign aid but in my opinion they ruin the fun simplicity that is the game's biggest strength.\n\nBe warned though this game was made in 1990 and the graphics and interface will show. You have to make do without a couple of the interface refinements gamers have grown used to in RTS games over the years. Graphics are what you see in the screen shots. Sound effects are a bunch of bleeps and bloops (PC speaker sound quality!).\n\nI'm not sure about the $7 price tag If you're dying to relive this for nostalgia that's an okay price. For anyone else I'd say wait until it's on a half off sale. It's a fun simplistic game you'll get at least a couple hours of fun out of (or dozens if you get into it), plus it's an interesting historical artifact as one of the very first instances of an RTS as we know them today, a whole 4 years before Blizzard's first Warcraft game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428352646, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428352646, "recommendationid": "15241112", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510393", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438462645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 369, "steamid": "76561198030795610", "num_games_owned": 361}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "For any old-schoolers who missed Command HQ, I'd put it in the Civ1/SimCity1/Gold Box rotation...
