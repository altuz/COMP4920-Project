I think it would have been much more popular if it had not been released the same year as Duke Nukem 3D. I had a lot of fun on Duke 3D, don't get me wrong, but I always thought this one was just as good. Duke had a better atmosphere (looks a bit nicer, feels \"bigger,\" has interactive pool table, etc.), but this one has better gameplay, especially later in the game (personal opinion).\n\nThe good: \n\n-Tried in 2014  with Steam's built-in emulator. <----edit: game has DOSBOX, apparently, which amounts to the same thing. Thank you, kindly stranger. The game works.\n-The game is still fun. Mind you, it is a nostalgic kind of fun. If you didn't grow up playing games in the 90s, you will probably find the game to be terrible. There are some quality-of-life differences that games have now that just didn't exist then. If you like Duke 3D though, you'll probably like this.\n-Interesting weapons and items. This is what I liked better than Duke. Duke has the atmosphere, this game has the better weapons, IMO.\n-Different playable characters. This is the first FPS I recall ever having different characters. The different characters have a few different weapons. It's pretty neat and adds to the replayability. You also get another character that is a bit of a mix of the other characters by beating the game! Pretty fancy.\n-It might bother some, but to me this game is set up to change between first person and 3rd person view. If just feels better switching views in this game than it does in most other games.\n\nThe bad:\n-Brain-hurting resolution. The game was made in '96 to run on DOS, and looks every bit of it.\n-Sometimes the aiming is off, especially when shooting guns on the celing. To get around that just change position (for the guns on the celing you might have to just get closer).\n\nThings to get you started:\n-You need to reset your controls before you play. You can configure buttons and whatnot before you play. Also, change the mouse controls to always on (this is mouse look), and also, the game says \"invert axis?\" or something like that, and for some reason the default is inverted, so if you change it to inverted, it puts it to normal. To get normal FPS controls, W = forward, S = back, A = strafe left, D = strafe right, Space = jump. I also recommend setting E to \"use\" and Q to \"change character view,\" or maybe it was just called change view.  You don't need to worry about \"look up\" and \"look down\" buttons. If the right mouse setting is used, the mouse does that for you. I think there is a button for cycling between fast/slower moving too, I just set it to LShift and have not really messed with it.  Also, it's a 90s game so no reloading/reload button, so don't have to worry about that.\n-Caves are kinda hard to see. If you think you are stuck at the beginning of the game, just walk along the walls. Once you get in the cave you'll be like \"Oh, derp.\" Pretty easy after you find it the first time.\n-I played the cat chick and was like \"Damnit, I can't jump on the platform. Gahh, curse you 90s platformers!\" Well, it turns out that you just have to wait until later in the game, then teleport back to the beginning and it opens the lasers blocking the platforms you need to get on. Lesson learned: if you can't get to it, maybe there's a button to open it later in the level, especially if it's blocked by lasers.\n\nAfter beating the game (or before, if you're inclined) if you want to have some fun you can press \\  <---that's the default button anyway, and then type in the codes for the game. Codes are:\n\nFMK = All health is restored\nARMS = All weapons\nRAGMUFFIN = Invincibilty\nDIG = No clipping\nGIFT = Gives you usable items (by default, use [ or ] to select item, and enter to use item).\nOVERDRIVE = Recieve a chip-powerup\nSPUTNIK = Reveals the whole map\nBLOAD = Warp to the next level\n\nYou don't need any of these to beat the game. You can save at any point, so it's easy to pass anything if you want to. These are just for fun, and IMO they do make the game more fun. I don't recommend using invincibility unless you want to just walk through the game (not as fun), just weapons and items, but that's up to you. Also, when you use the GIFT code, after entering it once you can just keep pressing \\ and it will load up your inventory with items. You don't have to keep typing \"gift\" to get more.\n\nI hope you like the game!\n\nNote:\nTried changing the \"screen size\" to get a better resolution. It doesn't help, but it does take your ammo count and other stuff off of the screen; at least for me it did. It also didn't improve the resolution at all. It just took off the ammo count. Would not recommend altering screen size, but if you do and notice your ammo count/health display/etc is missing, you get it back by lowering the \"screen size\" a few marks. I think the default is 2 ticks back from max. Max will remove your ammo/health from view.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415310747, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428721425, "recommendationid": "12821555", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643344", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439620040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 251, "steamid": "76561198116888148", "num_games_owned": 190}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 29, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Like carrying 15 different weapons at the same time?\nWant 3 cool characters  each with their own abilities? \n(Plus a hidden one you can unlock i bet most of you don\u2019t know)\nDo you like FPS(First-person shooter) and TPS(third-person shooter)?\nWell you can choose it now!\n\nDo you want to control your own walking mine !?\nOr a flying mine !?\nOr just plant that M\u2019nF\u2019n mine !?\nAnd detonate them trough a double view on your screen!\nLike controlling enemy forces and make them kill each other?\nLike code breaking?\nPuzzle solving\nSecret finding\nEaster Eggs\nCombination solving\nBoss fighting?\nNCP\u2019s who actually know to hide and scare the sh-bleep out of you XD\nTraps\nGlobal GPS that you can zoom in and out of\nHidden cameras\nCute droids that follow and fight for you\nTime missions\nDeadly lava\nPlatform jumping\nInvincibility\nInvisibility\nMissile Launch\u2019n\nGrenade throw\u2019n\nA-ss kicking?\nMind f-bleepkin\nany cool thing you can possibly imagine\nGAME?\nTHIS IS FOR YOU!!!!\n \nBefore you play, you want to fix the settings a bit, even though I like playing FPS games, I play this in TPS, cause it gets kinda dizzy in the FPS, if you play the fast character Eleena, she\u2019s fast, and thats why.\nMake sure you fix the brightness of the game too, if every thing is dark then you just didn\u2019t set things right.\nMake sure to change the mouse axis thing, and the controls to WASD.\n\n\nIt has 4 levels of difficulty, recommend to start with the easy for beginners, some things could be confusing at first.\n\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been with this game since a kid, the graphics still seem ok to me. \n(even after L4D2, CSGO, TF2 , Sanctum 2 , graphics don\u2019t seem to bother me)\n\nLove this game so much, brings back a lot of memories, defiantly a No.1 fan of Eradicator\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Now below\u2014\u2014 spoilers \u2014\u2014\nThis game has cheat codes to it\nThat let you see the whole map\nOr GPS the enemies\nDisable them\nKill yourself\nInvincibility\nWalk trough walls\nLow-gravity\nFly\nFull ammo\nFull health\nEnd level\nChoose level\nAnd then some system things\nUse the \u201c\\\u201d key to start the command and then just type out the cheat, here\u2019s one \u201c \\ragamuffin \u201c this should be enough for you to enjoy the game but not spoil it too much, since you still have puzzle solving to do!

Having played a demo of it at a young age I always longed to play the full version and bought the big box of it a couple of years ago. Now it seems the game is finally on Steam and so you might want to know a thing or two about it.\n\nEradicator is an oldschool shooter in the veins of Doom and Duke Nukem 3D, to which it shares most of its similarities though it is rather unique for its time. For one, it features multiple characters, each with their own personality. The weapons are also all rather interesting and serve different purposes. Another groundbreaking feature for this game was the ability to use RC cars and other remote controlled devices thanks to something called PIP (picture-in-picture) view. Another enjoyable thing about the game is the ability to switch between third person and first person perspectives at will (or automatically if you so choose) which helps immensely with the platforming sections, of which there are plentiful. The graphics are also really good for their time and give the game a gritty and dirty sci-fi atmosphere I enjoy a lot.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is the level design which does show its age. It is confusing and relies heavily on hunting down switches to push and it's not always obvious where to go. The maze-like design also makes it difficult to navigate the levels and using the map is something you will get used to quickly. The music also doesn't really do much and stays in the background most of the time, adding to the ambience of the game. I'd much rather turn it off and turn on some good old 90's rock.\n\nBut all in all this is one of the more underrated shooters from the 90's and fell under the shadow of Quake and other more successfull games. It's nice to see it on Steam and back in action for those who missed it and those who love it.

Imagine:\n- destructable environment elements\n- shootable switches\n- more than 10 different weapons with upgrades\n- usable remote cameras\n- 1st / 3rd person view switch, 3rd person view has changable camera angle\n- remotely controlled weapons and objects\n- hi-res environmental audio with really artistic soundtracks\n- characters are talking and soliloquizing\n- atmospheric level design and art\n- night vision system\n- normal mouselook is on just from the start (!)\n- diverse inventory, which is not just to boost your stats, but to interact with enemies (turret gun or forcefiled)\n- enemies are really different in their features and behavior making the game properly challenging\n- game is more or less replayable due to different characters (1 is hidden!) who can somehow make shortcuts or can go slightly another way because of their diffferent stats and slightly varying weapons.\n- fairly good physics for that dated title and no glitches\n\nUse your brain to combine weapons and inventory items according to situation and you will have a strong taste of tactical shooter. Look how much break-through features had this game. And this all came years ago! \n\nDrawbacks?

I recently played it, and decided that it's understandable why it was forgotten. It's murky, monotonous, and frustrating, and it doesn't really do anything to stand out in any way.\n\nIt looks and plays a hell of a lot like Duke Nukem 3D, to the point that I wouldn't be surprised if the code was mostly Build Engine. The palette's the same, the gib physics are the same, there are security cameras you can look at, and overall it just seems like a Duke Nukem mod. This isn't a bad thing, necessarily, but it's very noticeable if you've played any Duke Nukem.\n\nEradicator's main aesthetic difference from DN3D is that it's really fucking dark. Most of the colors are brown and gray, and everything is in so much shadow that a lot of the time you can't even tell what's going on. This even extends to the minimap, so often it's nigh-impossible to navigate. I'm not sure why this choice was made, but it makes the game unpleasant and confusing to play and really detracts from the overall experience.\n\nThere are three different characters (plus a secret fourth one once you beat the game), like in HeXen, but unlike HeXen they don't seem to have entirely different playstyles, so I just wouldn't bother.\n\nThe level design is really screwy and often difficult to navigate, a concern only exacerbated by the omnipresent shadow and darkened minimap.\n\nThe game's really bad at telling you if what you're looking at is an objective, or if you're making any progress at all. Eventually you get the hang of what sorts of things are interactible and which aren't, but it's an uphill battle getting to that point.\n\nYou don't seem to obtain guns in this game; rather, your character seems to start out with all the guns already and simply collects different types of ammunition to gain use of them.\n\nThe default controls are pretty dumb, and require some rebinding.\n\nThe various \"Buddy\" powerups are pretty fun. They just summon a little robot friend who floats next to you and shoots whatever you shoot for a short period of time.\n\nThe jumping controls/physics are fucking terrible, which sucks because there's a lot of platforming in this game.\n\nSometimes the gameplay attempts to vary itself with sections where you remotely control a robot (tedious) or do something with a time limit (egregious).\n\nEradicator's main problem besides the murkiness, however, are its enemies. They're just annoying and poorly concieved. There are not one but two kinds of erratic flying suicide bomber enemies, which are really frustrating to fight. Quake also had an enemy like that, but Quake also made that enemy a big target and gave you a really inaccurate shotgun to hit it with; Eradicator does neither of these things. Also, I thought Dark Forces taught us that a water-based enemy who occasionally pops up and fires a projectile at you is a really bad idea, but apparently the developers of this game didn't get that message. These are only the worst examples of the shitty enemy design; there are certainly many others.\n\nOverall, Eradicator is just frustrating and unfun; not enough to make it offensively bad, but enough that it becomes a chore to play. If you're on the fence about getting it, normally I'd recommend it because playing more games is always good; however, I just can't see anyone getting anything out of playing this. It won't broaden any horizons or teach you new things. It just exists, pointless and bad.

Immersive music, enemy noises, gib sounds-- very impressive for its time.\n    [*]Surprisingly responsive shooter, complete with actual projectiles and a reticle that changes size with distance to target.\n    [*]Gotta love that old-school 90s gore / dismemberment. Very satisfying to blow up aliens.\n    [*]The map is great-- you can still move your character with the map up. Not many games allow that.\n    [*]Great variety in weapons. Ripper disks, remote controlled spider bombs, steerable rockets, etc.\n    [*]You can remote control various types of enemies and weapons to do your bidding. I struggle to think of modern games that have implemented this so well.\n    [*]Great variety in enemies, including plenty that take to the air.\n    [*]This game has scared the shit out of me many, many times-- even recently.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n\n[list]\n    [*]Storyline is laughable. Pretty much the standard fare, aliens-have-taken-over trope that all games seemed to have then.\n    [*]Maps can be a bit repetitive.\n    [*]Some secrets can be really hard to find/access, with sorta \"meh\" payouts when found. Satisfying only for completionists.\n[/list]\n\nI didn't expect much of the game when I picked it out of a used games shelf at Electronics Boutique back in '96, but I was pleasantly surprised then, and am still happy to play it today, even with other AAA titles in my library getting playtime. And honestly, it seems like many indie devs today are trying to emulate the very style that this game and its contemporaries pioneered.\n\nTotally worth its <$10 cost.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448870054, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448870174, "recommendationid": "19383818", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481596208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 135, "steamid": "76561198022297994", "num_games_owned": 87}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is both awesome and weird.
