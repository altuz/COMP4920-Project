I hate how people compare the two games to duke nukem, because this is a vietnam setting. This is VERY CHALLENGING and you will find yourself being blown to smitherines often. Remember they are usually US airstrikes so just back off for a bit until the bombs finish dropping then rush in and kill some viet cong. Throughout the game you will receive mission objectives which are awesome. This is a must have for any FPS library. Also look for its sequel WWII GI, which is for another totally different review. It is amazing what you can accomplish in the build engine, and NAM proves that it isn't just Duke Nukem. 5.5 two thumbs up", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499540711, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499540711, "recommendationid": "33382993", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510795", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506563376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 136, "steamid": "76561198121914002", "num_games_owned": 112}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "THE 'NAM!!!!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502172737, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502172737, "recommendationid": "34096791", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496365", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502158011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 91, "steamid": "76561198176783243", "num_games_owned": 257}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "War is hell, and this game is bad.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502158054, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502158054, "recommendationid": "34093756", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471538", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 63, "total_reviews": 79, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 16}}
