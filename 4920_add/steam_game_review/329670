In my opinion these are still the best submarine simulation games I have played. They have the right mix of simulation and playability to give you the feel of being in crontrol of a sub without some of the minute details that make some sub sims unplayable. For instance, you don't need to worry about running aground and sinking when you are on the big map, though you do need to keep an eye on your fuel tank. These games date back to the early days of computer gaming. The first copy of Silent Service which I owned ran on a 5.25\" floppy disk in one floppy drive with the DOS OS running from a similar floppy in the other floppydrive, for in those days hard drives were still unknown. Windows had not been invented yet and there was no such thing as a computer mouse. A lot has changed since those days, but these games are still very enjoyable if you are able to go through the learning process. There is no tutorial such as we know tutorials in modern games. Back in those days the operating manual was the tutorial and you learned the game by reading the manual and trial-and-error. For those who, like myself, played this game many years ago and remember it well, you can skip to the back of the manual and refresh your memory on the keyboard controls and be back stalking convoys with very little time practicing to refresh your skills. For those new to the game, it is well worth spending some time to look through the manual and at least skim some of the basics. A thorough read will give you some very useful information that will help you get up to speed faster once you begin play. I was not able to get the game manual link in Steam to work, but you will find .pdf files containing the English and German versions of the original game manuals in the installation directory once you have downloaded the game.

For the F1-12 keys, you have to hold the fn button while you press them. LIkewise, press alt + a to toggle animation (in an ambush on multiple warships or when evading multiple depth charges, the animation will quickly fuck with your program, so.) and alt +s to toggle slow speed/save game. As far as I can tell all other keys work as described in the manual. The full manual is available here but even if it weren't, you can find the PDF online. \n\nAnother tip: at the startup screen, choose NO joystick and NO digitized speech. According to an old forum post I found that was written years ago, there's some line of code that makes the digitized speech come out like unintelligible buzzing. Or, if you're literate in that sort of thing, you could go tweak the code and report back here how you did it. :D\n\nI first played this game as a kid at my friend's house. His parents were cooler than mine, so they had a computer and I didn't. Now that I actually know about submarine tactics and geometry, I can enjoy this game as it was meant to be enjoyed. I had been playing on a DOSbox simulator with a 5\" window, but with this port I can make full use of my 27\" iMac. Woohoo!\n\nCaveat: as noted by a previous reviewer, the game description on Steam is that of the original game packaging. There are not any new targets or scenarios added in the ported version. I'm pretty sure the \"new targets and scenarios\" are relative to SS1. Whatever you saw in the 90s is what's in this port. \n\nIf you want a submarine simulator that mimics the challenges of submarine warfare as closely as possible, this is your game.

I assume there have been no modifications done to this game to make it user friendly since its release, but for the price they could have at least overhauled the controls to make the game manageable.
