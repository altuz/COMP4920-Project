You don't expect fancy models from a 1992 game do you?\nThe Fletcher / Benson / Greaves / THAT DESTROYER in the video is not in-game. It's about 10 times detailed than the actual game models.\n\nPros:\n-Decent naval battle simulation\n-Distinguishable ships\n-Streamlined arcade level controls\n\nCons:\n-COMPLETELY MESSED UP WITH MY YUUBARI\n\nOnly two things more to note:\n1. The manual is inside the install folder (x:/.../steam/steamapps/common/task force 1942...)\n2. The manual is 101mb which takes up about 90% of what you download.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498218477, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498218818, "recommendationid": "32677379", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505685", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
