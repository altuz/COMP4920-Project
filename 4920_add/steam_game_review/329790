All players build their team using a pre-determined method, whether a point system, draft, or at random. Equip your team with spells, weapons and other items adapted to their requirements, then utilize their various talents and abilities to create a powerful fighting force. Every figure has a point value attached to it to help balance things out. Randomly drawn event cards spice up the game at each turn, and the winning conditions differ for each game based on the scenario you choose to play. Only those who are able to create a strong, yet versatile, strategy will prevail!\nI like it.\nPS:Recommend another game Krosmaga.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487402576, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487402576, "recommendationid": "30002109", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
