So that's a positive thing. And short (you can finish it in 50 minutes), which for me it's always a plus.\n\nStill, the Moon Sliver doesn't offer enough even for its price tag. It's not much of an adventure, its point-and-click elements are simply stupid (I solved the two puzzles that I found by proving all possible combinations of the two identical mechanisms governing the puzzles), it is very basic in its graphical elements... and the short-lived battery of the torchlight that you must recharge continuously is simply annoying.\n\nAs for the story... ok, maybe at the beginning it can seem curious, but there is not much to be taken out of it (sort of like Dear Esther). \n\nAnother positive thing: I did get shivers with the very last image I saw at the end of the game.
