It has potential, but it lacks content too much and I don't see it coming. I'm not only talking about items etc., but content in general: campaign, story, events. You can see everything it has to offer in 2-3 hours and it gets boring.\n\nAlso, I'm not quite sure I like the combat system: you have to take control of one creature who leads a group and the attack vilains manually. But you have no control of other individuals in the groups, so if the enemy has archers - your group will have many many problems.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1504853894, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504818938, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504818938, "recommendationid": "34802765", "developer_response": "More content is coming in the next update.

More spells and the ability to pick and choose what type of a spell casting keeper you want to experiment with.  Arena to have prisoners fight.\n\t\n  I never felt like game mechanics needed to be fixed but the new improvements in the current version are great.\n\n\nRating today: 7/10  \n\t\n  The Keeper spells and powers have been weakened to the point that I don't want to use my keeper anymore and the overall effect is that when I close the game I feel dissatisfied with my experience.  I'm not sure why I can't put my finger on it.  The keeper seems more fragile and I would rather just leave him in the dungeon to farm mana.\n\t\n  NPC's run away and it seems like the only option when playing now is to use a bow and arrows instead of using cool magic spells.\n\t\n  The minion recruitment mechanic is great as well as other mechanic improvements.\n\t\n  The campaign mode makes sense when trying to isolate the keeper dungeon so that adventurers don't start on a map where every outlying village and tribe is already wiped out.  The downside to this is that it ruined the awesome sandbox experience that makes KeeperRL shine.  I know I can start a sandbox map by choosing to but this should be the primary default option when starting a new game especially for new players because this is the KeeperRL you want them to experience not the campaign mode.\n\t\n  I like the new content such as the vampire lord, zombie mausoleum, gnome dungeon and automaton.\n\t\n  What will make the game better:  Line of site for all minions in a team/group it sucks not being able to see your minions fighting just hearing stuff dyeing.  More content such as capturing a princess from a nearby kingdom.  More spells and the ability to pick and choose what type of a spell casting keeper you want to experiment with.  Make the keeper more powerful for instance being able to choose the spell lightning, fireball, summon skeletons, or cause a corpse to explode.  There should be a limit on what spells the keeper equips so you create a sense of experimentation and trying out new combinations.\n\nAgain to the developer thanks for a making a quality game that is far better than a lot of games being produced today.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505838360, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505838360, "recommendationid": "35067743", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 184, "total_reviews": 210, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 26}}
