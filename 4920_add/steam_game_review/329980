This review is about the RE version.\n\nI am surprised that this game has so few reviews with many negative ones. Except for the voice acting, I found that it was quite an impressive and enjoyable puzzle game. The story was pretty interesting and directly inspired from 2001.\n\nYou are an astronaut. While working outside your space station, you see an enigmatic black cube floating close by.\nIntrigued, you leave the safety of your station, trying desperately to catch it. Finally reaching it, you find yourself low on oxygen, unable to go back to your station. You lose consciousness, and wake up on a mysterious alien spaceship, named the ark by a previously rescued astronaut. Having no idea where you are, you start following the notes he left everywhere, trying to uncover the secrets of this spaceship, and maybe find a way to go back home.\n\nTo advance in the game, you have to solve a wide variety of puzzles (not one puzzle is the same). For this, you will need to read everything you find, and pay careful attention to your whole surrounding. Like Myst, Rhem games and the like, you will have to take notes. I never took so many screenshots in a game. Clues are just everywhere and can be anything. I had a lot of fun solving the puzzles. \nPuzzles complexity is diverse and ranges from easy to impossible (for one puzzle).\nBe ready to do a lot of trials and errors to solve some of the puzzles. Persistence is a requirement.\nThere is just one puzzle at the end that is way too hard to figure out by yourself. \n\n\nIn addition to the alien spaceship, you also have the possibility to explore two planets (and a satellite).\nBecause of the wide diversity of the environment, every rooms, places are different, you never get bored, and are just curious to see where you are going to explore next. \nThere are also two possible endings to choose from.\n\nThe background music also fits nicely with the surroundings.\n\nThe only thing I did not like was the voice acting, which I found pretty useless. An option to disactivate it would have been most welcome, or was there? There are two voices in the game, the previously rescued astronaut diary voice, and an AI voice (from your space suit?).\nFirst, I did not see the point of having to hear the astronaut voice everytime one clicks on a section of his diary. It's more distracting than anything else, since one reads faster than the guy talks. Also, if you make the mistake of clicking twice on the section you want to read, the reading voice will start twice simultaneously...\nSo, I ended up turning off the sound while reading the diary. And just so you know, you cannot skip the reading part because the diary contains many clues to solve the puzzles. I would recommend reading the story of the other astronaut anyway since it is necessary to understand the plot. \n\nAlso, I did not really understand the true purpose of the AI voice. Was it intended to give us hints, or simply to keep us company while being all alone on an unknown spaceship?\nIt could have been seriously improved, since most of what she said was pretty obvious or just made me feel like a small kid:  I find a scalpel, and the AI tells me \"leave it here, you could cut yourself!\"; I look over some handrail, and she tells me: \"be careful not to fall!\". Oh well... It would have been great if it could have been funny...\n\n\nIn all, while looking past the voice acting part, I most definitely recommend this game. Puzzles were fun, the exploration and story quite interesting. \nI am looking forward to the next games of this developper.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe game ran flawlessly on a windows 7 laptop. But here are a few glitches I encountered:\n- Simultaneous reading voices can be heard if you click several times on the same diary section (you are not supposed to do that, but well I did it...).\n- on Planet Kepler, in one of the houses, I first found a locked door with a keypad on the side asking to solve some mysterious equation. When I came back later to try to solve it, the locked door and keypad had disappeared. At their place was a shelf. I first thought it was a different house looking the same, but I looked everywhere and never found the first house again. If anyone has any hint about this first mysterious house, I would be interested to know.\n- outside the spaceship, after coming back from the satellite Cobalt, if you decide to turn around, the satellite is gone. You have to go back inside the spaceship, then exit again for the satellite to be there again.\n- after advancing in the game, some objects previously found, reappeared (copper wire, dark rock, bird fruit) and could be then needlessly used again.\n\n----------------\n\nNote: All negative aspects cited above about the voice acting have been resolved in the next opus of the serie:  Catyph.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494768686, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499161805, "recommendationid": "31748358", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506350", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494608084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 105, "steamid": "76561198327165140", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I dont know how people can compare this to Myst. yes Its a point , click and solve type game but thats it.  it is no where near as good as Myst.
