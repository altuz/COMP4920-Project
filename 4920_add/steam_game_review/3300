The later spinoff titles do not count, such as Bejeweled Twist here on Steam. In this installment, the sequel takes the foundation of the first game, and adds a bunch of new features and game modes to the mix. For example, the original Bejeweled literally only made the jewels disappear when matched. However, this time around, when you match 4 of the same jewel, it will morph into 1 shining jewel. And, when matched, will explode within its area for bonus points. When you match 5 of the same jewel, the jewels will transform into a Hypercube, which will strike out any jewel it comes in contact with on the board itself. In addition to the new gameplay features and changing atmospheres when completing levels (another nice touch), PopCap also introduces 3 total new modes; Endless, Puzzle, and Zen. From the sheer relaxation of endlessly playing through, the strategic thinking of the puzzles, and topping the whole game off with Zen, Bejeweled 2 makes such a simple concept as a matching game work so well and deserving of sequels. I recommend you give all 3 games a try. You'll enjoy them!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1495339936, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31874738", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198110643504", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1495275404, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 679}, "timestamp_updated": 1495339936, "received_for_free": true, "review": "I want the entire Bejeweled series!
