Highly recommended for begginers as it's easy to use, boot and render times are decent.\nOnly big issues I come across are frequent crashing but thankfully it autosaves frequently, and lack of access to more advanced tools such as camera tracking; Moving elements around the video plane can be overly complicated too.\n\nAgain I highly recommend to people who want a simple editing tool that doesn't cost a small fortune.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505955735, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505955735, "recommendationid": "35094861", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507187841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5415, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 94358, "steamid": "76561198004410106", "num_games_owned": 576}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I used Adobe Premire Pro before this but when I built a new PC I saw that this software was on Steam and figured I'd give it a shot. It took a bit just to get a feel for their differences and there still a few things that I liked better on Adobe's side, but that's just personal preference. There are some things that I do really dislike with this one though and the biggest one that comes to mind is in the cropping of video files, in that you pretty much cannot in this version. I think you can in the more expensive versions, but that's a lame thing to put in the more premium versions. I only use it for making my YouTube videos so nothing too professional or big. Making quality 4K 60fps high bit-rate videos is very easy and it takes advantage of my CUDA cores for faster processing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505779441, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505779441, "recommendationid": "35055138", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505236145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 331, "steamid": "76561198127054310", "num_games_owned": 47}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Not very happy with my product.
