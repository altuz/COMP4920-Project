If you aren't into that aspect, pass on this game.  There are many components including many weapons, shields, armor, engines and more exotic things (hacking, grappling hooks, etc).  The only real complaint with this part of the game is some components are very poorly explained.  I still don't understand the point of energy chains, for example, even though I finished the game.  The only caveat with ship building is you have to earn the parts through exploration mode (it did look like you could maybe turn that off but I never tried it).  So you may not be able to build your perfect ship and it will take time for you to real use your creativity to make interesting ships.\n\nThe rest of the game is fun enough but could really use some more polish.  Exploration mode is what I spent most of my time with.  This is a campaign where you have to explore, meet civilations, do missions, buy parts and try and defeat the Von Neuman (the AI bad guys).  It is fun enough but could have been great with some more time.  The missions only have a handful of objectives so you will repeat these many times.  You even get mostly the same missions in enemy controlled regions (with basically two mission type exceptions).  After 10-15 missions you will feel like you've seen everything and just want to get more parts for your ship and get to the end.  Another problem is it is not clear how to stop the enemy expansion.  Early on you get some missions that will slow them down.  Later these mostly go away and for every sector you take from them you lose 1 or more in return.  Even the sectors you take don't seem to change hands and you don't seem to be able to stop the attacks from happening (they are marked on the map).  This definitely needed more explanation / feedback, if nothing else.\n\nThe other modes are mainly for testing your ship and goofing around.  Skirmish, wave battles, etc.  The exception is evolution mode.  The AI fights itself (without you viewing if you ever want it to complete) and the ships slowly evolve.  Very neat concept but it is too slow and has other problems.  It will sometimes build illegal ships and it seems to only hold 32 ship designs.  Those can get filled fast and you end up losing the more advanced AI designs.  Again maybe there are ways to get around these problems but it is not obvious.  The speed is the worst though.  Small ship designs can resolve in a decent amount of time, large ship designs not at all.  I gave up on that after letting it sit for many hours and only getting through 1 or 2 rounds.\n\nIn summary, worth your time if you like ship building and can put up with some rough edges and some underwhelming aspects that should have been better.  Probably best to get this when it's on sale.  Would really love to see a sequel with a campaign more along the lines of Star Control 2 or Star Flight.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499647741, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499647741, "recommendationid": "33418846", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505727", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506459037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4374, "steamid": "76561198346681435", "num_games_owned": 1}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Best modular spaceship game I have found and I have searched everywhere.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500849141, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500849141, "recommendationid": "33754353", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505501", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502504066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 553, "steamid": "76561197999481467", "num_games_owned": 46}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "After play some hours now, i can recommend this game. Some pros and cons:\n\n\n- The physics on game are well done. Everything is natural, if your ship is heavy and you want ramming little things, this go happen. If you make a \"spear\" with strong modules to ramming in the front, go work. If you make a little ship to be fast, this go happen. Overall the physics, the modules, everything, work very well.\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n- A good variety of weapons, modules, missions and customization.\n\n\n- I see some comments about not be a \"polished\" game. I cant agree. Is a solid game at moment.\n\n\n- System wise, im playing in OSX with a \"low-mid\" system and the game is very light.\n\n\n- TL:DR: You have a Stellaris galaxy map, and any system you enter, you have a RTS FTL customized by you to destroy the things, rescue people and everything else.\n\n\n\nCons (suggestions:)\n\n\n- The lack of in-game customization to some simple controls on the hangar. I play on a notebook without the buttons to rotate the modules.\n\n\n- Sometimes you have problems in indentify allies or enemys in battle. The colors (red/green) are not strong enough\n\n\n\n- The game need something on galaxy map to identify traders, factions influence more easily.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nOverall a nice buy if you want a mix between stellaris and a RTS FTL.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502477737, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502477737, "recommendationid": "34174727", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504018", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 84, "total_reviews": 105, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 21}}
