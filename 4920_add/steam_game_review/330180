So I played it for a bit and then ... gosh, I really like this game.  It really is a cross between Snake and Pac-Man, but better-presented than even the Championship edition(s?) of Pac-Man.  It's quirky and interesting and really challenging, and seems to go on long enough to get as hard as you can survive.  It's got more interesting and challenging mechanics (speeding up over time) than either of those games did, too.\n\nI was convinced to recommend this game right at the point I unlocked Laboratory mode, which is essentially puzzle mode, but really fun.  The entire game is super well-presented, and has an art style I can't find words for but really like despite being super cartoonish.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500184598, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500184598, "recommendationid": "33577654", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 57, "total_reviews": 64, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
