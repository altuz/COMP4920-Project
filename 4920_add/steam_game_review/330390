I've played through this game at least once a year since I was about 6 on Dreamcast and later the PS2 port, so I am so glad to now have it on PC! \nThis game has an amazing story, one that keeps me coming back to play year after year. I also love the battle system! Highly reccomend this to anyone who loves JRPGs, and doesnt mind older graphics ;)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500571221, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500571221, "recommendationid": "33676626", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513202", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443048076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2296, "steamid": "76561198083397835", "num_games_owned": 47}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Having missed out on playing Grandia 2 originally, I jumped at the chance to do so on my PC. I have played Grandia way back when, and although the sequel does not share any of the characters or the world, the art style and vibrant characters and environment do seem familiar - in a good way! \n\nSo, what is it about this game that makes it so that months after putting it down, it is a game I look back on with misty eyes and a headful of fun memories and wish there were more out there like it? \n\n[h1]Let's see now...[/h1] \n\nYou play as Ryudo, a bounty-hunter of a sell sword who will lend his blade for some coin (or free food, at times!). Now this guy, for me, he single-handedly raised the game from a pleasant experience to a hilarious one! Unlike your typical helpful hero, Ryudo always had a sarcastic remark waiting to be sprung and was more than happy to tell you what was on his mind! Whilst, this could have created a rather annoyingly obnoxious character, it did the opposite. I appreciated the honesty in his amusing quips, he did not care if you were the Pope or the princess, he was going to tell you exactly what he thought of you! He seemed to have little patience for children too, but let's be honest, who does? I'll come to some quotes from him a little later, it is best seen for yourself! \n\nA few other things worth mentioning: \n\n[h1]The visuals[/h1]\n\nIt was easy on the eyes. Unlike some games I have played, whereby the blandness and greyscale worlds are literally seeping out my soul, Grandia 2 was vibrant, it was alive, it had locations where I was happy to prance about and look for things to kill. Granted, I always spent a little too long in the towns looking for people to annoy/houses to loot! So many pots to overturn!\n\n[h1]The cast[/h1]\n\nThe characters were interesting, well written and brought to life with some great voice acting. The ever- changing expressions on their dialogue reels were a nice touch too, Ryudo could go from looking very annoyed, to being dumbfounded, with the expressive imagery. A nice little touch taken from the original game.\n\n[h1]The combat[/h1]\n\nThe combat, in my opinion is what most players will remember the game for. It does away with the random monster encounters, with the enemies visible in the world around you, giving you the option to sneak behind them for a surprise attack or... sneak by them entirely if you were not feeling the need to bloody your sword! When you are wanting to battle, you will have the ability to move your characters around the battlefield, set up attacks and abilities in such a way that you are able to interrupt or counter-attack foes \u2013 this is incredibly satisfying! To control the combat in such a way, meant you were almost always able to render some enemies useless! There is also no end of abilities, magic and special moves that you can unlock through experience gain.\n\n[h1]Summarisations![/h1]\n\nIn short, I cannot recommend Grandia 2 highly enough. It has everything I love in a game and then some. The combat system and memorable cast of characters alone is a good enough reason for me to buy you all a copy! But I can't! Because, money and stuff! So, if you need any further reason to buy the game, I'll leave you with some quotes from the delightful Ryudo: \n\n[b]His thoughts on lard-butts:[/b]  \n\n[i]Ryudo: And I don't quite get this \"blessing\" stuff. That one  lard-butt looked pretty damn blessed to me. About two hundred pounds more blessed than anyone else around here.[/i] \n\n[b]His idea of fun:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: If your idea of fun is wading through rivers of blood, gobbets of flesh and gut fresh upon your lips, then yes, it will be fun.[/i] \n\n[b]His thoughts on kids joining the party:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: For now. But, if you slow us down or just piss me off, your butt will be skipping down Lollipop Lane on its own.[/i] \n\n[b]When dealing with NPCS:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: Cheerful folk. But, if I listened to every piece of good advice I heard, I'd have killed all of you already and run off with your gold.[/i] \n\n[b]His stranger danger warning:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: Elena, don't talk to strangers. Besides, they could be diseased.[/i] \n\n[b]His use of the word 'gumshoe':[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: Whoa there, gumshoe! I don't recall \"hunting down reawakening God of Evil\" as being part of my job description.[/i] \n\n[b]And he just loves kids:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: Kid, there's going to be ONE wandering spirit here real soon if you don't learn how to keep your mouth shut.[/i] \n\n[b]When being referred to as 'his kind':[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: \"My kind.\" Right. I'll just sit over here and think filthy, unclean thoughts, then.[/i] \n\n[b]No bake sales? Aww!:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: Hey! HEY! Princess! The power of Darkness isn't coming this way to tell us about the neighborhood bake sale. We need to leave![/i] \n\n[b] And lastly, his standpoint on giving a damn:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: ...

So the party will have to face body parts, tongue, eye, etc.\n\nBattle is ok, magic animation feels long @_@ I hope there's a option to skip it... Because spells/skills that hit hard have long animation.\nAnd I have experience screen freeze because of it, first and last happened when first battle againts Millenia using zap spells. Solved it by turn off 60fps option and try lowering graphic option.\nIconic skills Sky Dragon Slash is here too!\n\nI have finished this game in hard mode, pretty easy because there's plenty of save place that recover all, hard notable fight is enemy on bonus stage, Raul Hills maze enemy (have spell that hit hard almost one hit kill), sequential boss fight on last dungeon, and last boss ^^\n\nps: waiting for Grandia Xtreme ^^", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501997491, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502001768, "recommendationid": "34053179", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484742", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 563, "total_reviews": 616, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 53}}
