A bit too easy for my taste. Maybe consider buying it at sale (This game is rather short hence around 14,99 \u20ac/ 18 $ is a bit too much) ![/h1]\n\nI like this game, because it just feels like a classic although it's from around 2010. And that's partially because of the first and most obvious flaw: The sound quality of the voices is really bad, so that one might think that this game must be reaaaally old. Well it's not, so this flaw could have been avoided!\nThe second thing which bothered me was that there is no \u201efast travel\u201c option, so that you have to wait for Pizzaboy to walk towards a door everytime, again and again. And he walks very slowly\u2026\n\nThe rest of the \"classic-feeling\" arises from the funny and great drawn characters, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1126455572 the funny but not silly story and humor, the not totally abstruse but reasonable easy riddles and the interesting story. You are reminded every minute of this game that it\u2019s made by former Lucas Arts members.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1130204688\nThe help given by Pizzaboy's journal is - for my taste - a bit too obvious. Other games give you a hint and let you do the rest yourself, this game bluntly gives you the direct solution to a riddle.
