Game locks you in small rooms and has you jump and spawn platforms under your feet creating staircases for yourself. Grab coins and reach exits. Level design relies on a lot of verticality for no apparent reason. You can platform spawn spam your way anywhere and the game has no challenge. Did not find the audiovisual presentation very engaging. The supposedly trippy atmosphere just felt like a lack of plot and random assets.
