The graphics are very nice for a game at this low price point.  More of a puzzle game then action for sure.  I got stuck on where to go as you can see in my first impressions video, but looks like it might easily be worth the money if you enjoy these kind of casual, relaxing games.\n\nIt's a hard game to explain, but you essentially swim around possessing different types of nearby fish as you progress and release captured special \"elder fish\" by connecting energy lasers in crystal formations that you find.  There doesn't look to be any real threat of death or any enemy fish, its much more of a leisurely exploratory type of game.\n\nNot for everyone, but I think some people will really enjoy this one and it is certainly unique.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454784422, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454784422, "recommendationid": "21004046", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519042", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504608341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 895, "steamid": "76561198051824217", "num_games_owned": 315}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Broken controls, sluggish perfomance. 0/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1470814921, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1470814921, "recommendationid": "24806085", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497565", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459981527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 58, "steamid": "76561198069650559", "num_games_owned": 51}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A beautiful exploration game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459903284, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1459903284, "recommendationid": "22261497", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494193", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499100408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 38, "steamid": "76561198002046645", "num_games_owned": 63}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "lovely visuals.  relaxing gameplay.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502047406, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502047406, "recommendationid": "34067019", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499892720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561197995327520", "num_games_owned": 922}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "3", "review": "The only part of the background story for the game I know about is from the Steam store page.

(I can look it up but why not help me along to get me interested?)\n\nControls feel a bit awkward. And the \"cleansing\" process (whatever it is for...) seems needlessly to involve long and click/hold button sequences.\n\nVisuals are fine (but no full screen?).
