Healers heal, tanks tank, dps do damage.\nThen you get a bit of micromanagement to do.\n\nSometimes raidmembers switch roles and you need to yell at them.\nSomtimes raidmembers stand in fire and you need at them.\nSometimes the melee walk into the backline and you need to yell at them.\nSometimes the tank gets low and you need to yell at the healers to keep them up (which works, unlike in World of Warcraft).\nMaybe a fight is too rough, so you go back to an older dungeon to gear up.\n\nLater the fights get complexer. You'll need to pay attention to mechanics and macro manage your raid as well as micro manage your raid at the same time.\n\nI find it enjoyable and considering it's price tag I'd recomend waiting for a sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503675993, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503675993, "recommendationid": "34484216", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500110", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 68, "total_reviews": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 22}}
