I'm not saying it's a bad game, but it ramps up the difficulty quite fast and will severely anger you. It reminds me of those rage inducing games that youtubers play in a way. I know if someone was recording my reactions to failing over and over, it would probably be entertaining. \n\nI do like this game. I have no idea why, since all it does is raise my blood pressure. I guess I'm just a sucker for punishment. \n\nGraphics: Nothing special, but they look nice and do the job. \n\nControls: They work, but due to the game mechanics and gravity, this game is hard to control. \n\nSounds: Nothing special. The music is ok, and the other noises get the job done. One thing I did notice though was this game is super loud. It plays a lot louder than my other games. And there's no way in game to adjust it. \n\nChallenge: Yeah. It's a challenge alright. Prepare to get super mad!\n\nFun: I really don't know. I enjoy completing a level with a perfect, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that the experience is fun. \n\nConclusion: This is a hard game to rate. It doesn't deserve a thumbs down, but it is so frustrating and tedious that it's hard to give it a thumbs up. In the end, I will give it a thumbs up, but if you get angered by frustrating games, then stay far far away from this one.\n\nRating: 19302548 wandering star fish out of 35601798 wandering star fish.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494127129, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494127129, "recommendationid": "31595062", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
