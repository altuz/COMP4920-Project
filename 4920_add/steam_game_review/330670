I play on mouse and keyboard but I imagine that it'll be even more fun to play on a controller.\n\nI look forward to the possibility of Online Co-Op \nWell done all!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440109538, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440109538, "recommendationid": "17635898", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506290", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460911507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 160, "steamid": "76561197972829522", "num_games_owned": 336}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Awesome soundtrack, incredibly stylish game.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's basically a twin-stick shooter which is naturally best enjoyed with a gamepad. There looks to be (IMO) a lot of replayability in terms of mastery of the levels. Very reminiscent of Towerfall, another game I loved.\n\nI've made it through the first 3 worlds so far, really looking forward to more of the single player campaign and trying out the local multiplayer.\n\nCan't recommend buying the version with the OST enough if you like electronica/dubstep!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440256626, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440256626, "recommendationid": "17662246", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506386", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440322226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1061, "steamid": "76561198001087883", "num_games_owned": 388}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It seems so simple, throw some discs around and dodge some enemies. After spending 3 hours trying to finish the first level  in the campaign I had to give up and take a break. I am clearly not as skilled as I assumed I was, I needed some time to re-eveluate life choices and check where I went wrong. This game is a [i]very[/i] entertaining challenge for me, I'm hooked on it and picking it right back up after I finish writing this review!\n\nThe gameplay is very smooth. I'm personally playing using keyboard and mouse but I really should get myself a controller for this. The art and music are very well done, and they blend in perfectly to add to that all-important gameplay, and really help to stay motivated.\n\nAlso, I can't wait to get some friends round and test the multiplayer on this, I foresee some very interesting chaos!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440114056, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440114056, "recommendationid": "17636667", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.972654", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451005023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 117, "steamid": "76561198002722958", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is the best game I've bought recently, I highly recommend it! I love the retro feel - and the music is so cool, not to mention the character illustrations.\n\nThe story line is really good too - in the training level, you are introduced to the Ninja Master who teaches you the way of the ninja and all the controls to play the game. You throw your discs at ememies to kill them, and you can even catch your own discs as they bounce off the walls and come back towards you like a true ninja.\n\nEven though it's fast paced it's quick and easy to pick up. It's full of surprises too! Just after learning from the ninja master in the training level, I had to put my skills to the test by battling the very master himself.\n\nYou can choose from a range of characters - I chose to play as Gustav on the first level as he most resembled me with his moustache and mexican vibe. I was glad to discover I could change my character at any stage and chose Alyssa for the next level cos she looks cooler with her purple hair. As you progress, you can unlock new outfits and stuff too which adds to the story.\n\nThe baddy's are pretty varied - there are the bog standard trolls, and then the more dangerous ones to keep you on your toes. The bosses can be pretty funny too, the first boss I came across was a big ape throwing banana peels at me!\n\nI've been playing this on my laptop, but I'm definitely going to have to get the console version of this.
