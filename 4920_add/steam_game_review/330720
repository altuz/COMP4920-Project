Reading Harold Coyle's Team Yankee, I just had to play this game again.\n\nNow, I am biased - the first scenario I played took place in July 1989 - exactly the time I was in the Bundeswehr, quite close by and I had actually been at one of the unit's barracks described in the mission briefing. So for me there is a whole lot of reminiscing in the game.\n\nBut apart from that you a great \"what if\". There seems to be a never-ending horde of Russian tanks and other vehicles, coming through somewhere, and you have to stop them. Every one of your own losses hurts - and the NATO concept in Germany does not allow you to yield any ground. It's do or die.\n\nIf you are interested in war games and this period of time, this is a must buy.\n\nThe one major con I have encountered so far is the victory condition calculations - they seem quite arbitrary to me. Going up against a major force I nearly stopped them cold. Turned out to be a 54% score -  a Contested Battle. Well - judge your achievements for yourself, I guess!\n\nTalking about achievements - that's another point. Too bad it doesn't have any, neither can you post screen shots. In today's world you call that a major social media marketing mishap.\n\nStill: Go buy it, support fringe publisher!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506515991, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506515991, "recommendationid": "35240867", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501418637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 9554, "steamid": "76561198020979772", "num_games_owned": 54}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Without a doubt the best tactical simulator i have ever seen\nin or out of the army. The WEGO turn system is great and\nworks awesome. The Ai is good at all levels but probably\nmore realistic if cranked up. Tactically speaking, Warpac\nacts like..A  War Pac force... Amazing!!  NATO actually sticks to\nNATO doctrine Even more amazing and the two fight in entirely\ndiffrent ways. The OOB is Realistic and simple to understand\nChain-of-command is easy to follow and easy to customise. \nInfact you can fiddle with and re orginise your forces to any\nreasonable config you like. Supply is fairly realistic as well. \n\nIn summary, If you are looking for a good tactical sim, up\nto brigade level and you want REALISM... This IS for you.\nIf, however you prefer to build a base structure and spam\nunits you may not like this as your forces are set from the start.\nand there are no fantasy Giant tanks or super battleships\nor a fleet of german CV's.....", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504777959, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504777959, "recommendationid": "34791316", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 49, "total_reviews": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
