The premise is simple - Wipeout in ships that can race on the outside of tubes. \n\nBack in the early days of VR, roller coaster rides were very popular, and developers were competing to make the sickest rides, and it feels as though the devs of this game had the ambition to combine the fastest, most gut wrenching roller coaster ride, with an actual game... and failed. \n\nAt these speeds, the concept of an extremely twisted track will cause the average player to be on the \"underside\" of the tube pretty often, which means you can only see the track a few meters in front of you. So unless you know the track by heart, anything you do at this point is pure luck - you have no idea whether to turn left or right or stay put.\n\nFurthermore, the handling of the ships themselves just feels \"off\" and unsatisfiying - especially during jumps and the concave parts of the track. The AI opponents seem to whizz around extremely erradically.\n\nWeapons were also added very late in the development cycle, and they're an unbalanced mess.\n\nYou unlock different ships during the single player \"campaign\", and they differ in the balance of shield, handling and speed. But changing ships during a session on the same track is ridiculously cumbersome, requiring you to quit all the way to the main menu if you wanna see the stats of the available ships.\n\nThe presentation is also lackluster - the visuals suffer from very crude textures plagued by \"coder color\" syndrome, and NO lightning/shadows making everything look very flat and dull.\n\nThe \"techno\" music has it's moments though.\n\nMeh.\n\n58%", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502552402, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502552511, "recommendationid": "34193960", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508057", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503816978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 33, "steamid": "76561198148142802", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "not that good. could be more fun", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503864711, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503864711, "recommendationid": "34538034", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480115498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 56, "steamid": "76561198031201473", "num_games_owned": 468}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Second best hovercraft tube racing game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503199380, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503199380, "recommendationid": "34364339", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503214", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 67, "total_reviews": 81, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 14}}
