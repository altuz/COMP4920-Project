This adventure sure was a thrilling one with a tonne of interesting and colourful characters, particularly seeing how some of them grow and change throughout the story and each one having motivations of their own, which makes them seem like real people. There's a lot they managed to pack into this 10-hour epic journey - silliness, thrills, emotional moments, and a tonne of laughs and jokes. It does a really decent job taking you on an emotional rollercoaster and getting invested in the characters and the outcome of their lives.\n\nThe game is set in the Borderlands universe, but I don't think it's necessary to have played previous Borderlands games, since the story here is its own and follows its own characters for the most part, though having played at least some of the Borderlands games or DLCs might make you appreciate some things more whilst playing this game.\n\nI really enjoyed the story-telling in this game. Firstly because it had two leading protagonists, and the point of view would often change between them, so we'd see the experiences of both of them, particularly when they'd split up. Another thing I really enjoyed was the fact that it wasn't cliche or predictable, and that's always a pleasant experience, when a story can surprise you instead of you going \"yep, I've seen that coming\", and it sure has managed to surprise me a number of times with the direction it went.\n\nAs with most Telltale games, there are elements of choice and consequence present in this game. Though the main story outcomes would largely be the same, some decisions sure seem to change a few things around. The rest of the gameplay mainly involves interacting with the environment, quick time events, and choosing dialogue options in conversations. So it's not too hard or complex. Just a lovely story for you to enjoy and participate in. The episodes are all pretty meaty too, especially the 5th episode which seemed to be almost as long as two different episodes. Beautiful art style, music, and voice acting too.\n\nReally don't have anything to criticise aside from maybe suspension of disbelief pushing it too far in some instances, such as characters not being in a full space suit whilst crawling outside the ship in freezing open space, or a few very lucky escapes in action scenes. But otherwise, this game is a real thrill and enjoyment.

This game is incredible! You wouldn't believe it.\n\n Great story, awesome characters. Totally a masterpiece by Telltale Games. Choices matter and you can play however your story would like to become. The introductions in every episode feels so relaxing with very nice music, nice narrative storytelling recaps to previous episodes and almost every ending of each episodes finishes off with a cliffhanger. So many hilarious scenes with never-ending humor that would make me laugh and cry. That's because they are here to make you laugh and cry. One of those best stories made by Telltale Games is just heartbreaking that could take you to a journey far, far away. \n\nThere are also very great voice actors doing a really good job, especially to those of Troy Baker (Rhys) and Laura Bailey (Fiona). Also featuring the returning characters with the same voice actors from previous games in the main Borderlands series, including badass Vault Hunters Zer0 and Athena becoming allies with you and also featuring psychopath Handsome Jack, who wants to become your friend (or is that so?). \n\nThis story feels so unexpected in a way when playing through, depending on different choices you will make. I feel like I wouldn't even stop playing it. Nice action, breathtaking humour and all the fun stuff. I love this game so damn much!\n\nWARNING: Yes, yes, yes. There are going to be a lot of blood, gore, brutal killing and creepy faces, so beware.\n \nJust seriously. The best Telltale game ever made. It is like no other Telltale games.
