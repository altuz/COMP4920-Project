Do barrel rolls, mortal flips, spit at some American cop's face, doesn't matter. Go grab it. \n[*]If you're just looking for a good plot-driven game but you're coming out from the blue, repeat step above right now. \n[*]If you just want some game were choices matters at spectacular level, this game isn't the best for you. I recommend [i]Tales of Bordelands[/i] or even [i]Batman Telltales [/i]- ''Tailored by how you play'' can be an overstatement here so wait for some discount.[/olist]\n\n[h1]Detailed \u2193[/h1]\n\n[b]New to Telltales?[/b]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is an interactive ''movie game'' you'll be using your controls during action scenes but not just for combatants. GOT series have been poorly conceived on games, Telltales is the best we got. If someone tells you this is just The Walking Dead with swords, ignore, that soul doesn't comprehend our Westeros blood. There is more.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This game doesn't require any plot knowledge, it is friendly for recent arrivals and works perfectly to engage Game of Thrones universe by George R. R. Martin, if you haven't you will soon. The cold hearted narrative and the literal gaming for power and survival and its subsequent blood shed and twists; the formula behind the books and the TV show. For fans, it is a dream to drive the plot at will - or at guts or dexterity. \n\n[list][*]Don't get your hopes too high for an spectacular season finale or great consequences. It isn't another case of 2 endings like [i]Life is Strange[/i] but I feel it could have been better. Feels more like the first steps for Season 2.\n[*]Each episode will have its own ending, but they're not really that cumulative for six episodes, you will still have a couple varieties per character but I think it should have at least 30 different endings, [b]lol[/b] at me, I know Corporate Commander would never approve it.\n[*]The game has a broad variety of conversation options, it should be impressive, but Development trickery often tries to fool you to think consequences are always happening. Too complex to be relating every time it happens, but you still have some reminder and hints warnings after choosing some of them.[/list]\n\nThe game will give you different consequences and some group tree so to speak. Between the forced illusion and real freedom, you surely feel connected but not always in control...  blatant scripts can undermine it but it is enjoyable regardless. I guess we either accept it or backlash to demand better efforts, what can you do.\n\n[h1]The universe for engaged fans[/h1]\n[b]Jump to newbies if not. 3 half-spoiled paragraphs ahead.[/b]\n\n[b]#1 is:[/b]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The character swaps from each other smoothly as the episode unfolds, just like the TV show. Characters and locations that are actually important on the franchise are present on the game, from the good Jon Snow to the cold Cersei Lannister and also my two favorite classic characters and actors- Emilia's Daenerys and Peter's Tyrion. The new characters, mostly from Forrester family are easy likeable, also for the voice acting reasons.\n\n[b]#2 is:[/b]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0George's universe blends references such as the [i]\"Wonders Made by Man\"[/i] a book written by Lomas Longstrider the traveller owned by new playable character, Mira. You get to be around more active things such as the imprisonment of lord Tyrion and the Red Wedding event. When all that shows up interacting with new characters under your control, you get that insta-smile. When you die, its down to ''[b]Valar Morghulis[/b]\" as it suits our doom just fine. \n\n[b]#3 is:[/b]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asher Forrester probably works as a theoretical main character for you if Gared Tuttle couldn't impress you, Asher's insertion and his friend Beskha energy probably will. They're so good and compatible that I already got mines, like the humble loyal handmaiden. Mira has the unlucky role to fight with words instead of swords on King's Landing. Such soul having to deal with Cersey is no small task - and it is quite the scene in-game. The way you can get in or out with Tyrion's evil sister and manipulate everyone from there (if you got the balls) is very pleasing for the likes of me. They're compatible, no silly gamey personas around the classics - they got identity by themselves.\n\nGared Tuttle, the first character you get to play with is not to be confused with Gared the ranger, the one who dies at TV GOT's episode ''Winter Is Coming'' at the hands of some White Walker. Things got swapped from [i]A Song of Ice and Fire[/i], and the name Gared feels just recycled.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1146363663\n\n[h1]The universe for newbies[/h1]\n\nWith attempts to be likeable, Gared isn't even a Forrester but non-bought loyalty does exists and this is pretty realistic. [u]It is amusing to fight against the character itself, changing him to fit you isn't easy.[/u] Humans are weird and your interests may change when characters swaps. You will try to be a decent warrior with Rodrik Forrester and a funny glorious \u0299\u1d00s\u1d1b\u1d00\u0280\u1d05 with Asher... and King's Landing might reveal that treacherous side you have, that's how well crafted the game is with plot just as the classic works.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You must understand Game of Thrones signature, everyone is trying to rise or to survive and trust is always in balance and rarely established - when it is, your expectancy isn't. This game is plenty of chances for you to understand how hard is to be good on this selfish ''planeto''. Always  assume ''if you want peace, prepare for war\" instance. But I love how you can transform a sweet loyal girl like Mira into a treacherous snake if you deem wise, losing her decency or better yet, her Forrester-y in the process. Humans. Weird.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1146405567\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Forrester great-sword and its house Ironrath shield has an strange resemblance to the King's sword and Gondor's symbol from The Lord of The Rings. I must be a fool for making such shameful waste of paragraph and abusing my reader's patience.\n\n[b]Fool me once, shame on you[/b]\nSometimes the game exaggerates and [spoiler]death[/spoiler] becomes predictable. Unavoidable scripts are nothing new, BUT mistakes are unacceptable. [spoiler]If you deny food to Whitehill's men, Gryff will later say you're leaving them drunk.[/spoiler] Sure, HBO never gave Telltale enough money.\n\n[h1]Final thoughts[/h1]\n[olist][*]The graphics and animation haven't aged very well, because they have never been great anyway (they look oily painty) It still have some beauty.\n[*]During combat scenes, you're prompted with modern quick-time event, not very traditional. It isn't easy, so don't underestimate it. It has some rare bugs in that and on reloading. WASD controls on the keyboard will be used for walking in short spaces and look for items.\n[*]Item grabbing. It is a game. It got items, they're used in key situations.\n[*]Dialogue is timed. Silence is way to pass it but it is well made. You don't get that cold ''waiting for answer'' from other games, voice acting still goes during the countdown and its realistic. Facial animations are really not good. Still better than ME: Andromeda. \n[*]The music is good, it ranges from the series to news. The development team is taking too long to produce next season. The whispering from weirwoods says around 2019. The JOIN! us prompt everytime you finish episodes is very annoying.\n[*] No backgrounds, no cards, no emoticons. Thanks Valve, HBO and Telltales, outstanding move.\n Sarcasm that.[/olist]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1146358583]Vertical Screenshot.[/url]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506366424, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506377038, "recommendationid": "35208849", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538594", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505814163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1542, "steamid": "76561198068873044", "num_games_owned": 520}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Chances are  you'd have heard of Game of Thrones. A popular show, based on an acclaimed series of novels called \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", which now gets attention from TellTale, the ones who are famous for their episodic point and click games. Is it a good match? One doesn't need to know a lot to bet on \"yes\". But is it worth the players while? Introducing to this new series, House Forrester is the one who's family members are mostly spread throughout the world, taking their shot at the game for the sake of not losing everything they have, a consequences of being on the losing side of the war.  At a first glance, fans would feel that this family is heavily inspired on the Starks. While true in a sense, it's not a \"The Force Awakens\"  similar to \"A New Hope\" situation. As the story progresses, you can see that they have their own personalities and they handle the events better. While you don't need to be a fan of either the show or the books, the main episode may be lacking tense feelings and wow factors, as it starts with the brutal event that had people talking for a long time and put the show on the map. Since it's the world of Game of Thrones you can expect things to not go your way, it will be unfair and you'll ask a question along side a character \"Why do the Gods keep fucking us?\". The main characters won't feel weak though. Even with a crippled one you'll have the option to make a stand, although it won't lead to glory. Political machinations, bloody deals and forced changes, that's what the story is about.\n\nI've played through the game twice. Had I written the review after the first play-through, I would have rated it negative. Second time around, one year later from playing it, I've made different choices, but I've also seen the same things with different eyes. Perhaps knowing the story, not having the tension of what comes next changed my perspective on things. Perhaps I've gone soft. The problem I've had the first time around was that it all felt to brutal, like they writers were going to much with the \"unfair\" and the \"murder\". Characters would die before you'd care for them to live. Then the other main issue was that whenever things would lighten up, dynamic consequences were you could bring changes for the better, there was always a plot bomb to put the character down, neutralize everything. Add a perceived as a cliffhanger ending, which I see as a teaser trailer for the next season(it might be, considering it takes place after what felt like a final scene), and you can see why most people are displeased with it. \n\nPlaying through the second time around, in a time where I played mostly TellTale games, the loved and the loathed, I could say that Game of Thrones-A TellTale series is not the one to be dismissed and watch somewhere else online. I've noticed in the analytics regarding choices how extreme the unbalance is, as most people go for the same thing, disregarding the alternative. Most of my choices were in the 6.8% to 39%, while having a few of little over 60%. Certain characters make it through the season at inhuman costs or cheap tricks. Picking an ally means making a secret enemy of someone else. Making a choice of who lives and who dies changes the course of the final episode, which is not a short one. The length of most episode is close to two hours, the fifth one being a short one, being ten minutes over an hour. \n\nFollowing the formula from the books and the show, the story is divided into different point of views, the main characters being in different places yet tied to each other, in this case by blood. There's the crippled former warrior that stands high as a lord, the squire that wants to prove himself he can do more than serve wine, the little boy that has to grow up faster to be a lord, the handmaiden that sets her own webs in a place of intrigue and deceits, the exiled brother who's in an exotic place and is the charming fellow with something sharp in each hand. You'll have three dialogue types, ranging from diplomatic to aggressive, however tied enough together to show their uniqueness to their character. While silence is an option, it does feel like an absence of your character's implication most of the time. In certain key moments, you'll have the big choices to make. Just like in any TellTale game however, you may change how a thing happens, but you won't stop the plot from happening. That said, the game won't impress you with its variation if you replay it at once, but it's story, design of the characters  and well-crafter soundtrack may warrant a replay across the years. I feel the disappointment of the ones that wanted to have the option of triumph and it's a bile to swallow the fact that the only thing it goes down to is delaying the loss, but such are dark fantasy stories that are made with multiple parts, in this case seasons to follow. Enjoying the characters, the QTE (yeah, first time I've said that, maybe the only game where I've enjoyed Quick Time Events, finding them fluent and entertaining), and trying out the other options for the sake of seeing small scale changes, it's a way to pass the time without regretting it. \n\nWhile it's not everyone's cup of tea and me not being a fan of the show, after playing this, I feel like saying: \"Iron from Ice!\".", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505822540, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505895386, "recommendationid": "35062974", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530283", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505273870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 565, "steamid": "76561198016648277", "num_games_owned": 271}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "28 euros for what i would think of is even a stretch to call an interactive movie... sure its interactive as in you can choose some dialog options every now and then but 9 out of 10 times those dialog options wont change anything for the story. the few the game has quicktime events are super broken for me seeing how the game doesnt recognize my azerty keyboard layout, im not at all saddened by this however seeing how quicktime events are the lowest of the low in videogame actionsequences... turn a nice action scene into a qt event and even that becomes boring as hell.  i strongly suggest that you instead of wasting your money on this game watch a playthrough on youtube, all you will miss out on are some quicktime events.... in fact as im writing this i remember that every episode of the game has a fairly long UNSKIPPABLE comming up next episode part showing you whats gonne happen in the episode you're about to play next and then when you start the next episode theres a freaking 10 min UNSKIPPABLE heres what happened in the prev episode.... i freaking just played that episode and you're gonne show me an unskippable recap of what i just did.... so at least on youtube you can skip through this nonsense. even tho i own the game and have played through 4episodes i will continue on with the series by watching lets plays so i can skip through the boring parts and recaps", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505602965, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505602965, "recommendationid": "35009225", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509390", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478364190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1196, "steamid": "76561198069659704", "num_games_owned": 437}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An extremely disappointing game with deceptive and misleading marketing. They promised the players the ability to make choices and decide the fate of the protagonists but we cannot make any meaningful choices whatsoever, their fates have already been decided by the devs before the game even starts, they only present you with the illusion of choice. The only choices that you get to actually make are minor and irrelevant and by the time you've realized that it's far too late for a refund of your money and your time. \n\nThis game is basically a linear cutscene story that's occasionally interrupted by quicktime events. And you're probably not going to enjoy the story at all, because of 2 main reasons. First, the story itself is not original because your protagonist house (the Foresters) is modeled after the Starks so everything will seem very familiar and unoriginal, lazy writing at its best. Second of all **SPOILER ALERT UNTIL THE END OF THIS PARAGRAPH**, the game much like the show itself follows the same \"dark fantasy recipe\" which means that it will use cheap tricks to try and get you to care about your characters and protagonists just so it can shock and hurt you later when they inevitably get brutally murdered. Rinse and repeat. Because of that there is no such thing as a \"good ending\" in this game, there is only bad and worse. I actually mean that, for me the game finished with a scene of my head being chopped off. The end.\n\nSo no, I cannot recommend this game to anyone else, not even to the fans of the show.
