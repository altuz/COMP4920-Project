This is not the most attractive popcap game. The sound effects are very catchy and so is the music. The core mechanic is drag entire lines of ponpons around to match lines until you fill a bottle for level up and score increase. There are also zen and speed modes. Its catchy and will help your mind tune off, and the cutesy appeal is still there despite the primitive presentation but it is on the edge of being too obsolete to keep around"}, {"votes_down": 21, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1493673441, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463209", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "31495148", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198357888491", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1503763098, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 802}, "timestamp_updated": 1493673441, "received_for_free": true, "review": "hi"}]}
