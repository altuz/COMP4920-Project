Sure, there are bugs and compatibility issues, the visuals are really dated, game process is too simple, just run and gun everything around...  Yet, it's a really cool game, an isometric analog to Serious Sam. A very addictive variant to spend an hour after a hardwork day, when your brain just can't get something as complex as a story in some RPG... but certainly needs a valve turn, to let the steam off. Just kill the hordes of aliens, going lower and lower underground, clearing out some secret military bunker, filled with lizard-looking predators from top to bottom.\n\nThe main downside of this release is about there's only 10 levels (out of 30 originally created), so, the end of the game comes too soon (in an hour, maybe), and you really want to do more of this (it's really addictive). Well, for one, there's a survival mode, for two, I can only suggest you to buy this game in a bundle with other Sigma studio games, to prolong the slaughter.\n\nSpeaking of bugs and issues again, remember it's a 37Mb WinXp little game, which you can probably run on your fridge or toaster by now. If you're trying to play it with Win10 system, just turn on XPcompatibility, and fix the resolution manually in the game files. That way you'll get rid of the crushes that game can possibly try to perform on the newest PCs. However, there is one more serious bug around, about the most powerful enemies (behemots) AI. When I've played it decade ago, they were running on you, just like all of the other creatures. Now, they are trying to move to the opposite direction (and gets stuck in the walls). That's really strange behavior, and I think it can be fixed, although I don't know how.\n\nOkay, once again: it's a very old and short isometric shooter. It's still quite good for a short brake time, though, and it's cheap enough. However, I suggest to buy it only in a bundle, with other Sigma games, and with an overall discount. That way you'll not feel chagrin even if you'll not like it from the first glance. My mark is 7/10."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503614187, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513561", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34469208", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198107580793", "num_reviews": 40, "last_played": 1504459467, "num_games_owned": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 172}, "timestamp_updated": 1503614187, "received_for_free": false, "review": "old childhood memories"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503969926, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34566104", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198244060760", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505954951, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 270}, "timestamp_updated": 1503969926, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is great sure its old but for what it is if your looking to kill time highly recommended, but be careful if play on windows 7+ for the game crashes when you die"}]}
