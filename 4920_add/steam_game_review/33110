Looking slightly better with higher screen resolutions, provides more heroes to choose from at the start... And, the most noticable thing, right from the start, the game expects you to choose a difficulty level. And if you don't have enough pain in your life, choose the \"Impossible\" level. Be my guest. It's like smoking a cigar. No badge or achievement whatsoever, a lot of damage to your health... but, if you'll manage it, you'll be feeling yourself as tough as Schwarzenegger or Castro.\n\nWell, actually, no. I'm not going to promote cigar smoking here, for that game (or smoking) will not make you any tougher or better in any way. It'll only hurt you badly. Don't start the \"Impossible\" level, it's not worth it. I know that because I've tried, and finished it. It's about 1 hour for the first 8 levels, and 4 hours for 9 and 10 levels. Four hours each. Yeah, I could definetely made something better with my life.\n\nBut, seriously, Alien Shooter is still a one fine isometric shooter, which weighs so little (220 Mb) that you can just store it on your hardware just in case you'll be not in the mood for anything but simplistic killing all the way. If you never get that mood, well... Sorry, I don't believe you. People who never ever wanted to squash aliens (or whatever else what's got in the way), will not be reading reviews for this game.\n\nOkay, enough with all that Marilyn Manson talks. Buy this game in the bundle with other Sigma team titles, preferrably discounted, and try it out for yourself. For me, it's 6/10 mark game, which looks better than the original, plays a bit smoother than original for a while... And then it punches you right in the kisser, and expects you to swallow it. Still, a good short brake thing, with the survival mode, and red (or green) blood all over the floor, everywhere around... and you know that it was you who did it. Oh, sorry, more of Manson talks, and I don't even like the guy."}]}
