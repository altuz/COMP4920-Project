I remember playing this as a kid, and I was excited when I recently found out that it was available on Steam. This game has great races and mini-games. The controls can sometimes feel floaty and weird, but it is easy to get used to (I used a PS4 controller). The hub world, consisting of Radiator Springs, Ornament Valley, and Tailfin Pass, give you this sense of exploration. Not to mention you can hit npc cars in these hubs which can be very hilarious if you are doing this with someone watching you. You can choose a difficulty before starting Story Mode, which are Rookie, Pro, Champion, and another mode that is the most challenging that you need to unlock (I don't know how to unlock it or the name of it). The cutscenes have original voice actors. You can also get bonus content like characters (note: unlocked characters can't be used in Story Mode), paint jobs for characters, art, deleted cutscenes, and other videos, but you need to pay with points you receive in-game. The characters you unlock can only be used in Arcade and Multiplayer. Arcade is where you can choose a character and paint job and choose any mini-game or race that you have unlocked while playing in Story Mode. Multiplayer is basically just Arcade but with multiplayer. Multiplayer is split screen, and there is no online play. The only downfall is the sometimes floaty and weird controls that can take some getting used to and the difficulty that keeps on switching from easy to difficult, then back to easy and cycle repeats. Overall, it is a great game that anyone can enjoy, and I am more than happy to call it one of my favorite racing games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503498540, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503498540, "recommendationid": "34439515", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501310691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 286, "steamid": "76561198190763534", "num_games_owned": 17}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Let me say one thing...AMAZING. For all those windows 10 users i found out the issue. What i believe it is, is that you guys have updated your computer to windows 10. When you upgrade, the computer does not recive everything windows 10 has to offer. My computer with natural windows 10 works the game very well.
