I know this game from RAC, the artist who made the soundtrack for this game; the soundtrack is good to listen for soundtrack lover like me, but I strongly recommend playing it while RAC's sound flowing in your ears, they are perfectly suited. The difficulty here are both the pro and con, since it is so hard but hard only in a single boring way. Even if you can beat Shovel Knight or Hollow Knight, you cannot beat this insanely hard game.\n+ The Difficulty that would crush you hundreds of times even in Stage 1\n+ Soundtrack from a genious electronic music artist\n+ A good story that could be made into a great stealth game if adding more details\n+ Nostalgia to these classic old games that are hard like hell\n- too hard\n- too hard\n- insanely hard\nPs: I really want to go over stage 2 and listen to HongKong, which is the best song in this album and is the main theme in stage 3.\nBut I never could. I was totally crushed like that flower under my foot. \nBeauty always dies:)\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505778712, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505778712, "recommendationid": "35054960", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499191", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506770204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 305, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 771, "steamid": "76561198029512145", "num_games_owned": 622}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Challenge, art, music.
