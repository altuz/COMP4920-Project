More levels, most of them - quite lengthy. To the point where you need to drive armed vehicles to get through all the wilderness, filled with the hordes (hundreds, thousands) of alien invaders, with the goal of saving the world (and the girl) in the end. Tough enemies, many different weapons to annihilate them, various sequences and aRPG levelling, and even some story with two different endings! Well, maybe Alien Shooter 2 not the very best of the all isometric shooter genre... But it's a quite good approach to that.\n\nAnyway, to put it short, you gotta fill some aliens with the lead, covering all the floors on your way with the blood. That simple, that hard. Worth 6.9/10 mark in my list. With a discount - very good pick, for a steam releasing shooting time so many of us need after some hard day at the office."}]}
