Instead, they opted to release an embarrassingly short and painfully butchered appetizer.\n\nOne should be easily inclined to forgive unrefined details in Early Access but no update in over a year severely burdens the game's credibility.\n\nThe game largely plays like any classic 90's point and click adventure, except for an interestingly unconventional \"inspiration\" mechanic that lets players collect and use abstract items such as emotions. Big points here for a truly original idea.\n\nVery uneven art results in pixelated animations built from very low-resolution sprites, poorly compressed, and sometimes out of focus or misaligned. Low quality here is not an aesthetic choice and does not suggest easily replaceable work in progress.\n\nItem placement, puzzles and the world around them feel very inorganic and contrived. You'll pick up any random thing without purpose or guidance, including items never used in this brief chapter.\n\n[h1]Positive[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Likable main characters Bolt and Smokey\n[*] Original theme and good general vibe\n[*] Innovative \"inspiration\" mechanic\n[*] Excellent reggae soundtrack\n[*] Decent-looking environment art\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Negative[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Useless and repetitive dialogues\n[*] Heavy in clich\u00e9s\n[*] Overdrawn intro tutorial\n[*] Only a handful of backdrops to explore\n[*] Unfocused narrative direction: there is more story in the trailer than the entire chapter\n[*] Technically unstable with buggy saved games and crashes\n[*] Clumsy-looking characters without lip sync\n[/list]\n\nThis game had a lot of potential but releasing it in this rushed state is an insult to the player.
