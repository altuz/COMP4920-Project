It features every single thing a bullet hell must have, frustration included.\n\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nThere's no much to say about the story. There is no depth on the story, like most of the bullet hell games out there.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nSurprisingly enough, the rhythm mechanic works quite well in Miko Gakkou: Second Year. While playing the first couple of songs, I did have a lot of difficulty to understand the timing, but after playing the same song a couple of times, you start figuring what instrument you should follow the timing.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\nThe seiyuus (voice actresses) are really good. Their voices fit well in the game, and the general sound is not intrusive or out of place. It goes without saying that a lot of effort was put on making the characters sound good.\n\n[h1]Music:[/h1]\nMost songs follow a pattern of instruments, however it is surprising that every song can be different from each other. You have a handful of genres covered in this game, but it doesn't go too off the pattern.\nThe songs are quite nice, and are fun to play. I wanted to play at least one vocal song, but that didn't happen. Not a big problem, though.\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\nThe backgrounds are simplistic, kinda minimal, but it blends well in the game. They may be simple, but the style is pleasant to look at. The characters look great, and do a great job being different from each other.\n\n\n[h1]Wrapping it up:[/h1]\nMiko Gakkou: Second Year is a game that will please fans of bullet hell and music alike. It will be frustrating at times, but it will be rewarding in the end. The sudden ending leaves a bittersweet taste in the mouth, but the replay value makes up to it.\n\nSadly the game doesn't feature cards and achievements, so if you are interested in this kind of thing, there's no much you can do. In my case, I would gladly buy a background of Alicia in her stage.\n\nFor a title with a price this low, Miko Gakkou: Second Year delivers a good experience, but no more than that. If you are looking for a game with great depth in both story and gameplay, you will be disappointed. For those looking for a good challenge and mindless fun, this game will do the job.\n\n[h1]Scores:[/h1]\n[table]\n [tr]\n     [th]Category[/th]\n     [th]Score[/th]\n [/tr]\n  [tr]\n      [td] Story[/td]\n      [td]5/10[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n      [td]Gameplay[/td]\n      [td]8.5/10[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n      [td]Sound[/td]\n      [td]9/10[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n      [td]Music[/td]\n      [td]8.5/10[/td]\n  [/tr]\n   [tr]\n       [td]Graphics[/td]\n       [td]8/10[/td]\n   [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Overall[/td]\n        [td]7.5/10[/td]\n    [/tr]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1416039124, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432240031, "recommendationid": "12947800", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544316", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1415975120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 90, "steamid": "76561198043960246", "num_games_owned": 618}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Miko Gakkou is a fun, fast-paced action game. \n\nIt has cute characters, fully voiced dialogues (with lovely voice acting) and beautiful music, all of which add to already enjoyable gameplay.

I was in. Got this downloading remotely, and when I got home played through each of the game's six levels.  Each level begins with the main characters getting into fights with random people over odd reasons. Once the fighting starts we are presented with a series of columns which projectiles decend down from our enemy at the top of the screen. You have to weave in and out in order to survive. \n\nEach level gets its own song, which throughout are rather dissapointing. Nothing about these songs stands out as being the least bit unique, and for a game that relies heavily on music is a big negative. The rhythm element of the game is also very spotty. Most of the time I didn't feel like I was moving to the beat of the music, even though I was moving in a way to dodge the bullets. \n\nIn the end I was not happy with my experience with Miko Gakkou: Second Year.
