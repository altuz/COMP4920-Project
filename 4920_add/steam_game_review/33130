I'm certainly Can't recommend it as a single game. Only as a part of Sigma's shooter pack.\nBasically, it feels like an upgraded version of the standard Alien Shooter: more options of tuning your character, upgrading weaponry, strong enemies, fun enough maps for massive massacres. If you just want to fill the floor with the blood of monsters in some generic isometric shooting game which you can beat in one hour with normal difficulty level... Well, maybe it's okay. \n\nBut! I said that it feels like an upgraded version of Alien Shooter, with more more features... and more glitches. And not so fun. Maybe it's the level design, maybe it's the zombie theme, which is so generic and chewed right now... I dunno.\nI like the Alien Shooter, but this one - is not good enough. It's slightly better in survival mode, and it's worse in the campaign, even with the super-duper megaboss in the end.\n\nMy mark is 5.2/10. Buy it only with good discount, in the bundle, and don't expect nothing more than 1-2 hours of the blood-splatting gameplay."}, {"votes_down": 10, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499614511, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473365", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "33407171", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197970615671", "num_reviews": 52, "last_played": 1499614463, "num_games_owned": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 39}, "timestamp_updated": 1499614511, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Could've been good.
