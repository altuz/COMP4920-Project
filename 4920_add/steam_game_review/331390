The UI is very very simple in all aspects (info, sfx, graphics, animation)\n2. It's taking too much time and too much concentration, and if you die you'll have to repeat the whole level (it can take more than 1 hour for hard difficulty in later levels) \nOther than those it's all good, gameplay is quite unique, nice story", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506515263, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506515263, "recommendationid": "35240695", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 55, "total_reviews": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
