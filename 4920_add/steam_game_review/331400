The gameplay is fairly simple, rolling, slashing, and jumping among other actions, fighting against an array of different monsters, collecting items, finding recipe's, crafting things.. It doesn't have a comprehensive list of items to craft the way a survival game would, but it is still fun. The story is interesting and was good enough to keep me playing for over 90 minutes when I planned on only 15 - 30. All in all not a bad game, could use some work here and there, but wouldn't be a complete waste if you were to happen across it. Not sure if I would pay much for it, but if it were in a bundle, I would recommend giving it a try.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432524733, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432524733, "recommendationid": "15993058", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511344", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429057080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561198003387111", "num_games_owned": 541}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It seemed promising when under development and now I've finally gotten around to it I'm left with a bad taste of disappointment in every department.\n\nThe most important flaws are rubbish controls--unresponsive with a non-variable jump height, so you will always be jumping the same height and the physics are terrible for it making it feel like some awful low-gravity moon jump. With the animations seeming to have missing frames and lack of good indicators, you're never sure how well you're doing against an enemy until it dies. Everything is so terrible in this department, it feels so sluggish you'd think the inputs were delayed and lagging.\n\nWhen it comes to sound, the only noticeable thing is the terrible voice acting with dialogue that can't be skipped so you're forced to listen to the stale, emotionless characters that don't even seem to try to get you to care about what's going on. Bad voice acting exists in a lot of things, yes, but when there are no means to skip or speed up the dialogue, it draws extra attention itself and it just seems to get worse each time it happens. \n\nIf the controls weren't so rubbish, I might have given game more time, but the terrible voice-acting that I couldn't skip really put me off. There's quite a bit of dialogue in the beginning which I'd have to repeat each time I died because of not having a clear indication of whether or not the enemy I fought was near death. It's annoying how terrible it is. \n\nDon't even take a chance on this one.
