There was no walkthrough available at the time, but with the help of another person I was able to beat the game. As far as whether or not they can all be solved in the minimum number of moves, I haven't achieved that yet, but I assume they all can. Anyway, it IS a fun game, but quite frustrating at times.

It's a sliding block puzzle game with a lot of extra mechanics, such as puppets that chase you and explode in your face, locked rooms, boarded up rooms, etc. The mechanics are quite clever and the game does a great job of walking you through each new mechanic, though I hated the mirrored rooms with a passion.  Instead of timing you, the game keeps track of moves.  If you go \"over par\" you get fewer puzzle pieces awarded.  In reality, this only hurts if you're achievement hunting, but it still encourages you to find the best way to solve each room.\n\nThe game is set with a fairy tale background - a mysterious tinker who becomes evil and you, the little girl, are fated to be his next victim if you can't figure out the rooms in his house.  Unlike many games, there is a very good reason that the tinker's house is puzzles.  Spoiler - it's not because he gives his victims a sporting chance.\n\nBecause all of the puzzles are sliding rooms, and there are a LOT of rooms, it's best to play this game in chunks over a few weeks so the game doesn't feel repetitious.  In some of the rooms, the girl has an animation of a tired sigh.  That's probably what'll you be doing in real like if you try to do a marathon session of this game.\n\nThe one thing I didn't like was that the mansion is pretty linear.  If you get stuck on a room, you don't have many places to go otherwise.  If you're stuck on room 4, you can't skip to room 5.  You have to get though half of one bulding before you unlock the next one, so you can get get bogged down by a single room.  You can do the basement, but that's significantly more difficult and the same \"no skipping rooms\" rule applies.\n\nSome people have said that the endings are too short (one for completing the main buildings, one for completing the basements), but they do fit the fairy tale motif.  It would have been nice to have longer, more elaborate endings, but they were appropriate  for the game.\n\nThe game isn't for everyone, but for those who enjoy this type of puzzle, it's well worth the price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457824573, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457824573, "recommendationid": "21801586", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503165", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483308958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 854, "steamid": "76561198084282951", "num_games_owned": 404}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Simply put, this game is a must have for every puzzle game enthusiast!!!
