By setting its story of a shamed priest searching for his kidnapped daughter in a beautifully stylized and hand-painted frozen version of hell, [b][i]\"Pinstripe\"[/i][/b] is loaded with visual metaphors as the narrative dips between uplifting, heart-breaking and downright disturbing. By the time it all wraps up you will feeling a range of feels depending on how affecting you find the stories conclusion.

I went through the whole game without an achievement when at least a couple of them should have unlocked, and then randomly 3 of them unlocked at once on my second speedrun when I entered a room. Note that I had re-verified my game files right before this happened as well. I'm not quite sure, but you'll likely have everything unlock in an improper order. Some people even got the achievement for beating the game without damage when they died multiple times, and they didn't get any other achievement.\n\n[i](EDIT: Supposedly the above issue is fixed according to the developer.)[/i]\n\n[u]Review:[/u] The only reason I'm giving this a \"Yes\" is because of the art design.\n\nPinstripe is a simple platforming game, very easy to play. The gameplay is just exploring around, shooting a slingshot at some enemies, and navigating between a handful of areas. But it has some great atmosphere in the graphics and sound, which includes some voice acting that I found to be amazing. If the artistic design was not that good, I would not have played the game, as it is overly simple and much of the short time is spent backtracking to collect repetitive items.\n\nI'd say the game is not worth the $14.99 it is, despite the style. The story has next to nothing to do with you being a minister, other than the fact that the game is in Hell. I guess the developers thought the story would seem more shocking if the character was a minister, but it didn't really change much. Even then, the story is understandable and I like it. I am not sure why some people seem to think the story does not explain things to you.\n\nGive the game a try, but at a discounted price. You'll hopefully like the art style and voice acting, at least.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504576225, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505248220, "recommendationid": "34747770", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499404", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504654576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 19, "steamid": "76561198039508387", "num_games_owned": 249}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I had a short play of this game and whilst visually it is impressive I just felt the game itself was very stale really quickly.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505658301, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505658301, "recommendationid": "35024746", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487330", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 81, "total_reviews": 93, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 12}}
