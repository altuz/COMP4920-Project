I know the solution and how to do it. It didn't work. So I looked online for walkthroughs, videos and tutorials on how to do it. That was what I was trying to do, so I tried it again. And again. And again. I just spent an entire hour clicking sticky chains all over a sign post and no matter what I did, I couldn't make the solution in the videos work for me.\n\nThat seems to be a game breaking issue.\n\nThat pains me to say, because this game is beautiful and it is telling a lovely story without any dialogue. The music is lovely, sound design is great, game mechanics are fun. But if your game is broken, it doesn't matter how well polished it looks.\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499195007, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499195007, "recommendationid": "33243852", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503377", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 28, "total_reviews": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
