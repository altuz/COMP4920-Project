Abstract.\n\nNow, why do I not recommend this game?\nWell, no options menu which is a quite easy thing to implement in your game.\nThe only options you have are 2 graphics options: over-all graphics quality and V-Sync on/off, and these settings are changed via your keyboard.\nIt has no cursor speed slider, volume slider which in my opinion this game desperately needs.\nAlso, if you have sensitive eyes this game just can't be played by you. My eyes started tearing up at how bright the colours were.\nThere's a difference between an explosion of colours, and just making everything extremely bright.\n\nThe game keeps stopping you, pausing you as you play to tell you more stuff about how to the game works.\nAll that stuff, if it's not obvious, should be explained at the start of the game, not periodically throughout the entire game.\n\nYou can't jump which really puzzles me, this is the sort of game where you just involuntarily want to jump as you walk around.\n\nThe story, if you can call it that, is trying way too hard to induce philosophical thoughts, it's way too pretentious.\nThe game is trying a little too hard to take itself seriously.\n\nI enjoy the vast amount of Walking Simulators out there but this one wasn't at all what I expected it to be.\nThe graphics are terrible, yes, there is a difference between artwork and graphics, the story started getting cringeworthy and the game-play is boring.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485731433, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1490787953, "recommendationid": "29575288", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508284", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482272162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 57, "steamid": "76561197972072638", "num_games_owned": 294}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Reminds me a lot of Connor Sherlock\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1482272233, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1482272233, "recommendationid": "28494994", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462892892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 86, "steamid": "76561197974487036", "num_games_owned": 647}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I enjoy this game.

Done quite poorly.\n\nZero gameplay whatsoever.\nGo from point A to point B, listen to a boring siloloquy which is supposed to stir some sort of questions in the mind of the player, proceed onwards. \nThe problem is - for people who have no interest in this kind of things, the game will seem boring due to lack of interactivity. For people who know even a tiniest bit about AIs from mass media the game will seem boring, since it's exploiting the same tropes that premate all the blockbusters about robots these days.
