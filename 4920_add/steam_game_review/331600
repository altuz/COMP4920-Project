I've never watched the anime, but this game leaves a nice impression on One Piece's style and charm while being an exceptional musou-style game!\n\nI'll say right off the bat, if you're not into the musou genre, like Dynasty Warriors games, then this won't change your mind. But for those who do enjoy it, there's plenty to sink your teeth into here!\nThe story mode, or Legend Log as it's called in the game, took me about 20 hours to complete - give-or-take some time, I generally get distracted and leave my games on while doing other things - and it follows the tale of Luffy and the Straw Hat crew from humble beginnings all the way up through the Dressrosa arc. The storytelling isn't as spectacular as, say the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, but it's understandable given the genre of the game.\n\nEach mission - of which there are 21, four in each chapter plus a prologue - will give you a text-based recap of events leading up to the stage, and then both comic-book-styled and fully animated cutscenes will play during the actual adventure. It misses its beats, and not every character is as fleshed out as they are in the anime, but I suppose it's to be expected, as the game does want to hurry the player along into the next mission.\n\nOnce the fighting begins, you'll find the familiar territory-taking, mook-mashing, boss-bashing gameplay to be pretty easy to pick up. I would totally recommend playing on Hard difficulty, since the game is already very easy, and I lost only once on the final stage; you're rewarded consistently for playing on Hard mode, and it gives the game a little more challenge as well. What sets Pirate Warriors 3's gameplay apart is its Kizuna bar. Your teammates will hop in-and-out of each mission, and you can select which support teammate you want to help you, and as you defeat lots of enemies, this guage will fill. Once it's full, you can activate Kizuna to do even more damage, amplify your abilities, and even have multiple support characters assist you in battle at once by filling multiple Kizuna bars and using special team-up attacks before its use-timer runs out.\n\nOutside of the Legend Log is the Free Log, which lets you replay any stage you want with any of the characters you've unlocked. However, going through the story mode alone isn't enough to unlock all of the characters; to get many of the remaining locked characters, you're going to have to play through the Dream Log mode, which sets you on a sort of board-game where you pick your character of choice and travel from piece-to-piece fighting other characters and playing randomized stages. Once you hit the final board piece of the Dream Log, however, is where the game's real endgame begins, as you'll unlock the Nightmare Log afterwards. By this point, you'll have unlocked each character, so pick your favorites and have at it!\n\nAs far as multiplayer goes, sadly, the PC version only has local cooperative play, unlike the console counterpart which offers fully online multiplayer. If you have a friend or family member that's willing to play, split-screen is always a viable option, however.\n\nI would wholly recommend this game to both musou enthusiasts and One Piece fans alike! I fit into the former category, and enjoy these kinds of games, though I'm not too big into watching anime, and I still found a very charming, fun experience in my time with PW3!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506551082, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506551082, "recommendationid": "35250464", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507067732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2592, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5266, "steamid": "76561198074367216", "num_games_owned": 134}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Would completly recommend this game but keep in mind that this game does not support the steam cloud!!!\nOnce this game is deleted or even launched from another Computer you have to start all over!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506951336, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506975203, "recommendationid": "35415411", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507118539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3333, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4666, "steamid": "76561198289839739", "num_games_owned": 50}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's fun to play.
