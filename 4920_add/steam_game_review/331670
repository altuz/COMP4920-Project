If I had a nickel for every time I've packed my laptop to a house party JUST FOR THIS GAME, I'd have enough money to buy the trilogy. You just need your laptop and an internet connection to start it up. Listen, the game uses your phone as the controller, which means literally every single person you ask to play with you immediately have a frame of reference for how it works. That's priceless. No teaching controls, no explaining mechanics, just \"look at the TV, go to that site, enter the code.\" I don't care if you have an Android, iPhone, or cheap knockoff iPad; if you have an internet browser, you can play this game. The games offer the prompt, then your phone's browser lets you submit your response. Super easy. I've seen socially reserved people suddenly become the funniest f***er at the party, not because they're social butterflies, but because they were witty with their lies on Fibbage. \n\nPLUS, the games are presented in such a way that it can behave like either Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. It's good to play with kids, college students, or adults and still have a good time. The prompts are never inappropriate, but you're responses can definitely be. Players can adapt the game to suit your own friend bubble's sense of humor and it's brilliantly handled. There's also a secondary prize in most games (the best ones at least) based on who had the most liked responses, which people can pick after the answer has been revealed.\n\nThis one comes with 5 games and all of the best ones have an 8 player cap. Each game takes about 10-15 minutes to play, but they have TONS of questions and prompts, so you'll almost never hit one you've seen before and it's pretty easy to corral people to try it out because of the play time. Each game has an announcer that briefly explains the game and the rules, while also presenting the prompts. They're sorta funny; they get some laughs for being super cheesy. You won't want to turn it off for being annoying, at least. They're a little self aware, honestly. Fibbage XL and Drawful are THE games you need, though. \n\nYOU DON'T KNOW JACK 2015 is basically a trivia game with some quirks. Not much to say about it, but I'm not crazy into trivia games. The series has been around since (at least) the original Xbox, so they know what they're doing with the whole \"digital trivia\" thing. If you like trivia, you'll probably like this. \n\nFibbage XL is one of the games you're buying this for. It's a trivia game at it's heart, but the questions are less \"fact heavy\" and much more obscure/funny. Sometimes someone will know the answer, but most of the time you're guessing. After everyone has sent in a guess (or the time limit goes off), the game presents a list of options to pick from, which are composed of everyone's responses mixed in with the answer. If someone pick your guess, you get points. If you pick the right answer, you get a lot of points. That means you can win for being convincing with your answer, rather than actually knowing it. Really, really fun game.\n\nDrawful is the second game you're buying this for. It's Pictionary, except everyone draws at the same time and you're drawing on a phone so it's really not going to be a masterpiece anyway. Basically, the Drawful announcer tells everyone to start drawing, then everyone gets a unique prompt on their phone to make a little sketch for. Then, the drawings come up one after another on the TV. Like Fibbage, everyone says what they THINK the answer is and everyone picks from a combined list. If it's you're prompt, you get points for every person who picks the correct answer. If not, you get points for picking the correct answer and some points if someone picks your guess. Very fun, probably the best game here, IMO. They even made a standalone sequel and it's also great.\n\nWord Spud is essentially a fill-in-the-blank game. Much more abstract and toned down than the other games. This one is about just hanging around and chilling. Not a huge fan.\n\nLie Swatter is better than Word Spud, but is really just a spin on how trivia games work. Up to 100 players can play this game, which is really it's main draw. You're basically given a succession of prompts and have to tell whether it's a lie or not. You get points for picking out the lies and more points for being the first to respond. \n\nSeriously, though. Get this. It's a great game to break out at a party or just with a small group of friends. I wish I had this when I was studying abroad and staying in hostels.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506052818, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506052818, "recommendationid": "35119688", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501868", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 516, "total_reviews": 561, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 45}}
