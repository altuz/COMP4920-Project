I enjoyed the Alien Shooter games and so when I saw this expected them to improve this style of game. But they white washed the entire game removing almost all color which made the Alien Shooter games fun to look at. There was many typos. The accents were really inconsistent, and an insult to Americans. The commanders of armies were terrible southern accents but the soilders were all european accents. They re-used as many models from Alien shooter games that they could and almost exactly the same enemy types with a different model that felt stolen out of Dead Frontier (at least that game is actually free and has many people playing it). The secrets were just boxes hidden in corners of the map or behind window panes, not really rewarding to find. Two hours played and I'm requesting a refund."}]}
