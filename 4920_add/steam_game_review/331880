It all went downhill from there. Many of the jobs had tons of bugs and glitches. I often had to do research in the commmunity to be able to pass a level, because a random part, not damaged, and not on the repair order, would have to be replaced for the mission to be finished. And theses problems really only start after 3 or so hours, so if you dont listen to the reviews, you run into major problems only after you have passed the returns limit. English translation are also flawed in some major ways, and the game is an obvious convert of Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, as in the Test Path, the overhead icon showing the tires being tested shows a car. The game is not worth it, even the 2.49 I paid for it. There is more, but I dont want to write to much. Just dont get the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500156418, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500156418, "recommendationid": "33570611", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507316", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 17}}
