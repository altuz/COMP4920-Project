The artstyle is interesting, and the outlines of the story made me intrigued when I first bought it. The story began in a very sudden manor and the controls felt a bit wonky from the start, but it's a short game, so why not play through it once? That was my thought as I played this game and it was fine for what is was, although disappointing in terms of story and gameplay.\n\nThen I reached the first part where you get the power to fly around with the son. That is where the game turns from adequate to outright stupid. The first problem is the controls. The level is designed for precise flying and the controls for the game is somewhat floaty, which makes flying through somewhat tight corridors filled with spikes challenging in all the wrong ways. \n\nThe second problem is the the lighting. Throughout the flying level, where you try to control the son to the best of your ability, the game has sudden lightning flashes in the middle of a corridor of spikes. Not terribly startling, mind you, but distracting to the degree of me losing my concentration, making the flying all the more annoying.\n\nBut the third and biggest problem with the first flying level is the fact that there's sudden \"surges\" (wind?) that work against you, making you fly into walls and spikes alike. These come at the most awkward of times, which would not be as bad if you could actually compensate for them. You can't. Once I took a lot of momentum forward just to try and compensate, and the game just turned me on a dime and slammed me into a wall of spikes. Instead positioning is very important, and with the floaty controls... you get the issue.\n\nAll of these problems, together with the fact that it doesn't checkpoint you, made me quit this game after barely an hour of gameplay. Having such a level is gamebraking and stupid, and even if the story had been better and more well-paced, I doubt I would have continued to play this game.

You're met with a number of obsticles, challenges and enemies along the way which you have to over come, either individually or as a team. I'll admit a few of these challenges are incredibly frustrating (at least they were for me) but entirely compelling, and make you want to try harder to beat them instead of just giving up. \n\nThe story, while fully understandable, is not very developed (you are kind of just thrown into it) but with the guidance of what I can only descrive as the centre of a magic 8-ball communicating via what Im sure is Anime-Ace script, its not at all hard to keep up with what is happening at each stage of the game. \n\nThe animation is simple, and quite honestly adorable, and very well done for such a simple side scroller, and allows for easy character control. For the last half of this game I didnt even have to connect my mouse, which was fantastic as it was 3am and I was in bed. \n\nWhat really gets me about this game though, is the art. The art is outstanding. Beautiful, simple, magical. Art can make or break a game, I believe, and this games scenery, cut scenes and stills compliment the story, the characters and the game play perfectly. It brings and entirely new depth and delicacy to the game.\n\nMy only complaint is that I wish it were longer. I completed the game is just over two hours (which I will have to try and beat to unlock one of the 17 achievments.)

You just jumped from a ledge and landed with a roll? Too bad, you can't skip the roll and now you roll off the cliff, now you have to restart the puzzle from an un-notified autosave that is close to the start of the level. You also have the father's inconsistant movements, turning speed, roll and jump that breaks storytelling and platforming momentum. When you're climbing an ice-wall with icepicks vertically upwards as well as hanging on a cliff you won't be able to press down (add in a timed puzzles with yeti waiting on top). As basic platformer logic goes, this was executed very poorly.\n\nThe first part all boss level has over-excessive flashes across the screen that causes more grief than artistic beauty (Did I mention there's also wind mechanic that affects movement as well as intense flashing?) The crow flying level's wind mechanic is different from regular level wind mechanic, as one affects your movement and can cause you death but the latter doesn't, this causes confusion to general gameplay and is poorly thought-out. \n\nNo indication at any point the game auto saves doesn't help either, when you're trying to collect the blue glowing runestones to complete achievements. \n\nNo in-game settings for background, voice or music sound. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this, almost all the time, you will worry about wether you will make the jump or not more than the story itself.
