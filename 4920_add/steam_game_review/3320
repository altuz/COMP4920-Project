You also get to raise carnivor fish who feed on other smaller fish and aside from that you can have a permanent aquarium which you can raise fish that can never die unless you free them.

Deluxe is a game I have played in my childhood- as many other reviewers here have. However, even if you are older than 6, I think you may still like this game, I'll explain.\nInsaniquarium is an old game, there are 2 things you are required to do: You are tasked with simply buying/feeding fish, occasionally doing certain things to keep bigger or different fish alive (like feeding a bigger fish normal fish, or feeding even bigger fish the already mentioned big fish that feeds on your normal fish, or feeding a certain creature beetles).\nThe other thing you must do is defend your fish from aliens by shooting them with your laser gun. \nYou can save up money to bye temporary upgrades that can make your job easier, such as getting the ability to give the fish more than 1 thing of food at a time, getting better food, or getting a better gun (the final upgrade turns your gun into an automatic weapon, making tougher levels super easy). \nThe main goal of Insaniquarium is to save up enough money to bye all 3 peices of an egg, once this is done, you unlock a companion fish that can help you out in your playthrough. You also move on to the next stage- there are 4 stages and you after you get the last egg, you move on to the fifth and final stage (which is only 1 level).\n\nThere are a few modes besides the main story, such as a time trail mode, a normal fish tank mode where you buy and take care of fish without the danger of aliens, and a mode after the main story that allows you to reply the game with all of your companions (and you even get a story of the companions after each level).\n\nNow as to why I recommend this game... it is a fun little game that will keep you occupied if you don't have much money, or you are just looking for something small to play. \nPerhaps you are a parent and you're trying to buy a game for your kid- in that case then get this game for them! Trust me, this will be something they cheris throughout their livesand if you get involved and play the game with them, it will be a memorable expirience.\n\nMy score for the game is a 6/10 as a normal game, and an 8/10 for nostalgia value."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505811531, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35060668", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198259454890", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506484321, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_forever": 176}, "timestamp_updated": 1505811531, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game as long with my fellow friends had an amazing childhood because this game, i use to play it with my dad.

Every time I try to open the game now, my screen goes off and gives the 'Monitor going to sleep message'. I can get it back on pressing the Windows key, but I can't open the game (which is still running and playing a once heartwarming track that I've now began to resent) without the cycle continuing. This has been going on for a couple days and I cannot get a refund for the game, since I have passed the 2 hour maximum. This game is actually fun and a worthwhile spend if it works, but it did not work at all for me after just a day of playing. I can't reccomend buying it."}]}
