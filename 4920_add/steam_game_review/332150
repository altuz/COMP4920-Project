Apparently, I have to agree with Mattchu, it REALLY needs a lot of improvements, like a pause screen, make a strict limit of lives you can carry (as I have collected so many I saw half a heart! xD), music sometimes change its volume, needs more options on the main menu, and a whole lot more bits and pieces to find that needs fixing if you guys or I can discover them for ourselves. This game was quite fun, but unfortunately I have to not recommend this game until there is further notice of updates of the game itself.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417169838, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1417169838, "recommendationid": "13119328", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526320", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
