[i]Axiom Verge[/i] has a killer soundtrack, unique biomes and enemies, secrets galore, a plethora of upgrades and weapons, and boss fights that will test your reflexes and skill. \n\nPlay as Trace, a scientist who wakes up in the strange land of Sudra after an explosion in the lab knocks him unconscious. Help the Rusalki (Sudran war machines) recover their strength after being critically wounded by Athetos and his biological weapons. But who is really friend and who is foe? Or perhaps an even better question is, what is real and what is not? These are the types of questions you will be constantly asking yourself during and after your playthrough of [i]Axiom Verge[/i]. The game\u2019s ending is fantastic and leaves plenty of room for theorizing and forming your own opinion. That being said, the entire experience will take you between ten and fifteen hours. Here\u2019s to hoping this isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ll see of Trace!\n\nFor the hardcore, [i]Axiom Verge[/i] can be played in hard mode, speedrun mode, or both. \n\n[h1]Summary and Target Price Point[/h1]\n\n[i]Axiom Verge[/i] is a solid [b]8.0 out of 10 with the biggest complaint being its brevity[/b]. Normally priced at $19.99, [b]you can grab [i]Axiom Verge[/i] for $9.99 with some patience.[/b]\n\nCheck out[url=https://isthereanydeal.com/search/?q=Axiom+Verge#/page:game/info?plain=axiomverge] this link[/url] to compare price and price history of [i]Axiom Verge[/i] from your favorite retailers.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506113569, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506113585, "recommendationid": "35137446", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504860745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 376, "steamid": "76561197989077202", "num_games_owned": 119}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Amazing, if you like 2d metroid you should 100% buy this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504746407, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504746407, "recommendationid": "34785980", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505698", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506627790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 947, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 962, "steamid": "76561198022041128", "num_games_owned": 331}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is an awesome metroidvania game done very well.
