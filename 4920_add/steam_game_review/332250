I really hope they create a sequel or add more content!\n\ntl;dr:\n+ Gameplay is fun!!\n+ throws constantly new situations, playstyles and conditions in, never gets monotonous\n+ good presentation: cool graphical style, fitting music\n+ feels a bit like a mix of F-Zero and R.C. Pro Am\n+ good difficulty: starts easy, ends with lots of challenges\no if you expect racing, this may not be for you\n- controls need some time to get used to\n- the camera is way too close! It's really hard to see anything, this makes the game more about memorizing than racing\n- unlocking bonus missions is wrongly explained in the game\n- short, took me 2.6h to beat the singleplayer\n\n\nLong version:\nI love games like F-Zero, but there hasn't been a sequel since a long time. I played some topdown-racing games in the past, so I knew they were fun, too. Anyways, after watching the trailers, I was convinced this game should be fun to me. The camera looked really close, but since a screenshot showed the possibility to zoom further out, I bought the game anyways.\n\nFirst of all: this is not a racing game.\nIt contains several levels where you have to be faster than others, but it feels more like a fast Arcade-Puzzle game. You cannot accelerate or brake, instead the focus is more on figuring out where to use which weapon.\nEvery world in this game has 3 levels, of which 1 is a racing level. If I remember correctly, there were 5 worlds with a Racing-Level.\nThe other levels are obstacle courses where you have to make use of your weapons, time trials or bossfights. \nWhile the bossfights look really good and are well designed, for me it was always about figuring out how to recharge your energy so you have enough power to beat the boss. Once you know the pattern and how to get energy, the bosses are not a big problem.\n\nThe leveldesigns felt very intelligent and the overall experience was quite enjoyable, but it was really short and it took a while to get used to the controls. And the camera... the camera is REALLY weird in this game. Even if there are 3D-Elements, the camera makes everything look flat and 2D. It makes it even harder to control the machine without being able to slow down...\nNot to mention that the camera is still really, really close on the track - even with the 10%-upgrade. You hardly notice it at all.\n\nAbout the worlds and levels:\nYou can choose which world to play in any order you like. Additionally to that, there are several locked bonus missions, that tell you to get all the weapons first. This is wrong: you have to beat all the worlds in order to unlock the bonus missions.\nI wanted to do the bonus missions before starting the last levels, but I couldn't find a way to unlock them. I wanted to grind XP to make the last levels easier, but without the bonus missions, it felt stupid to redo the previous levels again.\n\nOverall, I liked this game a lot, but I would've liked it more, if the focus would be more on the racing-part. I really miss some kind of Grand Prix-Mode, like in Mario Kart or F-Zero. Stil, it was fun and enjoyable to me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448795463, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448795463, "recommendationid": "19360088", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522598", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459708527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 225, "steamid": "76561197997527737", "num_games_owned": 266}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Future racers, if you have played Wipeout, F-Zero, etc. You will all love this!

I feel the perspective difference (top down) alone is enough to not, but there are clearly F-Zero influences in The Next Penelope. While many of them are obvious in game-mechanic behavior (energy charging strips and boosting), there is also new abilities introduced, with the most notable and fun, weapons. While the game-play isn't too original, this game implements them spot on for a very fluid and enjoyable experience.\n\nWhile I can't say it's a F-Zero successor (again, due to perspective differences), it most certainly seems to be for Micro Machines. Micro Machines was a great classic game from the NES I never really got into too much. However, The Next Penelope grasps my attention for a racing game immediately.

It has racing elements, most levels are on tracks, and some are actual races against NPC opponents, but most levels are about combat or survival focused. I personally wouldn't mind this dynamic if the combat wasn't so deeply flawed.\n\nThe health mechanic in this game is one of the worst health implementations I've seen. Energy (their term for health) is used up whenever you take damage or whenever you use a weapon; this could provide an interesting balance of risk/reward, but health is doled out so rarely that you are constantly budgetting your weapon use. One small slip up in a match will leave you in a situation where you still have half of your health, but are forced to quit because it takes at least 2/3 of your health used as weapon energy to kill the boss you are fighting. \n\nAbout 1/3 of my playtime was retrying because I didn't have enough energy to beat a challenge/kill a boss, about another 1/3 of my playtime was just crashing into walls because the screen is so zoomed in that you can't see far enough in front of you to avoid damage.
