The creators of the first Cars game went and made another one with more awesome! I love this game as much as I do the other, and for one main reason: the devs knew what worked, and improved on it! This is very apparent in the fact that this game reuses a lot of assets from the original ala Majora's Mask. This includes gameplay, sounds, graphics, etc. However, there is still a bunch of stuff you should consider, mainly, the differences.\nNow the first difference is the plot, as here, the plot is that due to the success Radiator Springs got after Lightning McQueen won, Mater opened up a worldwide race called, \"Mater-National.\" Yeah, I know. Clever. As it's worldwide, you will race against cars from the world. If this sounds familiar, is it because Disney reused this idea for Cars 2. In fact, this feels like the devs version of a Cars sequel because there is a test graphic in the files that calls this, \"Cars 2.\" Now, this could just be for videogames, but since Disney also used a joke from here, I wouldn't doubt it.\nGraphics time: the graphics are all based on the original game, but now, they look really great! Now with new technology and the fact that they upgraded the engine, the completely upgraded to 1080p in 60FPS. Now, if you care about that is totally up to you, but I think it looks nice.\nMOOSIC!!!! It's great! It shares a soundtrack from the original game, which I like, with some new songs, and even some songs from the original Cars movie, which I wonder why the original Cars game didn't include. I love it so much, that I even found myself listening to an unused remix that you can find online.\nSince every game has this, flaws! This game can sometimes be TOO similar to the original game, and if you played the original, you will 100% know what to expect here. Now, there are new minigames and race types, even including Mike and Sully as guest characters based on their appearance in, \"Monster Trucks Inc.\" A parody in Cars' credits. However, it may not be enough for everyone to pay 20 bucks for. Also, and more importantly, the game is SO short! Now, I didn't 100% this or the original, but it took me 5 hours to beat the original, and 3.3 hours to beat this. Any Cars experts can beat this game crazy fast. Some people might get turned by this.\nVerdict is that despite the flaws, the gameplay was just too fun to get angry about. If you have friends, or liked the original, then buy it! However, if you didn't like the original that much, then you shouldn't really bother with this one with all the similarities. So in the end, if you like Cars, buy it. If not, then don't, but I still recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500420683, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500420683, "recommendationid": "33640298", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
