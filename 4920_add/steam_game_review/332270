Kyle Pittman's games with Minor Key Games are hyper-polished platformers, comparable in every way to the best and brightest bits of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. The world of Gunmetal Arcadia (and its hand-crafted prequel, Gunmetal Arcadia Zero) follow on the heels of Super Win the Game, using the classic platforming mechanics and CRT emulation for a roguelike tale of elven factions at war, hives of evil critters, and a monstrous queen spreading its evil with the Seed of Unmaking.\n\nAs with other roguelikes, levels are randomly generated while following predictable patterns. There are only four chapters and four endings with all but the final boss pulled randomly. A single successful playthrough should take around 40 minutes. It'll take a while, however, to get to that first successful run, with my first taking 13 attempts over 3.75 hours. There are legacy aspects -- bonuses to make your run easier -- that hold over from one playthrough to the next, but only the next. (This means, a single failed run could set you back pretty far if you rely on those stacked bonuses.)\n\nOver the course of the dungeons, you'll run into many genre staples, including shops and inns, faction outposts and monster traps. Factions offer another welcome layer of complexity, however small: By joining either the warriors or the academics, you gain access to exclusive items and massive discounts when you come across their outposts. You'll be forced to ignore the opposing faction's offerings if you join one, as they loathe one another and will force impossible price hikes to opposing members.\n\nThe randomly-generated levels don't hold up quite as well as the hand-crafted ones in the bite-sized prequel, but the game as a whole offers more content, and the legacy aspects and random surprises in each playthrough make this an improvement over Zero. It's also not terribly difficult, but Gunmetal Arcadia emulates the absolute best of the NES: There's a strong sense of nostalgia to playing Gunmetal Arcadia, even though it's its own original property. It just feels fantastic to play, and has become a go-to when I'm in the mood to cozy up and play vegetable.\n\nI love both sides of Minor Key Games. J. Kyle and David Pittman both create their own unique, fantastic games, and Gunmetal Arcadia fits right alongside the best of the indie gaming scene.

While these features are executed well, I found the gameplay to be severely lacking, esp. if you compare it to the NES titles it's drawing from.\n\nTo put it succintly: the combat is just not fun. A good deal of enemies simply walk at you, but because of how quickly you can swing your default sword you're in no real danger of them ever hitting you. Most fights boil down to an enemy trying to walk into you while you mindlessly mash attack until they die. The only enemies who pose any threat to you are the tiny ones who either dash at you or shoot at you, often at the border of the camera before you can see them. While this is accurate to how a lot of old titles played, I don't think it's very good game design. The bosses seemed a bit better, I'll admit, but there's just so much tedium in between them.\n\nThen there are more minor quibbles: chests that spawn in when you clear a room can damage you for some reason, and there is no indication of where they're going to spawn from. Who thought this was a good idea? It's like a kick in the shins for doing the challenge they set out for you. The upgrades didn't seem all that necessary given how easy the game was; I'm sure they become more relevant in subsequent runs but again, you need to draw the player in enough for them to want to actually do that. While random level generation is a fun idea, I think it's a big reason this game feels so dull to me; more deliberate enemy placement would feel more interesting, but because you can't replicate a level designer's intelligence that easily the game has to make up for it by adding artificial difficulty with the aforementioned tiny enemies.\n\nTo put it succintly, this game absolutely feels like something that would've come out on the NES; unfortunately this extends to the limited gameplay and artificial difficulty. Castlevania, a game this clearly had some inspiration from, still holds up today because of the depth in fighting (you can't just spam attacks and expect good results, you actually have to time it out) and fiendish yet fair level designs. If you're really patient then you may be able to get something out of this, but personally I can't recommend it: for those of us with limited free time, the \"it gets better X hours in\" argument is not going to cut it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500257109, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500257109, "recommendationid": "33598609", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503704", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501577736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 508, "steamid": "76561197997363400", "num_games_owned": 188}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Silly hard, sometimes unfair.
