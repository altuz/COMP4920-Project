I'm not sure how many times i've finished this game. Since back then steam was not as popular (at least where i live) we couldn't get games all the time. And no one would use internet around us. Only where it was needed. So i've played this game again and again and i can say i will be able to play it as long as i want even today. Now i'm gunna stop with my stupid story and talk about AC2. I'm gunna start off by saying\n\n[h1] [b] Assassin's Creed II is art and a masterpiece [/b] [/h1]\n\n[h1] [b] Story [/b] [/h1] The best part about this game. The game starts with Desmond where you last left AC1. You get everything ready and hop in to the animus. The first thing you will see is the birth of [b] [u] Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. [/u] [/b] You get to experience Ezio's life from his birth. After that you play as he acts like how a teenager would. Free, in love and nothing to worry about. You get a basic introduction of every main characters before \"everything\" happens. As Ezio gets familier with Assassin's, his only perpose was revenge. We get to experience years of Ezios life as he develops as a character and the people around him. The rich story of AC2 will only make it better as Ezio grows up. You will see and feel the world around you changing physically and in story. As Ezio goes forward uncovering the Templar order to destroy it. I can't actually say many things about the story since saying one thing will just spoil you alot of the game. I know i did not explain anything but i can assure you that you will love the story.\n\n[h1] [b] Characters [/b] [/h1] Since this game follows the main protagonist and the people around him very closely i thought it's better to talk about the characters first. Every character that's associated with the story has their own story. From the Auditore family to the people around Ezio, everyone has rich lore. You will also meet and be with lot of people from the history of real life. But i want to talk about our protagonist here. [b] Ezio Auditore Da Firenze [/b] is the best character i've seen. We play him from his birth as you start moving your hands and head. From that we see young cheerfull Ezio grow up. At first he's young and reckless but slowly you see him become an experienced Assassin and a wise man. But while all of this happens Ezio never loses his charm. There's nothing in his life that you will not know. You will be emotionally attached with him. I can never explain what Ezio is in words. He is beyond that. I haven't seen another character as much interesting and amazing as Ezio. \n\n[h1] [b] Gameplay [/b] [/h1] It's the better version of AC1. The sword fighting is much more fluid and there's different options. It's much more fancy as well. There's also much more parkour options. The hidden blade is way better as well as the assassinations. There's more weapons for better gameplay. But i'm pretty sure you will just be jumping over the rooftops of Florence, Venice, Tuscany and few more other places. Hunting templars in these beautiful places just made the game so good back then and i still enjoy it lot more than most other games.\n\n[h1] [b] World Design [/b] [/h1] They made the cities look almost same as the real world while making it accessible for the gameplay of AC. Running over rooftops, assassinating templars, jumping on groups of enemies or escape with the beautiful parkour. Everything is just perfect. The best part is if you've been to the places IRL then you will recognize every important parts of the cities from the game. The open world was HUGE as well. It was genius TBH. Not just one map like ACB or most other AC games. So many things makes the world of AC2 so good that i can't explain it fully.\n\n[h1] [b] Soundtracks/OST [/b] [/h1] A huge part of AC universe you can say. And Jesper Kyd did a fine job with the saoundtracks. You could listen to them all day. Running over venice rooftops and the \"Venice Rooftops\" OST starts, You just feel it all the way. And when you finish the game you will probably cry listenning to \"Ezio's Family\" OST.\n\n[h1] [b] Graphics [/b] [/h1] It's really good considering it's a game from 2009. If you play it today you will be amazed by how good the game looks. How well it shows us the beauty of these beautiful cities of Italy. I would love a remaster of the game but it's not necessary cuz the game looks fantastic even today. \n\n[h1] [b] Optimization [/b] [/h1] It was really demanding back then. But now a days talking about it is hard. Any PC should be able to handle it without any problem. And there's no FPS drop or anything. There are few funny glitches but that's all.\n\n[h1] [b] Controls [/b] [/h1] It's REALLY easy to get used to. It handles perfectly as well. There's no comment about the controls. \n\n[h1] [b] Overall - 10 [/b] [/h1]\n\n[h1] Assassin's Creed II is my most favorite game of all time. The story just blows me away even tho i've easily finished it over 20 times at least. The gameplay never gets boring just like the story. I would say the entire Ezio trilogy is what masterpiece looks like. It's like a movie. I can't recommend this game enough. You can call me a fanboy but this game is a  [b] MUST PLAY. [/b]\n\n[h1] [b] You must play Assassin's Creed II at least once in your life. It's one of those games you can't just miss.

It's my favorite of the series so far (I've played through the Ezio storyline and most of AC III at this point), and it still makes me want to go back and play it again.\n\nBasic info on equipment: HP Pavilion dv6-6123cl entertainment notebook. Processor AMD A6-3400M APU w/Radeon HD Graphics 1.40 GHz. Installed RAM of 6 GB. 64-Bit Windows 10 OS. Wired external mouse and keyboard. No additional equipment used or upgrades made to computer.\n\nGameplay and Controls 6/10:  Still one of the most challenging aspects of the game, especially for mouse/keyboard users, but as I was more used to the controls, having played the first game, it was not quite as difficult. The only things that took some getting used to were the combat system and the new blending system. Kill streaks were almost impossible for me to get at first because I just couldn't get the timing down. I think I only started to finally get them towards the end of the game when I had enough practice that I could set them up effectively. So, are the controls still challenging? Yes, but at least if you've played through the first AC, you should be familiar enough with them that only minor to moderate adjustments should be necessary. The controls for other forms of combat (ranged, for instance) are actually rather easy to get the hang of.\n\nGraphics 10/10:  As with the last game, the graphics are truly impressive. Not only are the cities and countryside that you move through absolutely gorgeous (like seriously, I want to go back in time and move to Italy now), but everything from the movement of the characters within the game to the movement of extraneous things like horses and carriages is tremendously realistic. Maybe not Halo level of realism, but frankly, I'm not looking for that in a game like this, so what they do have is amazing. It made the immersion in the world so much better than most other games that I've seen or played.\n\nStoryline 8/10:  I enjoyed the storyline of this particular game very much, even with the inaccuracies presented about the Templars. The history of the time period that it represents was otherwise rather accurate, and that made the game hugely enjoyable for me. Talk about history coming to life! The only part that I had any real trouble with was keeping up with how many years were going by in-game, especially since the characters were not made to look any older throughout. It actually came as a bit of a shock to me to realize at the end just how many years were contained within the story, even though I would see the new date flash by at the beginning of each new memory sequence. In addition to the great history aspect of the game, I found the fictional story within it compelling and complex enough that I did not lose interest for almost the entire game. (Towards the very very end when I was playing through the Bonfire of the Vanities quests, I started to get bored because that was not really  part of the main storyline, and it became tedious; but otherwise, the rest of the game was quite good.) I think, again, that the story within this game is the most enjoyable so far out of the installments that I've played. The only two parts that I didn't enjoy as much, were the two DLCs at the end of the game that come with the deluxe edition (the Battle of Forli, which was okay, but not great; and The Bonfire of the Vanities, which as I mentioned previously, became tedious rather quickly).\n\nCharacters 9/10:  Oh my word, the characters in this game are great! I didn't add a review of characters for the first AC because we really only dealt with Altair for the most part, and he was just okay. Ezio was actually personable and such a fun and likeable character that I truly loved playing as him. Not only that, but the other people (historical and fictional) around him in the game were so well done, that I wanted to interact with them even more. Leonardo Da Vinci is the best!\n\nOverall Rating 9/10:  As I said, this game is my favorite so far out of the AC games that I've played. The storyline was detailed, graphics were superb, characters felt more like my friends than just graphics on a screen, and I truly enjoyed becoming immersed in the rich historical world of Renaissance Italy and exploring it through the adventures of the vibrant character of Ezio Auditore da Firenze.
