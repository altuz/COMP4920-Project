There are a large number of characters and vehicles to choose from. \n\nHowever it is missing something. It is missing a narrative. The basis of the game, is landing on a lego islands and exploring it. That's it. \n\nIt needs more in order to make it the LEGO Worlds that they want consumers to view it as. \n1. Add a 'story' (maybe similar to the style in older LEGO games to capture nostalgic gamers). \n2.

Only things you can't create, are vehicles that are buoyant, vehicles that have wheels and air/space crafts (that actually work) (You can only make models without the wheels). Alternatively, you can find working vehicles, but you can't build them.
