Miko Gakkou Monogatari is nothing but several girls that look cute and talk, that is it. No comedy, no adventure, just...boring dialogue. I could have more fun watching paint dry. Controls are clunky, the camera angles are terrible, poor user interface, and there's no fun or challenge playing it. If you are looking for a cute anime game to engage with, look somewhere else.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494710744, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494710744, "recommendationid": "31733793", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502025", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
