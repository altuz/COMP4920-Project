Beyond some initial stat-boosting skills, you're basically stuck with basic skills unless you want to run out of mana - and don't even think about using real skills against anything other than bosses, or you'll barely get a room into the dungeon before you're out of mana. Combat in general is not a great experience.\n\nIt has a reasonable amount of dialogue, which you'll likely want to avoid reading as much as possible. It's pretty rough.\n\nIt contains about four different art styles, interspersed randomly - enemy art in particular often seems to come entirely out of left field.\n\nI'll give it the benefit of the doubt and assume it does indeed have an 'amazing fantasy soundtrack', but regardless, I can't recommend this - certainly not at this price point.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501735147, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501735147, "recommendationid": "33985181", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512531", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503173388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 362, "playtime_forever": 97, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 445}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Aldorlea puts a lot of heart and thought into their games. Asguaard shows this... even if the results aren't completely up to par. See, the game has a lot of hidden locations and rooms, and without the guide, those might be a bit difficult to find. You are a teenager (name thyself), who has been summoned to this world by a group of dwarves to try and save their world from the plagues released from Pandora (or Pandora's) Box. As such, you are a whiny 15-year-old who isn't so happy about the situation. And by whiny, I mean Anakin/Luke bad.\n\nThat said, it is still an amusing game, and could be worth your time.
