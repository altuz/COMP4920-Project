The story never really took off for me and before I knew it, it was over before I ever really felt like it got out of what would be \"Chapter 1\" in a novel.  However, other parts of the game where enough to push my verdict to \"Recomended\" in light of it all and I hope the developers can look on this with a bit of advice for suture titles.\n\n[h1]The Story[/h1]\nThis was one of the larger areas of dissapointment for me.  It started off very unique and well.  The music in the barracks and intro scenes fit the mood very well and the way the proffessional soldiers talked to you as a cadet was good.  It really set the tone of life in the military as best as you can do in a RPG Maker game.  \n\nBut as the story progressed, everything centered around the wasteland spreading and turning monsters into tougher opponents.  Even when you make it to the village completely destroyed, it still did not feel like it was a very menacing backstory to be afraid of.  In addition, the lack of villians in the game meant that your characters pretty much just stumble on new items instead of actually having any sort of real mission.  You are mainly just being sent to investigate over and over again.  There was no one to fight or scheming to stop you it feels like.\n\nThe ending was the worst.  I don't want to divulge too much for sake of spoilers, but that ending was borderline M. Night Shyamalan style like the Mist where it just vanishes or the Happening where it too just...ends?  The \"big\" revelation at the end really had as about much impact as it instead being a early game boss instead of the \"grand\" finale.  \n\nLastly....there is way too much dialougue and interaction in the game.  Kudos for not being lazy...but it was just way too much and it makes the player immune to when something is being said instead of engaged in a cutscene because half of the game some form of text is popping up every 20 seconds.  Streamline and gut it to only concentrate on the main story and then every once in a while...very rare times...add in parts that help build character identity more.  \n\n[h1]Style Art and Game Design[/h1]\n\nThis was a solid B+.  Almost everyhting is custom, but I would harp on the quality.  In total honesty I think default RPG Maker parts would had been better in many spots like many of the battle backgrounds and sprite work in dungeons.  \n\nBut heart and soul was poured into this area I can tell and that can always be appreciated.  \n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nMusic and ambience matched very well.  Will give this a solid B+ as well.  There where no tracks that took my breath away, but everything fit well together.  Only area I saw that could be easily improved without having to find new commission work would be the battle background music.  Mix it up from time to time.  It gets old hearing the same thing from beggining to end of game minus boss fights.  \n\nHowever, there must had been 30 tracks and again...although they did not blow me away, they still all fit very well together.  Great attention to detail.\n\n[h1]Overall map design[/h1]\n\nUndefeated uses a very different style that is for sure.  I would recomend narrowing those dungeons by A LOT.  Eons of running around vast open areas with enemy encounters happening every few seconds is not very enjoyable.  Perhaps it was a method used to not have to make but 7-ish main dungeons in the entire game?  I dont know.  A game to end with my characters only at level 45 and only seeing a few places does not give a complete package feeling to the player.  \n\nThat leads me to the world map.  Again...unique?  Not sure if that is the style in your other games, but I hope it is not.  That hurts the game I think and again reinforces what I felt in the story with it never really feeling like I even left Chapter 1.  How is the wasteland such a danger to the world when it apparantly only affects an area the size of ... 100 square miles?  \n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nMuch more emphasis needs to be on explaining the grand scope of the game and definitly make a enemy to fight towards...not all of a sudden get attacked by.  There was never any end fight your party was going to...they just stumbled onto it.  In fact, I had no idea I was at the end of the game until I stumbled into secret room 24 of 25.  That left a bad taste in my mouth after enjoying for the most part everything else.  \n\nHowever, work was definitly put into the game and it is enjoyable enough so I do not see this as being a waste of money for anyone.
