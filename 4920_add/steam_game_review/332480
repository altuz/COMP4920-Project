Might as well be playing a free Adobe Flash game from the mid-2000s.\n[*]No obvious hitbox indicator\u2014 just a few frames of a flapping bird.\n[*]Constant re-use of gameplay, audio, and art assets.

This can cause enemies (fights frequently involve more than one type of enemy, as a way to provide variety) to start using more powerful attacks when the player means to focus on only one.\n[/list]\n\nIf you really like bullet hell games or you want to try out a very simple and cheap bullet hell game, get this when it's on sale for next to nothing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502244368, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502244368, "recommendationid": "34116082", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504529630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 170, "steamid": "76561198138700608", "num_games_owned": 1019}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Brief: Score: 72/100.  A good SHOOT \u2018EM UP that\u2019s definitely worth playing.\n\nPhoenix Force is mostly about patience and avoiding damage.  The main gun is auto fire, so as long as you avoid damage you will eventually kill the enemy.  The more skillful players, who can memorize the bullet patterns, will be able to take down enemies by being more aggressive and jumping into the bullet hell more often.  Again, patience is the most power skill since one hit means death.  The enemies are basically all bosses. You meet a new boss in one level, then you face off against the new boss and a combination of the other bosses in later levels.  The game is a nice grind, since there are about 100 levels.  The graphics are passable.  Don\u2019t expect to see amazing effects that you might run into in the top games in the genre.  Still, for the price, it\u2019s a very good experience.  In fact, if you can pick it up during a sale, it probably is a must buy if you care about \u201cbang for the buck\u201d purchases.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501689293, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501689293, "recommendationid": "33973813", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 66, "total_reviews": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 13}}
