The VR mode is well implemented but I preferrred playing the game on a normal screen, (maybe thats just me though).. The AI can be either as dumb as a rock or a startling cheat dependent on the level you are playing at.\nNot a bad game, a little overpriced but worth buying on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503589930, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503589930, "recommendationid": "34462507", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501128", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502610329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2181, "steamid": "76561198045652927", "num_games_owned": 117}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I absolutely LOVE this game! It's the first game I've played in years where I didn't mind playing for hours on end.\nIt may be a little repetitive, but I really felt like I HAD to win. I can play for 20 minutes or lose hours of sleep over it. I can save a game at any time (although I really wish these saved games were saved to Steam instead of locally - my laptop doesn't have the same saved games my desktop does).\nLike other reviewers have said, there's no real resource managment, no \"politics\" involved - just fighting between ships and aircraft. It's more like Risk than about any other game I can think of; you have to have certain types of ships to hold areas you've won; there a \"zones\" you're trying to take over. You can only move a ship once in a turn so you have to plan carefully. Turns can take as long as you'd like, so there's no rush. If ships are damaged during a battle, they retain that damage even in future battles unless you repair them. To repair them, they have to be in \"zones\" where a shipyard is without moving for an entire turn. You do earn money based on which properties you control at the end of the turn. You use this money to build more ships which can only originate at specific points. These ships can be customized to some extent when you \"build\" them.\nI love the graphics. The water looks cool, the ships look cool. There are no microtransactions: you buy the game and you're done. Still, I wish there was some DLC.\nI really only have a very complaints: damage is determined randomly no matter where you hit another ship. If you hit the rear end, it might still show \"bridge damaged\" instead of a rudder. It would be neat to be able to zoom completely into your ships during a battle. AI will waste some time barely moving some ships at all, yet taking the time to move them anyway. AI doesn't seem to realize exactly how to correct for its miss. You have NO control over which ships you can move or in what order - sometimes a ship is in the way of another, but you have no choice over which you can move first. It would be neat to have cut scenes of ships being repaired when that happens instead of a bland \"3 ships were repaired\" text at the top of the screen.\nI got the game on sale, but I gotta say it's easily worth $20. Too bad there's no DLC at all.
