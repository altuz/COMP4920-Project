It was (is?) a lovely game, and a nice concept, but i am giving this negative review based on how the developers have been treating the game and the community. It dosent take much to communicate with people, seems they are either affraid of people wanting money back? or just have no respect for anyone who plays their games...

I'm more or less a casual gamer and am usually very forgiving when it comes to a game's short comings.

You'll reach a certain point and you'll say to yourself, \"Where's the rest of the game?  Is this really all that there is?\".  Reviews saying that it's abandoned is very acurate.  There's nothing new.  Ever.  I returned after three months or so and... nothing.  Monsters are spawned and you collect things over and over and over and over and over.  Unlocking abilities and weapons seems as if that's the only point to the game.  I don't play multi-player so I can't say if that's worth the buy.  \n\nThis is the first early access game I've ever bought and it's been a bad experience.  I will be highly cautious in the future.
