It's fairly quick - I was able to finish in about 5 hours. There's also not a whole lot of background story because you just jump right in, and I was perfectly happy with that. The puzzles ranged from very easy and intuitive to those requiring a little more creative thinking and time. There was at least one or two really challenging puzzles per level which was great. This is really meant as a relaxing, casual game that doesn't have a whole lot of depth to it. So, I can understand why some people may not like it. I don't think they are as \"brutally difficult\" as other users have described, but they will be challenging enough for those who are unfamiliar with gaming clues/norms/hints (i.e. the kinds of things you would \"know\" to look for only if you have gamed regularly in the past). \n\nI didn't have issues with unresponsive controls, but I was playing this on my laptop.  \n\nThe art was great - simple, colorful, imaginative. I found myself smiling at some of the very cute and quirky drawing styles. I sometimes get overwhelmed if there is too much going on visually in a game, so I can appreciate a graphics style where it is both visually appealing and well-balanced. I liked the change of pace (and scenery!) for the underwater levels, although I was also very happy when I was done with them. I think the biggest issue people may have is the learning curve with timing; however, I'm used to playing PC flash games and maybe I've just learned to accept it. It wasn't so frustrating that I ever quit the game, and it's not keeping me from wanting to replay it! \n\nI would strongly recommend it for anyone who is just starting out getting into gaming or for kids - I would not recommend this for anyone who is looking for something with complexity or depth, whether in story line, puzzles, or otherwise. \n\nFull disclosure: I bought this game for $1 and was really pleased with the amount of entertainment I got from it. I'd probably pay $5 at most if I had to repurchase it again. I don't think it's worth more than that.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501696105, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501696105, "recommendationid": "33975859", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 29, "total_reviews": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
