It was short but sweet, reminding me of platformers from the 90's. Some of the puzzles were relatively straightforward, but others were interestingly complex. To be honest, it took me a lot longer than I'd like to admit to figure out how to get the boulder unlodged in the underwater area. While there is a great deal of backtracking through all the areas, I'll say at least half of mine was due to taking everything I picked up to Miss Willow just to see what she'd say about it. Poor Miss Willow, behind your kind, hardworking veneer is a lonely overworked woman who is living for the weekend.\n\nLong story short, if you enjoy shooting things with fire, whacking things with a broom, traipsing through a school filled with an inordinate amount of ghosts and monsters as you ferry random items back and forth, and you have a few hours to spare, I'd definitely recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502627714, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502627714, "recommendationid": "34212907", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503892", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486949543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 190, "steamid": "76561197983495899", "num_games_owned": 619}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A fun little metroidvania.
