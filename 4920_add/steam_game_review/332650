After about two hours of gameplay, it's clear to see that the devs put a lot of hard work in this game. The world is beautiful, with many different biomes/areas to explore. The tutorial is straight-forward and informative.\n\nUnfortunately the game does fall short in some places. After completing the tutorial, you are left to do your own thing - no hand-holding whatsoever. And there isn't much else to do other than to grind the same events over and over, or kill other players. Also, the combat is weird and clunky, with plenty of lag. \nThe devs say there is \"no grinding\" but actually, there's plenty of it. You need to kill monsters/participate in events to obtain items to level up your equipment/to craft new equipment, which seems kind of pointless (unless you're leveling up to kill other players and steal their loot, I don't see why you'd want to grind for countless hours just to level up your equipment a bit).\n\nFinally, the community has been quite toxic so far. Since it's PvP [i]at all times[/i], almost everyone is trying to kill you [i]at all times[/i]. I found a ton of loot at one stage, and two of these guys came up to me and rekt me and I lost everything 5 minutes later.\nThis is just unfair, especially since I had just spent the last 5 minutes doing an event for [a little bit of] loot. I did however find an awesome guy that I had helped to finish an event and he shared half the loot with me. That was pretty cool.\n\nAnother thing is that all the events are practically the same. In my experience, all you do in an event is defend a site from a bunch of attacking monsters that look the exact same pretty much every time. Fun, right? Wrong.\n\nAll in all, I'd say this game is good to an extent, but it definitely does need to be improved in some areas. It's also only free for 7 days, and thereafter we have to pay $20. If you want to support the devs, then you should definitely buy it, but otherwise I don't think the game is worth $20 in it's current state.\n\nGive it a try though, I mean it's free - won't hurt to try! I'm giving it a thumbs up for now, but it is subject to change.\nAlso if you enjoy trolling people, then this is definitely the game for you.\n\nThanks for reading and hope you have a great day!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487866519, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1490994731, "recommendationid": "30121991", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514468", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490279489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2044, "steamid": "76561197992640525", "num_games_owned": 67}, "votes_funny": -1, "votes_up": 46, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Excellent high-skill PVP game.

No grinding you said? that is BS. You will  be grinding on mobs for skills and pigments. You have to grind on events to obtain materials in order to craft gears. You will be spending 80% of your game time grinding and 20% on losing your loots and getting killed by players in group. What is ridiculous is that you are only allowed to gain certain amount of exp from items and killing mobs each day. So many things are glitched at this moment, for example, earth wall does not properly block mobs as some mobs can just squeeze pass walls. Gravirty well often does not apply slow on palyers and does not suck them toward the center. In terms of balance, it seems like sickle is  the most useful and probably most powerful weapon atm. it is capable of killing mobs in group and doing some good 2 VS 1 while other weapons are just eating shit. Did i mention that you are constantly being blocked and stucked by little rocks, plants, and sometimes buildings on the path ? that probably happens like every 5 minutes !!

You can switch to local and talk to people around you or go to the clan tab and talk to your clan mates.\n\nCons- \nlocal banking is garbage/annoying (in any game that has it) I know the idea behind local banking is to encourage pvp, but its annoying. \n\nre-spawn KO after you got gank is dumb as well, (which you then can get re-gank if you binded near the place where you died, which then it just tele you to a different tree) so basically you re-spawn defenseless and can't do anything about it. \n\nits pvp focus but forces you to pve and grind for everything (including abilities), I can understand grinding for crafting gear but abilities?. you need pigment to level up abilities and some scrolls to learn new ones, they drop from mobs, but its random drops. Or you can be a pker and loot players and hope they got what you need.\n\nThe mechanics are very similar to bloodline champions but less polish and can feel kinda clunky. They don't respond smoothly at times.\n\nRandom lag spikes/server issues. rubber banding even when my ping and frames are good.\n\nMap - you will get stuck randomly by rocks or whatever is in the way. This is by far the most annoying thing. \n\nResource gathering is a mini game of defending it (whatever it is you claim) until the timer runs out. Although unique I didn't like it.\n\nIf you desire to be the ultimate troll you can def fuck with people on this. If they're trying to capture some resources you can destroy it. You can also heal mobs or just pk the shit outta players. If you're a grifter this game is for you. \n\nDef try to join people as soon as you can.
