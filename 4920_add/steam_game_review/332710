It'S not bad but it's not good either. First of all the game has no proper tutorial which is fundemental for a rogue like. I still have no clue what i have to do or what's my goal. The gameplay feels like a typical turn based rogue like. Click on monsters untill the die gather loot and use you skills, kill more monsters and evtenually level up. Sounds good to me? But i dunno why and what it is but the standard rogue like gameplay is not enough for this title. You don't even have to think in 1QUEST you can just click on monsters and the die, You have skills but you don't have to use them to succeed. Sometimes there are so many enemies on the screen that if you take one turn you immediately die. There are monsters that are just o.p. and they break the game.
