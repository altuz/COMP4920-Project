I liked the concept so I bought it for me and my bf straight away. Big mistake...\n\nIndeed, you'll be fed up after 2 or 4 hours of gameplay because of 3 main reasons:\n- ONLY ONE MAP (and a small one !!!!) \nFor the price, 10 maps would have been the minimum required.\n- NO PLAYERS!!! \nServors are empty, really empty!!! We met a guy once few days after the game release and that was it. \nOf course, who wants to play on the same map over and over again ??!!\n- ALWAYS THE SAME BACKGROUND MUSIC, really irritating !\n\nAVOID THIS GAME!
