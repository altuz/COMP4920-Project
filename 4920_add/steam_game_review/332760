I especially enjoyed Bullet Hell where the bullets literally never stop flying and Trick Shot where the game turns into a quick thinking vs. puzzle game.\n\nThe controls and menus are simple, colourful and perfectly pitched for a party game. The matches get crazy hectic and it really is a lot of fun.\n\nCan't wait for the introduction of the single player mode to iron out my strategies too!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428486271, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1428486271, "recommendationid": "15261876", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504807", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494217186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 75, "steamid": "76561198159961615", "num_games_owned": 175}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Extremely broken controls makes this amazing game nearly unplayable with friends.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1472184447, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1472184447, "recommendationid": "25155017", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498107", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450465004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 142, "steamid": "76561198132115105", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you like blasting,fun and playing with friends,you'll love this awesome game with great art!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428091492, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1428091492, "recommendationid": "15191233", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499359", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
