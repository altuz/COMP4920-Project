Sure - zombie games are plentiful, but they are a kind of game that provides for endless amounts of joy. [i]National Zombie Park[/i] is an overhead view survival game that looks like a polished piece of work. It has the tension and surival feeling that so many of its cousins also have. \n\nYet it's when one actually starts playing the game that the problems start. Firstly there's the controls. The mouse and keyboard combination works well most of the time, but the lack of conscious feedback from the zombie attacks mean that you cannot tell if you've successfully avoided an assault until the creature is lying on the floor dead. Or you are. Either way, it's difficult to tell until the battle is over.\n\nNext comes the less crucial but still annoying issues of glitchy backgrounds. Whilst walking around, you will see backgrounds with different shaded areas that don't blend at all. This kind of amateur coding is to me evidence that this game needed proper project management and a proper QA system. When I work, things like this are picked up by testers. Here, they seem to be simply disregarded.\n\nThere's also the problem of character and weapon sprites lacking clear definition over their backgrounds. This, combined with the lack of proper detection of when the player is walking on the weapons means this game becomes an exercise in squinting at the screen trying to see where certain things are.\n\nI've given NZP enough time. I'm going to delete it and concentrate on the better offerings out there. I'd advise anyone else out there to stay clear of this game too. Go with 7 Days to Die or even Day-Z for your zombie rewards.\n\nEven better, try [url=https://www.deadfrontier.com/]Dead Frontier[/url].", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492514354, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492514354, "recommendationid": "31216460", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534115", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493123363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 612, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198007179147", "num_games_owned": 1141}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I should listen reviewers, now i'm refunding...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493123529, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493123529, "recommendationid": "31356331", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.246887", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 3, "review_score_desc": "Negative", "total_negative": 20}}
