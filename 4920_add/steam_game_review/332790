The boring and uninteresting story is only the smallest of problems as this game also features a horrible lighting that has no option to change in the settings, a boring and drawn out maze of a map that feels like a punishment to play in, horrible sound edits that miss their eerie mark, countless useless items (especially the gun), horrible hit registration from the infected AI to the player, god awful and delayed controlled actions, a horrible respawn system, and a horribly made animation through the sections you pass. It's honestly a crime to even consider selling this game for money instead of free. Purchasing it made me feel like I was only punishing myself. I had only bought it for twenty cents but it still felt like I paid too much. Even writing the review felt more engaging and fun then the actual game.  0.3/10\n\nTL;DR: Buying this game is an absolute waste of time and money and you'd have more fun watching paint dry.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503040688, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503040688, "recommendationid": "34322665", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507946", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 38, "total_reviews": 98, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 60}}
