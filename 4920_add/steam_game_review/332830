It is a logic puzzle game similar to the programming-oriented titles such as Spacechem and Human Resource Machine. Honestly, I enjoy this game more than both of those titles. The length and difficulty are a lot higher than Human Resource Machine while the interface and mechanics of the game are more casual and simplistic than Spacechem. The best part is that unlike some other games in this genre, it is entirely graphical and very easy to learn with no programming background required. \n\nI am currently nine hours into the game with roughly two-thirds of the chapters completed, and I am so hooked on the gameplay that I have no desire to stop playing even when I hit a wall. Prelogate consists of ten chapters and while some chapters are quick and easy, the difficulty increases significantly about halfway through the game.\n\nSince this is a niche title and not a mainstream puzzle game like Portal 2, it really isn't for everyone so you are most likely going to either love it or hate it. The expert puzzle gamers might consider this game to be mediocre compared to games like TIS-100 and Spacechem, but as an intermediate puzzle gamer who is not a professional programmer, I found this title to be much more accessible than many of its counterparts. If you are interested in logic-based puzzle games but you don't have the coding background to enjoy the more technical programming-based games, Prelogate serves as a great starting point and makes for an enjoyable experience.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506380161, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506484915, "recommendationid": "35212022", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505515", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 37, "total_reviews": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
