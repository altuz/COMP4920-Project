Just move the mouse.  No powerups, No character creation, no inventory, just old school arcade gaming goodness!  There is not even the use of a mouse button required except to choose what level and difficulty you want to play on.  The gameplay itself is just dodging your automatic stream of bullets reflection all over the increasingly more challenging level designs.  This game offers you 60 levels with 3 difficulty levels each to master!  Don't shoot yourself!  LOL!!\n\nMy video linked above demonstates this game pretty well I believe.  Give it a view, and make up your mind!\n\nMy rating at this point: 88% and a \"Must-Buy\" for any old school arcade/action game fans who enjoy a game that is super simple to learn but difficult to master!

Partly \u201carcade\u201d, perhaps. Certainly largely \u201cpuzzle\u201d, certainly, for reasons to soon be explained. It begins with Tier 0, of seemingly 6 tiers (0-5) of 10 scenarios each. Each scenario consists of a named layout, or game field to try to beat, each with three skill levels: Normal (1 star), Hard (2 stars) and Impossible (5 stars!). That\u2019s important, so I\u2019ll clarify. Impossible counts 5 TIMES as much as Normal, and 2 and a half times as much as Hard. Each tier ends with a boss scenario that has to be defeated to move to the next tier. But it\u2019s not that simple. To even access each boss, a cumulative number of stars must be acquired. On Tier 0 this is a very easy proposition. Few of the Normal skill level puzzles are difficult at early levels. Some early level scenarios are almost stupid easy, all the way through Impossible. This led me to believe my money had been poorly spent. I was hasty.\n\nEach scenario requires the player to use the mouse to move a cursor forward, shooting a stream of bullets to the rear. Once 100 bullets have been fired, the scenario has been defeated at that skill level. That number of stars, 1, 2 or 5, is added to the total. What makes this game interesting is the fascinating differences in the scenarios, and the ways the bullets react to the walls and barriers they encounter in each.  Imagine invisible walls (Glass Ceiling), or backgrounds of which more than 50% are opaque (Hourglass.) Or in many cases, lines that can be followed, or must be followed, or a combination. Barriers to the bullets, barriers to the player. \u201cWormhole\u201d type walls. Bullets that fly off walls they strike, or that shoot back at the player at high speeds. Fortunately, the bullets do eventually shrink or fade away, and it\u2019s simply necessary to avoid them long enough. It generally seems to be OK to hit them, just not for them to hit you. And, oh yes, the boss levels are harder.\n\nThe reason I called this a puzzle game is that any scenario can conceivably be difficult, if the proper logic is not applied. From what I\u2019ve seen, many levels aren\u2019t just impossible in name, but in action, without determining and applying that specific logic. With it, some of them almost instantly become the described \u201cstupid easy\u201d. And that is very fortunate, because it doesn\u2019t take long until the cumulative number of stars required to access the next boss, thereby giving one the chance to open the next tier, grows almost exponentially. \n\nAdmittedly, this isn\u2019t typically my kind of game, where the movement of the cursor is so precise. I have very little experience, so the difficulty I describe may be mine alone. The math, however, is not. After 2 hours I have a total of 9 Impossible, 11 Hard and 9 Normal, for a total of 76 stars. I need 4 more stars to access the third level boss, and I\u2019m stumped. (Perhaps YouTube is an admission of failure, but I have a cash investment here. PC is a new port, so no telling if that\u2019s even an option.) Here\u2019s the problem. To access the 4th level boss, assuming that level is even more difficult and I may have to accept Normal wins on every 4th level scenario prior to the boss, it will be necessary to have beat skill level Impossible on almost EVERY preceding puzzle on all 3 prior levels. And I can\u2019t imagine that will be easy for anyone. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m wondering if my money was poorly spent.\n\nA very hard, very frustrating game, at least for me. But certainly interesting intellectually. And very satisfying when that \u201ctrick\u201d suddenly comes to light, and victory is so very simple. Hopefully, that possibility continues throughout \u201cDon\u2019t Shoot Yourself!\u201d\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428952542, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428952542, "recommendationid": "15339776", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521869", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1428934961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 123, "steamid": "76561198056665342", "num_games_owned": 228}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "its pretty good, I found that due to the game being mouse driven some of the mechanic made things more chaotic than they should have been e.g I went through a teleporter but my mouse didn't move so my character attempted to zip back to where my mouse is and then I lost because it ran into some bullets.\n Aside from constantly beating levels obviously atypically to how the level design would suggest, it is a fun little puzzler that should be an app but is good enough of a game to feel right at home in my steam library.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428727598, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428727598, "recommendationid": "15300950", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504363", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482452414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 156, "steamid": "76561198036276042", "num_games_owned": 94}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Amazing!
