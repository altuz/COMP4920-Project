There's only 10 items in game that you can craft, animals are scares, I only saw one structure a cabin throughout the whole map that I ran around, no base building, the UI and some of the items in game are from unity store. You start off with a bow, but no arrows, so I ran around finding sticks and rocks off the ground, started crafting arrows, ran, ran and ran, but avoid the swamp, because you will sink to your death. I ended up being killed by a bear (asset) after playing for 15 minutes.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498565060, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498565060, "recommendationid": "32852476", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497392", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 9}}
