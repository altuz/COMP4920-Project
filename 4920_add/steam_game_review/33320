Well, in fact it looks pretty amazing - it utilizes a similar material and texture approach as my favorite entry in the series - Prince of Persia \"2008\". The textures are crisp, extremely rich and detailed, but all fit together rather well. The art style is consistent, palettes - solid (if a bit too brown at times) and characters - well designed and recognizable.\n\nThe Forgotten Sands utilizes a strange combat system, similar to that of the Batman Arkham series (Freeflow Combat), though not qute as polished or refined. \n\nThe parkour / puzzles have a decent difficulty curve to them, with the final climb being quite a challenge - at least to my, not-so-nimble fingers.\n\nDefinitely worth a buy if on sale, should run on pretty much anything these days. Recommended with a game pad. Took me around 8 hours to complete, ignoring the challenges and focussing on the main story."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499243338, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511049", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33265737", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971246373", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1499271286, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 134}, "timestamp_updated": 1499271202, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Forgotten Sands feels like the dying breath of a once-great series. Previously, the overall gameplay had the player explore their newfound time-changing abilities by not only solving pathway puzzles but also using them in combat to gain an advantage on a certain enemy type or boss. It was up to the player to find the solution to each little challenge. It was a, forgive the pun, sandbox to discover new uses for each ability. Forgotten Sands instead holds the player's hand throughout each room and hallway: as the camera pans away (in almost every room) to show the next path to take or where a button is located, it never allows the player a feeling of full control. The only time manipulation tricks here are the ability to rewind in case of a missed jump or death by sand zombies and pausing time to use water as a traversal tool. Its never as cohesive as the previous games. Combat is done through repetitive sword swinging or sometimes kicking away an enemy shield. Upgrades to create whirlwinds that knock enemies down or one that creates a trail of fire are attempts to add some variety but these don't replace the excitement of slowing time to take out three enemies in five seconds. Its a bare-minimum Prince of Persia experience and while it isn't cluttered with a lot of button memorization or a deeper story it wouldn't have hurt to inject a few things into the overall package. Is it worth playing? ONLY if you want to experience a PoP game without all the distractions. But for most: those distractions are what made the previous games good in the first place. \nWithout any real depth to the story, it means the ludonarrative dissonance is at an all-time high, never giving the player a connection between the gameplay and the story. What you're doing is never fully connected to why you're doing it. Who thought it was a good idea to line a hallway with a dozen spinning spike traps? Who was originally in control of the sand zombie soldiers? How did the Prince becomes so adept at wall-running and traversal? What's at stake if things get too far out of hand? It skips parts of what could be a juicy story and leaves a lean minimum of connectivity. Figure out a way around a room, fight some enemies, see a short bit of story. Repeat ad nauseam. The Sands of Time trilogy and even the 2008 relaunch offer more overall enjoyment than this, which should have been a budget release.\n\n(I can't believe I'm saying this but if you ever get the chance, play the Wii version instead. The combat feels better, the exploration feels rewarding, the story isn't half-hearted, and the Prince doesn't feel like a cheap imitation. It really is a better game overall.)"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498088599, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32630218", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027736032", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1504561768, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 618}, "timestamp_updated": 1498088599, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The Prince Of Persia The Forgotten Sands in my opinion is an enjoyable ride. With all games, good, bad, or just plain ok, I found things I enjoyed and things I did not. Overall, I enjoyed it. The story itself is simple, you are the Prince visiting his brother Malik in the middle of a battle. Trying to save his kingdom Malik accidentaly opens up a ancient sand army run by an evil Djinn. The prince meets a Djinn named Razia who helps the Prince in defeating the army and putting a end to the sand army. Simply story, it does offer inside into the Prince Of Persia verison of Djinns but overall it is a simply story to follow. Even for the time it came out, it looks great, a few hiccups of texture and sometimes the models look a little weird, but it looks great. Gameplay ways is where the game shines, the Prince's usually parkor is still present from the wall jump wall run swinging on polls etc. I found the Parkor system easy to follow. Puzzle solving was ok, some simply and some SO simple that I over thinking it. One of the Sands Of Time powers return to really help with the parkor when ever you make a little mistake or start to get a little impatient which I have done manytimes. Combat is simple with just one button for basic attacks, the same attack button for heavy attacks just by holding it, a kick button, and a dodge button plus an upgrade system to upgrade your health, and powers again simple. Again I found enjoyment out of it even with the simplistic story and combat system. I do recommend it if you are willing to give it a try."}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498195614, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471643", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32666117", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198179863075", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1498269819, "num_games_owned": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1004}, "timestamp_updated": 1498195614, "received_for_free": false, "review": "steam is annoying"}]}
