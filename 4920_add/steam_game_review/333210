While I keep playing it, more out of stubborn determination than enjoyment, the game progresses by getting TEDIOUS and frustratingly more difficult while offering next to no reward for the player.  Half-baked I can't help but imagine how good this game COULD have been; if the monster was reasonable to control, there were any kind of customizations, destroying a major city was fun, the world would actually run out of stealth bombers, I COULD have loved this game.  But instead it is just fucking boring.   BORING.   \n\nI play a game like this because I want to have fun and destroy cities and take over the world.  NOT to endlessly \"fight\" an infinite supply of shitty tanks and planes over and over and over and over and over again.\n\nStill, imagine if this game combined with Sim City and Mechwarrior... where the cities arent just awful grids of generic buildings, but actual recreations of the cities as they are known, and you can design and custom build and then ACTUALLY CONTROL your monster from various POV, and wreak havoc, you know, for fun and enjoyment.   Where a sense of... dare I say, realism, would actually improve the experience.    I fantasize. \n\nThis game is just a tedious job to complete.  Don't bother with more than Tier 1 cities, as it just gets worse and worse", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502349352, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502349352, "recommendationid": "34140753", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496512", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 75, "total_reviews": 122, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 47}}
