They are all explored a lot more in this and i think its a good addition to the 1st game. I would get this on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501836950, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501836950, "recommendationid": "34011457", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 45, "total_reviews": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 9}}
