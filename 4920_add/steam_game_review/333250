Woo!\n\nUnfortunately, the game seems to have little to it in most respects. The combat is awkward, the platforming is awkward, the environments are just the \"castle in the sky\" and the voice acting is a little wonky. New mechanics are introduced every level, however there are only 6 of them.\n\nI completed the game in about an hour, then went back for the complete ending. It's a rather small game - but that means that the things it attempts are difficult to mess up.
