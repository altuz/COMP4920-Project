It has a nice amount of levels with lots of secrets to find and an amazing soundtrack![/i]\n\nAfter seeing the store page, I thought [i]Mos Speedrun 2[/i] was one of those simple and perhaps lame platformers but I was happy to note I was wrong. Despite (or perhaps because of) its simple presentation it packs with quite a lot of high-quality content.\n\nGame has 30 levels placed in groups of six through five worlds with their own distinct graphics styles and soundtrack (that fits the game very well), with enemies and traps going with that. In that it strikes a similarity with Super Mario Bros 3 and its diverse worlds. Of course [i]Mos Speedrun 2[/i] totally lacks a story and [strike]doesn't have weird suits[/strike] Mos' suits are merely visual.\n\n[h1]Jumping through the ages[/h1]\n\nGame play mechanics are almost as simple as they can be: Mos (I take it's the name of the protagonist) may run, jump and wall-jump and occasionally swing from a rope. Controls are simple and very slick and hit boxes are good, so every once in a while when you die, you know its your own fault.\n\nBy the way, I used Xbox 360 controller but controls were simple and fine enough to play with a keyboard. My only regret is that up key is both \"up\" in menu and \"jump\" in-game, despite there being a separate jump key. I had to remap \"up\" to another button on the controller to make it playable but I'm glad this was possible.\n\n[h1]Travelling around the world[/h1]\n\nLevel design is top-notch. While levels are usually rather linear with minor sidetracking, there is also a secret area or two in each and every level. In the course of the game Mos goes from avoiding giant bees, rats and spike traps to dodging ghosts and fireballs while avoiding saw blades and lava. Disappearing and reappearing blocks are probably the only platformer trap trope missing from the game.\n\nThe difficulty curve is good, starting from rather easy first levels but going to pretty challenging levels close to the end. However, as a gamer who plays a lot of platformers, I would not call any of the levels very difficult, even if they are not a cakewalk either. There are respawn points every now and then to alleviate unnecessary restarts, although they work only once per game.\n\nGame supports \"ghosts\", i.e. the runs of other players (and earlier runs of yourself) are shown, so you can use them to perfect your run or even try to beat them to the top of the leaderboards if you like that sort of thing.\n\n[h1]Secrets! People love secrets![/h1]\n\nThere are a lot of collectables in all levels. In addition to completing and speed running, to fully complete a level one has to grab all the coins (they are never hidden in unfair fashion), grab the hidden golden skull of the level and find the hidden daily collectable, day charm.\n\nThe day charm is in a different level in each day of the month. There's an achievement for grabbing all of them, so ideally one would find them over the course of a single 30-day month. I liked this challenge a lot, though some people might disagree with time-limited achievements like this.\n\nFinally there's even a super secret that encompasses several levels throughout the game. It felt very rewarding to find this ultimate secret after a couple days of confusion and mad exploration.\n\nGetting achievements grants you suits, hats and skins for Mos. It's useless but fun feature to bring some personality to your character. You can be a dinosaur wearing a suit, a pipe and a top hat, which is just priceless.\n\n[h1]Conclusion: Get it![/h1]\n\nAfter about 17 hours and little over a month I was done. After all this time I can say [i]Mos Speedrun 2[/i] is a great platformer that is not too easy but not too difficult either and that has a lot of stuff to do and find out.
