I like the corruption system but it's not very clear how it works. Also,  don't get too attached to any characters, It can feel really unfair at times. Prepare to die in the most inane ways. That said I like the tile set used here but the UI could use some love.

This graphical update seems to make the experience worse. The music is unpleasantly mediocre, and sound volume can't be changed in-game. The mouse-based controls are incomplete, meaning you can't play it one-handed (yeah, yeah). I don't like the keyboard-based movement due to the possibility of carpal tunnel syndrome (it's happened to me with other roguelikes) but I also don't like switching back and forth between keyboard and mouse; what the game really needs is an auto-walk feature like in NetHack. This needs a lot more polish, and while it looks like the author is going to put out a major update soon, I'd recommend in the meantime that you just get the ASCII version online and then donate if it really grabs you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504991292, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504991292, "recommendationid": "34846804", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487270", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 290, "total_reviews": 325, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 35}}
