Myrne plays a lot slower. It wants you to take your time and explore!\nI'll do my best to describe the good and bad points, but with such a simple game, it's a bit tricky..\n\nTHE GOOD:\n-The story doesn't take itself seriously. If you've played DLC Quest, the sense of humour will seem very similar with goofy jokes and calling attention to the fact that it's a game. The main character likes to break the forth wall while the NPCs struggle to stay in character.\n-Questing is fun! You could probably count the total number of quests with one hand, but the game does a good job varying them up. Most of them involve killing bosses or other creatures, but you might have to solve a puzzle to reach them.\n-Very lengthy for what it is. You can finish it in a little over 4 hours. I got stuck on a quest which took me a while to figure out, otherwise everything else was easy :)\n-The Music is awesome! The soundtrack in What Lies Beneath will surprise you! Seriously, it's steps this game up to a whole other level.\n-Walking speed doesn't suck! This might seem trivial, but for a game like this, moving slow can test your patience. You can spend stats to increase movement speed and there's plenty of items that warp you to your last checkpoint (touching a bed saves your game and sets spawn)\n-Easy to grasp crafting system! In this day and age, crafting has become a strange standard in gaming, which a lot of times requires loads of research on the games wiki. Song of Myrne has descriptions for every item and effect in-game so you won't be scratching your head and taking notes.\n\nTHE BAD:\n-I've ran into a couple bugs. One completely locked my hotbar. I could walk around, but I couldn't attack. Reopening the game resolved the issue.\n-The second bug isn't an issue, but it's quite cruel. I was killed inside a dungeon (being killed will respawn you in town and cost gold) and while the screen was fading out to respawn, the monsters continued to attack my corpse. Each hit counted as a \"death blow\" so kept losing gold over and over as the game thought I died multiple times.\n-The Hotbar can get a bit confusing. Say you have an item tied to 1 on the keyboard. If you have 6 of that it shows your reserve on the hotbar. The problem is there's no visual que letting you know which number is which, so until you get used to it, you might press the wrong key a few times. This is an easy fix if the numbers on the hotbar were a different colour than the item number.\n\nIf you'd like to see the game in action, here's my First Look :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGF3jrgBGIA\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nIf you're in the mood for a casual single player RPG, you can't go wrong with Song of Myrne. $5 is a perfect price for this game. Any bugs I ran into weren't game breaking or annoying, I just noticed them. I really don't have anything bad to say about this game.\n\n-Thanks for taking the time to read this review!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421250711, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421381661, "recommendationid": "13983427", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673858", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421440017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 434, "steamid": "76561198026913459", "num_games_owned": 450}, "votes_funny": 10, "votes_up": 97, "comment_count": "7", "review": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdQ5JBYseug\n\nThe game will give roughly 3 hours of gameplay which is ill suited for an RPG.  It gives you just enough time to figure things out but not enough time to advance any sort of story or bring your character to a reasonably customizable point.  I hit Level 6 when I finished the game, which gave me 5 points to distribute.  I put two in stamina which ended up being a completely useless stat to me, 2 in health and one in mana... which also ended up being a completely useless stat to me.\n\nThe final boss of the game was killed by left clicking it over 10,000 times.  My right hand is still suffering from carpal tunnel, but thankfully I'm left handed and can do fine without.  But if you have carpal tunnel and are right handed.... you probably should just not buy this game.\n\nThe game starts you off in a room where you left click on what appears to be a flower until you look a little closer and find out that it's your dead wife.  You find out she's dead and receive your first quest to avenge her.  Throughout the game you will pick up 8 quests which will get you to 8 different boss-like entities that are all killed in roughly the same way.\n\nThe game advertises crafting... which it does have.  However since the game is so short and you don't actually need it, it doesn't make up a very important part of the game.  I killed the final boss with a weapon I picked off of an enemy, crafting seems like it is tacked on.  It is the way in which you get all higher quality goods, but because you can beat enemies by using a microing technique, it's simply not necessary.  It's kind of like how I found out I could block shots with the shift key... and then never used it because I barely ever got hit.\n\nEach story is very rushed.  You talk to a person and they tell you two sentences, and then you are on your way.  For an RPG it's very lacking in plot development.\n\nThe pixel graphics unfortunately hinder the game in such a massive way.  Pixel art can be very beautiful.  In this case it looks like most of the pixel art was taken from royalty free artists and slapped into the game.  Nothing looks like what it should be.\n\nIf this was a free to play browser game I'd play it.

Its a questline based story with multiple side quests along the way. The quests arent that detailed though. So the story isnt that rich but it makes up for it with the humor of the quests. And you do get a sense of accomplishment from doing the quests from the gear that you get along the way with some lvls every here and there.\n\nOne of the problemes that somebody would have with it is the quests are not very descriptive. Most quests tell you just to do something and not how to do it. For instance one of the very first quests you get is to find who killed your beloved rabbit wife. Thats all it tells you, is to do just that. Youll have to figure out what to do from there. That alone left me wondering around for about 30 minutes untill I learned I had to go to the village, talk to this guy in the bar, and he will tell you to go to this dungeon and you will have to clear the dungeon. However he doesnt tell you where the dungeon is.. So if your expected to be guided through the story dont. With the amount of time it takes to figure things out like that it adds alot of gametime.\n\nOverall I still enjoyed playing this game. I do come back to it every now and then to see if I can figure out that quest I was stuck on. And if your thinking you might like it and are willing to spend an extra 5$ then go for it.

It doesnt look like much at first glance, but its really fun. If you are a fan of pixel art or top-down realtime RPGs, take a look at this one. Overall, its totally worth the completely reasonable asking price, even with a few minor flaws.\n\nIn depth \n+++++++++++++\nYou move around with the WASD on a top down screen and aim you guy's facing with the mouse pointer, so you can run backwards while attacking or in circles or what have you. Its actually quite entertaining to run circles around a mob dodging their weapons while you hit them repeatedly. It is controlled simply. RMB is any ranged weapon, LMB is use (the cursor changes to a situational icon when you are pointing at something you can interact with) and melee. A few other keys round out the commands (questlist, char sheet, quickbar, inventory, menu), and all are mappable. \n\nAll weapons have a slight cooldown and even melee weapons have a range difference based on type (ie a sword has more range than a dagger) identified by how far away your \"attack\" animation travels. There is a simple char screen any RPG'er will pick up immediately, where you can add stat points, learn talents and generally make your guy better. It has a niceinventory and item system, and there is even a crafting menu. The enemies respawn, so farming and grinding is an option if you wanted to, but not strictly needed. There is also a lot of tongue in cheek humor, but it never feels like it beating you over the head with \"trying too hard to be funny\"\n\nIt does have a few flaws, some people may consider them major, some people may not care at all. One of the ones I consider major is the M+K only configuration. For people like me with physical disabilities that make it so using WASD is difficult, JoytoKey is a must. But even then JoytoKey never works as good as native controller. Another one is that the game is obviously written by someone without complete fluency in English. Grammar mistakes and odd phrasing abound in nearly all dialogue. It isn't as badly written as many games I've seen, but its definately noticeable. There are still many jokes that are greatly amusing, and some of the stilted odd dialogue adds a certain charm. \nIf you are fluent enough to play it in French, I suggest you do that. \n\nAnother thing I noticed is that walking into the bed at the inn is how you regain health and save. It costs 4 gold every time you touch it. There have been times when I bounced off it accidentally while leaving, causing me to spend 12 gold I didnt want to in 2 seconds. I have also been pinned by NPCS in certain areas (the crafter's bench in the miscellaneous store is horrible for this one), and was unable to get out due to the configuration of the area. It could also stand to be a little longer and have wider variety of items and crafting receipes as well as not have everything you can craft visible from the start (although that is a matter of personal taste, I like to gain/learn receipes instead of seeing everything right away). YOu;ll probably get 3-5 hours of gameplay out of it, more if you explore and mess around.\n\nEven with these flaws - which I would call more of a lack of polish than anything - the game is definately worth it. With a seeming trend of indie developers charging ridiculous prices for games far less polished and fun than this one (especially 99c mobile games being badly ported to the PC and sold for $10), its a breath of fresh air to see a non-greedy dev charging a fair price for a game.\n\nIts worth the $5 for any top-down RPG or oldschool fan.
