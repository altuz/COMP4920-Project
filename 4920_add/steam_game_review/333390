After 9 hours I'm still on the first scene because I keep wanting to go back and try different customization skills.  I am glad that this appears to have less \"romance\" than the other games by this publisher.  I mostly like the story, quests, and battle.  The graphics are very appealing.  The music is phenomenal!  I also enjoy the narrative; it has just the right amount of humor.  The story also unfolds at a good pace.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501804397, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501804397, "recommendationid": "34004496", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502747264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2551, "steamid": "76561198062710598", "num_games_owned": 173}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a shame : this game is underrated, deserving much more love from rpg players.\nIt's a great rpg, but a poor vn with only one love interest if you are straight, whether you play a boy or a girl.\nGraphics are greats, musics are relaxing.\n\na game less generous than loren amazon princess, but well worth  enjoying nevertheless.\n\nedit : the ending is sooo disappointing that i retract my opinion, this is a trainwreck.\ntheir father is a psycho, their mother is an utter slut, and chalassa's twist is  not convincing : drama for the sake of drama.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502491381, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502730868, "recommendationid": "34178549", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501495", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 26, "total_reviews": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
