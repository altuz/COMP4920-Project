You have to walk everywhere, and it is incredibly slow. Most of the time you have no clue what you are looking for, who you need to talk to or where you need to go. You just have to guess and walk all around the mansion hoping you come across someone (people also change locations in the mansion occasionally so it makes it more frustrating). Camera angles change all the time and make you lose your way. One minute you see your character from the right side then from the back etc (some games make this in the right way btw). Just because you do not see where you go, I discovered a balcony after 4 hours of play, it was so ridiculously placed.\n\nMouths do not move. Like it's been made in 1998, not in 2007.\n\nDialogues are all the same. You ask the same questions literally word by word to everyone and there is no skip button. Incredibly boring.\n\nLike those are not enough, at the beginning of the Day 3 my character disappeared. Yes, it vanished from the screen. I can talk to people who are in the same place with me right now but I can't move to another place. I restarted the day, loaded from a different slot but it didn't reappear again. At the end of 8 hours of strugglling I can't even finish the game.\n\nThey did absolutely nothing to make things easier for the gamers. If you don't know how videogames work, just don't develop them.\n\nDo not buy this, it is not worth neither your money nor your time.\n\nEdit: After many trials I managed to fix the bug by chance.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499444276, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503513986, "recommendationid": "33347257", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511581", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502093204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 301, "steamid": "76561197961131873", "num_games_owned": 424}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a shame.  This game has so much going for it!\n\nFirst, the art design is brilliant.  Palm trees wave lazily in the breeze.  The art deco hotel is stylish, sprawling, and gorgeous.  Characters are distinctive without being cartoonish.  The island is huge, and despite an oversized and largely empty environment, the lush atmosphere makes wandering around a pleasure.\n\nSecond, the story is interesting and well constructed.  There are ten major characters to interact with, all well differentiated with clear motivations and relationships.  (I find that whodunits sometimes suffer from \"list of names syndrome\", where it's hard to remember who everybody is.  Not here.)  The immediate interpretation of events becomes less clear as new evidence emerges.  Everyone has sensible things to say when asked about their perspectives ... but who is lying?\n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, the detective mechanics are excellent.  Physical clues, documents, and important conversational topics are all stored in a \"thought cabinet\", and must be assembled correctly to unlock a dozen major conceptual \"puzzle pieces\" over the course of the game to solve the mystery.  I was really looking forward to this.\n\nSounds great, right?\n\nSadly, the wonderful game content is trapped behind the absolute worst example of old school point and click design possible.  Gathering clues and even navigating the environment requires bottom of the barrel \"pixel hunting\" with [i]no visual cues[/i].\n\nLet me say that again.  You are expected to click on things [i]you cannot see[/i].\n\nPaths to other areas exist where no path is visually evident.  Some doors only exist off-camera, requiring nonsensical clicks for the main character to see what is in front of his face.  Vital clues are hidden under blank patches of sand.  You are required to comb your mouse cursor over every millimeter of screen space over dozens of empty rooms.  On top of this, interactive areas are maddeningly small.  Even areas I thought I checked turned out to have tiny pixels I missed by not zeroing in closely enough on a space with absolutely no visual interest.  It took a walkthrough to find three or four of these literally invisible hotspots before I decided there was no longer any point in trying.\n\nHorribly, all it would take to make this game near-perfect would be a hotkey to highlight interactive spots, as many adventure games have nowadays.  Even adding in lots of \"nothing here\" red herring spots would be fine, as long as the things actually there were evident in any way.  Countless hours of meaningless mouse cursor combing could be done away with; clues and portals would be findable and the player could get back to the business of making [i]sense[/i] of the intriguing mystery surrounding a tyrant's death.  Instead, the challenge is an excruciating test of patience in finding the game at all.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502481532, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505254083, "recommendationid": "34175820", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509500", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 30, "total_reviews": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 14}}
