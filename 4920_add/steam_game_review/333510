The gameplay may need a few hours to be fully able to play with all the abilities to control perfectly your character. The game is very progressive in the beginning to let you accustom yourself to the dash/slow-time/barrier making but to truly use them all and switching at the right time between each to get the best of the different cooldowns you'll need a bit more time !\n\nIt's a easy to play/hard to master gameplay and it'll allow you to keep improving yourself and elaborate new techniques even after lots of hours.\n\nThat's the gameplay but how is the game ?\nBoss fight, boss fight, boss fight !\n18 bosses, 3 difficulties and even 3 challenges to boost your score when you've mastered a boss.\nYou can fight bosses you've beaten a long time before but in a harder difficulty or add one or two challenges to change your mind from a boss you can't beat.\nEach boss is very unique and you'll have to thoroughly analyze its patterns to find the best way to counterattack by using your powers. At this time, there are still one or two patterns that I can't really understand and where I'm almost always hit.\n\nIf you like platformer gameplay, hard but highly rewarding games, fights for survival or playing until you get the top score, this is perfect for you !", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432745412, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432745578, "recommendationid": "16027668", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507549", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505444371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 283, "steamid": "76561197988745013", "num_games_owned": 606}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "review": "On a list of things I didn't know I wanted, Isbarah would no doubt be at the top. I love bullet hell games that require you to focus and memorize patterns, and this takes that idea and completely reimagines it. Everything about the game feels polished, and all of the visuals look crisp, clean, and sharp. In the spirit of bullet hell games it keeps you constantly in the action, with only brief periods of downtime between fights for a comicbook-styled storyline. As far as the flow of the game, it feels very much like Touhou. Most of your game time is spent in a fight, and in the event of a game over it only takes a few seconds to be right back into it.\n\nThe game has really tight and responsive controls. I've yet to have an issue with them, or a single instance of the controls being the cause of a death. On top of the normal dodging mechanics you'd expect from a game like this you are also given three abilities. The ability dash, which quickly sends you in a a straight line for a short distance. The ability to create a platform, which halts incoming bullets for its duration and can also be stood on. Lastly, the ability to slow time, which slows yourself and all bullets, which is useful for dashing through really tight spots, or placing a platform in the perfect position. Even with these at your disposal each fight still presents an impressive, yet fair, challenge. \n\nThe only thing that has been a downside to me with this game is that the railguns sometimes have a habit of floating away from you into nigh impossible to follow places. Not always a problem, and even when it is it usually just requires patience, but can be a little annoying when you have one left to activate and it just seems to flee to the most inconvenient spot it can. Again though, even when that happens it's still a matter of just playing it right and knowing where to go. Beating a stage is very satisfying, and clearing a spell without taking a hit even moreso. I very much recommend the game to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary, as well as anyone looking for a good challenge that doesn't feel cheap or unfair.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425936833, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425936833, "recommendationid": "14813986", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509071", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449280395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 945, "steamid": "76561197979449037", "num_games_owned": 154}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[b]What a unique game, Isbarah is certainly a fantastic piece of work.[/b]\n\n* A very important aspect of Isbarah is the difficulty. It's tough. Tough that there are achievements that mock you for dying multiple times in a row to the same boss. The difficulty is a lot like Dark Souls where you may need to face a boss multiple times to learn its move sets before beating it, so you will die a lot. But it's a very enjoyable difficulty, you will want to keep trying until you win!\n\n* The core mechanics in this game are really neat. You have the ability to slow time which will allow you to dodge projectiles more easy, you can dash to maneuver around the stages and you can create platforms or walls to stand on and or block most projectiles with. You will need manage your resources for each of these tools well to be able to beat a stage.\n\n* The games graphic style is really nice to look at. Between each stage the story is told in a comic strip style, and the backgrounds to all of the stages are well animated and detailed.\n\n* The story is fairly decent, though a few parts of the dialogue in the game caused me to cringe because it was so corny, and the pacing sometimes felt a little odd as well; Such as teleporting to a new area in one frame because 'something' happened.\n\n* The music in the game is very good. It really fits the style of the game and makes you feel like you are in an epic battle.\n\n\nOverall this game is extremely fun, and I seriously recommend it to anyone who loves the Bullet Hell / Shoot 'Em Up genre. Plus the price is very resonable for the amount of detail and work that was put into this game.\n\n[b]Good luck and I hope you enjoy the game if you pick it up![/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424896105, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1475737329, "recommendationid": "14652179", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506632", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485092352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1408, "steamid": "76561198029894536", "num_games_owned": 155}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I wish this game was more widely known.

The music in this game is just awesome. Simply awesome. While the game itself is already at a high pace, the music will make the game even more intense. Jumping around, dashing, while amazing guitar solos play in the background, what could be better!?\n+ Mechanics and controlls. I was confused at first... mouse and keyboards for a platformer!? But it all makes sense. The dashing click and drag mechanic is something I have basically never seen in a 'platformer'. It's just amazing how well it works. Together with the time slowing mechanics, the dash possibly allows some EPIC plays! Apart from that, the controlls are simple, easy to learn, easy to change and make sense.\n+ Bosses. Unique bosses with unique abilties makes you spend a lot of time trying to figure each one out. Learn the patterns, get used to how to dodge those. Some of those could take hours! (For example, 3rd enrage Walter on 7th Hell is pretty hard!).\n+ Graphics. Not much to say; I merely like the graphics. They're simple, yet effective. The way the bullets are drawn makes this game look like a real bullet hell.\n+ Gametime. I personally played this game for about 12 hours as I write the review. I started on 7th Hell and got stuck at Walter, continued on Hard. When I reached Bolgur I decided to try Walter some more on 7th hell. I eventually killed him! However, to make my point. I've already had 12 hours of gametime and I only killed 6 bosses on Hard and 4 on 7th Hell. 21 Bosses or so I heard, so lots of gametime left!\n+ Normal difficulty. Played 2 bosses on this mode, for me it's been insanely easy (even though I heard even normal gets harder later on), but I can imagine some people new to platforming will find this challenging. I believe this normal difficulty is perfectly well made for the less-experienced platformers.\n\n- I found one glitch so far; when you alt tab from windowed mode, your sound often disappears and you have to alt tab again in order to get it back.\n\nMechanics: 9/10\nMusic: 9/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nBoss Design: 10/10\n\nGAME RATING by Kep: 9.25/10.\n\nNote, I'm a variety gamer who prefers rage platformers and bullet hell games - my rating related to the actual game (not music/graphics, basically) might be biased!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424956497, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424999777, "recommendationid": "14661158", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498539", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1426218275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 338, "steamid": "76561198021006779", "num_games_owned": 148}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The joy of succesfully dodging an army's worth of bullets combined with the pleasure of fluent platforming controls.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424980446, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424980446, "recommendationid": "14666150", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502696", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436079927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 222, "steamid": "76561198028467241", "num_games_owned": 1378}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The last game I ever played with danmaku tier mechanics that isn't actually a danmaku is probably one of the Touhou spinoff games, Touhou Suimusou (Immaterial and Missing Power).
