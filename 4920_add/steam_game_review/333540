There wasn't really much of a  point to play the game over again because it only really has a one-game charm.  Not really worth $10.\n\nThe point of the game is to ruin the world.  When you win, the world is ruined and you win. When you lose, the world is ruined and, well exact same title screen.  The game mechanics are unique, but that doesn't contribute to quality gameplay.  It feels like it might make an excellent board game.\n\nBut the general theme of the video game and implementation is poor.  It's one of those games that is designed with a social conscience and you're almost certain they're more concerned about getting across their point than make the game feel fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417465651, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1419394003, "recommendationid": "13186539", "language": "english", "votes_down": 103, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667517", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1418005519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 428, "steamid": "76561198098286833", "num_games_owned": 188}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 71, "comment_count": "4", "review": "The correct name of this game should be : [h1]Corporativism[/h1]\n\n=============\n\n[b] REVIEW[/b] :\n\n[b] ABOUT THE GAME[/b]:\nIt is not like \"Plague Inc. Evolved\", where you play against the people of the world. No, here, you and the other players are competing each other to get as much money they can extract from each region.\nPlay agaisnt the IA is an easy win. [u]The fun is on multiplayer[/u], where you don't know who will vote to whom; and you can chat privately with other players to work together (temporaly, of course) or join forces to go against another player.\n\n[b] TURN ESTRUCTURE[/b]: Buy votes. With the votes bought, each player choose who will be a minister of that region; if you are elected, then you decide to build mines, or factories, or free trade agreement. If another player is elected, he/she propose, and you vote \"Yes/No\". That finish a turn.\nEven when it's unstated, the minister is not the player itself, it is \"controlled by the player\". You can have a minister in each region of the world, at same time.\n\n[b] GRAPHICS[/b]: Horrible. I know, it's a \"Turn based strategy game\" and graphics are not important. But they are really ugly. About the map \"upside-down\", you get used to it in 5 minutes.\nAbout the interface, the menus are well placed, simple, and fast to use. Rarely you have to click 2 times to make 1 thing.\n\n[b] SHOULD YOU BUY?[/b]: Depends. If you are planning to play alone, I think you are not going to get much fun, because the IA is easy to beat. If you are planning to play online, then, yes, worth it. Would be awesome to have a 4-pack or a 6-pack, to invite friends and family.\n\n\n=============\n\n[b] ABOUT THE CONCEPT[/b]: Technically speaking, I should not call it \"neocolonialism\", because here you are buying votes on poor countries, and then make them grow up, creating factories and mines (you can destroy them too). When you cashout, the countries keep all the things you created.\nHere, the poor countries are not working for a bigger one (like \"colonies\"). Here, there is no debt, nor loans. So, more than a banker, you are a powerful (and corrupted) business magnate, with enough power to buy votes, control the IMF and propose free trade agreements.\n\nSo, you may find the name misleading; but don't care, the game shows a very bad side effect of the current system, where people with enough money may get corrupted and decide over what happens in the world, buy politicians, and force the countries to take decisions that are only good for this person business. Even agaisnt the people benefit.\n\nLike I said, I consider it a \"Corporativism\" simulator.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417642197, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1417676276, "recommendationid": "13218012", "language": "english", "votes_down": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566029", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484332797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 75, "steamid": "76561198000715622", "num_games_owned": 828}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Honestly, I'm the most fervent anti-capitalist you're likely to find, but this game had absolutely no substance. I like the concept but the execution leaves everything to be desired. The game is slow, boring, and feels quite arbitrary, the branding suggests that it is an exercise in 'ruining the world' but there is no representation of this whatsoever, there is no conception of the environment, the workers, or anything, only text at the end of the game that says 'the world has been ruined'. The only goal is buy enough votes to get elected, then try to build a mine or factory before you 'bank' your votes. Playing with the AI is unsatisfactory since they can make deals with each other to get elected which you can't do and must control the majority of votes, and the round progression is especially awful, with the game taking about a second to go through each player buying votes one at a time - if everyone is out of money but one AI which wants to buy up a developing region, you may have to cycle through all 6 (max) players one at a time, with you having to say each time that you want to pass, up to 8 or 9 times for no reason, wasting about a minute.
