If you want to play a fan made prequel to this, play Vol 0. However, I recommend playing this one before Vol 0.\n\nThis is a visual novel and not a game so don't expect to have any interactive options in the visual novel. The game can be funny at times, and sad at others. In my opinion, it is a great mix between happy scenes, sad scenes, and funny scenes.\n\nGeneral Story plot in the novel:\n[spoiler]  The game first starts with you moving to another town and opening a bakery called La Soleil. Then Chocola and Vanilla were hiding in a box, and you unbox them.   [/spoiler] [spoiler] Then you let them help you.    [/spoiler] [spoiler] Then you have multiple adventures with them   [/spoiler] [spoiler] then you have sex with them. (sex scenes not shown   [/spoiler] [spoiler] At the end every catgirl (maple, cinnamon, vanilla,\n chocola, coconut, and azuki) help you with your bakery.[/spoiler]\n\nThere isn't anything too sexual except for the [spoiler] showering with vanilla and chocolate part [/spoiler] and [spoiler] you sleeping with chocola and vanilla. [/spoiler] Sex scenes are not shown in the steam version.\n\nIt's a great story if you're into it. I'd recommend it you like visual novels.\n\nIn general\n\nI recommend it\n\n\n[spoiler]  I'd pick vanilla as my waifu [/spoiler]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506116014, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506116346, "recommendationid": "35138168", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507093649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 59, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 361, "steamid": "76561198217354001", "num_games_owned": 114}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2593\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2584\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2590\u2588\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591NICE\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2588\u258c \u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591GAMEPLAY\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u258c \u2591\u2591\u2590\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2592\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u258c \u2591\u2591\u2590\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2590\u2592\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u258c \u2591\u2591\u2590\u2590\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2590\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u258c \u2591\u2591\u2590\u2590\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2590\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2591\u258c\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2590\u2591\u2580\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2580\u2592\u2580\u2584\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2584\u2580\u258c\u2591\u258c\u2591", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506120337, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506120337, "recommendationid": "35139296", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502015", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505510142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 311, "steamid": "76561198115883811", "num_games_owned": 61}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "disgusting, but i have nothing better to do sooooooooooooooooo.......\n\ni recommend it if you wanna feel bad about yourself.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505502198, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505502198, "recommendationid": "34979054", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3872, "total_reviews": 4093, "num_reviews": 13, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 221}}
