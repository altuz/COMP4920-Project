Because Caves of Qud is the most complicate game to rate i've ever seen.[/h1]\n\n\nThat's why I will be straightforward.\n\n[u]Why would you buy Caves of Qud ?[/u]\n\nIf you want to try the hardest  rogue-like rpg up to date  with minimalistic graphics and rich story then you can buy this game.\n\nOtherwise forget it.\n\nBecause you can have a lot of fun and really rewarding moments as you can become so frustrated and angry to smash your keyboard (wich is actually the only controler).\n\n\n[h1]If you still want to buy this game: Few things you must know before playing.[/h1]\n\n[u]The Game Developpement/ Community:[/u]\n\nCaves of Qud is in early access. Supported by a great dev team (these guys are awesome ! ).\nThe minimalistic render of the game permits amazing possibilities regularly updated by new stories, content and bug fixes (Sorry you won't fall in love for a wood sign again ). Caves of Qud is one of the most promising early access around. Most of the ones who played it have barely scratched it's surface ! Also the developpement logs are some of the funniest i've ever read.\n\nIf you enter this world you will find  a friendly community. Forums are  full of nice and helpfull people. Plus there's already implemented Steam Workshop to add new stories, items, character presets or skills. \n\n[u]Overall difficulty and Survival tips:[/u]\n\nCaves of Qud is a brutally difficult game. Maybe the hardest i've ever played. Hours of efforts can be lots in seconds. There is no space for errors and lack of planning.\n\nEspecially when you build your character. Don't trust reviews talking about weird stuff with character creation.\nOf course you can do amazing things in this game. But taking risks leads to a game over and nothing else.\nNo exp for your highscores. No unlockables after death. Just lessons, regrets and your tears...\n\nYou can save your starting character sheet and also the world seed: wich is one of the most important feature regarding difficulty. Everything is random except tilesets if you save your world seed. It makes adventures way more manageable for your successives tries. So keep that in mind !\n\nSurviving requires you to gather food and water. Depending of your character you might have different habits to fullfill your needs. Also be ware water is a currency and can overload you. It makes trading a bit tedious because you must trade water for items with the same trading price but lightweight.\nTo set a base in a village is a good thing, you can lift chests and drop them anywhere. If you store items inside nobody will steal them.\n\nRemember to always have a backup plan when you create a character. By plan I mean: a way to escape fights !\nBecause almost everything is random you fall rather often on huge packs or a really vicious enemies just around a corner, down some stairs or in the wilderness on the border of  a new tile.\nThat's why you must be able to set up a decent escape plan for every situations.\nRun, jump, lay mines, throw grenades, freeze with your hands, stun with your cudgel or just teleport yourself and run away ! (teleportation is my favourite skill in Caves of Qud. Nothing can beat this).\n\nYou can inspect the world around you. Helps you to know  your enemies , there's a cybernetic augment that give you detailed informations about your target. If it's tough or impossible and angry .... Run ! !\n\n\nNote that you need to light your environment or get the appropriate skill to see whenever the conditions. Temperature matters, check your body temperature or when it's too late pour something on you !\n\nDoing regular faction checks and inspecting new people helps to prevent bad surprises. \n\n\nAnd take your time, you might survive longer....\n\n\n[u]Character creation:[/u]\n\nEven if the possibilities are almost limitless when you create your character you have to choose between Mutated humans and True Kins.\n\nMutants can tailor their skills by adding new limbs/organs or spychic powers (teleportation and some other cool stuff). One of the starting mutations is really interresting: you can be versatile, choose an unstable genome and get amazing results or focus on one type and exclude the other (Physical or Mind mutations). You can also select a Caste that gives skills/bonuses/equipements and serves as your background.\n\nTrue Kins could be seen as fresh \"Fallout\" Vault Dwellers.\nStronger starting attributes and unable to get mutations. They get more skill points every level and have access to cybernetics: the weaker cousin of mutations, at least for the moment.\nYou can also choose castes and they get slightly better starting equipement (wich is sometimes really unfair compared to mutants).\n\n\nYour equipement is really important no matter what character you create. Try to spend enough Ego points so you will sell your loot at decent prices. No other attribute can affect bartering.\n\n\nTake time to understand how attributes and skills works. If you fail to stick to one character type you won't be able to reach your full potential. Saving and practicing a character in the first tries is a good thing... especially True Kins, they are easier to handle when you start.\n\n\n[u]Progression:[/u]\n\nCaves of Qud is very grindy. You will often kills tons of enemies to reach a decent level and skills/mutations sets.\nBe ware quests are extremely hard, you must explore the world first and get some gear and experience to be able to finish them.\n\nThe deeper you explore, the more you venture to the East... the more dangerous it will be.\n\nTinkering is the only crafting skill available in the game. A bit of a problem sometimes because related to intelligence and gives access to tons of receipes unavailable to other builds without itl. Especially restorative injectors and grenades. You can buy them if you find some appropriate traders but crafting is still the best way to survive longer.\nAlso Tinkering enable to lay mines (in fact to put grenades on the ground), wich is really helpfull when you want to flee ! \n\n\n\n[h1]The word of the end[/h1]\n\nCaves of Qud is a unique game. Not for everyone that's for sure.\n\nDetailed on many aspects and extremely deep. The pleasure of discovering new characters, locations and even new ways to survive is a delight.\nHowever loosing a character that fast and forever is really annoying especially after so many hours spent on trying to get the best of every situations.\n\nThat's why I'm still mixed and turned my review into a small guide to prevent you most of the frustrating moments when you start.\nKeep your time to learn how to survive in this world otherwise you will miss everything about this game.\n\n\"Life and Drink\" my friend\n\nN.B: Don't forget to save your characters builds and copy and paste in a folder your World seeds.

Enemies, locations, events, and even lore is randomly generated with each unique character you create. While it sounds chaotic, Caves of Qud has seemlessly integrated this massive RNG table with both the gameplay and the plot, and you really won't mind dying a couple dozen times (my experience) and restarting before finding a strategy or character build to overcome an obstacle.\n\nThat's right - this game is BRUTAL. Food is scarce, water is currency, diseases are deadly and hard to cure, and powerful enemies can appear in the most unassuming of locations (thank you RNG). Ready or not, Caves of Qud never holds your hand and throws you right into an epic, dangerous world to explore at your own pace.\n\nMy current character, a mutant gunslinger, lost both his arm and his prized Legendary Borderlands Revolver in a viscious fight with a sneaky madpole. Fortunately, the toxic spores which infect his remaining arm combined with a potent, corrosive gas of his own mutation provide a formidable defense to combat the remaining unseen threats that lurk in the swamps and mountains around Joppa. Nicknamed the Poison King, he slaughters his way through ruins, feasts upon the still-warm bodies of his victims, and lusts after the power needed to restore his lost appendage and full strength.\n\nCaves of Qud offers a unique world containing both magic (mutations) and science (augmentations). Whether you prefer fantasy or cyberpunk, the game can provide either one or both to suit your preferences.

Lots of stats and things to keep track of, so I opted for a premade character that was offered as part of a weekly challenge. I got a mutant Arconaut with a genetic defect that makes me teleport randomly. Sometimes this has led to my death, but I turned off permadeath so I'm honestly enjoying the strenghts and weaknesses of a random character like this. There's a lot of history to find out about, just looking at an engraved weapon gave me a quest to visit a holy place, and depth like that really sucks me in. Given the low-res overhead view of things, I find it weirdly immersive because so much of my imagination is employed in the process of playing. I would definitely like a bit of an introduction to things, since I had to look stuff up just to make sense of how some things worked. I also wish there was a place I could settle down to call my own so I could store things. All in all, this is a fun game, but it's certainly difficult until you learn by playing a lot or just look up a quick guide. I'm not terribly fond of how so many things want to kill you, and I'm not sure how to improve my relationship with some creatures, but there's probably info somewhere for that.\n\nFun story about the game below ***************************************************************************************\n\nOne second you're exploring a legendary Glowfish lair, the next, you're entering a space time portal, trapped in unknown caves for days with seemingly no way out, the hopelessness mounting with each arrow or shot gun shell expended in a desperate bid for survival. Then, it lessens as you bite into the corpse of a giant centipede, knowing you have bought yourself a few more hours, another chance at escape. Then, one day, after you've nearly accepted your new life underground, you hear something and find a Dromad caravan wandering the caves, and upon investigating, you see a space time portal as Dromad merchants fight off creatures in the dark. I knew I should stay and fight with them, but the thought of seeing daylight once more was too much... I abandoned the merchants, and found myself in the wilderness above, and eventually home... but perhaps at the cost of many lives whom I had yet to learn of or trade with. \n10/10 would recklessly enter strange portals again.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505706941, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505706941, "recommendationid": "35038357", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507157533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 182, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 634, "steamid": "76561197970372066", "num_games_owned": 175}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is my favorite roguelike hands down.
