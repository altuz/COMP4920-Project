Not a good introduction to the tower defense genre, but as a veteran I find that it is enjoyable. The difficulty from map to map varies significantly, and because of the co-op option I highly recommend you buy a friend a copy at the same time. The GUI has been criticized a great deal, but I don't have a problem with it. Be sure to watch the tutorials in their entirety, it is worth the wait.

I have been playing it on and off for years. I find it very addictive once I start. If you like Tower Defense then it's worth a try at this price. I know this has some bad reviews but I enjoy it, and like the level design. Some levels really challenge you. It's standard TD with upgrades for towers etc. The graphics are not great but then I can't think of any TD games that have mind blowing graphics.
