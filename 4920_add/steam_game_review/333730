Games like this are all about collecting loot, building unique characters, strategy and tactics. The 8.99 price tag was a little steep, but I knew based on how much fun I had with the Monsters' Den games that it would be worth it. This game has no loot, no strategy, no tactics, no dimensions, no plot, and no fun. I could have made a better game and I don't know how to code. This is possibly the largest waste of money I've ever spent in my whole life and I would really like it back. :(", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422311874, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422311874, "recommendationid": "14184040", "language": "english", "votes_down": 33, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552084", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489322522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561198022949988", "num_games_owned": 535}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "However the game itself, im not sure about. Every so often i try it again, and i just cant get beyond playing it for 20 minutes. I like board games and play new ones often. So i understand the concept of virtualizing one is just downright awesome. However i have never played the old board games this is based off of. Too young i guess, was born in 87. So in my review be aware that i have never played citedel of blood or the others.\n\nI like the concept of searching through unknown areas. What i find dreadful is fighting enemies. It feels like press enter to win kind of thing. Maybe i just dont like it? I feel like it is an attempt at final fantasy. I think if it was aiming at being a board game style, it should of had dice, etc. \n\nI think it would be awesome if the dev updated the game with new content. \n\ni have to upvote this because its made in python/pygame. :) Its not everyday you see a steam game made in Python language.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489323360, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489323360, "recommendationid": "30469907", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497815", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472349155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 190, "steamid": "76561198110843706", "num_games_owned": 173}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "i was surprised, when they did not review, this game, for what, it, is, worth, again", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1472254032, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1472254032, "recommendationid": "25171101", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484456", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423097665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 547, "steamid": "76561198143142509", "num_games_owned": 598}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very nice little game :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422738951, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422738951, "recommendationid": "14267250", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485472", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1422620040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 26, "steamid": "76561198031153600", "num_games_owned": 18}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is hardly a game at all.
