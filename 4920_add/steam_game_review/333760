The basic premise of the game is that you've been hired by a gentleman who calls himself The Connoisseur who tasks you with defending his family's precious wine from a vicious gang called the \"Skull Faction\". As you venture into his wine cellar, however, it's clear that there's other supernatural forces at play. \n\nThe game is often compared to other top down shooters like [i]Nuclear Throne[/i]. Although both games share the same basic elements, they are quite different. Vlambeer's [i]Throne[/i] has a faster, more arcade-like feel to its gameplay, while [i]Vintage Year[/i] relies on stealthy tactics and careful planning. At the beginning of every level, you're given an opportunity to scout out the layout of the room. This gives the player a chance to strategize the best way to tackle all of the enemies on the floor; you must eliminate all of the Skull Faction before continuing. Levels are also shrouded in darkness, making it difficult to peer ahead to keep track of enemy movements. To counter this, you're given a limited amount of torches to place, adding more of a strategical aspect to the gameplay. \n\nFor its $5 price, [i]Vintage Year[/i] offers a good amount of replay value. There's up to 16 different playable characters that you can unlock, each with their own unique perks. After every two completed levels, players have the chance to gain more perks, helping them continue through ever-increasingly difficult dungeons. Enemies, Mini-Bosses, and Bosses get progressively harder to overcome, making this game a suitable challenge for fans of roguelites and action games. There's a lot of the game that the dev has kept secret, leaving the player to discover the strange inner workings by themselves. Additionally, players can also unlock an alternate game mode, cosmetic hats (!!!), and mod their own characters into the game. \n\nStill, the game isn't perfect. The controls aren't remappable, and at times, movement doesn't feel as smooth as it should. Some parts are a little buggy, such as sometimes getting stuck inside walls and strange spike trap hitboxes. Graphically, the pixel sprites lack the creativity and charm that [i]Nuclear Throne[/i] manages to capture, but the developer, Nooner Bear, makes up for it with a chilling atmosphere that keeps the player on their toes. He's still adding bugfixes and patches to the game, so it can only get better from here.\n\n[i]Vintage Year[/i] is a solid game that delivers a lot in a small package. It offers a good amount of replayability through procedurally generated levels, challenging gameplay, and many player unlocks. It definitely shines most as a quick game to take breaks with since you can go on quick runs to try and beat your high scores. This game is a great stepping stone into shooter roguelites and is definitely worth the asking price. You should definitely consider picking this up, considering the $2.99 vs. $12.99 [i]Nuclear Throne[/i] asks for. However, both games have their own merits. Even if you own Vlambeer's popular product, this is a good investment for a different experience. If you like games that are easy to pick up and play but are difficult to beat, this indie gem is a good addition to your gaming collection.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: For fans of [i]Nuclear Throne[/i], [i]Teleglitch[/i], [i]Cavern Kings[/i], and other shooter roguelikes.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425287361, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498895708, "recommendationid": "14721909", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512058", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423624666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 28, "steamid": "76561198013372350", "num_games_owned": 454}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Relatively simple, but well-made and quite fun.

Vintage Year embraces the old-school roguelike style of giving the player very little information and forcing them to figure it out. It mostly works, with the gameplay being simple enough that you can learn just by fooling around, and the fast-paced live-die-repeat gameplay helps this. \n\nYou never feel like you lose much progress by making a blind choice, but sometimes the very minimal UI can be frustrating if you already know how things work, you just can't remember which item is which. Some players will find the experimentation-driven learning very rewarding, but some may find it simply frustrating.\n\nThe gameplay is rather polished, but one major area shows weakness: enemy pathfinding. Levels are randomly generated and mazelike, and the enemies have an extremely hard time navigating if there is a hard wall between them and you. And this isn't something that comes up every once in a while; enemies literally do not know how to move around a wall to line up a shot. In some ways this works to the game's benefit; if the AI could navigate better then the already hard game would be even harder, but to see the AI fail so regularly is amateurish. \n\nVintage Year is rather difficult, since you have very limited health and it is only replenished by (very rarely) randomly found health pick-ups. Using all the tools the game provides you is vital, as is caution. Stumbling into a room without a very good idea of what's all in it can be deadly. While unforgiving, the difficulty feels fair, though one sometimes wishes for some kind of non-random healing.\n\nThe biggest failing is in the UI. It seems designed for a controller, but the gameplay requires precision I wouldn't trust to a controller. Frankly, if you're making a PC game, main menus that can't be navigated purely through the mouse are an unforgivable sin. And furthermore, the game is inconsistent: sometimes WASD can be used to navigate menus, sometimes the arrow keys need to be used. Sometimes things are selected with the mouse, sometimes with E, and sometimes, bafflingly, with the enter key.\n\nFinally, the progression system is very minimal, only giving unlockable characters and cosmetic items for characters. This isn't a terrible flaw, but its implentation feels more like an ingame-currency DLC store than a true progression system, in that the things you unlock may not help you get further in the game at all, and are simply alternate options to enhance replayability.\n\nOverall, the biggest factor in my recommendation is the price. At 10 dollars I would not recommend this game, when you could get Hotline Miami for the same. But at $5.49 it's worth a look if you like roguelikes or overhead shooters. I don't know how much more I'll really play this thing, but I've definitely gotten $5.49 worth of fun out of it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429898225, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429898225, "recommendationid": "15521808", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504910", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1420239255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198021846379", "num_games_owned": 67}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is absolutely great for the price!
