This game unlike the original Bravelands requires you to go through dungeons which continously generate the same fights and you get very low gold per each victory - mainly between 20 to 30, whilst a unit costs 100 or so... now imagine trying to get an army of 20 units.. Too repetitive and boring. Get the original Bravelands, it's a great game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494681010, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494681010, "recommendationid": "31723779", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493816215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 886, "steamid": "76561198221077972", "num_games_owned": 117}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The basic gameplay is solid. Not spectacular but fun and entertaining.\n\nYou assemble a couple of different troups, each with an unlockable special ability on top of their basic fighting capabilities. Then there is equipment for your main character which boosts the strength of your army and finally the magic skills of said main character with which you can help turn the tide of battle. The fighting is turn based.\nSo you navigate the world map and fight battles occasionally discovering a new troop type to recruit or another piece of equipment and you could be having a good time.\nSadly the developers felt the need to pad the game time with a huge amount of grinding. You want to recruit two more archers so you have the (at this time) maximum amount of 10/10 archers in your army? Well, off to the repeatable cave fight and do it 6-10 times in a row before you have the required gold.\n\nOn normal difficulty this is annoying. On hard it made me hate the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493370067, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493381415, "recommendationid": "31411789", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 30, "total_reviews": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 15}}
