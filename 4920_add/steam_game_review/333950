While space engineers was a game I was farmiliar with; this not so much. I had the gyst of it; doing a similar thing to SE but with far less advanced technology.\n\nIf you've played Space Engineers, you should know what to expect from that. If you haven't played SE, then imagine minecraft with much higher graphics, physics and far fewer things to do.\n\nThe inventory and crafting systems are somewhat cumbersome. In SE, they're berable, but in this game, crafting takes a small amount of time, and inventories are restrictively small. Survival might be fun with friends; if you could break off into seprate jobs, divide up the work and specialize, you could probably build something in a decent amount of time. But I haven't had the chance to try it. (Also there's a tech progression system that will consume a lot of valueble items (namely iron ingots which can be annoying to get in large quantities without a pickaxe which you dont unlock until later on)) to advance, but you're pushed to advance the tree as quickly as possible.\n\nI tried creative mode. There aren't a lot of blocks to build with. Aside from Stone castle parts and wooden house parts; along with a few odds and ends theres very little variety. Some blocks seem to be missing. (I couldn't get a reversed wooden angled wall to build the roof of my house in my surival world) So all your builds will look somewhat the same. I'd really like the ability to color builds; whitewash castles, etc.\n\nI'd also like to see more varied terrain. Though the plains, mountians and forests are pretty, that's about all you'll see.\n\nAbout the only things I like in this game are the woodcutting mechanics (I don't know why, but cutting trees in this game is just... fun. At one point, I cut down a tree, and it fell into another tree knocking the top off of it. I got a little extra wood for my effort. If the whole game were full of moments like this, I'd thumbs up no problem.) And the fact that you can build large grid blocks along with small grid details. (Something that Space Engineers does not allow)\n\nThere are only two types of randomly spawned NPCs ATM. Barbarians are dumb (I've only seen two) and you can beat them by standing on a wooden platform elevated a few inches off the ground. It's like their kryptonite; there's nothing they can do but glower at you from below a ledge they could easily step up while you leisurely craft a weapon. (The crossbow wont kill them easily, use the sword.) And the Deer, which apparently has psychic powers because it runs away when you get close, even if you sneak up to it or hide behind cover, and also takes two shots to kill no matter where you shoot it. A singleplayer world feels dead.\n\nUnlike my initial venture into Space Engineers, I encountered almost no bugs with this game. A few of my crafting stations became invisible when I reloaded a world but by picking them up and moving them I was able to get them to reappear.\n\nAs of writing this, The developers are actively adding new items, making optimizations and fixing bugs. If you're reading this review in 2018+, disregard it. Given what I expect, or hope this game will be a few years down the line, But for now, its not worth 20 bucks. If you're really into building and survival games, get it while its on sale. If you're not sure, try Space Engineers first. It's similar in a lot of ways, right down to the controls, but IMO easier to pick up and feels like more of a complete game; where building stuff is easier and you have a lot more creative freedom.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506822621, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506822621, "recommendationid": "35360271", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499997", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507148181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3371, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7755, "steamid": "76561197998167151", "num_games_owned": 298}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Medieval Engineers has improved alot since it was first released, I thought like many others it would just be a small side project that would not see the development that was put into space engineers.

The buildings also look amazing and very realistic compared to anything else out there.

Barbarians are buggy and annoying so I already disabled them, now the world is safe but somewhat boring.  Dungeones would be awesome but considering they have bigger fish to fry(or bugs to squash), I don't see that happening anytime soon. \n\nWhat I would love more than anything is a skill gain system like Wurm or Ultima Online (but much faster).
