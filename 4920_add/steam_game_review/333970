He's taken all the feedback we've given and in a short month, been able to add multiple features such as a tournament settings mode, a live mutliplayer mode (not async-only anymore), live chat, campaign changes etc. There's more in the patch. Very surprised at the level of dedication and involvement from the developer. Check out the game!\n\nInteresting tactical game. The gameplay mechanics and unit classes are very fun. There is a singleplayer campaign, but I bought it mainly for the multiplayer, because there are several game modes (1v1, 3-player 1v1v1 and even 4-players versus each other, with 20+ maps). Downside is that it is asynchronous unless your opponents are present and playing automatically. Developer has shown interest in improving and making quicker games, hope they add a live game mode option (or shorter time-to-take-turn). Nice little game to pass time. I would reccommend if: 1) you dont mind asynchronous game, 2) you enjoy and support tactical turn-based games. I mainly bought it bc I support this genre and these turn-based pvp games come too few and far between.\n\nWith that said, I am not sure how big the multiplayer base will be, and it is a one-man-developer team so there are some inevitable limitations that come with that. There are several updates planned to be released, so definitely a game to look out for. If you're buying for multiplayer, I'd recommend waiting to see how the MP updates turn out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428338793, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430523910, "recommendationid": "15237877", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526454", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430677056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 910, "steamid": "76561197979435763", "num_games_owned": 206}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": "1", "review": "If you're looking for a fun little game, this isn't bad. If you're looking for a strategy game, it still needs quite a bit of improvement. Every multiplayer map suffers from severe First Move Advantage, and One on One is the way I wanted to play a strategy game like this (since I found it reminiscent of chess), but this game is currently not designed for that.\n\nSingle Player is just an excercise in manipulating the enemy AI to fight each other and not you. Not too much different than most other single player strategy game ecperiences, but it includes \"False Path\" maps that are really frustrating and can add hours onto your play time by forcing you to replay levels you already beat.\n\nLevels are small and there's no expandability or map maker.\n\nFor $10 I can't really recommend it at this point in time.

All the combat is one-hit kills so it's all strategy- no luck involved. Your task is to secure every enemy-held tile on the board. Each tile acquisition increases your mana which is used to spawn more units or use special abilities to increase movement/attack range and create or destroy tiles and obstacles. There are only 4 different classes so the options are limited to that but there is enough there to have very fun and tactical games. \n\nThere are a few things to be aware of, though. First, there is only campaign and multiplayer at this point. The devs have mentioned an interest in adding a versus AI mode but it isn't there yet. The multiplayer could also be improved. As of now, unless you are playing with a friend, you will likely be playing games 1 turn per day at a time, similar to the old PBeM games. This is great to have as a feature, but as of now it is the only option. There is no chat or lobby to see if anyone is active. There IS local hotseat multiplayer though, up to 4 players, so that's nice.\n\nAll in all, I do recommend especially if you are a fan of the genre. The devs are very friendly and seem sincere in wanting to improve the game if they have the resources to do it. As it stands the campaign is very engaging and I look forward to playing multiplayer with friends.   9/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425056931, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425056931, "recommendationid": "14677833", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507572", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466878927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 86, "steamid": "76561197993770690", "num_games_owned": 393}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game itself is a very fun and simple strategy concept with quick rounds and decent amounts of depth considering the easy rules.

I bought the 2 pack to play with a friend, and in the duration of one ~half hour session, we experienced the following:\n- Whether we were able to join each other seemed like a complete dice roll; we just had to keep making new games until one finally became visible in the games list. There's no invitation system.\n- Upon joining me one time, friend's game did not load the board or characters and they had to quit.\n- Said game then became invisible forever, despite both of us attempting restarts/rejoins.\n- Seemingly random server disconnects that cause your turn to be reset to the beginning.\n- Friend's \"end turn\" button completely broke; when pressed, nothing happened on my end, it only affected fairies on their end.\n\nIn addition, you also have to sign up for an account JUST for this game and use their friends list system on their website if you want to play online. The online interface in general is terrible as well; there's not even any way to see who you're playing against while you're ingame, and there's no local chat (only global).\n\nNote that this was with cross-platform Windows/Linux play. I don't know if that makes it more likely to break, but broken is broken.\n\nAgain, the core game is fine.

Despite what some sources may lead you to believe, there is an element of RNG: fairies. They randomly spawn on the map and they give mana, allowing you to make more actions. I understand the logic here with adding some level of chance to make things a bit more interesting but lucky fairies early in the game lead to some very serious snowballing. My suggestion would be to delay fairies until turn 2, or maybe prevent fairies spawning next to druids during turn 1.\n\nThe other problem is to do with the limited screen resolution options (limited to 4:3), but it doesn't bother me too much.
