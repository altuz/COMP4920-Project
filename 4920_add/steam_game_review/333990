I was waiting until this came out to do my review. I quite enjoy this game. It's pretty slow paced, but I like that. It was super boring when you could only play 1 character. Developing 1 character didn't leave you with many choices or things to do, but now that I have 4, I'm choosing their skills, doing all the combat, and there's so much to be involved in now. I'd give it a 6.5/10.

I was very quickly told by the devs that there was a new update that would make replaying ththe game worth it. For the most part I can agree.  The single player update was an awesome leap in the right direction. More importantly they saw that I loved the game and went out of their way to reply to me. This game deserves some attention. It's fun for lovers of tabletop games or turn based fantasy. I admit it took a bit for me to get into it at first but I got hooked.

Its not the game that you'll go out and say \"lets play this really great game.\"  There are so many [i]other[/i] good games out there that if I want to play a game, this one will fall a ways down on my recent play list.\n\nThat's not to say its a bad game. Its not. Its just not a good game. It might be more fun if I could connect with the role playing in it a bit more. It might be more fun if I was playing with other people who thought it was also fun.\n\nBut as it is, with the interface that it has (select a minor action, move, go back up into the main play area, select a spot to move to, go back down to the action selector, select a major action, select 'next', select an action, go back up to the main area, select the target location for that action, select next, select a minor action...)... its sluggish.\n\nThe storyline is on rails (you do A then B then C) with no aspect of an openish world that one tends to expect of fantasy games today.  There are minor differences \"I've got lore! I can select this option\" that have a minor impact on the next challenge, but that still lacks a degree of agency.\n\nIf you've got a friend saying \"lets play this game together\" and they've already played some... check out a video or watch them play and then maybe get it.  If not... its really not that great of a game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502547949, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502547949, "recommendationid": "34192416", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491670", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502189351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561198068987641", "num_games_owned": 129}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "kinda boring\n\nit feels kinda slow\n\neven do like the idea", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502189431, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502207567, "recommendationid": "34100738", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468304", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 23, "total_reviews": 29, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
