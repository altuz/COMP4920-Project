Play tumblestone instead which is a better realized execution of this concept \nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/269710/Tumblestone/\n\nPopcap. Good sound and art design. Game is catchy. No Xbox360 pad support, no resolution change support. Game allows you to pick falling blocks and drop them back in the play area to match them in rows of 4+. Its very brainless, as all you do is basically collect blocks of the same color over and over again. So to compensate the game increases speed of falling blocks. Its meh and outdone by competitors"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501088111, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498609", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33812939", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005208684", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1500804520, "num_games_owned": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 46}, "timestamp_updated": 1501088111, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I actually like the core gameplay of Astropop, the problem has more to do with the fact that it has been utterly abandoned by PopCap and EA.\n\nProblem 1)  Game will not save - That's right, for a game that is based on progressive unlocks, it will not save.  Reading through support forum notes I think this may be because I am running a Windows 10 machine.  But if that's the case then it's a good reason to warn people away.\n\nProblem 2)  Game runs extremely low resolution - It doesn't support modern graphics methods, won't recognize that I have a graphics card more than capable of it's \"high end\" settings, and has no ability to change resolution for a widescreen monitor.\n\nOtherwise it's a fun brick breaking game.  I just wish it would get fixed so it's playable again."}]}
