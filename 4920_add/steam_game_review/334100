The more levels you go through, the more enemies you face. A fun and enjoyable concept this game has a few quirks that really prevent it from being a great game. \n\n[b] Pros [/b] \n- Fun Concept\n       Who doesn't want to be a ghost kicking cool person\n- Enjoyable sound (both music and SFX)\n       Although I never whipped this soundtrack out while driving I enjoyed it throughout the time of my playing\n- Old School Graphics\n       The graphics fit well for this type of game. Personally I enjoy the throwback look for simple indy games\n- Local Co-op for buddies\n       The whole reason I bought this game was to play with friend.\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n- [u] Reptitive Design [/u]\n        Yes the levels change and you move from location to location but it all feels really similiar after a while. \n- [u] Lack of story/reasons to progress[/u]\n        I don't really know why I'm in the house in the first place, why I'm killing ghosts, or what compels me to keep      moving forward other than a hate for chairs or things that copy me. \n- [u] Lack of controller support [/u]\n         When connecting an Xbox One controller through multiple means the game registers that i'm continually pressing left on the d-pad. It make it impossibe to play using it. I had to switch to my old Logitech controller to get it working. \n- [u] Lack of customer support [/u]\n         I contacted customer support twice, (about the above issue) one incident about a week ago and haven't heard back from them at all and still no reply, even to say we are looking into it. Sadly this game is wasted because without the ability to connect multiple controller the co-op awesomness is lost. \n- [u] Lack of co-op playability [/u]\n         This controller thing really breaks the game for me. Not only can I not re-map the buttons to different parts of my keyboard (no setting option), I can't even connect multiple controllers. This game would have a lot of potental if the co-op work but as a single player entry it lacks substance to keep me playing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456182196, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456182196, "recommendationid": "21395263", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512911", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478936000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 178, "steamid": "76561198127694038", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really fun game! Love the retro feel. Really seems like something you'd find in an 80s arcade.\nThe game can get a little buggy sometimes; the first time I went to \"Challenges\", it crashed. \nAlso when you finish a stage, the only options are \"Quit\" and \"Leaderboards\". Kind of shocked no one thought to put in a \"Replay Level\" option.\nI think the creators of this game are done with it but I really wish some updates happen to fix the above issues as well as put in some more awesome weapons, stages and maybe Team Challenges.\nAll in all, it's a pretty fun game.

Check out my impression in REAL TIME HD 1080p TECHNICOLORS[/url][/u]\n\nPros:\n_Looks nice: Very vibrant pixel arts, fits the tone of the game, pleasant to look at.\n_Great music: Appropriately Halloween, nothing too catchy, but pretty kickass.\n_Controls well: Nice and tight, Double jumping feels great, weapons could use a bit more oomph, but overall pretty good.\n_Interesting mechanics: You can hold and use 3 weapons at the same time! That's pretty rad. The ghosts are also interesting. They mimic your actions from the previous rounds, making them really unpredictable and eratic. The chaos they create are insane.\n_Lots to unlock: Stages, weapons and more unlock at a breakneck pace, keeping you playing just one more round.\n_Local multiplayer: Ramps up the chaos, ramps up the friendship.\n\nCons:\n_Sort of one note: You just kill ghosts and nothing else. The ghost all look the same, and do the same thing you do. So it's just a whole lot of jumping and shooting. Very interesting jumping and shooting perhaps, but it does get old and grindy after a while.\n_No online plays: Which is a shame, cuz I have no friends :(\n\nIs it worth 13 bucks? I would say so. For all of its flaws, it IS a fun game. It's hectic, arcade-y fun.
