It is minimalist and simple, bit it knows what it want to do and it does it really well. Explosion are everywhere and score go high really fast. Add loads of neon colors and you have a high-octave blood pumping experience.\n\nThanks to the variety of ships and upgrades there is as lot of replay value. Also I like that the varied ennemies are color-codes so you know what to expect of them in a glance. Though, the upgrades offered at the end of waves are randomised, so it might happen that the game offers you only shitty ones, which can ruin your run.\n\nWhile not perfect, Roche Fusion has enough to offer to get you glued to your screen for hours. Try to get a friend to play co-op with too for extra amazingness!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500210038, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500210038, "recommendationid": "33584387", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501414", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 40, "total_reviews": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
