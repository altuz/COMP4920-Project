This game is that experience in a nutshell.\n\nIt definately has its flaws like inconsistant level design and an odd and almost uneeded inventory system, but they're just chips on what is on the whole a diamond. Golden Axe, Castlevania, and Gauntlet mixed with NES era difficulty. For a studio's first game, this is a good outing. As i was around in the golden days of gaming, i had several moments while playing of being transported back there. No doubt that is coloring my review a bit. Regardless, this is a fun and correctly priced game that would be right at home on the rental shelf alongside Karnov and Bayou Billy. A solid 7 out of 10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501406567, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501406995, "recommendationid": "33900557", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504789", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497141626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 192, "steamid": "76561198049246552", "num_games_owned": 105}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Read the last paragraph if you want a quick overview recomendation.\n\nI will be honest with you: This game needed more polish. WAY more polish then what it has right now.\n\nInsanity's Blade is an arcade-inspired platformer where you control Thurstan, a retired warrior that have it's village attacked by a horde of demons and it's family killed in the process leaving him as the sole survivor of the tragedy. After that Thurstan embarks in a journey to find the cause of the demonic horde while slowly giving in to the hatred of demons and mental degradation of the loss of his family.\n\nIf that summary got you interested in the game it's because at the very least it's story, while simple in premise and execution, is very well told and never stops been entertaining even if it is very thin and almost bare bones. In this case you could even say it has no fluf, only the very essencial for the plot. I have to admit, this is what saved this game for me and made me continue to play up until the end of it's story mode. While I enjoyed it, I understand many others might give this game a pass because of the next point: Gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but there's little to no variety in it, so it dulls very quickly. The mechanics aren't very well thought for what the game intends itself to be, evident by the fact that the game gives the player projectiles for a hand to hand platform brawler. Screenshots are beautiful, but the game is very poorly animated and most stuff in motion isn't really all that good and that leads into the fact most stuff that fly on screen and hits the player could be deemed as unfair. Because of the poor animations enemies also have very poorly telegraphed attacks and some enemies don't even have the required animation to convey what they actually do (most notable for weapon-throwing enemies).\n\nThurstan controls a little too abruptly for confort and really doesn't have any sort of momentum to his movement or combat. He has an attack and a grab for his offensive options and they aren't really nice to use. The attack button stops Thurstan on spot to make the attack motion and hit the enemies and the same goes for the grab with the only diference been that Thurstan flip-jump over the enemy and throws it forward. The attack has another characteristic that makes it the superior choice on almost every situation: it can be upgraded on certain shops throughout the game to have increasingly powerful projetile knives been thrown everytime you attack. This should be awesome but it gives away the fact that it was a patchwork for everything else that didn't work in the game. Enemies don't stagger or flinch when hit, some of them don't have attack animations and there is a sensation that there is no weight to anything you do or is done to you because the animations and sound effects don't convey properly what is going on.\n\nMaybe none of that is very concerning to you and you are loving the game so far, but remember what I said on the beggining summary of the game? \"Insanity's Blade is an arcade-inspired platformer...\" And that also apply to it's core design: ENEMIES EVERYWHERE AND RESPAWNING!!! That is what I consider to be what made aparent to me this game didn't really know what it wanted to be. In one hand you have a very breef but powerful story and a pair of protagonists that are really easy to simpatise due to their intermission banter. On the other you have a game wanting to be so arcade-hardcore that it passes some very outdated, clunky, poorly thought AND made design decisions as integral to the experience that it is really hard to imagine how this game even holds itself together. At least the soundtrack is nice, nothing really special, just nice.\n\nDo I recomend this game? Only if you can stomach the gameplay for long enough to enjoy the story and if you are a really BIG fan of stories, although this may be way too bare bones for you. If you are after some interesting characters, this may also be an interesting one since there is enough time to develop the characters alongside the story. Bonus points for been short (took me 3hrs to beat it). But if you are someone who value your gameplay as paramount and don't really regard story and characters as important or is one who are looking for deep and rewarding gameplay or you simply can't stand arcade design principles, you should avoid this one.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499485727, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499485727, "recommendationid": "33362276", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499850", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 80, "total_reviews": 104, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 24}}
