Funniest thing is, entire thread was deleted, funny, isn't it? Like they wanted to silence me because they don't want community to find out about ToL.\n\nPeople were mad, because they turned ToS into a mere facebook game and because of all shady stuff like ToS Card Game situation, obviously lots of people switched to ToL when it got released to Closed Alpha, this lowered ToS fanbase even more, but what our smart devs did? A DLC! Be a loser and pay even more $$$ for our trash game that only exists to milk the shit out of your pocket! They never did separate matches for Steam buyers, preventing from trolls that came when PewDiePie and Markiplier started to promote ToS, but when it comes to $$$ they quickly made separate server. Woah, technology! But that's not worst thing, most of The Coven roles are ripped off from Throne of Lies classes so you are basically paying for stolen roles.\n\nI suggest everyone to switch to Throne of Lies, better and more complex game where developers are always working hard on their game, listening to the community and the most important - They are honest.\n\nEdit #1: People are accusing me of only ranting about their way of milking the game, so here is some \"rant\" about gameplay aswell:\n\nArsonist is overpowered, why you ask, he needed a buff! Yes, he needed a buff, but making arsonist some kind of a ghost was worst possible move ever, you can't see if you are doused, you appear as Arsonist/BodyGuard/GodFather after being doused, only luck can stop that fellow. \n\nFavoring mafia in rankeds like there was not enough problems with Any appearing as Mafia or making Spy completly useless, can't hear whispers, can't hear mafia, and only sees who was visited.

They stick to superficial insults. \n\nIn Town of Salem, me and my fiancee were accused of cheating simply because I'm helping her understand the fundamentals of the game. They took it further and began using my fiancee's account name as their towny name for several games over. (The community is so small we kept being chucked in a game with the same people) They would threaten her that they'd use the account name to sign up to adult sites, to harass underaged people and to get a bunch of creepy people to add her on Steam. This is a level of harassment and stalking that should not go unpunished, so we decided to report the person. We told him we'd report and mute him and he began rallying the people playing that game to report us. He interrupted normal gameplay to focus on reporting us because I'm trying to help my fiancee understand a game.\n\nI don't normally leave a bad review on a game solely because of their community, but here's the real kicker:\n\n ..

I tried to login in my account and it says \"Your account is suspended.\" That's it, there is no reason why my account is suspended, nothing. Just the warning.\n\nWhat did I do? Besides playing the game the whole day, what did I do and my account is suspended? There is no support system, nothing. It kinda turns to GTA-V ban system in my opinion. \n\nThat's why I do not recommend. Fix your fucking support system and informations. Do not ban people randomly. Show me a proof that you are right about banning my account.\n\nBesides that ban, here are the reasons;\n\n1- Very bad GUI. You can't chat with your friends while you are in a game lobby. How hard to make this? Seriously?\n\n2- BUGS. Tons of bugs. Currently lots of people can't play ranked games. The game can not place you into a group. You join a queue, you wait 3mins, then it says \"there were unbalanced number of players blablabla\" and force you to wait 3 more mins, then you see the same message again.\n\n3- BUGS. Again bugs. Sometimes, you can't leave the lobby. So you have to restart the game. It just freeze.\n\n4- BUGS. Again, right? Yeah, again. The game just close itself without any reason. \n\n5- LAGS. I download the games like 10-12MB per second. And yet, I have chat delays sometimes in this game. This game is all about TYPING and Roleplaying. So if you have chat delay, you fuckd up. You type fast, but your messages delivered late, and then 9 people lynched you.\n\nApperantly DEVs doesn't care the bugs, they just create new skins. Because, you know; you can earn money with skins so why they should fix those bugs, right?\n\nAgain, the game is great, the idea is great, DEVs are very bad. So, I don't recommend this game. I wish someone who knows what they doing buy the whole game and develop it better.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nOynad\u0131\u011f\u0131m en g\u00fczel oyunlardan bir tanesi.
