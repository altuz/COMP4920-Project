The story is long enough to be enjoyable, and there are a lot of characters, and nice soundtracks that go well with the story.\n\nThe game has a few puzzles that you can play through and are somewhat enjoyable, you can see that a lot of work has gone into this game.  The menu interface is well done, and the background art and characters are very original and fun to interact with.\n\nGranted this is a story game more than anything else, and you will be reading and working your way through the game most of the time with choices that will lead you through more dialogue.  Some choices though only have 1 choice, so it is not really a choice......there would be no need to have that window open up.\n\nThere is no animation in the game, just a series of static image art, of 2 characters on a well painted background and reading through the story below.
