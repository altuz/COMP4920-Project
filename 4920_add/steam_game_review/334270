Let's see...\n\n[list]\n[*] The Game was clearly designed for tablets, with PCs only an afterthought. Changing the window size or attempting to run in fullscreen mode requires a restart of the entire program, and tooltips are missing from most screens.\n[*] No option for anti-aliasing. This makes the graphics look very choppy on all but the most zoomed in screens.\n[*] The tutorial gives very little help in understanding how the game is actually played. Combat is not explained at all, and no victory condition is given.\n[*] The tech tree has remarkably unimaginative names (Planetary Construction 1, 2, 3, etc., Starship Consruction 1, 2, 3, etc) and no explanation what benefit any given advance will give. (benefits such as \"Reactor 1, Reactor 2, etc [i]do[/i] technically exist, but similarly lack any significant indication of their role, and no further menu delving is possible to find out)\n[*] The \"seige\" mechanics are excruciatingly drawn out. It's impossible to even attempt to take an enemy's base until you have the appropriate tech (a feat in itself due to the obtuse tech tree issues listed above), and then requires specialized units incapable of performing any other tasks or combat maneuvers. And even once you do get the Invasion ships onto the field and attacking enemy bases, they actually regrow faster than you can cause damage, even with multiple ships at once.\n[*] Base growth is randomized, making any attempt at strategy in them useless.\n[*] All claims in the game synopsis about \"politics,\" \"espionage,\" or \"trade\" are simply false. There is a very bare-bones menu which seems to try to address this, but it takes dozens of turns to even reach a coin flip decision on whether a \"trade agreement\" will even be made, and there is no way to know what they even do.\n[*] Hidden game launch icon location. It may sound silly, but after relocating my Steam install folder, I was unable to reassign an icon to this game, (or the other two RPG games from Trese Brothers for that matter) leaving blank eyesore shortcuts on my desktop. No ther game in my Steam library had this issue.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500168097, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500168097, "recommendationid": "33574026", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 12}}
