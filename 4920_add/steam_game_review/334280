There're just a lot of things that aren't explained well, or are poorly designed--for instance, there are crew members you can pick up.  That's cool, but you can only have one at a time initially, upgrading to more is /extremely/ expensive, and a great deal of content is gated behind their abilities.  You can't even store a few different ones to tediously return to the ship for--all crew not currently assigned as direct sidekicks are lost when you change islands.  You find anywhere from 2-4 crew members per island and nearly all of them go to waste.\n\nCrew members can take damage and die, including from your own sword--and the way you move and swing and their idiot AI means you are hitting them /constantly/.  Once, I had a crew member get stuck behind an obstacle and be unable to follow me closely.  No problem, I figured.  Surely the pathfinding algorithm will eventually teleport them back to me.  Nope!  Traveled to the next island, and they were gone permanently--because of shitty pathfinding.  \n\nThere are items available for pickup as well, but you can again only hold one--and the game won't explain to you why you can't pick up or interact with a second item.  Items themselves are much more rare than crew and often require crew gating skills to retrieve, and this can make healing complicated since you don't auto-heal between islands.\n\nThe enemies are very repetitive, particularly given that you can't upgrade or change your weaponry.  There appear to be a couple of special attacks buried in the obtuse upgrade menu but they cost a huge amount of XP.  There's a ship upgrade in THAT obtuse menu that reduces XP costs but again it costs a huge number of coins.  Have fun grinding the same five creatures forever!\n\nLastly, the bosses are gearboxy bullshit.  By that I mean they sit on their invincible ledge and you get to dodge around until they show a weak spot for a brief time.  Repeat.  Yawn.  \n\nThe graphics are nice enough, even if the tile elements repeat a lot, and the music is alright.  There's just a lot of gameplay flaws that make this one fall flat.  I got it on sale for $3 and had an hour or two of amusement with it, and I think that's all it contains for me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504123433, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504123433, "recommendationid": "34617063", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
