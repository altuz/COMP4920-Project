It is a very fun game, but sadly once you finish it you don't really have enything left to do other then some small challenge modes. Its sad that due to Uplay the modding of this game is nearly devoid of content. If it had more mods or a sandbox mode (besides the final mission, which is still not the same as a true sandbox mode) it would be well worth more then $15 in my opinion, perhaps even a full $20. However due to Uplay account being required to play I don't recomend getting this game if you do not want Uplay on your system. Otherwise however the game is great."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506178837, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494504", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35155726", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197976340921", "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1506178934, "num_games_owned": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_forever": 1197}, "timestamp_updated": 1506179008, "received_for_free": false, "review": "7/10, enjoyable, strange and memorable.
