The game is so much better with a controller, it feels way more natural and less awkward to control. Instead of being a game of skitterish squirrels skating on slippery ice, it became a tight and easy to manuever elite soccer game. I really love this game now and so do my friends.

It sort of reminded me of the oldschool game Slime Volleyball, and it seems like it's heart is in the right place, but it just isn't that good.\n\nI wish I had some constructive criticism for what could be done to make it better. I'd start with the physics- it's just too frustrating to try to hit the ball. On top of that it's way too hard to aim and get it into the goal. I thought volleyball was alright, but after trying it again I've decided that I don't think that's a redeeming quality either- once you lose one point, you're almost guaranteed to lose 2 or 3.\n\nIf I had to say something good about Soccertron it's that the menu system is easy to navigate. However, the game mode selection interface is too in-your-face big.\n\nI'm sorry, but I would have to say to avoid this game.\n\nOn a sidenote, I tried letting the computer play against an idle player and thought it was funny that the idle player won one of the games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434850879, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434850879, "recommendationid": "16570237", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501304", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465835264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198040245856", "num_games_owned": 37}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I bought this game because I thought it was going to be fun playing local-multiplayer but too bad, I was disappointed.
