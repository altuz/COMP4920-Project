The momentum scale is not always my favorite thing, and their seems to be a dead frame fromt the time you hit the ground to when you can jump again, which frustrates me. The difficulty spike is a little much for me, but totally doable for an experienced platformer. It reminds me of Sonic aesthetic with Meatboy levels of difficulty. It's cute, it plays  It's a pretty good little platform for a dollar or two, so I would recommend it.\n\nEdit: as the levels get more difficult, the momentum becomes more of a piss-off.  There are also more and more puzzles that require you to break momentum which is so frustrating and counter-intuitive.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499131970, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499369651, "recommendationid": "33210079", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500099", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499398014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1596, "steamid": "76561198243327438", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "10/10 would jump to death on a bubble again.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499237604, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499237604, "recommendationid": "33263387", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500099", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 50, "total_reviews": 65, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 15}}
