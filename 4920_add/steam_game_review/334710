You move around in 1st person and click your mouse wondering what you are supposed to do, then you accdientally fall off a platform into the abyss for the 100th time, but that won't bother you because the game resets you back to the start of the level - and you are good to go. Then you try the spacebar to jump and discover it effects the level somehow and you can use that for a possible solution. \n\nYeah you fail and not solve any puzzles, constantly, but the whole process is rather chill and that's nice.\n\nIlamentia is a worthy purchase for anyone in need of a challenge.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496118401, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496118401, "recommendationid": "32055543", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517229", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499169031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 142, "steamid": "76561198402630763", "num_games_owned": 58}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Beautiful.
