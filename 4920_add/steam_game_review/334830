Sure it takes its inspiration from Braid and Portal, but it has taken the good parts of both those games and come up with a fresh idea.\n\nThis game has a mixture of clever puzzles, interesting environments and it does a really good job of giving the world a sense if weight and gravity as you interact with it. I am enjoying my time with this game currently, it has a few minor negative points. Those points and my gameplay are featured below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDxUVJMGi7s", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448317400, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448317400, "recommendationid": "19241076", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499660", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478475786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 515, "steamid": "76561197964481355", "num_games_owned": 99}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I played the entire game and after considering it a while, I don't think that I can recommend it.  It has a bit of a Portal feel, but without any story and none of the humor.  What's important here though are the puzzles and the mechanics.  The game looks pretty good but I found very few of the puzzles to be interesting from a problem solving perspective.  I think I spent about 10 times as much time simply trying to nudge things into exactly the right spot than I did trying to figure out how the puzzles needed to be solved.  \n\nEven that maybe wouldn't have bothered me too much if the mechanics weren't so terribly annoying.  So you have the ability to move an acid ball from lets say 1 meter away.  Guess exactly what distance you start taking damage from an acid ball at?  You guessed it, exactly the same distance.  So every single time you need to move one of these things you have to rush in, push it as fast as you can, and get out again.  It's so annoying and serves no purpose that I can see.   And it's not like this is something you have to do once or twice.  It's more like this is how you spend most your time in the game.\n\nThe one pretty cool mechanic of being able to go back in time whenever and as much as you want doesn't really serve any purpose except to fix mistakes.  It's not as if you can cleverly do something, go back in time, and end up changing where things were.  Everything goes back in time exactly how it was.  So, if you were super careful you would never need this ability.  Now with the crazy annoying mechanics it is super important, but then if you use it you won't get the achievment  for not using it at the end of each level.  It's kind of a slap in the face when you have to be so careful at every step to avoid the many game mechanic based pitfalls.\n\nI will say that I was happy with the final level and the ending.
