Really great twin-stick conrol scheme makes it easy to get into and lets you do some pretty fancy moves. Animations are good, has a fun style to itself, and plays really well in co-op! Played great right out of the box, worked with my controller without having to fiddle with anything. Good number of unlockables to keep you coming back. Lots of weird enemy designs that feel unique. Cool powerups. What else can I say?\nFeels like a long-lost coin-op arcade shmup.
