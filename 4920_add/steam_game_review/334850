It sounded great. A visual novel basically but where you build stats which can be used to overcome obstacles! How fun! Travel the world, befriend people, so on and so forth!\n\nIt really wasn't very good.\nThe art isn't great but I can overcome it but it's more of a negative or a neutral.\nMost of the stuff written is rather boring and very very very long. I've read alot of books but the writing here dragged. And I couldn't be interested usually. \n\nMost characters are iffy. No one really shined. The main character, besides a really weird name, was just TOO perfect at everything. Hard to put myself in her shoes when she is just so flawless. Too bad her romance options are horrid too. I don't trust any of them. The mummy is the only one I liked. Her family and her friend are okay though. So I stuck with them.\n\nThe actual gameplay is near impossible. You bet I ended up cheating after realizing it's way too unfair. But even without the gameplay, the story couldn't carry the game.\n\nEh, I was disappointed.
