I don't expect a game to hold my hands but when the game doesn't give you very good feedback on what effect you are having it makes it nearly impossible to figure out what exactly the game creator had in mind for the player to execute.\n\nI'm 3/4 of the way through the game after about 2 hours of play so it also looks to be fairly short.\n\nIf they went through and gave the player a little more instruction on how I'm affecting the cellular simulation and added a few more levels this would be a solid action title. As it stands its a bit frustrating and short.\n\n+Graphics have a nice retro feel\n+Concept is awesome and well executed\n\n\n-Game can be completed in a few hours\n-No real replayability \n-Several mechanics in the game are not explained and the style of the game makes it fairly difficult to figure them out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424756112, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424756112, "recommendationid": "14630298", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546968", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449510741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 41, "steamid": "76561198158069920", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is hard. I am already on the 3rd level and I am struggling. The feeling you get from succeeding is well worth it though. My tip is to study the visuals and help the game gives you and apply it. The music is good, it has a pulse to it which fits the theme. The visuals are nice and also are bright and understandable. I would reccommend it to anyone who likes a good challenge.
