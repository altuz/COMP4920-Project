No credits or anything, just back to desktop?) and at 4.99$ that is quite a costly, brief experience. \n\nInto Blue Valley is an immersive, at-times spooky / at-times relaxing, VERY brief (30 min maybe??) experience. The game does a good job of crafting an immersive environment via its weather effects (snow / wind breezing throughout the outdoor areas..) and its orchestral music is very well-done and fitting to the enviroments. The gameplay itself is nothing revolutionary for the Walking Simulator genre, you slowly plod your way along to read various notes scattered throughout the desolate city, search for a handful of items to be \"used\" (placed) at a later location near the game's finale, while occassionally seeing creepy, dark silhouettes of figures in the distance who will always disappear before you get too close to them with the same \"flash of white\" effect. This is cool and unsettling the first several times it happens, but as the game reaches its climax it begins to do the same effect every few steps, and with each repeated use of the same shtick it begins to lessen the impact of each time it's used. \n\nInto Blue Valley isn't a bad game per se, it effectively crafts a range of player reactions during its brief storyline ranging from introspection to unsettled via its foreboding atmosphere, and (if you are familiar with the slower pace of Walking Simulator games) you will likely want to see it through to its end to unravel more of its ambiguous, surreal setting. Unfortunately, its price of 4.99$ seems very high considering what little content it offers. I would recommend Into Blue Valley to Walking Simulator enthusiasts, and people who don't mind short but memorable experiences, but at a sparse 30 minutes to see nearly all of the experience, you may be better off seeking out another game or waiting until this is on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505716300, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505716300, "recommendationid": "35040063", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "total_reviews": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 19}}
