No offence, but if you've been living in the biggest rock ever and you're new to match-3 games, you should probably just skip to Bejeweled 3. Not to say Bejeweld 1 is bad, it's pretty good and nostalgic, especially its music, but nowadays it's just... Meh.

Such a simple yet ever-so-addictive set of games I literally put days upon days worth in effort of just simply beating my previous high scores to see how far I could go. Good times. But anyways, lets get into the review. As for the first installment in the main trilogy, it introduces the core gameplay and mechanics that the later titles put additional twists on. Such as in Bejeweled 2, you have the main \"classic\" and timed modes, but in addition to those 2 modes, B2 introduced the Puzzle and Endless modes. Not in the original title. If you want to start playing the games in an evolution kind of fashion, this is obviously where you should start. As for the gameplay itself, it still holds up fairly well even today, and the randomization of the levels make for good replayability.  As a whole, the Bejeweled is a very fun series to get into and I recommend checking out some other games that are similar if the age of this game is a turnoff factor for you."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1495222304, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31846308", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198029231607", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1495222160, "num_games_owned": 3570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 103}, "timestamp_updated": 1495222304, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of the most played and influential games in gaming history.

It's simple, yet ridiculously addictive. However, while the second and third games are spectacular, and Stars is surprisingly good despite following the infamous Candy Crush structure, the first game is not that great. How so? Well, this review will tell you.\n\n[strike][h1]Plot[/h1][/strike]\nThere is no plot. At all. This game is not a game that needs a plot.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nWhile the graphics are fairly dated, they were great for their time, and still look pretty good as of today. While the later Bejeweled games look far better, as you'd expect, the gems in this game are still pretty, and are definitely recognizable by those who play the later games.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nThe one music track you hear throughout the game would make for fantastic main menu music. The problem is, you hear this while playing the game itself. It's fairly boring, to be honest. It just sounds like random sounds strung together to make a song.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay is Bejeweled. The same addictive, simple and replayable Bejeweled that you know and love. However... It has some problems. For one, there are only two basic modes. This would be fine for a free game, but this is a game you spend a solid 5 dollars on. In addition, my least favorite part of the game is that lining up 4 or 5 gems at once only scores you additional points rather than giving you a powerful powerup gem. While extra points in a game revolving around high scores is a good thing, getting a powerup gem is more powerful and, in most if not all cases, much better at the job.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nI give this game a 4/10. It's not bad by any means, but it aged like milk, and Bejeweled 2 and 3 offer much more for the same buck. If you get this from the Popcap bundle (Like I did), maybe you could check it out once or twice, but overall, this game is not one you should take for full price."}]}
