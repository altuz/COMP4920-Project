This one is about story, morality, life and death.   To truly get the most out of this game you can't simply focus on the puzzles themselves, you have to pay attention to what you're doing, what's going on in the world, and the consequences your actions might have.  \n\nThe puzzles are not overly difficult by any means.   Really rather simple, actually, as far as these games go.  \nIts not a long game, either.  An afternoon/evening is enough time to get through it all, if you take your time or get stuck for a while (as I did, trying to be lazy I missed something).  \n\nBut the art and style, the aesthetic, are superb.  The music fits the game.   The decor is incredible for setting the mood and tone.  And the game itself is just solid.    Mouse clicks are responsive, clicking on interactable objects in the game are nice and reactive, the load times are nigh instantaneous, the menu options are as you would hope.  No irritation with mouse clicks or transitioning between zones/areas/slides.  Using objects from your pack is simple, everything behaves as you would hope and expect.\n\nThis game is simply fantastic.  It has all it needs and it is all that it should be.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505534092, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505534092, "recommendationid": "34987040", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509713", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505674622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 254, "steamid": "76561198009914771", "num_games_owned": 267}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you are evem a little human, better to give this a skip.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506274658, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506274684, "recommendationid": "35186706", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505081", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506112419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 343, "steamid": "76561198112166886", "num_games_owned": 30}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Love those games that despite not revealing any groundbreaking philosophical truths yet shatter your world so deeply with the simplest and most obvious things that we fail to see in our everyday life.
