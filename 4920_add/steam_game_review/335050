The manual, and some of the text within the game is in French while the rest of the text, and the audio is in English.  The AI assistant you're given is incredibly annoying because the speed, and intonation of her speech is random, and wild.  She sounds like a lunatic!  The game has a learning curve, for sure, but good luck with that unless you speak French.  If you've played resource management games before (like SimCity), you may have an easier time picking this up, but that doesn't mean you'll want to play.  I actually own the very latest SimCity, and that gaming experience is a smooth pleasure compared to this game.  It stutters, and lags with every click.  When it does work, it's a dull mess.  It's an eyesore of a game, too.  Like an old DOS game.  Embarrassing.
