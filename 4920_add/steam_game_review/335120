For example, early in the game you might find yourself crossing a bridge, only to have your identification papers stolen by an urchin child. \n\nAt this point, you have two choices:\n1. Try to cross without papers, which means fighting the guards and possibly everyone else on the bridge. \n2. Hunt down the urchin's elderly guardian and kill him to get your papers back. \n\nMost games would let you have some other options. Maybe you could bribe the guards, or find another way accross the river, or do a sidequest for the old man in exchange for your stuff. Supposedly, the game has programmed in an option for you to pickpocket the guardian using the game's Linguistic magic system, but I couldn't make that trick work. So the only options you have are to murder a helpless old man or brawl with the cops. \n\nThe game is full of moments like this, where a complex situation devolves into slaughter that probably could have been avoided. That wouldn't be such a big deal, except the combat system in this game is very unforgiving. Magic is nearly useless except for healing, and even that becomes less helpful by the endgame. The game includes a sizeable numberof skills that have few or no practical applications, and you don't get enough points to spare on experimenting. And there are a lot of hidden puzzles that can only be solved if you have the promotional pdf, Erlein's Handbook (not included in the Steam version of the game) or you trawl the internet for answers. \n\nThis game COULD have been good, but you'll see once you're out of the first few areas of the game that you have few options and all of the options you do have lead to pain.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503619502, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503619502, "recommendationid": "34470390", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513239", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1479697025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 50, "steamid": "76561198002351903", "num_games_owned": 116}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "2", "review": "This game doesn't come with a manual and there appears to be almost no in-game documentation to figure out what's going on, or how to play, or even what the spirit of the game is.\n\nSo I gave up after fifty minutes on the game.
