It's also got resolution issues, and even after modifying several files to get it to run at all, there is no easy way to change any of the graphics settings in-game. (The F keys can do things, but there's no in-game prompt for that.) The menu text just floats over the map, and nothing can be selected.\n\nGetting older games like this is a really dicey proposition on Steam. It seems like there is no QA whatsoever on the anything more than a few years old, and this game is no exception. The series can be a lot of fun, and if you\u2019ve got an old laptop from, like, 2008 or something it might run this with fewer problems. It\u2019s weird that the first Tropico runs so much better on my rig."}]}
