First of all, I felt this game was SIGNIFICANTLY better using a controller. Second: I am a huge minesweeper fan. I play it a lot to kill the time and I'm pretty good at it. Also, bought this at -10%. \n\nSo this is like minesweeper. Except you are marking the mines and then killing them whenever you like (if ever: you can complete a 'floor' without clearing and it's basically exactly like minesweeper. \n\nIn the multiplayer (or vs bots) mode: There's like 8 characters. Each one has exactly one special ability. If you've played Puyo Pop: it's sort of like that. You guys are both contesting the same mapand you both want to mark and collect as many mines as possible whilst retaining your combo of selecting mines without clearing or selecting an incorrect tile. \n\nI'll be honest: the story is really bad and very stupid. The AI is not horrible and will sometimes make mistakes (this is good). The art direction is OK. It's an anime-style game. The Dungeon Mode (ie, endless mode) is very fun and I enjoy playing it. It relinquishes the fighting bit and you're basically just playing nearly endless minesweeper. \n\nThe long and short of it is, if you like Puzzle Quest or Puzzle Fighter and games like that: you will like this game most certainly. If you like minesweeper: you will probably like this game. If you like little moe anime girls running around and clicking mines: you will probably like this game.
