The voice acting is mediocre at best and there is no solid gameplay. The animations in the game are poorly done, for example, the fire \"spell\" cuts off immediately as soon as you lift the button, and there is no level structure. You can visit a few places with no context of where you are.

When a new title on Steam announces it has VR support, I normally investigate and see if it will work with the DK2 (Yes, beware as Valve is too incompetent to properly label VR titles; you must do your own verifications in order to make sure the game actually works with VR, even if Steam says it should... it may very well not - Steam just want to take your money)\n\nWhile this title worked virtually perfectly with the DK2, content-wise it fell short. Very short. Don't get me wrong, it looks fairly good in there (fairly, not incredibly... I was more impressed with the visuals in Frontiers) but it just doesn't seem right. The scales are off, the LOD lacks and as a showstopper, some basics like camera clipping values are wrong.\n\nI stopped my run when I recognized something I learned in Unity on day 1: I could see a big diamond-shaped hole in the skybox.
