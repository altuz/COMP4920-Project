Well, you are a mouse. Which isn't that great, but the real amazing thing is that you chase after cheese all day.  Literally my biggest dream that I never told anyone. Some may make fun of me for the amount of time I played, but I say if I could chase after cheese in real life I would spend more than a few couple hundred hours on it. You know what makes it even better? It's free! Free Cheese! And you know everything free tastes better. It's hard for new people to like it because it's pretty difficult to be able to even get the cheese in the first place, but once you get that cheese, everything changes. You just want to get that cheese again and again. Life is going good; all the cheese you can get your little grubby little paws on. Then BOOM, it hits you, you realize it, you finally realize that the cheese you love is full of MSG and you can't stop even if you wanted to... It all spirals out of control at this point. Am I a mouse or human??? I don't even know anymore. I need to go get some more cheese. Yes, cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE!!!\n\nThis was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nOnce we have a 100 followers on our group there will be a game giveaway, but only the followers have a chance to win.\n\nIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

Graphically speaking, the game is simple and appealing.\n\nYou play as a mouse along with a bunch of other people and try to get the cheese with the help of the shaman, a special mouse that has powers that allow him to construct structures to help the mice get the cheese. You could also buy cosmetics with the cheese.\n\nTheres a level up system that gives the shaman ridiculously overpowered abilities that allow them to single out people they like and complete the level for them and kill everyone else, which is usually what happens. Besides that, to this there is enough brony pandering to sink a ship, from cosmetics to maps based off the show.\n\nThe community isn\u2019t very good, is really appalling, and now mostly consists of memelords and bronies. Each server is full of people saying \u201c#@?* you\u201d and \u201cnoob\u201d and plenty of other insults.\n\nAlthough this game doesn\u2019t fascinate me (I confess), the game itself isn\u2019t really bad. It's the community that makes this game not really fun to play. Looks like a bunch of kids of about 10 years old talking nothing but crap. Not recommended much because of the community.

Every round, you try to get the cheese with the help of a different [b]shaman,[/b] a mouse with special skills that allow them to construct structures in order to help as many mice as possible successfully complete the map. This concept [b]can vary[/b] from [i]small changes[/i] to almost [i]entirely,[/i] though, depending on the mode you are playing. There is quite a variety of modes and mini-games to try out, both [b]official and user-made.[/b]\n\n[b]The cheese[/b] you collect on each map is the currency of the game with which you are able to buy [b]customization[/b] items for your mouse to your own liking, with options starting from hats to skins for the shaman\u2019s building/summoning tools. The game does not make you spend your money for any other reason than getting the before-mentioned aesthetic items faster instead of collecting cheese one by one, thus [i]it is not a \u201cPay-to-Win\u201d game[/i] of any sorts as the items play no factor in your performance. This is one of the positive points of Transformice, though considering the price of some items and the fact you get one cheese per map on which you may succeed in doing so or do a simple mistake and lose your chance, is all about a matter of [i]time, patience[/i] and [i]interest[/i] to decide if you want to boost this progress up and or you really want to make your playable character more unique-looking (but it is all up to your preferences, [b]otherwise it is completely optional[/b]).\n\n[b]The shaman[/b] plays an important role in the game, making it [b]essential[/b] learning how to use their skills and work yourself around the idea of them in order to enjoy your time playing when your turn comes. Unfortunately, [i]there is not even a simple tutorial covering at least the basics[/i] around the physics and abilities of the shaman in-game (for the time being, at least), making it hard for new players to take slow steps into becoming better and help their fellow mice. The community, as heavily mentioned already (thus I am not going to go further into details about it), is [i]very discouraging to beginners,[/i] getting easily angry and not offering even a slight bit of advice [b]except[/b] from the few people that do not take \u201cTransformice\u201d so seriously as to bother changing their emotional state over a game with mice and help you to the best of their ability in order to get you started. These are the people you will find yourself eventually coming closer to, [b]building friendships[/b] and making them the main reason to come back and get yourself busy with this game again (at least that was and is the case for me).\n\n[b]Once you get past the learning phase and curves,[/b] reach a decent level and get used to the chat and the community, \u201cTransformice\u201d becomes [i]an enjoyable way to pass time[/i] and that is the main reason why I am suggesting trying it. People that easily get offended or cannot handle reading and dealing with, the majority of the time, immature players and hateful conversations will not have the best experience from this game but I say [i]it is worth giving it a chance and see if you will eventually stick with it.[/i]\n\nThe gameplay is [b]fun,[/b] it has [b]variety[/b] and offers [b]endless replayability and customization[/b] by giving you the option to create your own maps. Every month or so there is a different [b]event[/b] which adds special collectibles, such as badges and titles, to fill up your profile with. And overall, I believe that [i]the game appeals to a wide audience of ages[/i] and if you play it on and off you will not find it as boring and unworthy of your time as it may seem after a while.
