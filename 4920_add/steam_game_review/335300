Well \"finished\" closely. I missed the Fume Knight and Sir Alonne, but from the rest, I got each and everyone.\n\nSo, how is Dark Souls 2? Well, it's not a bad game. ... which is quite a catastrophe compared to the legendary Dark Souls 1.\n\nDark Souls 2 takes all the recipes which the new designers have been fond of in Dark Souls 1 and added and tweaked some details here and there. Notably, on character death, your maximum HP lowers down to at least 50% (but there are ways to get around this). And the number of enemy re-spawn has been limited to 12 or 15 (it seems to depend on the area). Due to some more heal options (Life Gems) it seemed to be a bit easier. I got the impression that the normal game is far easier than Dark Souls 1 has been. It really felt like being made for the casual gamer. Then again, the three DLCs are even more difficult than the Dark Souls 1 DLC has been. At least for me.\n\nA difficulty which for me was beyond the barrier of acceptance with the Fume Knight. This was just boring frustrating (if you should have known in advance, you should have spared some smelter sticks to block the self-healing ability of the knight, but you don't. Maybe I missed to read the small print on some item, alas, no-one told me in advance).\n\nI once read the limited amount of enemy re-spawn is to prevent people from grinding. Funny, because for me, it *gave* me the reason to grind: kill all enemies until nothing re-spawns. I did this for about 95% of all areas and reached level 222(!) with this approach. Yes, a total grinding campaign. Bad design decision. Backfired for me.\n\nThen the designers thought, that PvP is the real extra something to Dark Souls. And they made it non-consensual everywhere in the world. In Dark Souls 1 this was sort of ok since when you have been hallowed no-one could have invaded your realm and forced a PvP on you. This is different to DS2, because here in order to limit the probability to be invaded you have the burn those highly valuable human effigies (humanity in DS1 terms). Or play offline.\n\nBut when playing offline you won't get any achievements.\n\nAnother bad design decision. I like Dark Souls combat style and world immersion, but I am greatly loathing doing PvP.\n\nAs I discovered this, I started to make my own save games and whenever I got invaded I CTRL-ALT-DEL and kicked DS2 from the process table and loaded my old save game. Some people got annoyed by this and flamed on Steam. Well, read my comment before flaming. I clearly stated that I *will* do this. There are areas in DS2 for PvP. Go for this, but leave me while I'm playing. This idea with the Blue Sentinels trying to protect you when invaded never worked for me (another bad design decision?).\n\nAs a result, I finished the whole game *without dying even once a single time!* and hardly used any human effigy ever ... since I reloaded my save game all the time I died. :P\n\nThen there is the universe. DS1 and DS2 have a huge amount of lore to tell. It is a fascinating world. Yet, From Software still hasn't managed to tell a story. It is all in the item descriptions and in those mystic dialogues. But DS2 keeps on the virtue of DS1 in: \"unable to tell a story\". You have to read the item descriptions on these tons of things (weapons, armors, keys, blah, ...) and make some logical deduction. I come to the conclusion, that they thought this is some DS1 thing they should keep up doing. Well, I would like to have seen some story telling. I think From Software isn't just capable of doing it.\n\nAnd, while I'm at it: DS2 has no cohesive world. In one level you are in bright daylight, two stages beyond that it's dark night and the moon is shining. The world in DS1 has been somehow \"organic\", each level, each stage carefully designed and interlinked. DS2 is more like platform runner: now \"Water Level\", then \"Wood World\", then \"Castle Run\",... Some levels are great (Dragon Aeire), some are just not (well, The Gutter, anyone?).\n\nAnother aspect is, that in between DS2 and \"DS2 Scholar of the first Sin\", they added more enemies and rearranged them quite heavily. Whereas in DS1 it seemed that every opponent has been placed there really carefully. In DS2 they just threw more obstacles in your way, mistakenly thinking that's what you want. For some enemies there seems no real reasoning but just that the designer simply had to the power to do so. This is not a good level design.\n\nIf there hasn't been a DS1 this game would have been quite nice. But given that there is this legendary masterpiece of DS1 (with respect to all its flaws), DS2 is more a setback to the series. Yet, it still \"isn't a bad game\". But clearly didn't live up to the expectations.\n\nSadly, I reward 7 out of 10.\n\n\nEdit: it seems, that some people think the DS series' multiplayer feature integral. I just got another \"git gud, noob\", \"low hanging fruits\" from another troll in this community for doing this kill-reload-strategy, which is pretty ridiculous. Especially having more than 200 hours in DS playtime. And doing all bosses alone without any help from anyone...\n\nSo again: I do not want to PvP. Neither in DS1 nor in DS2. Never did, never wanted to. Actually, I do not play multiplayer games *at all*. Not a single one. I love the DS setting, the game immersion, and the combat style. But enforcing PvP on me as DS2 did is for me a No-Go.\n\nI do not treat the multiplayer capabilities of DS (1 or 2) as essential to the game. It is really an add-on, an icing on the cupcake. DS are really two games: one for the story and one for making online fighting matches. I love the first, reject the second. Effectively, I found myself been *bored* and pretty annoyed by these constant invading attempts. My most common thought in such incidents was \"Oh, get lost!\". It was disruptive for me at best. At first, I lost some matches and then I won some matches. As usual. \n\nIn DS1 the game provided me with a mechanic to prevent me being invaded (turning hollow). DS2 needs to burn human effigies to lower the probability *or* play offline. The later than would withhold any achievements I made. However, human effigies are quite scarce. As DS2 does not provide any means to turn off online combat and does not reward achievements in offline mode, I simply turned to this rather crude solution: kick DS2 from the process table and reload. Later on, I played out some matches just been too lazy to kick DS2 and reload. For the \"git gud\"-trolls: I won these matches on average. Not all. Most. But I give a f..k for these battles. Boring.\n\nFor me, and yes: this is my opinion, I would have been better off if there has been some switch or game mechanic like in DS1 to avoid being invaded.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505493480, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507190480, "recommendationid": "34976219", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506809", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505650669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 7297, "steamid": "76561197963217574", "num_games_owned": 159}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "One of my favorite games of all time. \n\nThis was the first Dark Souls game that I played. I don't remember how all this began or what year, it was years ago with the original version of Dark Souls 2. But combined I easily have more than 500 hours between the vanilla Dark Souls 2 and the Scholar edition.\n\nDark Souls 1 and 2 require you to learn the timing and flow of its combat to be successful. Your swing speed and even its response time is usually not \"instant\", things have a weighty feel to them, a windup. \n\nI don't think I can explain how I was such a glutton for punishment that led me back to the DS2 world time and time again - even with one year breaks in between at some points. \n\nI will try to summarize the Scholar edition on a technical level at least, since I have no idea what impression the game world and gameplay will make on You if you were to try it - it's 75% off right now by the way, an impossible steal. \n\nSo let's see, what does the years of developer and fan investment since the original DS2 get you today?\n\nWell, the graphics are top notch and the performance is flawless. The game is excellent with an XBox controller and I use an Elite one just for Souls games. The sound is awesome. The menus and interfaces are excellent. \n\nAnd there are so many mechanics in this series that are brilliantly designed and not found anywhere else, such as how levelling and character building is implemented - things we take completely for granted but once you experience them, you can't believe it's only done here. \n\nThe challenge level is downright controversial, but not All the time at least. Personally though I found that even as I was fighting through an area over and over, it still felt fun. You only make it through some parts when every possible technique is exploited - maybe you need to run through and not try to take down every possible enemy. Maybe you need to exploit the terrain and break up that large group somehow. Maybe some arrows (that's cheese and should only be overused). When you consider that, sure you need to grab souls and resources Somewhere to continue to build your character, but that aside your primary goal is simply to physically make it to that next bonfire. That's a game-changer sometimes in the face of a stupidly-hard area, when you consider that literally you only need to make it Through an area, any way you can. Also, your cleverness is Higher than mine without question. You will find things that work for you that I blindly stumbled past and made it ten times harder than it needed to be.\n\n\nFinally, the boss fights. Man these are glorious. The Fume Knight is my favorite boss of all time in any game. The purest knight-style duel (when not cheesed or bringing help) there has ever been, you can feel and sense every swing of the sword sweeping over the ash and roaring past your head in this fight. I probably faced him over 200 times, over a 2 year period, and I did not stop until I was satisfied. \n\nSo go ahead and play your auto-win games. Dark Souls beats your ass by default, if that describes you. I am going to fire up Dark Souls 3 now to start that fresh but I think Dark Souls 2 will always be my favorite. \n\nFall into that dark hole just like the opening cutscene, face immeasurable odds and find your redemption. \n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505652025, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505652025, "recommendationid": "35022580", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500384", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507008075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 162, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 8943, "steamid": "76561198011817913", "num_games_owned": 1049}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Might not be the best Dark Souls...but it IS the best Dark Souls on PC.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505683230, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505683230, "recommendationid": "35033417", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502823", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506639068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 527, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2378, "steamid": "76561198179175461", "num_games_owned": 57}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have wanted to play this for years and finally came around to doing it.\nAlmost 40 hours straight in a couple days one of the most fun games I have ever played...

And getting hit even by grunts hurts a lot. Thus a tactical approach is required many times and a simple misstep and aggroing several enemies can easily get you killed.\n\n\nStill even though I like the game very much it isn't perfect and I have a few complaints, most of them can be put down to taste but still.\nPvping can be somewhat avoided but it can be really costly to do so and a lot of the times might not be worth using the consumable to do so. Thus you can get ganked by players that generally seem better prepared and unless another consumable is used they will be ignored by enemies putting you at a major disadvantage.\nAlso because of the fact that you lose all souls on you when dying and dying again makes the previous drop of yours vanish, invading players can go from a simple annoyance to rage-quitting frustration when you lose a significant amount of souls.\n\nWhile most enemies and bosses have varying degrees of difficulty between them there are a few bosses in particular that seem intentionally designate as difficulty spikes and you will spend way more time on those than anything else in the game if you want to solo them.\n\nAnd finally the game really doesn't go into specifics. Like how weight actually interacts with dodge rolls, how damage is calculated, the fact that infused weapons even when they have the same grade of scaling don't scale as well as natural elemental weapons and so on.
