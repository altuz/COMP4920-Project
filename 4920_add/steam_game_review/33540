( I also played Dawn of magic 1) While I didn't expect much from this, for some reason I got hooked. Some people say that the Story and Combat are garbage in  this game. Well, the story makes no sense unless you've played the first one. And the combat is focused around magic, It's literarly impossible to play a Warrior or a Rougue in this game. It's revolved around magic. A Cool feature that is VERY rare is that the more magic you learn, the more pimped your character becomes. I just bought a tornado spell and my character grew wings. At first i was like wtf but then , when you think about it, it's a really cool adition. IMO it's worth the money, especially when it's on sale. Too bad nobody gives this a chance. =( \nMy rating is 7/10 - good but definately needs some polish to get people's attention."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1424706691, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551871", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "14611912", "votes_up": 35, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198112266285", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1447619017, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1541}, "timestamp_updated": 1426182767, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I see very few reviews here, all very different, so think my report could be useful. This is my first review.\nI've played non-Steam Dawn of Magic for a long time few years ago, and now bought a Steam version to play again on 64-bit OS (Retail version protection cannot run under 64 bit).\n\n(IMPPORTANT) This game is basically an addon to an original Dawn of Magic and is actually the same game, just modified and with a different and quite short storyline set in a much smaller world. \n\nAbout an original game \n(WARNING: Original game (story, some monsters, most of maps) is not included in this Steam version):\n\nIt says that it's an ARPG, but it's only partially true. The \"Magical killing sandbox\" is much closer to the truth, I think. \n\nThere are hordes of monsters everywhere, and on most locations you will take a bloodshower just trying to run from A to B. The monster killing is the core of the game, but unlike many other games, this one makes this process a real art. \n12 (!) BALANCED (!!!) schools of magic and the ability to make crazy spell combinations make these poor hordes of monsters your specimen. \nSaying about spells variety, it's the only game I know where you can effectively \"eat\" enemy corpses, explode them with bones or fire, make them a source of plague or resurrect them in 3(!) possible ways.\n\nKilling is no more routine - it's an experiment. Knowledge and skill give you more power than just upgrading spell levels - even on first spell levels some not-at-all-obvious combinations of seemingly useless spells create an extremely powerful weapon. Also, leveling up some spells changes their effective behaviour (difference in numerical values sometimes makes qualitative change).\nAnd i'm just speaking about the spell system itself, without influence from other systems!\n\nThe real treasure of this game is its art. It alone costs multiple times this funny steam price. This pretty much unique dreamy horror style, beauty and harmony in common human figures, beauty even in dreadful monsters and locations, beauty in strange city architecture (I really have no idea how designers made these), wonderful atmospheric music... Really, in such an atmosphere monsters are just a part of a harmonic gorgeous nature, life and death cycle. The graphics can seem technically dated, but the art itself is a masterpiece, and the concept behind is very deep. \nYou will probably never see something like this anywhere else. \n\nLong story short, let's make some lists:\n\n\n\nORIGINAL DAWN OF MAGIC (again, NOT included in this Steam version)\npros and contras\n\n++++Amazing artwork and atmosphere, elaborated to the smallest details. All or almost all dialogues and random npc strings vary depending on your character and moral alignment. Dialogues themselves are often quite unusual.\n+++ Complex and entertaining spellsystem.\n+++ Ability to be really EVIL! (and to be verbally and not verbally kicked and abused in an incredible variety of ways by NPCs), have a really evil campaign, kill innocent people and so on.\n++ multiple equipment and character upgrade systems (many upgrades are not trivial): \n1) Alchemy\n2) Material adding\n3) Incredibly wide range of runes \n4) Runic spells on items (most with unusual effects)\n5) Tatoos (not removable of course)\n6) Perks from learning magic\n7) Item sets, some of which change spell behaviour\n++ Non-standard in details storyline. You know like remakes of old tales in an unexpected manner.\n++ Non-linear in details campaign.\n+Large enough world with many things to look at.\n+Challenging (usually) boss fights.\n+Crazy mob fights (mobs use magic ALOT including resurrection and so on)\n+ Many consequent difficulty levels (very escalating) and an ability to make a new game with an old character (with all exp and items). Adds much of replayability (also some things are not supposed to be done on first dif. levels)\n+Short range through-walls teleportation skill to feel like a mage :)\n+ On slow machines or in very heavy scenes the game itself slows down instead of skipping frames. Very good neuron-saving feature.\n+Ability to play as Mortal. Death is irreversible in this mode, you'll need to start over. For maniacs.\n\n(neutral) mobs generally do not respawn. Oh, don't worry, they won't deplete completely unless you're a maniacal inquisitor. They're just too many. You can still try...(PURGE!!!) but I guess, that'll ruin ecological balance.\n\n- Monsters are a bit too dense sometimes. If the map is big and you need to cross it, better use teleporting skill and try to survive in the air boiling with mob spells between jumps.\n-Minor bugs like very rare inactive mobs, rare incorrect resurrection and strange npc walking routes when in a very limited space.\n-Monster population could be a bit less homogenous on most maps... Maybe a bit more monster types (even more)...\n-The main outline of a plot could be less generic.\n\n\n\n\nDAWN OF MAGIC 2 (please remember that it's only an addon) \nDifferences:\n\n+Sweet movie scenes.\n+more comfortable UI (not much changed, but still).\n+New feature: element parts that can be collected and make an item to give you a concentrated power of one school including Skill.\n+Different starts for different characters (4). The campaign details also differ a bit, but only a bit.\n+Seemingly improved campaign rewarding system.\n+In retail versions often original modified(inc. new UI and element parts) game is also included.\n\n(neutral) Fewer difficulty levels. (only 3)\n(neutral) Monster continously respawn on some maps during some campaign events.\n\n-Shorter storyline.\n---------Much(!!!) smaller world. (You cannot visit most of cities and places).\n-No more Alchemists' guild.\n-No more bards. (funny guys)\n---Much less quests.\n--------No evil campaign or passive hatred from citizens (you can still kill them though)\n---- Very linear campaign. (In original one you could, for example, alternatively kill some characters or even kill key figures not obviously supposed to be killed.)\n-Fewer tatoos.\n\n\nNON-RUSSIAN VERSION\nDifferences:\n---- Less fantastic voice acting. No voice acting for citizens. (Atmosphere changes a bit. Less warm.)\n--The translation is... Well, they tried to conserve an original style. They tried.\n\n\nSTEAM VERSION \nDifferences:\n\n+++ low price, esp. on sale.\n+Feels more ironed out.\n\n----(-) (IMPORTANT) No original modified Dawn of Magic included!\n- No russian version (really, if you understand Russian, get a russian version of this, otherwise you miss a chunk of an atmosphere).\n-The advertisment and screenshots are just awful :) They should fire people for such a thing.\n\nSUMMARY:\nIf you're new to Dawn of Magic, buy this, but not a Steam version (beware of Starforce, do not work on 64 bit!). Choose one with an original game included and have fun. Or you can buy this if you just want to see a bit of DOM for a very low price, but remember that this is just an addon.\nIf you played the original game, you can buy this, especially on sale, at least to feel some nostalgia.\nIf you understand Russian, get a Russian version, really. It's a bit more atmospheric, but beware of Starforce.\n\nNotes:\nMultiplayer is seemingly working, but there's no people."}, {"votes_down": 13, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1394449563, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507059", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "9408697", "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198107655980", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1394622476, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2121}, "timestamp_updated": 1394449563, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Story is amazing , and it's the best arpg that I have played since ages ...

You dont need to find some epic helmet or else to make your face, your head look like a scary skull. Or maybe you want to get wings? - then head to learn Alchemy. Wanna change your legs for being Zerg-like? Each spell from the each School of magic, that you've learned, affects on each piece of your body, like hands, legs, chest and etc. So the final version of your char may look like whatever YOU want. Besides, through game you collect the pieces of some special SETs, which grant you full skin of one of  the Magic Schools.

I have played, and finished, Dawn of Magic 1. DoM2 is exactly the same as DoM1 when it comes to playstyle, character animation, spell/abilities. Heck, they remade the same game and added a 2 after it. \n\nThe storyline aspect is lacking in this game. Do not play it if you are into games with a good story. This game is however recommended to people loving high customizability and patience (especially waiting for level ups so you can spend your scrolls). \n\nThe playability in this game on modern PCs are also smooth, as long as you don't alt+tab, because getting back into the game has some known issues to cause a hell of a lot of FPS lag.\n\nMy review is somewhat objective as I have finished the first installment. Give it time. Try the combat, you will find yourself mentally wrecked coming up with a good build - there are so many to choose from (my personal favourite is one of 3 builds: Water, focus on Ice Blast, Poison, focus on plague (which is superb for AoE fights but lacking in single-target fights due to high Global Cooldown,  and finally earth magic) and blessing + fire + earth, play this as a melee strength/energy-stat character\n\nTips for new guys:\n\n-Try out builds by making a network Free-for-all game, and play it solo. you won't be using your story character for this.\n-Stay the heck away from the spell \"Infidel\" unless you have high strength/energy \n-REDUCE enemy resistance, or Croud Control the heck out of them - will make your life easier. Some examples are the \"Thick Blood\" spell which works fantastically with Poison.\n-WATER BUBBLE! it negates Blessings/Curses\n-Dark path, Dark path, Dark path. Not only does it teleport you, it HEALS you.\n-Melt is also a fantastic option to have - pair it up with any less-frequently-used spell.

This erratic NPC and enemy behaviour will turn into chaotic mass brawls whenever a quest\nspawns opponents in a city. Not that it would become any better out in the wilderness, as the randomly spawning enemies\nwill make sure that even then every single encounter is a mess.\n\nThe one stand out gimmick that magic you learn affecting the stats and the looks of your character is  a neat idea, but ultimately pointless. The bonusses are sometimes utterly pointless-like having a reduced death penalty. In a  game that has a hardcore mode. Those changes also come coupled with heavy downsides that usually have a higher negative impact than any advantage you might gain. Spells are on a global cooldown so you will usually see yourself spamming your standard attack spell over and over again until your enemies keel over.
