The Legends Pack also has patches for each of its games, but this one is more complete from what I've seen so far.\n\nPassage of the Book is an open-ended, party-based dungeon-crawling RPG.  It begins by having you create a world according to a few simple parameters, and then you're thrown right into it with some basic equipment and money.  You recruit other party members via inns and through talking to other adventurers, and over time improve all your characters by fulfilling requests and plundering dungeons.  There is no overarching narrative; rather, you're left to do as you like and become as famous/infamous as you please.\n\nCreating a character invovles selecting certain criteria from a small window and selecting someone from a list of generated results.  Age and gender can affect one's stats in different ways - a mid-20's character will generally be stronger than a much older one, but an older one may have much more charisma, for example.  There aren't strict classes as much as there are stats which determine what kinds of actions a character is best at performing - a warrior is going to prioritize strength over intelligence, a mage will do the opposite, so on and so forth.  Again, very freeform and the details are largely up to the player. Party members are NOT created by the player - they are recruited once the game starts.\n\nPassage of the Book is tough.  Enemies can be very powerful and there's little indication as to what kinds of enemies will be in different dungeons, but with persistence and a full party you can usually make it out ok.  Equipment is straightforward - bought at shops, can be improved X number of times, and different folks are better with different weapons.  Inns allow you to talk to various individuals, including your own party members, as well as purchase supplies.  Lamps are especially important for dungeons - you can get stuck in the dark without one!  There are also item shops, temples, training areas (where you raise your own skills in exchange for money), and an information broker through whom you can search for info on specific people and places. \n\nBattle is a turn-based affair similar to other Japanese console RPG's, in that you select an action then watch as everyone takes their turns.  The difference, though, is you only have primary control over your own character - your party acts independently, but can be encouraged to focus on particular enemies or utilize certain strategies (this is largely similar to the other Lunatic Dawn games in the Legends Pack).  After battle, loot is divided amongst your party and can be won through a competitive game.  Once divided, loot belongs to each person, not to the player exclusively, and dividing loot is also what helps maintain cohesion within your party (members can become dissatisfied and leave).  \n\nOverall, it's a very open, freeform experience that I've never really encountered elsewhere.  I'd almost call Passage of the Book more of a sim than a traditional dungeon crawler.  Either way, it's a unique experience that fans of old-school dungeon crawling will appreciate, as the mechanics are solid and the sense of accomplishment grows very quickly.  Definitely recommend giving this one a go.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456716682, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456716682, "recommendationid": "21539167", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565137", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
