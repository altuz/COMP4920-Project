The gameplay is not very fun.  \n\nThe quality of the game is extremely minimal, this is the absolute least amount of work you could put into a 3D game.  It doesn't seem \"unfinished\" as much as it just seems like they didn't spend a whole lot of time on it.  You can actually play any level of the game right off the bat, you don't need to progress through it to unlock anything.  It's actually a really good thing because if you find a level to be rediculous you can just move onto the next one but I tried the first 3 and I'm just not feeling it.  \n\nIn the level list, I figured \"00\" would be a sort of training level, since the rest are just numbered 01, 02, 03 and so on.  In the \"00\" level, there's a big minigun turret around the first corner.  You can't seem to hurt it, bullets don't seem to affect it much, but there are treasure boxes beside it.  When you walk over a treasure box it will open it, but you don't instantly have the ability to pick it up for about a second or so, you basically have to circle around it 3 or 4 times.  Well the gun will take you out much faster than that, so it makes picking up any loot basically annoying.  Trying to kill enemies is pretty bad too, it's a shame they didn't try to lure me in with any slow progressing \"fun\" parts instead of basically throwing the player to the dogs on the first levels and having a horrible control scheme to boot. \n\n", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1417830057, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417777339, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1417777339, "recommendationid": "13236694", "developer_response": "Hey maplesyrupghost,\n\nThanks for the useful feedback and taking the time to write a review.\n\nWe are going to add full controller support in the next update. \n\nWhat kind of monster spawns is randomized everytime the level is loaded. So levels can be easier  or harder depending on what gets spawned. The treasure chest has to open and spill its loot and that is what is picked up.\n\nWhat about the controls is terrible?\n\nAgain thanks for the feedback and review.", "language": "english", "votes_down": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509872", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
