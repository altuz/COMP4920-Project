A CYOA book, with dice throwing and \"if you wish to turn left, turn to page 15\" blah blah style adventuring. It is a lost art, partly because many of those old Fighting Fantasy books were more or less lifeless, dripping in theme but completely lacking in storytelling skill. This story is quite a fun ride though. You start out alone in a bar, your girlfriend has left you, and before long you are swept up in a maelstrom of kidnapping, blackmail, and even assassination! (Wait... \"An Assassin in Orlandes!\" I just noticed that! They must have planned that ALL ALONG! Brilliant!) Along the way, you'll travel through tombs, graveyards, castles, battle robbers, monsters, thugs, and even an assassin or two. The story is not long to finish, though you will want to go back and enjoy some of the branching paths, but even if you don't, the story does a wonderful job of telling a rip-roaring swashbuckling tale of adventure. The decisions are generally written with reasonable benefits and consequences if you think them through, too, so unlike most CYOAs the game feels like it is actually a game rather than a series of choices you must iterate though. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a CYOA story a little bit lighter on the anime VN style nonsense and heavier on swords and sorcery.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437250975, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437252835, "recommendationid": "17113134", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531177", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467285190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 156, "steamid": "76561197979215168", "num_games_owned": 4711}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "What is An Assassin in Orlandes?\n\nAn Assassin in Orlandes is a gamebook in video game form. If you know the Fighting Fantasy books by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone (not to be confused with Ian Livingstone, the Illuminati card game designer!) you will know how it plays. If not, here is a small summary.\n\nYou are presented with a lot of text that describes your situation, then you choose your next action from a set of several possibilities. Often, you are constricted by having or having not a certain item, or you must fight or check your fitness.\n\nAt first you roll fitness and vitality.\nFitness is determined at the beginning of your game. I recommend to keep on restarting (more on this in a bit) until you roll at least a 4, preferrably a 6. I got very lucky, having rolled 6 for fitness and a high vitality. Vitality is rolled with 4 dice, fitness with 1 die, and a set number is added to each roll's total (I think 26 for vitality and 6 for fitness). Vitality can be restored in some ways, and it is not that important, but fitness is essential. Rolling a vitality of anything that is not trolled (you should try to get over 40 vitality, but anything over 36 should work well) and a fitness of 6 is what you want for almost all of the game (there is one artwork where you must follow a set of actions that includes a failed fitness roll, but you will want to do that after finishing the game).\nSo in short: Vitality = 4d6 + 26. Fitness = 1d6 + 6. You need 10+ fitness for all achievements, and 12 is absolutely recommended, even if vitality is low then.\n\nAfter you are done rolling your initial stats and assigning yourself a name that you will never see again, the adventure begins. So you are in a tavern and can decide if you want to get drunk, talk to the barkeeper, or leave the tavern. All ways eventually lead outside, where you witness an attack against a young nobleman. The game follows its main path linearly, but branches off at the side paths, enabling you to get some better equipment or helpful items - or into dangerous battles.\n\nThe battle system works on offense, defense and vitality. The vitality is hit points, offense and defense are each the number of dice you roll for yourself or opponents when attacking or defending. The highest single die counts, in case of a tie the next one, etc., but I don't fully understand the system even after beating the game.\nSo you remember me recommending 12 fitness? You can use fitness in the battle, and it seems to jump back to the previous value when you win, but the advantage is really small and you have to do a fitness check each time.\nThe fitness check consists of throwing two dice, and you pass if the total is lower than your fitness value. This gives you at 12 fitness a 1 in 36 chance to fail. Unfortunately here is a huge weakness of the book: Almost each time you fail in the story, it is a certain game over. There are a few exceptions.\n\nYou can make up to three saves (called bookmarks) when the game is started. My first playthrough attempt failed because I set the bookmarks too early. Of course, this is part of exploring the game. So you start the game, set the first bookmark (to save your fitness and vitality) and explore until you know what is a good course of action. And this goes on that way. Eventually you run out of bookmarks and want to restart.\nWait, how do you restart?\nYou can only do so after getting a \"THE END\" message, which appears when you die or when you win the game. So if you want to get 12 fitness you will need to die a few times, which is annoying because it takes a while. And - minor spoiler - you need 10+ fitness for one achievement, so you will want to reroll if it is too low.\n\nThere are 23 artworks to find (24 if you include the title page), and when you found all you are awarded with an achievement, which is most likely the final achievement you find. By that time, you will have won the game already and tried a few different approaches to sidetracking. Without a guide it took me around 2 hours to beat the game in classic mode, but as I said I got lucky with the initial rolls. I then used a guide for the last few artworks and another achievement, bringing my platime to around two and a half hours.\n\nAnd that is it, after seeing everything once, there is no replayability. Sure, the time will depend on how fast you can read, or if you get bored, how fast you skip pages and make decisions. The story is in my opinion your standard fantasy story, and the ganeplay is unbalanced in terms of fitness, but rather easy and forgivable for the rest, showing that it is aimed at beginners of gamebooks. If you look for the classical situation where you missed one item somewhere along the path and now can't beat the final boss three hours later... this gamebook does not have it.\n\nSo, this is a gamebook for beginners, and if you get it cheap or in a bundle, you should give it a try, if you enjoy the genre.\n\nRecommended: For gamebook beginners and achievement enthusiasts", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467287348, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1467287358, "recommendationid": "23952568", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525537", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497742983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 143, "steamid": "76561197982399877", "num_games_owned": 362}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Taking from such books as Fighting Fantasy, the book follows the old style gamebooks from the 80s well written and good story should draw anyone willing to read. Good background music, and artwork, and ajustable fonts and extras. The rules are fair and the options off choices on the page is actually better then Fighting fantasy giving you more logical responses then the standard go left and right. Fighting is fluid, my main complaint is that hardcore rules only allow 3 bookmarks which isn't a problem if you plan to play the whole game in one go, there is a casual mode and you don't really have to cheat if you don't want to but still, would liked to have had a hardcore option with unlimited bookmarks. It doesn't really stop you from playing the game hardcore, I think it just prevents you from going back over and over.\n\nAll and all its a good read and you should get the game if you don't mind reading and remembering how to use your mind to picture events, its a interactive novel, that plays like a game, so even though you are reading it as a book, you still feel like it's you living the story.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461445823, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1461445823, "recommendationid": "22596836", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503177", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472227363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 46, "steamid": "76561198031089250", "num_games_owned": 1197}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Not the greatest entry in the long-running CYOA series but an entertaining one at least. If you're the kind of person who likes to roleplay as a thief, or assassin, or generally as a rogue then you'll want to look into buying this one as its focus is on the underworld and the gritty nature of medieval. Whilst this book isn't as punishing as others, like the Forest of Doom and Deathtrap Dungeon, there is a moment where you can instant die if you happen to make a single wrong choice.\n\nThough what I love about An Assassin in Orlandes is that it's stylised to my personal interests in what I seek out of a CYOA book. The choices, the setting, the items you'll find and characters you'll meet add up to create its own world fit for your imagination as that burglar, or thief, or assassin you tend to be. There's little sorcery in this, which might disappoint high fantasy lovers, but given the style this is it is forgivable.\n\nMost importantly, I found the storyline to be linear compared to other CYOA books out there, where it feels more akin to an on-rails experience than decisions being made that totally change where you are going next. This doesn't mean that all your choices are pre-determined, as you can make some that will make getting out of certain situations easier, but it feels like there is a parallel consequence if you decided to bring x item, and left y behind. This also plays into the linearity of the story where specific items are only helpful in specific situations, rather than decking out your character to make willy-nilly free choices. What I really love about books like House of Hell, or afore mentioned Deathtrap Dungeon, were the splitting paths in the story and having your items be more of a general use than a direct choice. In An Assassin in Orlandes, it feels this element is stripped and you're being guided through.\n\nHaving said that, I tend to love these mystery, crime-driven stories that are dark and gritty and focus on that cloak and dagger style - so that helped a ton when it came to liking this one. I did enjoy my time, there are some great choices that will bite you in the butt later on, and other lacklustre ones that feel like padding; to delay the inevitable. I'll definitely recommend An Assassin in Orlandes to fans of CYOA but go in with caution that this probably isn't as open ended as you might expect, but expect a great mystery and some storytelling here.\n\nAnd if you really love this, there's an overview world map in the bonus section as well as chunks of lore ready to immerse you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1472129999, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1472129999, "recommendationid": "25131731", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503461", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456810162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 48, "steamid": "76561198044013162", "num_games_owned": 1694}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Got to the boss castle, died of the plauge.\n\nWould play again.
