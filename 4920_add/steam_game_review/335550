Now he has to solve puzzle, where he has to get a cube to a specific area, to escape this madness. \nThe puzzles are seperated into five world each with 13 level, so quite a lot of puzzle to solve.\nTo solve these about 60 puzzle you first begin with one tool, a magnet, with it you can grab metal cubes and some metals board.\nLater you also get a portal gun, a  merge gun, which merges several cubes to one object so you can grab all of them at once with the magnet and a magnetizing gun, which makes cubes magnetic, so they attract other metal cubes.\nOverall the puzzles aren't that hard except a few and at the end you will also have an endboss, which was kinda annoying in my opinion, but not that big of a deal.\nSo if you like puzzle games, you should buy this game, because it's totally worth it's price, because you will have fun with that game for about 3-4 hours. :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423824798, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423824845, "recommendationid": "14444917", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517807", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499565015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 163, "steamid": "76561198033107016", "num_games_owned": 349}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493306978, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500667486, "recommendationid": "31395437", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485356", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
