Minimalistic funky graphics with great touches and nods to things like space invader inspired floating jellyfish background ambience, weapons that have sound effects at times that seem like a nod to Defender. (the Nova weapon). Wacky characters. Even the character selection screen reminds me of the Ninja Turtles arcade character select screen (in a way). What seems like a simple shoot-em up quickly turns into \"one more game\". Great soundtrack by Gloom also. All around great package. Totally reccomend as a party game if you have multiple controllers :D", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433824046, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433824046, "recommendationid": "16270654", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519892", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
