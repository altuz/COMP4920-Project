Much like 9 doors 9 persons 9 hours, you needed to play through all the routes in order to actually beat the game and get the true end. I have always liked that mechanic because it requires you to build on what you learn from previous runs to get the whole picture.\n\nUnlike 999, which left me feeling like \"Wow! That was so cool how they pulled that all together!\" I finished the game and went \"Oh, that was neat. They really understood the original Anderson story... I feel dead inside now.\" \n\nThe artwork was not the worst I have seen, and the character bodies were actually pretty decent. The issue I had was the with faces. Looking at Sui made my eyes hurt because it felt like his face was constantly out of focused. If that is what the artist was going for, I respect that... I just don't like it. The faces felt rather like someone who was just starting to draw in the anime style, but hadn't quite figured out how to make it their own yet. It didn't take away from the story, but it didn't add either.\n\nOverall, this is a short game and worth beating... once.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499700357, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499700438, "recommendationid": "33433576", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500168848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 116, "steamid": "76561198244710038", "num_games_owned": 27}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "3 out of 5 stars -- Only because it bored me in a way and I paid for this!!\n\nBasically you play as a girl who drowns in the water during swimming time and you wake up with amnesia.

And while the game has its less appealing sides (like the art; or some awkward grammar here and there), I actually found myself enjoying it quite a lot.\n\nAt first, I was surprised about the pacing of the game. A single playthrough consists of 7 days, but each day goes by pretty quickly with basically just a single scene revolving around a character of your choice. Things almost feel rushed at times, but it makes consecutive playthroughs smooth and you don't get the feeling that things are starting to drag on. I suppose that can be both a good or a bad thing, depending on your approach. Personally, I didn't mind it.\n\nThe game has 6 endings, and 4 of those reward you with items that you get to keep permanently across your save files. You need all 4 of those to unlock the True Ending - which is the most fun to experience with some twist and turns and definitely worth the effort to unlock it. Once you get the True Ending, you also get a little bonus in the extras gallery which I found to be a nice touch from the creators. :)\n\nI also liked the music in this title a lot; it works nicely to give that kind of eerie/mysterious atmosphere that I love to experience in games such as these.\n\nSo, kudos to the creators for bringing out quite a unique mystery Visual Novel!
