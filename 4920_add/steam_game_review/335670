It's not in monsters (well, not solely). It's not in just setting up the right atmosphere. It's in inhumanity. To give a brief summary of what LISA is, LISA is this: a look into the worst of people and what will happen when people fall victim to their cravings. Cravings like drugs, women, etc. Honestly, the way I've described this thus far sounds like I'm describing the works of a pretentious artist who assaults canvases with splatters of paint and calls it \"sensitive issue #x\". This game, in addition to being one of the most jarring things I've ever witnessed, is also brilliantly funny. To give a little context, the basic premise of LISA is that the women of the world have up and ... they're gone. This leaves a bunch of men who suddenly, having taken so many things for granted, to spiral down the steps of madness into what they've become, dead, alive, or mutated. Anyways, back to hilarity. In an apocalypse where everything has gone out the window, you'd have to imagine that toilets, let alone a functioning one, are pretty hard to come by. So how do you poo? In one part of the game, you come across a guy named Percy who is attempting to push one out while standing up, but isn't very good at it. You can recruit him to your party by crushing a spider which is rushing towards him and will probably bite him if it gets too close. I don't know why, but that cracked me up. Honestly, the entire game is filled with brilliant jokes, but at the same time, brilliant horror. An example of said brilliant horror? I'm not going to spoil all of it, but at a point in the game, you can reach a place called dismal island. On there you find a sex depraved 'slave lord' named Jim, who will ask you to become his \"sweet boy\" in replacement of \"Jonathan\". The issue is, you're just not Jonathan, and therefore, you're just not cut out to be Jim's sweet boy. What does that mean? The ending of this game especially got me. In the end, you truly understand the struggle of the main character, but at the same time, you understand why the world is againt him. However, over the wide spectrum, you see that nobody truly understands the situation they're in except for Brad, the main character. For once in his life he will see a straight cut goal, something that he can achieve but not fail at like the rest of his life. As Brad says, \"No. You don't understand. I've been dead for 35 years. Today is the day I live\". All of that is pretty vague and the lack of context makes it hard to understand, but the ending will leave you in tears of sadness and joy. Play this game. It has so many interesting characters, jokes, twists, scares, battles, emotions, etc. I won't even make a pro cons list because everything about this game is a pro.

This is one of the strongest stories I have played. The world, the pacing, the dilemma, the goal if there is one, that ending. I tried my best to do all the things by myself and still I missed some. I made it in fifteen and a half hours. It could be made faster, sometimes I just took my time breathing in this world and it's habitats. I've found this game from videogamedunky's video. It was so funny and truthful to the beginning of the game and so deceiving to what this game turned to. Still should play it in PAIN mode... will play it in pain mode.
