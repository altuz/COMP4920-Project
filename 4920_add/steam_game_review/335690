This one shares a few things with their other games: the art isn\u2019t so good (which is okay because the story IS GOOD. At least [b]it\u2019s way better than a lot of other VNs around here[/b]), and [spoiler]there\u2019s a plot twist[/spoiler]. I must say, I found this story rather intriguing; not sure if in a good way tho\u2026 But I played all the routes to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing anything. [spoiler]To be really honest, I thought that it was kinda creepy the relationship between Yukina and Kouichi. I\u2019m not a fan of \u201creplacements\u201d (you know, when someone dies and the other person keeps seeing their deceased beloved one on this new person) so that must be why I didn\u2019t enjoyed his route so much.

I really was disappointed in it even after I was able to manage to get some of the endings. I wasn't eager to get all or even most of them but the happy ones at least.\n\nWhen I first played it I was done with it in a matter of minutes. Disappointing given the fact that I'm used to much better games from roseverte but not only that but it's really to expensive for that. I either expect a hella good game or at least more playtime. I got neither. \n\nThe dialogues are basic and dull. If you played the East tower series you'll might remember that the dialogues there were quite simplistic too but it wasn't bad because all the games had a special kind of cuteness to them. I can't claim the same thing about d'UpLicity. It wasn't emotional or cute, it wasn't intriguing or anything like that. Reading all these dialogues with these impersonal characters was just exhausting and frustrating.\n\nThe gameplay is boring and stupid and not challenging at all (those dayplanner features tend to be repetitive but other visual novel producers manage to do interesting stuff with it). You didn't have to think ahead you just had to choose the same action over and over again. The hints what thing you had to say were so obvious and aaargh... This is - in my opinion at least - the worst game rosevert ever produced. \n\nThere actually isn't much left to say now. The art isn't as bad as most of the people in the reviews claim it to be. It's most definitely not breathtakingly good but it's unique and alright to look at. If the story was good it wouldn't be even worth mentioning.
