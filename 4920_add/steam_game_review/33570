That being said its the best game of its type, still. Its superior to Patrician IV. \n\nThere is some considerable depth beyond the immediate money-making side of the game, there is a whole lot you can do to build up cities, manipulate trade, and play politics. Its not enough to build businesses, you have to create the conditions for new workers to migrate to the town by supplying goods of their class, housing and so on.
