Keep in mind that it still feels very much like an alpha / beta as some skills arent implemented yet (Parrying) or are incredibly time consuming to try and level (Taming). Likewise, there are a few systems that feel like they need a little more tweaking / work, but all things considered, its an ejoyable free-roam-open-world-min/max-exploration RPG.\n\nPros:\n\nMercenary System - Hire followers to help you out in battle, some of whom are actually fairly well scripted (Cleric / Mage / Warrior)\n\nMonster Taming - Tame monsters to fight along side you, each monster has different strengths or reasons as to why you'd use them. However, as of this writing, monsters do not seem to level or gain stats from using them, so you will be forced to swap out weaker monsters for stronger ones, even if you happen to like the one that you already have.\n\nExtensive Skill System - You dont gain levels in the traditional sense, instead your skills dictate your stat growth, and how powerful your character is. There also does not appear to be any restriction on skills, so if you enjoy min/maxing like I do, you can master everything with enough time invested.\n\nMaps - In game maps have been introduced, which mark the locations of enemies near you, and points of interest near you (chests, items, entrances / exits)\n\nOpen World - The guild hall in the first town will give you occasional hints at things you can do within the world, pointing you in the direction of places to explore. However, you are allowed to run around and play any way that you'd like, which is a pro in my opinion.\n\nMouse Movement, Hotkeys, and User Interface - Everything is done by clicking to move or to attack an enemy, and spells or items can be set to a hotbar (1-9) for easy access during combat. Likewise, the user interface is very well done and somewhat reminiscent of Ragnarok Online. It is easily one of the most innovative systems that I have seen created on the RPGMaker engine.\n\nCons:\n\nSubpar English Translation - The text and content is fairly unintelligible in a lot of dialogues. Luckily, everything is fairly easy to figure out on its own. I have heard that they are working on this, but as of right now, a lot of the text just simply does not make sense in english.\n\nMagic System - While this is actually a pretty interesting and well done system on its own, it can be rather frustrating to try and figure out what spells require which reagents. It would be nice if the description of a spell also included what reagents it required, but as for now, just buy 10 of every reagent and cast a spell; to figure out what reagent that spell requires. (Then buy more, if you plan on using that spell).\n\nLack of Explanation on Skills - This may just be a symptom of the poor english translation, but it would be nice if skills were explained a bit better. Most are easy enough to figure out, but I would want to know (for instance) how much raising my skills influences my strength and HP growth. That is to say, what secondary effects skills influence, other than the obvious 'You have a higher to-hit with attacks.'\n\nLack of Content / Storyline - There is already a lot to do within the game, places to explore and chests to plunder. While I havent accomplished everything, or killed every monster (Dragons, Giants, and Demons are rough) it definitely feels like it needs more content. I enjoy the open-world-free-roam aspect, it would be nice if there was more of a quest system or loose storyline to explore. \n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nFor the price, I might say to wait on it a little bit longer, for some of the systems to be fleshed out and more content to be introduced, but it is definitely playable, and I have not ran into any game-breaking bugs personally. Its fun and enjoyable for what it is, but if the idea of just building up a character and exploring (without any real direction from a storyline) doesnt sound fun to you, you may want to pass. That being said, I happen to be having a blast with this little game, and I look forward to future updates. =]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422599852, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422599852, "recommendationid": "14236483", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549165", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1422774639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 229, "steamid": "76561198031705078", "num_games_owned": 53}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Very interesting game, I feel like it should be put in a \"Pre-Alpha\" or a \"Beta\" stage due to the fact that the maker says that there will be many more areas to explore to come, and everything else I might add.

There's some genuine desire to make a game that's an homage to the Ultima Online style of gameplay and I can't help but admire that. Unfortunately, there's a lot of laziness going on here.\n\nLet's talk about the elephant in the room here. That this is an RPGMaker game isn't a bad thing, but usage of stock sprites, sound effects, and music is always something that can and should knock points off.  Pushing that aside, an RPGMaker game can still succeed well in spite of this by focusing on the gameplay.  Here, Tkl starts off alright.  The game's a little rough around the edges for the first hour, but enjoyable. You're getting loot from monsters and chests, exploring, learning new skills, all that good stuff.  Then you clear the first dungeon.\n\nThen the trouble starts.  Exploring the world is something anyone does in these sorts of games, but when you do find civilizations away from Orbis? Half the doors don't work.  No, that doesn't mean that there's nothing there. What it means is when you try to exit these doors from the inside, you fail to area transition.  The game still thinks you're outside while you're stuck inside and then the game hangs. No save, no load, no quitting save for alt+f4.  Given that you buy upgrades and reagents to progress, this isn't a small issue. This is a big issue.\n\nSuppose you decide to forego this and grab treasure from chests? 75% of the chests in the world don't work.  You'll open it, the game will play a tune and go \"You got an item!\" and then... nothing. You get NOTHING! This is such a glaring flaw in a game that's emulating UO, especially how gear-driven this game is. With all the time saved by not having to worry about creating your own sprite sheets, one would think populating the chests in the game would be important to reward exploration.\n\nPlease show your games you make more love, as dedicating this game to the fans of T2A has got to be one of the biggest insults any UO player has ever had to endure.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1483474557, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1483474557, "recommendationid": "28986552", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510511", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1425270863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1517, "steamid": "76561198025779455", "num_games_owned": 342}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "From what I've played so far, the game is buggy but playable!\n\nDuring the start of the game, the first thing you might notice is the translation. Not everything has been converted to english yet. The images in the tutorial section still uses the Japanese screenshots, which I don't mind, but it might confuse some players. The game is very open ended... I found myself wandering around trying to figure out what to do, but eh, I don't mind randomly killing mobs and getting stronger.\n\nA bug I've encountered so far was during Taming. There are some times when I select to tame monster, the \"TAMING\" notice doesn't appear, yet I have a channeling bar on my head (nothing happens at all when I finish channel), I also end up aggroing the monster... Oh, I have trouble going through doors sometimes, just a minor thing.\n\nI don't have much to say about the music in the game, it's very good. There are a few tracks I love listening to at the moment. \u2665\n\nOh yeah, I'm currently playing a Mage.\n\nMages seem pretty difficult to play as a first character, since it requires reagents to use spells. I found myself running out of reagents during a fight and had to Transfer Stone back to the Magic Shop to buy more. I wouldn't mind it, but I burn through these spells like mad, and I'm almost broke because of it.\n\nThere's also a list on their website that shows which spell uses what reagents, would be nice if it was shown in game as well, just for the convenience. (Not everyone is willing to open a browser to view reagents.)\n\nThe combat system is very reminiscent of that of Ragnarok Online. I remember those days when I was trying to kite around monsters while using fast casting spells to whittle down thier HP, only to find myself clicking too slow--- making my character move torward the monster instead... resulting in my death. (I miss those pure int, soul strike days)\n\nCombat takes place in the world. There's no transition from world to battle field at all, which is very surprising for me, as it's the first game RPG Maker I've played that does this.\n\nIn the end, this game feels like an early beta, it's got a lot of stuff done right, but needs polishing and debugging. If you like these type of games, and don't mind the game being a little buggy, by all means, go for it! Else, wait a bit for the developer to add a bit more polish and content before ultimately deciding! I'm going to update as I play more of the game, the last \"offline mmo\" I've played on PC was Numen...
