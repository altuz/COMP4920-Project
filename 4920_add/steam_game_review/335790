I'll give it that. I enjoy the finding a word and the variety of minigames.\n\nThat's about it though. I hate how there's no progress. I have no clue if I am playing to beat 30 monsters to get to the next level, if it is random or if I need to something. I just spent 45 minutes on a level and don't know if I was any closer to finishing it. I eventually quit. Did it safe? Didn't it? I have no clue, because when I reopen the game, it'll look exactly the same.\n\nThis dictionary is also ridiculous. Some of the words in anagram sections are so obscure that when I look up definitions online, google shrugs and asks if I meant something else.\n\nThe actual mechanics are lacking. Whenever I try to connect letters diagonally, it more often than not will skip horizontally or vertically instead of where I want to drag it. \n\nOverall, I paid about $1 for this game and I barely feel like I got my money's worth.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491877957, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491877957, "recommendationid": "31071121", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482255", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 184, "total_reviews": 234, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 50}}
