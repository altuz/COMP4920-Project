I, along with many others, were devastated - this game has many concepts that only come together cleanly here.  Then SUBA picked it up and now it is back and just as wonderful as ever!  Some games have similar concepts that this game does, but DoMO brings them through the best, and though the graphics are a bit chunky, that is part of the lovely charm of the game. =^_^=", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486592564, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486592564, "recommendationid": "29790590", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520290", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487190481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 862, "steamid": "76561198134016995", "num_games_owned": 44}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Its a good game if you have the time to play XD\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486939585, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486939585, "recommendationid": "29884690", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497090", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
