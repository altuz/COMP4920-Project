Played a little of this game while it was in development and loved it as well.\n\nAngels of Fasaria RPG (Single Player) has that old school RPG feel to it and has a decent story.  It's a lot of fun. The problem is that it is a very short lived adventure.\n\nMMORPG - a seperate game, but comes as part of the package is not even remotely close to being fun.  It is extremely rough to get started as you struggle to beat any creatures at level 1. It is also a MAJOR grindfest when it comes to leveling.  On top of that, it's an even BIGGER grindfest to get currency to get gear.  The game is an amatuer project and came after the production of the single player game years ago.  How it ended up being so much worse is crazy.\n\nThywill, the sole developer of these games, does also bribe purchasers to give postive reviews through private messages here on Steam.  So take a really close look at the quality of the reviews of those who are giving this a thumbs up for recommendation.
