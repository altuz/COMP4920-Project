As Neojac did not list a reason I may only assume the reason why is posts made that factually pointed out reasons not to purchase the game when others asked.\n\nIt likely also had to do by reposting an e-mail that Neojac sent to me (and all Atavism users) on June 5th stating that all Atavism accounts were hacked and all usernames and passwords had been given out.\n\nNot only were my posts deleted a great number of posts which commented on the negative qualities of Atavism was deleted.\n\nOddly enough a thread asking for those who created a project with Atavism that was in Beta likewise was deleted. \n\nAs posted on the offical fourms by a user who is not me was the question if Atavsim3 will come up with a new price tag. This is due to with Atavism 2 the team of Atavism created a new MMO (Arcfall) and then asked Atavism users to stress test it which halted the working on the unstable patch (which fixed the problem of them being hacked).\n\nThese are the reasons why I cannot recommend you purchasing this product. Not due to the $399 entry price point which requires $4000 for the full upgrade, not even due to Neojac banning people without a reason (reason spot was blank), but because there is less expensive, better coded and maintained software on the Unity store.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt has been about a year since I purchased Atavism and I wrote my initial review which was a negative. After which the developer Neojac spoke to me and worked on some issues. In the end he asked me to change my review to a positive one which I did. So here is the update.\n\nOver a year later the project is not finished. The road map has changed and the product I purchased is no longer the one sold here. Instead the company has moved from a MMO creation tool kit to offering hosting so you can create a MMO. Gone is the dream of creating as many MMOs you want (be it just small worlds for your friends or developing several to see what someone might like and then focusing on what the people choose) as the license is now for one world not unlimited. Likewise the new starter package now offers less people being able to log on then the previous, however one thing has changed the price. It has gone up.\n\nNow the increase in price seems to be focused on the new strategy of this company which is to create a monthly service where they will host the server they rent to you. $24 a month gives you a small development server so you can build your game upwards to a few hundred a month to have a game with a limit of 2000 people on at once. (Neojac mentioned this was due to the belief that games with more people could afford to pay them more).\n\nI do not fault them for turning to a subscription based plan after all a company needs money to survive. The problem however lies in the fact that this is not a finished product. Also users such as myself paid money which was going to a finished product which no longer will exists. Legacy members such as myself was given an option when this change in services occurred. Either pay several hundred dollars within a few months to upgrade our package or we would need to pay the new upgrade price $3000.\n\nNow to the product itself. It is not finished, the developers have worked hard and what is there is pleasant. However programming is needed to make this MMO despite the claims. One of the licenses is to have access to the engine in order to program changes. Likewise UMA which is a tool used in Unity (for creating multiple characters) while supported nicely in Atavism will require some coding knowledge to fully utilize. On the official Atavism Skype channel the users will mention that yes coding is needed and will recommend at least a year\u2019s worth of C# classes to know what you are doing.\n\nIn conclusion due to the lack of a grandfather clause for the product I purchased being standard (it is a case by case basis), the change of the business plan to have me the developer pay this company additional money for my success, and no real end in sight for when this product will be completed I cannot recommend it. I apologize for changing my initial stance of not recommending this product when asked to do so I had believed things would be quite different and I should have waited until the product being sold was a reality.\n\n\n-------------\nAtavism uses Unity allowing it to compile to many platforms (including Android now). An added benefit is these platforms can play with one another. It is a powerful tool and does make things such as make many task such as building the game world and adding quest chains much easier.\n\nAnyone wanting to make a full scale MMO is going to need a team.  A team will need to know how to use Atavism (http://atavismonline.com/forum/tutorials) they will need to know how to use Unity and unless they are going to outsource all artwork in the game they are going to need to know how to use software such as Blender. Having someone that knows C# and Java is needed as well.\n\nThe other route is making a persitant role playing world. Either something for friends table topping or along the lines of the old RPing NWN & NWN2 persitant worlds.
