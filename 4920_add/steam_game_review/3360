Mechanically Dubious. Audiovisually underpar. Derivative. Less outdated and just as underwhelming experiences are out there\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/335220/But_to_Paint_a_Universe/\n\nReview: This is a match3 inspired clicker game in which you simply click on a circle and every adjacent circles of the same color pop and fill a gauge. While it might seem like there could be strategy involved the best way to play is to just brute force your way by spam clicking on everything as there is no penalty for failed clicks. All in all the concept is flawed and mechanically too simplistic. The audio work is rather poor, and the cheap 2D scrooge type face that cheers you on falls flat."}]}
