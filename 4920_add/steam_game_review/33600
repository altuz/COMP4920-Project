Despite its age, I'd say it's held up well for a hidden object/puzzle adventure and my only criticism is how long it takes to interact with objects and other characters when your character moves relatively slowly (perhaps I've become impatient from playing games with a 'sprint' function). Other than that, it's tr\u00e8s bon! ****"}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499023998, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484139", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33148749", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198389885042", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1503775295, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 579}, "timestamp_updated": 1499023998, "received_for_free": false, "review": "thers no way you got anything of your rights"}]}
