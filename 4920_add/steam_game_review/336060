I recommend using a weight to hold down the shooting key. You can switch your weapons and use screen clearing bombs. But there are two factors, that make this game hold up and stand out. You don't die in one or even a few hits, because you have shields and armor, and you don't have a proper bullet hell, so it doesn't get too crowded on the screen japanese style. It is still a good game, runs smooth (24fps though) and looks good. What more do you need?\n\nFollow my curatorpage at http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28337205-Fair-Minded-Witness/?appid=402180", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505501616, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505501885, "recommendationid": "34978852", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500450", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 115, "total_reviews": 143, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 28}}
