Otherwise, it's a fast-paced sh-mup like Raptor where enemies comes from left, right, but mostly up/front.\n\nYour fighter can swap between 'red mode' and 'blue mode'. In red mode, you absorb red bullets and gets damage by blue bullets, and vice versa. Obviously you have to switch based on your tactical situation: sky too crowded? Switch colors to absorb the shot. Remember though, enemy will adapt with you. You can be accompanied by up to 4 drones and depending on which powerup you nabbed you can be joined by wingmen and more. As you fly through debris of enemies you pick up dropped \"coins\" and whatnot which you can spend on upgrades.   \n\nOne thing that sets this game apart somewhat is location-based damage, as the ship can take damage in 4 different locations, and the drones have their own individual life meter. \n\nThere are three different fighters, with different default strengths (heavy defense, heavy offence, average). There are over a dozen upgrade options, and three pilots each with different skill tree (there are only 5 skills each though). One pilot is mostly offense, one's mostly defense, and one's a drone expert. \n\nGame itself is simple. Fight your way through various planets and moons against baddies, enough said. If you finish a particular world (3 levels), you get to play \"escape stage\" where you are running away from a boss and you use your rear guns against it and the missiles it shoots at you, and if you get away you get a lot of bonus bucks you can use for upgrades. \n\nThe sh-mup is an very old genre, and the \"polarity\" system had been done before, but the skill tree, pilot, fighter, and upgradeable parts makes the game seem rather fresh. other than the game looks a \"little\" low-res on a 1680x1050 screen, I see no downside to this game. Sound is average with a proper adrenaline sound-track. \n\nWorth a try if you like the genre.  But read the manual before you start. There is no help within the game that explains the color system.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430991167, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430991167, "recommendationid": "15724302", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509914", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452191317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 169, "steamid": "76561197988922281", "num_games_owned": 2013}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I don't know if this game is supposed to be an homage to old school shmups because it sure as heck doesn't tell you so.. or anything else which possibly could be of use to the player for that matter. It almost seems like this game tries to bite off more than it can chew, resulting in what feels like a watered down shooter that doesn't excel at anything.\n\nI don't write negative reviews lightly (this being my second). I generally just don't bother with 'mediocre' or lower game but in some cases I do care. So from an almost 3 hour play session (which is more than lenient for this type of game) this is what I got from it.\n\n- Damage Numbers: By default, this setting is enabled which may be 'fun' in the beginning but later on just serves as more crap and distraction on the screen and doesn't really add anything useful whatsoever.\n- RPG Element: I usually enjoy RPG elements in games when it's done right.. but it does absolutely nothing for me here. It feels like a boring linear treadmill which almost seems required to progress which is pretty absurd for a shmup.\n- Color/Absorb/Polarity: A nice mechanic popularized by Ikaruga but falls a bit short here. Players unfamiliar with Ikaruga will either have to stumble upon it, get it from the subtle one-time 'hint' in the game or read it from the achievement you get for switching colors.\n\nTo cut things short, I'll speed it up a bit.. The UI is unpleasant to navigate; in-game HUD is very bland; Hitpoints for the player's ship are localized to separate ship parts/drones which is useless because it's not like you have any real control of it; enemies often seems to have too much HP regardless if you 'specialized' for damage; and the bonus level seems to be bugged unless you're not supposed to move and tank sporadic rockets that sway towards your ship until you die because I can't imagine shooting all of them down whilst also trying to wittle down the 'boss' of it's seemingly infinite HP.\n\nThere's probably more minor grievances that I have with this game but despite of everything I just wrote, I would be okay with this game if it wasn't for the dreadful sound effects. I have never played a shmup that felt less satisfying than this one does. The sound effects are very bland to the point that there's no sense of impact when you shoot or kill an enemy ship.. not only is it unsatisfying to shoot and kill, it makes it somewhat difficult to tell where and when you actually kill an enemy. For a game that revolves around wrecking swarms of enemy ships and crafts, this makes for a very dull and boring experience.\n\nBut that's not all unfortunately because the horribleness of sound effects stretches even further.. Now I am not a rookie at these types of games but in certain levels it throws so much crap at you that I'd be surprised if you can come out of it unscathed. Calling it bullet hell feels degrading towards other actual bullet hell games so I usually like to call it 'bs hell' as that's what it is. In other words, you will sometimes get hit quite a bit. ..and when you're in the middle of taking all of those hits in a bullet infestation, it really.. really doesn't help that taking damage sounds like you're being smacked on the the side by a muppet.. or stung by a swarm of muppets for that matter. Because that's not a sound that makes you think you're in trouble or may be about to die. If it wasn't clear.. by muppet I mean a little puppet that makes a squeeky sound when you squeeze it. ..it's horrible. But on the flipside, after an hour playing listening to it your ears become immune and you'll start thinking that colliding with enemy spaceships only tickles you and you're immortal.. ..well, until you see your ship crashing down that is.\n\nAnd with that, I think I have said enough. Honestly, I do think this game has/had potential but it just seems that it tries too much whilst the most essential parts of the game fall behind unfortunately. One thing I did enjoy was the music.. but for some reason it's random as heck which doesn't distinguish the stages/tilesets from each other and makes each level as forgettable as the last.. which sadly is also true for the game as a whole.\n\nAs a fan of this genre in general, I can not by the life of me recommend this game at it's full asking price. Perhaps the multiplayer/co-op could be fun, but alas like most of these games it's local only. And even then, I would advice just getting it on a sale because there's far better out there for your money's worth.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452196464, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452196595, "recommendationid": "20381756", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523692", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450217128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 250, "steamid": "76561198015466047", "num_games_owned": 339}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The graphics and sound effects don't have the \"kick\" I crave in a shmup, very little is explained about the controls, and the menus are annoying to navigate through (there's a certain fluidity that's missing, hard to explain).\n\nThat's all I can knock Sky Mercenaries for.\n\nThe rest of the game is a blast.

The RPG elements seemed cool to me and the Ikaruga-like color swapping held some appeal as well.\n\nBut the game is not good. Technically it runs alright but I encountered bugs with it not displaying an icon on my taskbar. The UI is lifeless, the music is horrible (really poor quality on the menus and ingame) and doesn't feel inspired or interesting in any way, the ship customization+player customization+drone customization is done very badly. You don't get any real description of what anything does, and the little bars that gauge offense and defense don't make sense. On the ship selection screen they work one way and on the drone upgrade screen they work in the opposite way. \n\nThe levels are typical for a SCHMUP but your ship+drones take up a ton of the screen. It is really hard to avoid getting hit (which makes the Ikaruga-like color swapping mechanic useful) and things just feel really... unpolished.

I disagree, and will explain why.  First off, it would largely be a generic shmup if not for the polarization / bullet-absorption mechanic a la \"Ikaruga\" or the latter \"eXceed\" games.  It's well-implemented here, for a fun and satisfying level of challenge -- and the 'Overloads' take the mechanic to its (super fun) logical conclusion IMO.\n\nAdditionally, the music is absolutely fantastic.  With a nearly album-length soundtrack of original compositions made specifically for THIS game, it sets the mood perfectly and is absolutely perfect for getting into that \"Matrix zone\" trance and blast some motherf*ckers!!  It's a nice electronic soundtrack that reminds me of classic arcade shmups but with a kind of dubsteppy feeling (but without its by-the-numbers drops, and nothing obnoxious or distracting).  A HUGE thing, just added in one of the most recent updates, is Steam Workshop functionality -- you can make and d/l levels for the game, meaning ENDLESS replayability.  The RPG elements also add a lot of value, and customization to the game -- instead of purely collecting coins for score, you are able to use them for a number of upgrade systems.  NO, it's NOT an RPG... but they said \"elements\"!  There's a difference.  Lastly, the developers have been GREAT so far -- diligently listening to, working with, and participating in the community; even releasing same-day hot-fixes for the problems we report!\n\nThat brings me to my next point.  Almost every issue people have brought up in the negative reviews has been addressed by the dev team.  This game is great fun, and is getting consistently better.  In an environment where LOTS of games get released horribly broken, you can't really fault a small independent team for having some problems at release.  But..

In general game demand you to learn abilities of your ship and here lies key to all gameplay - enemy shhot you with blue and red fire DON'T dodge - switch ship in required mode by right mouse button and catch them when meter is filled you get overload which damage all near enemies and destroy all enemy projectiles, but destroy all other stuff. Bosses have same weakness - last one is hard cause you will got slowbug when destroy it's rocket barrage and you will need good ship - but it's zone is VERY rich to money and exp so farm and eventually it will fall before you. Also plus is random zones after all and lvl up system for pilots - no to whole dat farm - 5 lvl = all abilities.\nGame has minuses  - old type of graphics but today some games also have retro style and have good reputation (Binding of Isaac) and price - but discount solve the problem. So game is worth to buy and play. Bugs are fixed, achievements are working - so buy and enjoy it so much as you can.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431548392, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431548392, "recommendationid": "15816283", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497218", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462732312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 200, "playtime_forever": 125, "steamid": "76561197987999692", "num_games_owned": 1545}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "pretty decent shoot em up, seems to run fine on my 4930K GTX970SLI rig. i like the RPG elements of the game, just keep playing and keep upgrading, it makes the harder levels easier. it gets a little repetitious, but thats where the grinding comes into play.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442657245, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442657245, "recommendationid": "18096826", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496894", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502086249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 146, "playtime_forever": 186, "steamid": "76561198093363183", "num_games_owned": 453}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very boring.
