Later I discovered that this game was releasd on many consoles. So it surely was designed for gamepads. \nThere was some bad decisions like 3D or no mouse controls , but in other aspects, game is faithful to its ancestors.\nThere really should be steam warning \"xbox controller is strongly recomended\" \n\nMy rating 78%\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1496225928, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32082350", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198031994154", "num_reviews": 41, "last_played": 1496386779, "num_games_owned": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 632}, "timestamp_updated": 1496857485, "received_for_free": false, "review": "BS3 features a great Indiana Jones-like story with excellent writing and lots of references to the first game. Voiceovers are awesome (Especially George), and graphics and music score are also good. Puzzles are generally very good, altough the abundance of crate-based puzzles occationally makes the game feel like an advanced version of sokoban.\n\nThe obvious problem is the 3D mechanics wich just doesnt cater adventuregames very well. The shoddy camera angels never show you what you want to see, and the angle arbitrarily changes when you move about which is confusing and annoying. Then again, if you have a proper controller (I recommend the xbox360 controller), you can leisurely enjoy this on the TV which can be nice for some casual gaming.\n\nAlthough not as enjoyable as the first games, I still highly recommend this for everyone without fatal 3D-allergies."}]}
