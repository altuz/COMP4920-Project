As a base game you know you're buying it because it has the Rooster Teeth name on it because they're an epic group of people. As a game though, it is lackluster and should have stayed as a mobile game.\n\nIn the first hour of play I noticed the following things that stopped me from playing it again:\n\n-Characters attack automatically. This seems like a good thing at first but when my character was firing a shotgun at long range and wasting bullets I kind of have a problem with it. The auto-attack also made my character shoot walls if the zombiens were turning around a corner. \n\n-I bought this game for the Rooster Teeth part of the game. It is pretty awesome in that regard but much like any RTS, every single movement click makes the character say something. With limited voice acting clips for movement this gets annoying pretty quickly. I love Gavin, but I don't want him to say \"Oh you found some gubs?\" one more time.\n\n-Waves start automatically when you kill the last enemy, not allowing you to check for weapons, move around the map, or set up defenses properly. A \"Next Wave\" button would be greatly appreciated.\n\n-The game ends when your starting character dies instead of when the last of your party dies when you find other RT members. This is probably intended but I would have preferred if you lost when the entire group was finished, not just your main character.\n\n-Other bugs like getting stuck in the floor and I can't maximize the game because it's a mobile port so clicking messes up. The lack of settings is also pretty annoying. No fullscreen or resolution options to fix this so I'm playing on a tiny window. I may as well have bought it on my tablet instead.\n\n-Camera moving sensitivity is... very sensitive. This is minor but it's something you do a LOT in a game so it's important, and there's no settings to turn it down.\n\n5 dollars isn't a lot of money so I don't think it was that much of a waste but I would have enjoyed this much more of some of these issues were addressed. I would probably buy the game on my tablet instead and see if it's any better as an actual mobile game but I sadly don't want to spend any more money on this game.\n\nI'd rather put the money towards another Rooster Teeth shirt to match my other three.\n\n\n\nIn summary, I do not recommend this game. The port isn't that good, even if you buy this game just for the Rooster Teeth portion of the game like I did. The game needs work. Maybe the game isn't as bad on mobile, which it was originally made for. If you want to buy this game, buy it on your large Iphone, Samsung, or a tablet to play on instead.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420199375, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1420199375, "recommendationid": "13781999", "language": "english", "votes_down": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561990", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454898705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 488, "steamid": "76561198119890290", "num_games_owned": 73}, "votes_funny": 16, "votes_up": 26, "comment_count": "1", "review": "It's a great game to play if you are a fan of the company.

Unless all RTS games have these as basic rules, Zombiens is rather poorly made. Let me give you a rundown of the game before I get into the problems.\n\nThe plot revolves around a spaceship crashing into the Rooster Teeth office and release zombie aliens that the protagonist dubs \u201cZombiens\u201d. You go around the Rooster Teeth office, collecting weapons and materials to survive various waves, being helped by Rooster Teeth employees you come across. In order to find them, you must use money to unlock doors to different parts of the office.\n\nHowever, here is problem #1: their locations are not only randomly generated, but impossible to discover until you\u2019ve spent over a hundred dollars on a door, only to find healing items inside. Finding an employee to help you is an invaluable asset, and practically required before the third wave unless you either A) use guns (which I\u2019ll get to in a second), or B) get super lucky and find enough healing items to recover from the damages of the first two waves. Believe me, if you don\u2019t have full health or a ranged weapon, the Plague Carriers will demolish you - they deal bleeding damage and have high defenses, so this early in the game, even a full-health character may have trouble.\n\nProblem #2: the weapons are distributed through vending machines. They also cost money, and are also randomly generated - not the locations, but which vending machine has which item. Not a problem, right? But some vending machines are inside those locked rooms. I have, many times, started with a primary gun-user, only for the immediately available vending machines to have swords or bats. I unlock the Achievement Hunter office, find a shotgun vending machine, have no money to buy one, and promptly headdesk while the Plague Carriers devour my delicious fleshy form.\n\nProblem #3: the game has problems involving clicking. If you click on a barricade to start destroying it, your character will walk over to a designated spot around the barricade to attack it. Said designated spot will often require your character to walk away from the barricade directly in front of him, down the hall, around several rooms, and to the other side of the barricade before you attack it. I am not kidding.\n\nFurthermore, the game seems to register enemy clicks poorly; if you aren\u2019t exact with your click, your character will just move to that spot and stand there for a second before attacking the enemy automatically. (I\u2019m glad they implemented the auto-attack, though. No downsides to that whatsoever, unless for some reason you don\u2019t want to waste your weapon\u2019s durability.)\n\nProblem #4: of course, glitches. The most infuriating is that, sometimes, your character won\u2019t pick up health items. Unlike the usual way of picking up items (by holding down the click button to draw all items in), you have to walk your character on top of the healing item to use it. And sometimes it will not realize your guy is standing on top of a pizza trying to eat it. This can easily screw you over, if you\u2019re making a quick retreat for healing before going back into the fray.\n\nThere are more glitches, too. When you try to buy something from a vending machine, it sometimes won\u2019t work for some reason. I have, once again, been screwed because it wouldn\u2019t let me buy a pistol I needed. So even when you do find the randomly generated weapon that you desperately need, there\u2019s a chance you won\u2019t get it anyway, regardless of money.\n\nProblem #5, and the biggest one: there is no way to check the strengths or weaknesses of a character in game. Once you find Gavin in the Achievement Hunter office or Barbara in Support or whatever, what will you give them? You\u2019ll probably have them buy the closest thing, like a saw or a bat, because you can\u2019t check what they\u2019re good with unless you exit the game/die, go to the main menu, and look through your character stats. You just have to guess, and then even better, somehow remember the stats of specific characters when you find them again - stats that make no sense. (Gavin is amazing with firearms in the game. In real life, he really isn\u2019t, and nobody will ever see the logic in giving him one.)\n\nThis game needs work. It\u2019s a great concept and I love the design of the office, but\u2026 seriously, unless these \u201cproblems\u201d are RTS staples (in which case I will never play another RTS), this game needs a V2 that fixes so, so much.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423077331, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423077331, "recommendationid": "14328517", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506398", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499605017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 832, "steamid": "76561198175086630", "num_games_owned": 535}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a fun game to play.

I'll go ahead and say 7.3/10 and there can be some major improvements, if anyone actually still looks at this game to find the bugs, glitches, and game breakers", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431828457, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431828457, "recommendationid": "15864035", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495751", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1422627522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 211, "steamid": "76561198043583661", "num_games_owned": 81}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is without an doubt one of the easiest wave survival games i have played.\nThe Difficulty dont seem to increase as you go up in waves, making the game boring in lenght. \nThere are some minor glitches that can make you stuck in a table or make a zombie spawn in a room you cant get into (blocked by rubble)\n\nBut with its low cost its a fun and simple game to enjoy for a short while.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422630252, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422630252, "recommendationid": "14241510", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498576", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423097616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 111, "steamid": "76561197984945894", "num_games_owned": 184}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you are a RoosterTeeth fan like me, this is a great little game.
