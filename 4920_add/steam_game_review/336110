It is packed with easy achievements and a variety of weapons and enemy's. Bloody Streets is a great time killer. \n\n\nThe core gameplay of Bloody Streets is sprinting and gunning down zombies, while trying to stay alive and resupplying between rounds. Wave after wave of numerous enemy's with a thirst for blood will rush the player attempting to kill them. The enemy's include slow and fast zombies, spiders, maggots, giant zombies, and exploding zombies. \n\n\nBloody Streets has many options available for disposing of hostiles. Different rifles, shotguns, pistols and even your melee ability can be used on the undead hoard. Environmental weapons also make quick work of them; such as trains, saw blades, and even mines can be used to defend yourself. The player is also able to activate \"rage\" where the player spins rapidly with knives in hand, immune to damage for a short duration. \n\n\nThe art and sound design of Bloody Streets is solid, the artsy design and the drawn cutscenes for the game are very well done and fit the game well. The high energy rock for background music makes the game feel more intense. The music, however, seems to cut out when you take to much time  during a wave and is slightly repetitive. \n\n\nBloody Streets does a lot of things right. \n\n\nHigh energy game\n\nGreat time killer \n\nReally easy achievements \n\nGreat variety \n\nFantastic art design \n\n\n\nBloody Streets does have a few issues. \n\n\nCan get boring quickly\n\nMusic seems to have some bugs and is repetitive \n\nThe ending seemed rushed \n\nLack of context in the story\n\nFeels like a flash game \n\n\n\n\nOverall Bloody Streets is a well made, fairly fun game. The cost of $5.49CND is over priced unless the player is attempting to get 100% of the achievements. If Bloody Streets is on sale I suggest picking it up, it's a fantastic game to kill time with and is a good amount of fun. \n\nHave a good one.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1483312207, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1483312207, "recommendationid": "28920239", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514664", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467858348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 507, "playtime_forever": 89, "steamid": "76561197967992446", "num_games_owned": 822}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Bloody Streets is a top-down kill-em-all arena shooter that looks good at first glance, but when the finer details of the game come out, it's kind of... irritating to play? \n\nThe problem with so many \"dumb\" shoot-em-all arena horde style games is that sometimes, the finer details of how the game works can be easy to skimp on. Like enemy spawn placement, ammo count, that sort of thing.\nBloody Streets, while being an otherwise fine game, does a bunch of these things in a way that made me grind my gears.\n\nHere's a few examples while playing:\n\n1: You can choose from many weapons in your arsenal as you go through the game, but at the beginning you are stuck with a shitty rifle that doesn't do much of anything at the hordes. Oh, and it has a very low ammo count, so you'll inevitably run out of ammo trying to shoot all the zombies. That means at some point you'll be surrounded by zombies and suddenly out of ammo (which is a bad design decision because it breaks the flow of the game, and forces the player to have to run through crowds to gather ammo pickups that are not big enough to keep the shooting going). But when that happens and you run away from the zombies, whatever zombies are remaining off-screen get deleted by the game, and eventually the game tells you \"It's time to kill these five zombies to advance to the next level!\" MOTHERFUCKER I WASN'T FINISHED SHOOTING THESE ZOMBIES IN THE FACE, IT'S NOT MY FAULT YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME ENOUGH AMMO. PUT THOSE ZOMBIES BACK, I AM A LEAN MEAN ZOMBIE MURDER MACHINE AND I AM NOT GETTING THE SERVICE I WANT AT THIS ZOMBIE MURDER RESTAURANT.\n\n2: This game has a high-score mechanic, and you get the best scores by having zombies eat bullets, having crowds of zombies crowdshare a grenade, or by leading them onto the railroad tracks into the path of a passing train. \nYou also get a rapidly increasing bonus depending on how many zombies you can cram into your kill streak. That's my jam - but unfortunately, if the zombies even get close enough to breathe on you, you lose that streak. And if you like to back towards the buildings while shooting zombies like I like to do, the game likes to spawn zombies that come out of the building just right behind you and BOOM, STREAK'S OVER. HOPE YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT S RANK, BUBBY, BECAUSE A ZOMBIE'S GOT IT NOW.\n\n3: Like I mentioned earlier, the starting weapons are shit and there's too low of a starting ammo count for them. This would be fine if this were a game about survival and creative problem-solving of zombie hordes, but this is a game about being a badass who can turn into the Tasmanian Devil when he gets angry enough. Games like this usually provide enough ammo to keep the flow of murder going, which is why you never run out of ammo for a weapon in a game like Crimsonland, or you have more than enough ammo to get the job done in a first person shooter like Doom. Being forced to stop shooting to run away to run around and pick up enough ammo to keep a sustained assault going not only breaks flow, but is not fun.\n\nAll of this is not to say that Bloody Streets is a bad game - it's competent enough to allow anyone probably a couple of hours of stupid gleeful death - but it's not good enough to be satisfying like the games it's trying to be like. It's okay, but it could be BETTER. For me, I keep seeing how much better the game could be and I'm disappointed, because there aren't a whole lot of games that are like Crimsonland and even fewer of them are actually good.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467733173, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1467733173, "recommendationid": "24111846", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503744", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489860528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 93, "steamid": "76561198060931144", "num_games_owned": 187}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Bloody Streets is an addicting top down shooter that lets you kill a lot of zombies.

At the start of each of the 24 stages (set across four chapters, each with its own distinct setting) you'll select one of seven unlockable weapons, then battle your way through with the help of pick-ups in the shape of extra health, ammo and grenades as you rack up combo kills and amass points. A rank will be awarded at the end of every stage based on your points, but it doesn't really count for anything special aside from bragging rights, I guess.\n\nOther treats come in the form of environmental hazards, such as trains, mines, cars, crushers, flames, blades and good old-fashioned exploding barrels. And also to aid you is a Rage mode, a super attack that turns you into an invulnerable tornado of spinning, bladed glory for a limited time, activated by collecting orbs from downed enemies. There's a little bit of a story to the game, the action being told through very brief, comic book style panels at the very start and end of the game, but it really amounts to nothing more than zombies are happening, gun-toting bad*ss shoots them all up, the end. But at least the panels look pretty.\n\nThe game in general is nice enough to look at, in fact, being a welcome change of colour and brightness that most zombie themed games will usually stay well away from. Although, overall, as nice as it looks, you can't escape the sense that the whole thing feels like a browser game more than anything else. I bought it for 99 cents, and am perfectly happy with what I got for that, but I could see how some people might see the full asking price as a little much for what it is, though I still think it's set pretty fairly.\n\nLike I said, it's simple and straightforward, nothing too fancy here, but still enjoyable. Although, while I had little issue on my first play through, on subsequent plays the game did crash frequently... very frequently. Like, maybe a dozen or so times in the 4 hours it took to finish (though that's only for completionists. Just to reach the end should take no more than 90 minutes). Though, to it's credit, it did at least have the decency to only ever do it during the menus and loading screen and never during actual gameplay at any point. Whatever the hell that's about.\n\nI've played better, but I've also played a lot worse, and even with a bunch of minor niggles, nothing was too bad to stop me enjoying my time with it.
