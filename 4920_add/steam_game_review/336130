Otherwise, well... \n\nOtherwise, well, this is a game I really wanted to enjoy. Wadjet Eye has released a lot of great games, and I bought this one without thinking twice. But I was really disappointed by its weak plot and flat characters. \n\nThere are so many character interactions that could have been more well written - we know a bit about the protagonist history before the game begins, but not enough to make me feel connected to her in any sense. We get some glimpses of good writing on other characters, like Old Pop or Doctor Collins, but most of the dialogue feels forced, and characters change their attitudes for no reason at all. [SPOILER: there's no good reason why Danton doesn't kill you after the raid!] \n\nOne thing that bothers me a lot is how the science in the game is poor - that's not how vaccines work, you know? And finally, the game is constantly hinting that your choices may have consequences, but they don't. The plot is completely and unavoidably linear up to the last scene, in which you're rushed to take a life-changing decision. \n\nThe pros: the art is good, reminiscent of the golden era of LucasArt. The voice acting is quite nice, with few exceptions. And most of the puzzles are well designed - altough some require you to speak to the right characters in the right order by chance.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505533102, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505533102, "recommendationid": "34986812", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506784", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504717381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 425, "steamid": "76561198040699549", "num_games_owned": 185}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really enjoyed this game.

Well, Technobabylon, Primordia, Gemini Rue or even Resonance (although this last one is a bit less futuristic) I do love them all ! Those games are very consistent and offer many hours of fantastic playthrough. Story, atmosphere, gameplay, puzzles.. everything is high level (although my expectancies are very high since these games are all of very good quality).\nShardlight is one of them. The sci-fi apocalyptic/futurist background is thrilling. \nThe storyline is fantastic and the gameplay is really worth a try for adventure/point 'n click lovers. \nIf you're already a Wadjet Eye Games point ' n click afficionado, Shardlight is for you and it shouldn't be a disappointment. \nVoice acting and soundtracks are good enough. \nThough pixelised, graphics are fine.
