The balls and tables act like you would expect them to in real life (if you expect them to play like a decent table, not the one down your local that gets pushed to the wall every weekend to open up the dance floor, and that is covered in spilled beer), and shots generally do what you would expect and the balls and tables play differently for each different game (8-Ball, 9-Ball, Snooker), each replicating their particular discipline brilliantly. The more you play, the better you get and the more confident you become in imparting spin to your shots, sometimes leading to the inevitable overconfidence and hilariously miscueing the white off the table and into someones pint. \n\nIt is definitely a game that reaches its peak fairly quickly though, when it comes to playing against the AI. After 30 hours, I am able to regularly beat the best skilled AI players in the game, playing with no training aids (although this is really how the game should be played!)\n\nSpeaking of the AI, I would have to describe it as erratic. At times you marvel at it, but more often than not it will bemuse you with the most bizarre shot choices. One frame it will break and dish, positioning for each ball perfectly as it expertly clears the table, but the next frame will choose to cross-double the black instead of playing the dead straight half-table pot that is on. Like, literally, this actually happened to me. The AI potted the last few balls and had the easiest shot on the black in a crucial frame and instead of just rolling it in, chose to play a tricky double, missing and leaving me a simple frame winner. And sadly, the AI does this far too often for you to ever really become immersed in to thinking that you might actually be playing against a real player. Other examples are the AI choosing to play around 6 cushions to hit a ball that they can actually see perfectly. In 8-Ball for example, if you have a ball over the pocket, and the AI has a ball close to it, it will often play a multi cushion shot to hit the ball they can see anyway instead of just hitting directly at it, making the fun of covering pockets as a tactical move less enjoyable.\n\nAlso, the AI will often go the other way, pulling out the most ridiculous of shots that literally could only be played by an AI that is able to calculate exactly what would happen when playing a shot in a certain way, with a certain type of spin, at a particular speed, and this can be so infuriating. As I say, I am yet to play this game within the online community, but can only feel that this will be a much more rewarding experience as you play with people who are limited to their own ability and imagination rather than an AI that, when it wants to, can calculate the perfect shot.\n\nA final note on the maddening AI is how many frames I have won by the AI going in off on the final black. It seems every single shot on the black the AI will hit as hard as possible, instead of doing the smart thing and dropping the black in.\n\nGoing back to a positive, the game has many games on offer. As well as the more recognisable cue sports (including several variants of 8 Ball Pool), there are so many more that will be more familiar to those in North America as well as a couple of fun games such as Bowlliards - essentially the pool version of Ten-Pin Bowling. But this rounds back to another negative; for all the game types on offer, the information provided by the game is sparse at best. Basically, if you don't know the rules of a particular game before loading this game up, it's going to take several games before you do as the VP4 offers no rulebook. Having played 8 Ball (World Rules) for many years here in the UK, I can say that the game gets the rules absolutely spot on, and in fact is the first game I have played that I have ever seen to do so. But, if you don't know the rules, there is nothing in the game that will help you understand, and this is a poor emission imo. I guess you could say this game is aimed at purists who will know the rules going in.\n\nAnother lovely touch is a very simple one. Having played a good many practice games I finally started up a Pro Tour Career and upon playing my first match it was a beautiful touch to see that the balls were so much brighter and shinier. Just as you would expect dull, faded balls on your local pub table, and shiny, pristine balls when playing at a County match or at the World Qualifiers. The geek/pool player in me absolutely marvelled at this neat little touch.\n\nSpeaking of the career mode, it is very nicely done, for what I have played of it and is something I am going to give a run at on the very highest difficulty setting having been pretty untouchable a level below, and am looking forward to doing this just as I am to getting stuck in and playing online with a couple of chums who also own the game.\n\nAnother bizarre choice is the naming of the players within the game. When you play a match, the game will display your opponent by their nickname, but in a career mode ranking list will display them by real name and nowhere does it actually say which nickname responds to which real name, so you haven't got a clue who is who unless you go through each tournament to see who earned what ranking points and determining who they are from there.\n\nTo summarise, I do recommend this game because it replicates the games on offer superbly when you are at the table, but is, however, let down by some pretty poor AI. It is a game that will be infinitely better played with friends (or playing as both human players if you have none). \n\nPROS:\nLooks and feels like real pool\nMultiple game variants\n\nCONS:\nAI is pretty bad\nLack of information on rules, player names/nicknames\n\nPersonal Rating\n76%\n\nEDIT 30/07/17:\nHaving now played the game for 55 hours I wanted to add a little to my review. I exclusively play 8 Ball World Pub Rules and the AI really is awful, and I've also noticed that the rules aren't 100% correct. The AI sometimes doesn't seem to recognise pocket jaws and tries to aim at balls through them, and also the game doesn't recognise pocket jaws when it comes to calling a full snooker. Again, if you are snookered after a foul and move the ball to baulk but are still snookered, the game does not recognise that you are still entitled to a free ball. Finally, the AI doesn't seem to understand touching balls very well.\n\nOn the AI front, it really does pick off some ridiculous shots, using pocket jaws to navigate around 5 cushions to perfectly hit a ball, and get a snooker back, with such frequency that it is clear the game figures out the perfect shot to play before playing it ruining any sense of AI. Similarly, it will sometimes opt to play a cross double when it has a clear shot in to a pocket, but chooses the former option for no obvious reason other than terrible AI.\n\nI also don't agree with the fact you have to pay to play online.\n\nNew Personal Rating:\n71%", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500104848, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501401171, "recommendationid": "33553685", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503585", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502249038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3221, "steamid": "76561198372626802", "num_games_owned": 69}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Short and simple....
