This game will get your brain going, let me tell you!\n\nLetters, numbers and arrow cubes will drop (you will be able to rotate numbers from 1 to 4 for example) and you will have to get combinations to move your craft up/down or right/left, get armour and shoot your enemies as fast as you can. Also, your enemies will constantly be moving so you have to be attentive in that regards. What I really like about this game is the fact that you really have to plan your moves (in advance, like a chess game) to be able to beat your foes as fast as possible. If you actually managed to get an \u201cA\u201d ranking at the end of each mission you will get a fair bit of money to upgrade your spaceship.\n\nAs you progress, you will be able to get other ships and commanders to help you in your missions.\nGraphics and soundtracks are decent and the game runs smoothly. The controls are easy but it will take you time to master them. \n\nOne small negative for me is the loading time between missions, it is a bit slow.\n\nFor $5.94, your brain will have a work out and you will have a lot of fun.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tChallenging\n-\tFun to play\n-\tAchievements\n-\tTrading Cards\n-\tWell structure idea\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n \n-\tLoading is a bit slow between mission\n\nMoney well spent!

I wanted to wait and reserve judgement until I played a bit more of it, but I find that I really don't want to play anymore for one reason alone.  Too much loading time.  I'll run though a mildly accurate account of loading time.\n\nThese are the game events that occur and an estimated execution time.\nGame Launch to main menu = 30 seconds.\nLoad game to play mode = 30 seconds.\nPlay game length = 240 seconds (four minutes, but this widely varies).\nGame death and automatic restart loading time = 30 seconds.\nGame victory loading time = 30 seconds.\nSpecial pause time (Game pauses when you use your special move.) = 10 seconds.\nBoss appearance pause time = 10 seconds.\n\nSo lets say you just want to play one quick four minute game.  In your quest for your four minute game you will have to wait for loading screens and pause events for an approximate total of 2 minutes.  Which means that one third of your total time in this game you will spend looking at loading screens.  Obviously there are other reviewers who look upon this game with more positivity than I do, and I do see why.  There is an entertaining game in here between the loading menus.
