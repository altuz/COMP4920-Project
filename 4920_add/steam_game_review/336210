I asked it in a rude way though and it was removed from the discussions. We continued to talk about the game and decided I wanted to invest in him and his game. \n\nI must say after coming back to the game months later to see what has changed and finding nothing it definitely feels my initials thoughts were correct, in that he was trying to make some money off of his months/years of work. \n\nThis was especially disheartening as I felt that he wanted his game to succeed realised there wasn't many people buying and stood a large step back. I also invested hours playing and bug reporting in the hopes that the game would quickly get better over time.\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466455835, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1466455835, "recommendationid": "23675151", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512990", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456701385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561197976495022", "num_games_owned": 135}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Game is very bare bones right now. Not sure if it's even EA ready.. Although it's nice the developer wants help and advice on his game, the price is a bit steep for what the game actually presents content wise right now. Should consider getting more help for a game of the scope he seems to want to get it too. \n\nCould be promising some day though, I can see the potential, just don't know if it'll ever get there. \n\nHe's got something going with the procedurally generated cities, and what he has accomplished by himself is a big feat. \n\nAt this time I can't recommend the game at the price its at and what is offered in the game. You die very quickly, the bullet spread is too high, cars steering is way off, can't deposit money to buy better weapons as far as I know, since trying earlier today. Pretty much all there is to do right now is run around , kill a couple people, then die. Like I said , with the description of the devs game modes, the game does have potential and hopefully can be reached especially if be plans on doing it all by himself.

After playing an hour of it i realized it was awful and not worth $15. I then returned it but planed to buy it much later when it was updated and overall a playable game (because the game sounded great on paper and had potential). I have now returned to see if its  worth the $15 and shockingly it hasent been updated since i returned it. This game could have been great but there were so many things wrong with this project from the begining, that made it doomed from the start. First off charging $15 for this is almost criminal, when i played back in early march (which was the last time it was updated) it wasnt even worth $1 and im sure still isn't. So there was its biggest problem it was barely finised and not even worth $1 and the dev charges not $5 not even $10 but $15 for a game that in my opinion wasnt even 10% complete smh. The dev also said at the time that this game was 66% complete XD that was one of the biggest lies yet and i get it you want to give people assurance that the game will be complete sooner than later but obviously the game didnt even come close to 66%. Games like this give early access games a bad name and further show caution you need to have when making an investment in one. I was so looking forward to this game when it came out but the dev made all the wrong decisions: Criminal price, broken promises, and lies. If the dev had put more time into making the game playable instead of rushing it out and charging $15 or had just made the game FTP and get a decent sized player base to get good feedback then this game could have been a hit. So to dan, i suggest making this game FTP and dont give up on making your dream game come true. If you decide to make it FTP and begin updating it then i will change this review to thumbs up, but as it stands this is a unfinished, broken, scam game that is so disappointing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466886323, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1466886323, "recommendationid": "23804012", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507249", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456875371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 21, "steamid": "76561198086030341", "num_games_owned": 93}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[b]Why Early Access?[/b]\n[i]\u201cI want to develop the game with the players!
