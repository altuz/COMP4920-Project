A  simple concept and not very many levels.\n\nBut I am here to assure you, ORBITOR is not at all weighed down by these factors. This review is my personal opinion, and I am aware not everyone is into this genre of game.\n\nORBITOR is a powerful arcade title where you play as a small robot called an orbitor, and the objective is to obtain the warp core located at the center of each level. The warp core is inside a shell in the middle, and it is opened when all of the surrounding objects are destroyed. There is no story to this game, but like that of the Bejeweled franchise, one is not required or even neccesary.\n\nPROS:\n-Stunning visuals\n-Exhilerating soundtrack that never gets old\n-Awesome sound effects\n-Tons of features and abilities\n-Lots of replay value\n-Unique atmosphere for each level\n-Incredibly well optimized (you can run this game on integrated GPU's no problem)\n-Very addictive\n\nCONS:\n-Not very many levels (for now. As of right now there are 4, but it's been confirmed there will be more coming soon!)\n-Lack of settings in the menu (no graphical or audio adjustment and very loud default sound)\n-Some minor glitches\n-No real goals or leaderboards (including achievements and trading cards) so points feel worthless\n\nORBITOR is an excellent game, truly worth $14.99. Any of the cons I have listed are easily fixable, and they probably will be fixed soon. I reccommend this if you like a small game to play in spare time. 9/10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440244037, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1440244037, "recommendationid": "17659489", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517457", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442799891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 168, "steamid": "76561198202441926", "num_games_owned": 85}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "In a single word (or TLDR): WOW!\n\nSimply WOW! I've played games for over about 40 years and this is one of those rare gems that I've encountered in my life. I'm amazed by the quality of this game. Superb visually, excellent music, very relaxing. I was so relaxed that I didn't even try to make points. I was just flying and looking at the visuals and listening to the music. I especially like the third level with a music similar to the style of Tron 2 and the beautiful background. Congratulations to the developer(s)!\n\nThe only things that I would say are somewhat negative is the low quantity of levels, the price and lack of information on what I have to do in the game. It starts without any help on what to do. But this is understandable as it is early access and not too complicated to get going. But I still hope for some tutorial or some information. As for the price, as the game stands, I would have preferred something like CAD$10. I know that more levels and gameplay elements will be added but EA buyers also bear part of the risk of not being completed. And we also give some publicity to the game. But that's my opinion.\n\nThe game lasts about 40 minutes but I could play for hours just relaxing flying.

(But it's Early Access so no complaints.)\n\nSince the demo was released this game has been on the radar of those who found it interesting. Even Markiplier, a Youtuber, was very impressed by this game back when it was first shown. After a few years of development it comes out swinging. Beautiful 2D artstyles combine to give you a depth that can rival 3D CG. Not to mention the music fits the areas down to a T.\n\nAt first it may seem a little difficult to understand the controls or know when to press what. But after a few tries you'll learn when and how to press the right buttons to gain the most out of the speed. The game becomes even more amazing once you nail this down and gains an unbeatable rhythm to the overall feel. Not to mention it feels extremely satisfying when you see yourself weaving and swerving from orbit to orbit while creating explosions in your path.\n\nThe only thing that can become frustrating is learning the right strategy for each level. How? Each level adds in a different element to take into account. So you have to fix your playstyle if you want to beat it. And dying can be the must enraging thing since you have to start all over again. But once you unlock that warp ability and see yourself dissapear like a beam of light, it's all worth it.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes! Absolutely.
