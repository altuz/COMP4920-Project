My wife and i played it together, although there is no coop mode, handing the conroller back and forth. Its a good game to do that because she will try sonething that i  did not think of. We got thru it only having to go to the you-tube well once i think. We thought the ending was particurly frustrating because all the sudden the ui to spell words was different for no good reason and we could not delete letters but eventually figuerd it out. The final cut scene was unnessisarily  long and dramatic but overall a thumbs up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503924636, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503924636, "recommendationid": "34552085", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500143242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 215, "steamid": "76561198082229566", "num_games_owned": 58}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Innovative game.\n\nCombines the puzzle solving and platforming of Limbo with Word puzzles.\n\nWhen considering getting this game, another Steam review stated that he was a \"writer\" and needed a thesaurus to get through this game.  That is a load of crap, and said writer can find that under C in his thesaurus. In all honesty, the vocabulary of a highschool student in an English speaking country is more than sufficient to handle this game. \n\nThe challenge of this game, from a word puzzle standpoint, is not about the complexity of the word, but rather taking few letters and using them in creative ways.\n\nNegatives:\n- short, takes only a few hours to complete, and has little replay value\n- some of the platforming elements were frustrating\n\nIf you are a fan of sames such as Limbo/Inside, and/or you like word puzzles, I strongly recommend that you give Typoman a try.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500140816, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500140816, "recommendationid": "33564898", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504303779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 200, "steamid": "76561198311129975", "num_games_owned": 137}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A pretty good one, especially the idea, and the feeling of power of the words it does on you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504303860, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504303860, "recommendationid": "34670463", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503214007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 319, "steamid": "76561198111298347", "num_games_owned": 500}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So worth it.
