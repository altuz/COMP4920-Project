I have not played it since this update, if I do, I will revise my review. For now, it will remain the same. This is a review of the game I paid for, played and that the devs were content with for almost six months. \n\nTL,DR: Chronicles of a Dark Lord is an ineptly written game with somewhat tolerable combat. The story is cliche, the characters have no personality or diversity and the game's flow is extremely repetitive. The description promises a game that's dark, mature and complex, but what you get is juvenile, shallow and as dark as something like Naruto. Furthermore, even though the description promises that you'll get to make decisions that effect the game later that is not the case (aside from choosing whether or not to kill random NPCs).\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nFirst, I want to point out that one positive review on this page was written by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050329159/recommended/336280/]someone affiliated with the developers[/url]. Looking at some comments on their Desura page, it seems like this is not uncommon for them. Even if I liked this game this would leave a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nFair warning, there are SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.\n\nChronicles of a Dark Lord: Episode 1 Tides of Fate is the kind of game that gives RPG Maker games a bad reputation. It is one of the worst written games I've ever played. If an RPG is poorly written, it fails. This goes double for RPG Maker games, because the graphics are pretty standard across the board (some will have nice character portraits, the portraits in this seem to be generated in RPG Maker) and the gameplay is very rote JRPG fare. \n\nBefore I get into why Chronicles of a Dark Lord is so bad, I will talk about the few things I did like. The random battle system is very nice. It's not really random. There's a meter that fills up as you walk and decreases if you stand still. If it fills up, you enter a battle. There's lots of object hidden around in the environment. My love of RPGs has trained me to check literally everything. In this game it pays off and I like that. Finally, about halfway-ish through the game I found a hidden sword and piece of armor that was so over-powered I breezed through a lot of the game. That definitely helped me keep going. Also, the song during the end credits is pretty good. Marielle Thomas did a great job with it.\n\nSo, onto the problems. First, and most importantly, the characters have no personality. Well, they kind of do, but everyone is either quiet and serious or kind of goofy. There is hardly any distinction between your party members. Half of them even look the same. If I was forced to describe any of them it would be extremely difficult. That's not good. The characters should be diverse and interesting. \n\nThe main character, Magus, is the worst of all. No personality. Towards the end of the game, some characters have a conversation about how he doesn't show emotion. Guess what? That's not interesting. He's just kind of there. Everything interesting about him happened in the prologue and the text crawl between that and the main game. There's supposedly a conflict between the evil path he started down and his decision to not be totally evil. . .WE NEVER SEE THAT.\n\nMagus is supposed to be so dark. The only way the game really shows us that in the main game is that we are given the option to randomly kill some NPCs. That's the problem with the game in general: where's the darkness? This is supposed to be dark and mature, but it's not. The game tries too hard to also be funny and light for it to be dark. For instance, there's one part where you're in a cave and there's a rumble. Magus' wife says something like, \"Either Magus is hungry or we better get moving!\" The game doesn't have any of the edge it claims to have, but when you throw in lines like that, it's just goofy. Or, the conversation with a female NPC where the Dark Lord Magus says he'll come back later to pick her up so she can come visit his kingdom.\n\nHere's a line that just blew my mind: \"She is going to cut my breasts off or something if we do not get out of her garden.\" That's in the game. Or, how about this line which someone says before fighting one of the final bosses: \"I am Sapphire Darkwell. . .and I hate cats. It's because of YOU I have to institute a law against cats in Senefarria!\" That is some dramatic and dark writing.\n\nThe storyline is really cliche. First, you're traveling around trying to rally people to fight an invading evil. Then, it turns out that (spoiler alert) the bad guys have a hidden agenda. They're trying to summon something to destroy the world. The dumbest trope in the world. Why do they want to destroy the world? What do they gain?\n\nThe script is super repetitive. I'm willing to bet 10% of the game is characters introducing themselves or being introduced. Magus seems to know every character he meets, but I don't. We usually don't really learn who they are, but we're supposed to care about them or be invested in what's going on. One character is recruited, then a side quest immediately becomes available where someone is trying to lure them into a confrontation. I don't know who that enemy was and I didn't care about what was going on. The whole game in general is repetitive. The bulk of it is: go to castle, talk to rule, get permission to go to next world map screen, fight boss, go to castle. World map screens come in two varieties: Castle and town and bridge/cave/docks or castle and bridge/cave/docks.\n\nThen, there's just weird stuff that makes me think the game was written by a 13-year-old boy. All your party members are female, except for Magus and someone you get at the end of the game. Why? There's no good reason. Also, three of your party members are women who Magus has had sex with. His ex-wife, his current wife and their lover. That's right, Magus has a wife and together they have a lover. Why? How did this happen? What is the attraction? What is the purpose from a writing perspective? It doesn't add anything. None of the three seem to actually be in love, they just call each other \"my love.\" I guess for them to seem like they actually loved each other they would need personalities. Is it so we know how not gay Magus is? Is it so he seems cooler or more awesome? I'm not a prude. If the characters were more developed, if any of it served any purpose, it would be fine. It doesn't, though. There's also a city entirely populated by lesbians.\n\nThere's also just mind-blowingly crazy things. There's a character named Crysta Aier. Later, someone mentions \"Krysta Aier.\" I thought, \"Oh, a typo.\" Then, we recruit Krysta Aier and I thought, \"Oh, I just remembered it wrong.\" Then, you re-recruit Crysta Aier and have both Aiers. Then, I didn't know what was going on. Finally, by chance, while checking a bookshelf, I found out that one of them is FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION. That's right. People's dopplegangers just pop in from other dimensions. Then, Magus remembers about the time that happened to him!\n\nOn top of the insanely inept writing, there are other issues. There's no mouse control and muting sounds doesn't completely work. Also, even though the description seems to promise that you'll get to make decisions that effect the game that is not true. The only decisions you get to make are whether or not to kill some random, nameless NPCs.\n\nI know that this review is extremely long, but the game is so flawed in so many ways I had to get it out (if only for my own sanity).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428558415, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434605663, "recommendationid": "15274097", "language": "english", "votes_down": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611333", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1419809918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 360, "steamid": "76561198055526573", "num_games_owned": 28}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 52, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I am only 6 hours in, but definitely worth the 5 bucks I paid for it if not more. Not too far in but there are a few things that jumped out at me right away:\n\n1. It's very much like Dragon Warrior 4, and it borrows concepts from Final Fantasy. They don't try to reinvent the wheel, which is a good thing, eg the thing that revives a dead ally is called a \"phoenix feather,\" that which cures poison is an antidote. Simple and good.\n\n2. tl;dr - You can avoid battles when you want to /tl;dr. The battle system is turned based, and each character's time bar fills up at a rate based on the character's agility. Time stops when a bar is full. Encounters are not random on the world map or in encounter zones. Instead, a \"battle bar\" fills up with each step you take. When the bar is full, there's a battle. If you stand still for a second or two, the bar will begin to empty until it is.\n\n3. The characters and their abilities are good and balanced, and they don't contain fluff or spam.\n\n4. They did a good job of taking the elements of classic rpgs that drive you nuts / are overdone / are unrealistic out, and instead put in refreshing updates to an older genre. I don't want to give out spoilers but the protagonist is a bad ass, not some wet behind the ears kid who just had his mind blown learning that he's the savior of the world or some whiney teenager with \"teen angst.\" Npcs for the most part don't have duplicate dialog, meaning every npc you talk to has something different to say. They've completely removed unnecessary hyper-morality that is common in old school rpgs. The story and dialogue are interesting but not overbearing. There are many, many more examples of times you will find yourself smiling just because they did something better than it's been done in the past.\n\n5. Lesbians\n\n\nI have only a few criticisms of the game at this point, and none of them are \"bad.\"\n\n1. Character sprites in battle are the same as they are on the map, while enemies' sprites in battle are elaborate. I would have made artfully elaborate battle sprites for each of the characters to give them more depth, personality, and make them more likeable over all.\n\n2. There are two areas in the game so far where it seemed to be \"laggy,\" which doesn't make sense because it's basically a super nintendo game. One area had \"fog\" which seems like it could almost make sense, but the other was in a castle i beleive. \n\n3. If you turn off all three sound options (listening to music, at work, etc), there are two sounds during battle that are still heard. Issuing battle commands and critical strikes.\n\n\n\nAs you can tell from these \"criticisms,\" there's nothing not to like about this game. Buy it.\n\nI don't often write reviews, but this game only had two at the time of this writing, so i wanted to endorse a good game.

It's a typical \"bad guy wants world domination\" thing, and there aren't any big plot twists or surprises in the bland story.

Your party members are all important people, monarchs, badasses, with you the greatest of them all, but you're never given any serious backstory on any of them, and the game only takes a shallow dive into their personalities. The game also seems to favor women a lot, with plenty of lesbians and only one male in your party, but that's fine.\n\nSo what makes the game worth playing? Well, the combat is solid. Characters' abilities are all useful, items are often essential, boss fights are common and tough, and occassional grinding is a must. If the dev could take this battle system and expand on the story and characters to lend more meaning and emotion to the fights, this game would be fantastic.

Well made, never saw anything like that!)\nSo far as i have played (second Kingdom finally arriving) the Story still seems to be good and i also meet someone i didnt thought i would see haha. Great Plot.\n\nAfter getting more through. I noticed the characters look so simliar. Yeah some are family but even those are not looks too similar. Would have been better if there are more differences between the characters. As for the story i get tiny parts from time to time also a lot of bosses. And the equip sometimes is just getting a new one after new one when you just shortly chanced locations!\nWhen you want to get the equip its also perfect for ahving the characters on a good level, so you have no problems killing a boss, bes ure to get the equip and the level ups while you do it you also get new skills 8some of em are hell good and sometimes needed.

I just bought this game for $2. I love RPG Maker-like games and helps me get ideas for how people do different things with it. I'll let you know what I think of it. I'm also attracted to \"Mixed\" review games. There's plenty of super-big hit games like the call of duty franchise that I'd say with the exception to a couple of them, really suck, so by the intuitive logic therein, I like to look at games that people are Iffy about [could be a struggle of conscience/ cognitive dissonance, thus indicating some or much substance is there although misjudged], and kinda indie games in general, and see if maybe just the shallow consumerist culture hated/disliked/overlooked it because it didn't provide the 'bling bling' and substanceless socio-cultural big-adva [advertizement] indoctrination trigger points to jump it into stardom. \n\nHowever, a lot of indie games suck too.\nlol I'm just trying to justify that I liked the sound of 'dark', liked the pictures, and saw an rpg maker game that was cheap, and yea a little bit about that mixed review shit helped.\n\nPlus if I ever get my own rpg maker games out there [probably will], it'd be awesome to collaberate with other devs of other games, on putting up eachother, maybe sharing resources, etc, and sharing fans too as a result lol. So yea, there's not many Steam RPG maker games, so im biased to want to support from the go. \n\nAnyway next update will be about this actual game experience.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1465337036, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1465337271, "recommendationid": "23442707", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494991", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446862696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 476, "steamid": "76561198047241312", "num_games_owned": 65}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is my kind of game. Hey, I'm old school! But that said, if you like the old style dungeon crawlers JRPG with the turn-based attacks and unique powers and abilities for each character...

In the right hands, RPG-Maker is a powerful tool that can be used to make a low-budget game that's actually worth playing. This isn't one of them. \n\nIt does a few somewhat interesting things: random battles can be seen ahead of time, thanks to a handy bar at the top of the screen on the world map; the characters will talk breifly after a battle is over; and the story is completely unorthodox - but despite these few redeeming traits, it's clear the author of the game has no idea how to really /make/ a game.\n\nYeah, you can move around and do things and fight things, but from the get-go the main character is extremely unlikable and we're given no reason to care whether he lives or dies. The story is also bizarre; when the game first started up, I thought it was going to be a reversal of the typical RPG hero story - y'know, where you play as the good hero from humble beginnings and gain strength and beat the bad guys. I was actually kind of excited to play through an evil overlord's rise to power. Then the game time-skips past all of that to when the empire is already formed. ...And that's about where I stopped playing.\n\nI could go on, but I don't think I have to. It's really, really not worth your time.

Magus was desperate to lead his father's forces in thier final push against their foes, but his father, being a Dark Lord, was cruel and belittled Magus. He denied Magus this chance, so Magus took matters into his own hands, and went to the battlefield. There, he confronted his father, and as they argued, the Dark God gifted Magus incredible powers. With this power, Magus killed both his father's and his father's enemies within seconds. He then banished his father to another land, and took his place of Dark Lord. Within the next few years, Magus took over many lands, but was soon defeated in a battle. From this, the Dark God took his powers away, leaving Magus helpless and weak. And now, he is rising in power again....\n\n\nPros: I somewhat enjoy the difficulty of the game. If you don't play just right, you'll need to grind and farm XP and Gold to buy potions, weapons, and armor. I also enjoy the idea of playing as an evil being, and how he is fighting another evil. With this, I enjoy how combat is played out, and how there is a random encounter meter in the open world. Finally, I like the dark humor in the story.\n\nCons: I dislike how much I have had to farm to get powerful enough to fight bosses, and I also dislike how magick users don't have as much MP as I would want and need to keep reviving and healing allies. Even with the humor, I don't like how it ruins the Dark feeling in the game.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I would recommend this game. I like how it runs, and how it feels. For those who want to try this, I recommend you buy it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436542567, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436842953, "recommendationid": "16976998", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495486", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443028056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 244, "playtime_forever": 260, "steamid": "76561198019218926", "num_games_owned": 385}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Super!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443028376, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443028376, "recommendationid": "18161413", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495156", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442766921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 178, "steamid": "76561198062081814", "num_games_owned": 488}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "FUN!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443132318, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443132318, "recommendationid": "18177890", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497792", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433990398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 151, "steamid": "76561198031240682", "num_games_owned": 671}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very solid game.
