It does some clever and some arguable tricks with controls and user interface, and to me personally it rather works than not. The game focuses mostly on exploration, finding the right objects and talking to people, while the use of inventory items is fully automatic, which made it interesting and easy to enjoy for me.

No.\nIs it worth it at $0.24US? Yes.\n\nAfter reading the reviews, I tried to go into CI not expecting much but I couldn't help but hope.\n\nThe graphics while being low poly actually made a refreshing change. Not since Jak & Daxter have I been impressed at the depth of field in a game. Also interesting graphically are the puffs of smoke from the cursor and the way walls of entered buildings drop comically from the sky upon leaving.\n\nThere is a *lot* of walking in this game. While it does make the world seem actually big and possibly more realistic, it gets tedious very quickly. You are given a teleport option between sites but that takes little away from it. Coupled with the unusual camera angles that can only be rotated left and right and not up and down, it makes a short snacky game into a multiple visit affair. You can at least click on things far away and the pathfinding will take over for you, making treks down mountain paths a chance for a player break.\n\nAs a side note, I like how when you run for a long time, Mya gets out of breath.\n\nThe humour while not awful is mostly forgetable. It's like a family or PG movie in that there's quite a few adult humour bits that should fly over younglings heads. Plus, toilet humour (literally too)!\n\n[The store page said \"There's occasional swearing and coarse language...Therefore it is not suitable for younger players\" but I honestly can't remember anything that bad.]\n\nThe puzzle solving is a little odd. Most puzzles are solved for you if you have the correct item. So it's mostly just a bit of back-and-forth running about. Which does hurt you once you've forgotten where things are. There was one story puzzle that (AFAIK) involved trail-and-error.\n\nThere also seems to be a lot of things missing or at least alluded to. My guess is it's either teasers for the next episode but it could just be bad design.\n\nMy complaints:\nThe 2 mousebutton thing to see interactive objects is really annoying. Can't we have a keyboard shortcut?\nThere are no audio/volume controls.\nOnly one save slot available\nYou had to use the toilet twice to get the book?!?\nThe game is relatively short and there's a promise of sequels but I doubt any will exist anytime soon.\nThe ending took WAAAY too long that I missed the top of the house. I had to play a game on my phone to suffer thru it. I thought at the time it would have been perfect to play the credits over, so when the credits played straight afterwards, I was utterly disappointed.\n\nTo reiterate, if it gets down to 24c and you have the patience, pick this game up.

I find the low poly, cel shaded style graphics quite appealing, and it fits the game perfectly. Good use of music as well.\n\nIf there's one aspect pulling this game down, it's the camera, and the controls for it. You are able to zoom in and out, but only between two very different ranges. And while you could rotate the camera around Mya, the main character, there was no way to change the angle. These two things made the adventuring aspect of this game feel a bit cramped. It also would not have hurt being able to rotate the camera without the use of a keyboard, and going to the map should probably not have been the second step of zooming out.\n\nBut while the camera controls could have been a bit better, the game itself is well worth playing through. It's walking a fine line between hilariously strange and playfully serious; It doesn't take itself at all seriously, yet it doesn't try to shove jokes down your throat either. Instead you are led through surreal dialogues and strange choices of action as if they were completely normal. In many ways it makes me think of Suda51's \"Flower, Sun and Rain\" for the DS, but much more adventurous and fun!\n\nIf anything, I wish the game was longer.
