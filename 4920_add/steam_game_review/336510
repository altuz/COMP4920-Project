Open this up during lunch break to build a few buildings, go back to work. It is good for people with a busy schedule. \nIt takes time to gather resources, trading, and ship related actions, however, unlike mobile city planning games, you don't need to tap on every production building to collect resources. You don't need to bug other people to help with production. You only need to collect production if you order a specific item to be built. \nThere are microtransaction, however, they are for impatiant people. If you're impatiant, in the first place, this game isn't for you, just spend the money you would have used on mircotransaction on an actula city buidling game, like the regular Anno games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485319535, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485319535, "recommendationid": "29476072", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518141", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463237248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 53732, "steamid": "76561198069730318", "num_games_owned": 52}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The classic old game with new design.
