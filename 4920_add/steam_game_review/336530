There are 2 tutorial playlists that you should walkthrough, starting with Tunnels.   [b]Workflow[/b], [b]Floatinng Transparency[/b], and [b]RGB morality[/b] are what confuse most people coming to Howler. Howler's workflow is different because it is more like a compositor workflow. Howler is also different as it uses [b]floating transparency[/b] instead of layer transparency.  [b]Workflow[/b] is shown in the older Tunnels series.  Working with floating transparency is shown in the [b]Transparency[/b] series.  [b]RGB morality[/b] is more of a joke on my end, but basically I mean that the RGB value will always display regardless of whether transparency is on or off.  For those who want to do 2D animation, there are no bones, so while Howler has exceptional potential for quality background work, you're going to want to import those backgrounds into software that has bones(rigging).\n\n[h1]The Floating Alpha Tools Menu[/h1]\nFound in this menu - View > Other > Alpha Panel... \nFloating transparency is transparency you call whenever you need transparency, whereas layer transparency is always there, you just turn it on whenever you need it.  Neither is necessarily better, as they both have advantages, it's only that every other program in the digital painting category does not use floating transparency so even Howler in the future is planning to change to layer transparency too.  So, if you try to bring a photoshop file with transparency included on every layer whether it's used or not into a program that relies on only the efficiency of floating transparency, well, the result makes people scratch their head.\n\n[h1]1. Tunnels[/h1]\nTunnels is THE series to watch to understand PD Howler.  That's all there is to it.  Anything else might assume you're already familiar with the Tunnels series.  There are 11 parts.\nUnorganized Playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/pdhowler/search?query=tunnels+part\nThe River Canyon series is like a themed redo of Tunnels, but some people have said it moves too fast.\n\n[h1]2.

Among the more interesting ones are some of the space ones, the 2 part series on creating many different landscapes in minutes, and the following 3 part series on painting 3d rendered landscapes.  The space ones can be found by keyword searching, while the other ones mentioned are found in the River Canyon playlist.  Also, look up glazing and color palettes, that's a good one too.\n\nGood luck Howlin'.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426265849, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1462978611, "recommendationid": "14867274", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559828", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1434805743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 10376, "steamid": "76561198016423813", "num_games_owned": 339}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 37, "comment_count": "3", "review": "There are pros and cons to get this software. I am mostly speaking of the drawing part of it, I haven't touched the animation part.\n\nLet's start with the pros :\n\n-You can quickly achieve a result\n-There are a lot of filters/effects\n-You can play around and have fun\n-devs look friendly :P\n\nThose are the main pros I see in this software. \n\nNow here are the cons :\n\n-There is no alpha channel, which means no opaque layers (if you want to have a layered rendering with a background, a foreground, layers in between, this won't work well for you). You can do stuff still, but you lose a lot of flexibility. This can be fun, if you're not serious, but for serious and precise work, this gets really hard with just that issue.\n\n-There are bugs, some of which can destroy your entire work. You will have to save often (which is good practice, but still..). Undos can paste an image from a different layer into your current layer, for exemple.\n\n-The devs don't seem to want to address those issues, although they do answers in the discussions, it seems hard to progress on something. Or at least, I'm very confused if they do, it's not clear.\n\n-The UI is getting outdated\n\nOverall, I would say, this software is cool if you want to be play around or if your work requires you to have very quick results that doesn't require precision. However, if you want to be a bit more serious, you'll be pulling your hair out soon enough ;)\n\nNote : That's for the drawing part of the software. The animation might be very cool, I do not know about it ;)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436481566, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436481566, "recommendationid": "16966240", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562035", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484776826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1315, "steamid": "76561198037259809", "num_games_owned": 490}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I wish there was a 'maybe' option, but for now I'll have to change this to a no (find my original review below).\n\nThe reason I changed this to a no, is I personally feel the program is just too held back by its lack of opaque layers. There are a couple of workarounds one can do, but it gets exremely fiddly, saving all different kinds of alpha's, cutting out different parts of images, rubbing them through the swap image. While they are all possible, making a nice landscape scenery, and afterwards trying to correct mistakes becomes an exercise in futility. The developers say 'they like it that way', but I personally don't, and that's why I personally wouldnt recommend it anymore.\n\nThe program has a lot of awesome features though, and one of the devs made a lot of tutorials and is active answering questions on the forums, but I just feel it's being held back by a lot when compared to programs such as photoshop. Furthermore the undo function is often very 'hard to use', and its easy to lose many hours of work because the undo stack works in weirrd ways.\n\nReally hoping they'll take the plunge and spend the time and resources on making this program support opaque layers etc., and I'll be sure to change my review when they do. As I said, you can do almost everything with the program, but many things just require too much fiddlyness for my taste.\n\nSee my original review below:\n\n\nThis software is very interesting, and my thumbs up comes with some reservations, but not enough to give it a thumbs down.\nIn a sense it works a bit like photoshop/GIMP etc., but it's got its own style. It's very fun for people like me who just want to muck about. It has a ton of pre-set filters and brushes, and the 3d terrain rendering is great. That said, it takes a very weird approach regarding layers, and it can be very hard to get the results you want. I'm not entirely sure if there would be any disadvantage to just implementing normal layer alpha channels like other programs, but at least this one doesn't have it.\n\nThat means it can be hard to add layers on top of each other without things messing up. There's some tricks you can do to try and circumvent it, but it's not perfect, and it's the #1 thing holding back this program. If it were implemented, I'm sure it would be an extremely successful product.\n\nThat said, it is a powerful software that's lots of fun to use. There's also a ton of tutorials available on youtube, so I definitely don't regret spending the money.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433023511, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435845902, "recommendationid": "16086600", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535758", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481818197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1113, "steamid": "76561197995298784", "num_games_owned": 86}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a fantastic art studio, animation creator and more! The interface takes a bit of getting used to as does remembering where everything is located. There are extensive short cut keys but again they need to be learned.

PD Howler does have menus and a RIGHT CLICK system for accessing the properties of the menu item if available.\n\nThe results that you can get even in a few minuets are astounding even for a poor computer artist like myself.

I think I never got so much concentrated creative power per invested dollar from any other program.\n\nI managed to produce this in my first day and I can assure you that uses like 1% of the potential of the program. Like with any other tool of worth, you have also to put your own imagination into the \"How to use this feature\". So i don't promise you that you will be a pro PD Howler artist after 10 days. but every hour you put into learning PD Howler will be awarded with new ways to express your art.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=691560746\n\nAlso ... do you hate programs without documentation ? Me too. Many promising programs out there die fast due to lack of documentation. But not this one. The creators have a solid performance record over years of dedicated creation of videos.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/pdhowler/videos\n\nOk I worked some more with PD Howler. I saw many bad reviews. What is true, is that you really need to put time in this program. But I don't remember the devs claimed it is easy to use. If you have experience with Photoshop and 3rd party tools you will agree that the brushes of PD Howler alone, are possibly worth the 70 dollars. And the program has much more to offer.\n\nAlso I don't see why everyone always thinks that every program has to be a total jack-of-all-trades. Why I understand that not all can afford a Photoshop, there is the free Gimp. To produce good art is not something you do in 2 days. You have to put time into your applications.\n\nI think this tool is a MUST in the program portfolio of a pro. However, be prepared to put months until you realyl master it. But then be fair ... how much time did you have to put with Photoshop and Gimp ? Especially Gimp is a bit like PD Howler, very unusual approaches. But can you live without Gimp ? Me not, I need it next to Photoshop. Same with PD Howler, I am now working with it since a week seriously, and already I can't miss it anymore in my toolset. \n\nHere my latest work after a week with PD Howler:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=692785160", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464551489, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1464551489, "recommendationid": "23279255", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463321657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23643, "steamid": "76561198022352105", "num_games_owned": 74}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have enjoyed using this 'paint program' and discovering that it is so much more.
