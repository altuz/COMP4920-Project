No gamepad support. Grating sound.  \n\nThis is a cube matching game on ice terrain, where you gotta use the uneven walls to stop blocks and glide them left and right until both the ones with the same number match. There is apparently a mechanic where numbers above 10 can be divided but I tried it on the first level and it was bugged, instead of having one dice of twelve it created one dice of 6 making the level unbeatable. There are locations from all around the world which change the landscape but even in the middle of the desert the tiles still glide and there are snowflakes. Otherwise it fullscreens correctly, and has resolution options. No gamepad support however and the sound was very grating. The visuals were okay for what it is. Mostly deleting because it is not the right platform and cannot be enjoyed at a sit-down desk experience especially when there are so many better options around"}]}
