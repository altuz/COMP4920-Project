I was expecting a toned down version of the old school game Twisted Metal, but instead what I got was a mobile port of an endless runner, which uses a car instead of a character.  \n\nYour options are left and right to dodge, quick brake and attack; no accelerator or brakes, just keep moving.  \n\nThe games main concept is to speed down a straight road dodging cars all while picking up coins, powerups and weapons; simple enough.  As you get further down the road, you will continually pick up speed.   The overall feel of the game was a port of an iOS or Android to PC which would have been better off as a Free To Play with micro transactions or a free web based flash game, not a full fledged PC release.\n\nWith all this being said, the game does have it's own simple quick game kinda charm, worth playing if you have some time kill.  Without looking at the actual specs, I would imagine this game would run fine on most modern laptops with just integrated graphics and a modest amount of RAM, so might be a game for a long car ride or flight?

But for now, it's a really fun endless runner game where you are a car!  The physics are just spot-on for a crazy-taxi-type arcade-ness, and the game itself functions well, there is stuff to unlock, etc.\n\nHowever the downsides is in the amount of content.  Sure you could unlock all those paint schemes for each car, but it feels grindy just thinking about it.  I only played for like 30 minutes, but I felt like I saw it all.  Literally there are a few different powerups to blast cars in front of you, and you basically see how long you can last.  The pace didn't seem to get more intense either, but I could be wrong.  I don't really see the 'hook' of why I should even keep playing.  \n\nSo why the thumbs up?  \n\nBecause this game is perfect for what it set out to achieve: an endless runner with a car.  Now if the developers have a chance to add in some functionality to give it replay value and they could gave a gem on their hands.  \n\nWishlist: \n- Steam leaderboards\n- Achievements\n- Trading Cards\n- Steam Cloud\n\nWill check back on this title later, but for now look at that price tag!  Day 1 release and it's like under $3 US.

No settings. Nothing. Change the resolution? No can do. Change the volume? Nope. Change the key bindings? No. Be told what the key bindings are? No. (Luckily I succesfully guessed UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT,SPC,ESC,ENTER) Be told what the goal is? No. Does it tell me the exact rules of the game? Which cars I may hit, what will kill me, what will give me points, how and when to use which power-up? None of this. \n\nThe only thing this game will do is blast the same Dubstep track* over and over. Did I mention that I have no means of turning that off? I don't need the music, you know, but it would be nice if I could switch it off seperately and not mute my headphones. Because the engine's sound is fine really.\n\nI'm a die-hard Burnout fan and no, this is _not like_ Burnout. From the screenshots I gathered it would be about crashing into junctions, causing havok. A plain copy of Burnout's infamous game mode. It is not. Which does not make it a bad game yet. That's only because of the issues mentioned above.\n\nGive me an options menue and a few lines of explanation and I will recommend this game. Oh, and maybe have a second song to choose from.\n\nPS: Writing this I discovered that Steam requires you to play a game for at least 5 minutes before being allowed to post a review.\n\n*When I say Dubstep I mean a five-second loop of the 'noise part' which usually makes up only a small part of actual Dubstep songs. Sometimes I even enjoy Dubstep (*shudder*) but this I can't.
