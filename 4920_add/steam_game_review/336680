Online Muliplayer is not supported yet as far as I know so its limited to LAN only.\n\nThe graphic and gameplay is good with no form of bugs or glitches as of yet.\n\nI would recommend it but not worth the full price.

Why?  It might not be everyone's cup of tea.  I have played 3 easy games so far.  I lost the first and won the other 2.\n\nI'm sure with enough time and study there will be strategies that immerge, but until then, it is a very alien playing field and having ANY IDEA AT ALL of what to do gives a disorienting feeling.\n\nThat said, this is certainly deeper than checkers and approaching the depth of chess.  Probably not as deep as Go (but notice, it's in the same league as these very strong games).  The biggest difficulty is that for most moves there are at least 3, maybe 6 or more balls rolling around the board!  So to get my head around that is proving more than I bargained for when I bought the game, and it's challenging to say the least.  The whole board may look very different by the time your opponent finishes his move (which is really 3 moves).\n\nI can imagine getting good at it and getting to the point of predicting opponent's moves, but that seems like a huge stretch.  I'm happy just to find an openning for the current move - not even considering several moves ahead.\n\nBut if you're not too worried about whether you'll get hooked, I recommend the game purely for the aesthetic beauty and genius of the game mechanic.  It is a simple mechanism, and beautiful to watch it play itself out, even if it makes me feel stupid in the process.  Hats off to the inventor of the game, and I'm happy to support this sort of ingenuity.\n\nThis game begs to be played as a boardgame with a real board.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469419213, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1473465000, "recommendationid": "24511946", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507922", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482013778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 55, "steamid": "76561198093675326", "num_games_owned": 1805}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Easy to get into, a surprisingly deep & original challenge.
