The game let's you take the role of both Kyle and Mel as they venture through the world of superheroes and supervillains. The story is a bit slow on the build up but the actual plot is very unique and original. Each issue comprises about 3-4 hours of gameplay depending on how you solve the puzzles in the game. The puzzles are easy and you won't get off track much since Melvin is there to guide you when you don't know/forgot what you should be doing. The dialgoues and voices are great especially Melvin's british accent.\n\nPros:\n+ A great funny story plot\n+ Great voice acting\n+ Great Music (especially each character's BGM)\n+ Good Graphics\n+ Narrative guide (Mel gives you a hint when you get lost)\n\nCons:\n+ There's a bit of bugs whenever you make Kyle go to an obtacle-full area\n+ There are times that the voices become out of sync with the balloons/text that appear\n\nIf you're looking for a point and click adventure game full of humor, comedy, patriotism, superheroes and supervillains, then Supreme League of Patriots is a must try for you.\n\nI already finished all 3 issues and I just can't wait for season 2! :D", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423996899, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423996899, "recommendationid": "14479359", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507233", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
