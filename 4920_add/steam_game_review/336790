There are endless folds of the world that I continue to discover and that keep me interested and in love. The only thing to be wary of before purchasing it is that the servers were recently down for quite a while which leaves no real way to play the game. Still, the servers are up for now and I would greatly recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499487032, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501467905, "recommendationid": "33362663", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505860", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 45, "total_reviews": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 21}}
