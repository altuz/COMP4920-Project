I'm so glad they were wrong, heheh, well maybe its just a subjective topic and we all have the right to express how we feel about it and that's okay. The thing is, I loved this game, right now I'm on the middle of the crystal cave and running my way through the 3rd boss, I love the dynamics and the colorful art, the game is not that hard to get and the levels are not that hard to finish, but that's just not enough, I need to get the 3 platinum stars and that need keeps me going for hours!\nMy review is over, go buy this game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431655562, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431655562, "recommendationid": "15833450", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513656", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449699104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 784, "steamid": "76561198144646326", "num_games_owned": 237}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This game brings me back to the days of SNES/Genesis days when i had a lot of fun playing a videogame from start to finish.\n\nI recommend this game for those who love endless runners and challenging levels, you need skill and timing, so don't be deceived!\n\n9/10 Probably one of the best indie games of the year\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431476333, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431476333, "recommendationid": "15806420", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513140", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498759527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2550, "steamid": "76561198103203780", "num_games_owned": 283}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I think it's time for meeh to rate and say something about that game ---> Color Guardians.\n\nFirst of all I really like jump n runs that focus on reflexes and skill :)\nThe graphics are cute and good looking.

The mechanics are simple change between 3 different colours to collect orbs or pass barriers etc, get to the end to progress and try to collect all of the orbs for the best completion rate. There are some nice touches in there, like hitting the  orbs colour button as you pick it up increases its score value, which give it a rhythm type mechanic.\n\nThe difficulty level peaks a little too early for my taste, but they do introduce new mechanics right up to the last world. Thing is by half way through these new mechanics don't seem to greatly affect the games difficulty. However as you can complete the whole game in a few hours the game doesn't get old before it's finished.
