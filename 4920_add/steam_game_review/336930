Not really.\nIs it still worth playing? Ehhhh....I guess? Possibly...possibly maybe...maybe possibly...but certainly not definitely.\n\nFirst off, it's a good-looking game, but it's also not. Everything looks sharp and really clean. The problem is everything also has this bright and cheery aesthetic. In a way, it's a conscious design-decision. The backgrounds are fairly muted, while the player-ship, enemies, and bullets are colourful* and easily distinguishable. While I respect that, I think the artist went a little too far. In stage 2, it seems that half the enemies are firing flowers. Are they trying to kill me with kindness? What's the deal here?\n\nStill, this is merely nitpicking compared to Redux's most glaring issue; it's way too easy. When fully-powered, the player-ship is protected from about 90% of the enemy's arsenal. Sure, lasers and bullets that might hit from behind are worrying, but they don't come up all that often. If that wasn't enough, there are usually 2-3 extra lives in every stage, plus a couple extends from surpassing certain score thresholds. If that wasn't enough, then the player can hit a button. This causes a vortex to swallow up any nearby bullets for several seconds. This special ability is tied to a meter, but it refills fairly quickly.\n\nNow if all of that still(!) wasn't enough, there's also the portions of the game that went overlooked. The fourth boss has laser cannons placed along the top and bottom of the screen, except for a massive space towards the left side. This is the most obvious safe-spot I've ever seen. Instead of forcing the player to weave in-between bullets approaching from above and below, all anyone has to do is sit back, watch, and laugh. I'm guessing that when this game was remade in wide-screen, nobody bothered to account for the additional real estate. \n\nI play a lot of STGs, but I'm a mediocre talent at best. I still cleared this game with 10 lives remaining, on my very first play-through. Granted, this was on the default ship, which is practically invincible. Redux added a ship designed specifically for veteran shmup-players, but it's loaded with oversights. The most obvious and ridiculous of the problems is that the veteran-ship's weaponry OVERLAPS THE ENEMY BULLETS! When I saw this, my jaw hit the floor so hard it drove through the earth, and then I cut my chin on the sharp edge of a dinosaur bone. I can't even remember the last time I saw this happen in a shmup.\n\nWas this an actual idea by the developer? Did they think: \"Those guys who play shmups by holding down the fire button all the time annoy me soooooo much. We have to do something about them.\"? I can't come up with a reasonable explanation, I simply can not. So if you're firing away, there's a good chance that you won't even see most of the bullets that are coming directly at you. That's just great. Veteran-ship also lacks the force-pod/other shields, which causes the game's difficulty to do a complete 180. Situations that were originally exceedingly simple become absurdly improbable.\n\nDux originally started off as a strict R-Type clone. It employed a checkpoint-system, which kicked players backwards whenever they died, rather than respawning them immediately. Over the next couple re-releases, the game has become considerably more lax, but that isn't enough of an excuse to assume that anyone can reasonably finish it without shields. The amount of bullets on-screen never hits danmaku levels, but it's overkill all the same. On a normal play-through, anyone can sleep-walk through Redux, but they'll hit a brick wall as early as stage 2, with the veteran ship. That isn't balanced, not in the slightest. If it were up to me, I would have made the charge-shot slightly wider, so that hard-to-reach enemies don't get quite as many opportunities to clog the screen with bullets. I also would have lowered the density of certain bullet-patterns.\n\nOr I would have just made a different game, one that's not actually designed around having force-pods or shields just to survive. Redux is an otherwise competently-made shooter held down by a complete lack of challenge. When it tries to break away, it goes too far. In any case, this shmup simply isn't entertaining.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477853899, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1477853899, "recommendationid": "26322532", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516608", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464363358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 56, "steamid": "76561198146281450", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Beautiful shmup.

F\u00fcr Sega war dies das Ende als Konsolenhersteller. Da die Dreamcast aber bis Heute noch zurecht Kultstatus besitzt und im Gegensatz zu heutigen Konsolen auch noch so konstruiert wurde, das sie auch nach 15 Jahren noch ihren Dienst tut, finden immer wieder mal neue Spiele dank kleiner, unabh\u00e4ngiger Publisher den Weg auf die Konsole. Wohlgemerkt keine Portierungen, die urspr\u00fcnglich f\u00fcr andere Plattformen entwickelt wurden, sondern Spiele, die ganz neu f\u00fcr die Dreamcast entwickelt wurden. Das hat sicher auch damit zu tun, dass die es f\u00fcr Hobby-Programmierer relativ einfach ist, f\u00fcr die Dreamcast zu programmieren - Ihre Software basiert auf Windows CE und Die Spiele k\u00f6nnen auf CDs verbereitet werden, welche die Konsole ohne Probleme lesen kann. Ein solches Spiel, \u00fcber Croudfounding finanziert, ist Redux: Dark Matters. Ein Remake eines horizontal scrollenden Dreamcast Shoot'm Ups, das sich spielerisch stark an R-Type anlehnt. Die grafik ist in Pastellfarben gehalten und die Gegner teilweise sehr fantasievoll gestaltet. Nachdem die Dreamcast Version nicht ganz fl\u00fcssig lief - was man aufgrund der betagten Dreamcast Hardware verzeihen mag - l\u00e4uft dieser Windows Port aabsolut fl\u00fcssig, und die Grafik ist auch nochmal eine ganze Ecke h\u00fcbscher.
