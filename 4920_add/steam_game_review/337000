In short, Human Revolution a game with multiple paths and options, with a great storyline of conspiracy which you have to discover and uncover yourself. You can really invest yourself into the story.\nThe start of the game was, in my opinion, one of the weak parts: you're dropped right into contact with multiple characters and situations of whom you've never heard of before (except in the trailers), but whom are apparently well known to the main protagonist. While these connections were introduced rather sloppy, you do get to know them about two hours in. \nThe storyline overall is very good. The feeling of being kept in the dark was fun, as it led to many surprises to which you can react. The main story changed the rest of the universe as well, which makes you feel like you are really making an impact on it. The story connected to the previous games as well (With Human Revolution being the past and the original Deus Ex as the future) in a way that made sense. Multiple sidequests with connection to Adam Jensen, being old aquaintances or connected to the atmosphere and his opinion about them. Some sidequests are randomly found, which made solving those mysteries much more enjoyable.\nThe atmosphere of the game is great, you see the division of \"Naturals\" and \"Augs\" and the results because of it everywhere around you. The main protagonist can also strike up multiple conversations on the workfloor with colleagues, which made them feel like more than just random NPC's by having discussions or building up friendship even if it doesn't alter the storyline at all.\nThe combat has been vastly improved; in Human Revolution the normal pistol was an unchallenged king out of the other weapons, but in Mankind Divided each weapon has their own merit (Some large open fields for the sniper rifle, different types of special ammunition, effective range and piercing, etc). Gunfights have more glasscannon than bullet sponge enemies, which is something I enjoy as well. Adam's health felt quite low, but I haven't tried out the Titan shields yet, which should give Adam Jensen a much higher survivability. Some situations felt poorly planned, some ambushed start you in a 3v1 situation without cover, making it hard to find cover or take them out fast enough on the highest difficulties.\nThe stealth system was improved as well with multiple phases like panic, hostile and searching. Although this was already present in the predecessor, it's more fleshed out in Mankind Divided by making the stages of NPC's known from the start. The ability to pull enemies with you behind cover in hand to hand combat also was a quality of life improvement, making the game react more to your intentions (Because you almost always want to hide bodies).\nThe amount of possible paths to locations was even bigger than in Human Revolution, making every playstyle viable instead of a choice between vents and following the main path; almost every floor was a new maze of possibilities.\nThe cityhub felt a little less diverse than Human Revolution which had a wider variety of scenery with Hengsha and Detroit, as Mankind Divided only has Prague and a small moment in Golem City. It was, however, much more impressive than it's predecessor as the area's changed much more because of new events. Shops are all over the city, which made selling items and buying new ones quite easy. Shop interaction was kind of flawed; you have to sit through 4 one-liners of the NPC which narrow down to \"I sell items. Please buy items?\" before you get access to their computer (which contains their wares), and exiting wants you to confirm your exiting multiple times.\nThere is only one bossfight in Mankind Divided compared to Human Revolution's multiple, but it doesn't feel like this game is lacking them. \n\nTL;DR:\n[list]\n    [*]Atmosphere feels rich and is vastly visible.\n    [*]Combat and stealth is improved and feels great with multiple options.\n    [*]Storyline is good, albeit the earlygame connection is weak.\n    [*]Possible paths have increased tremendously, making even more playstyles viable.\n[/list]\nIt's a great game, a worthy successor of the earlier Deus Ex franchise.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505596128, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505596128, "recommendationid": "35007283", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539086", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504873281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2395, "steamid": "76561197962569705", "num_games_owned": 303}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I refrained from playing DE:MD until September 2017 due to the critical reception by the community and critics.  I recently completed my first mostly-stealthy and fully pacifist playthrough over the course of five or so engaging nights of play and I wish I'd gotten to it sooner.  \n\nThis review concerns only the base experience, as I haven't gotten into any of the DLCs.  It also does not comment on the microtransaction model, which I understand has caused some uproar.\n\nIt may be the separation of years between playing HR and MD, but I think MD is equal to its predecessor in terms of story engagement.  I did all but one of the side quests and each one of them was well-written and impactful, with the possible exception of the one concerning the underground news ring.  Each step in the story felt like a big deal - I didn't feel like the game was wasting my time, and the world is absolutely chock full of interesting background information if you're the literary type.  I didn't use the Universe app, and I understand there's more there.\n\nPro/Con lists seem to be popular so here's mine.  The pros:\n\n-Meaningful progression - Praxis points make you way better at whatever it is you're trying to do.\n-Rewarding exploration - especially in the hub city, which is just full of neat stuff.\n-Good level design that supports the stealthy approach without making it too easy to bypass everything.\n-Interesting side quests.\n-Fantastic world-building and environmental storytelling.  Seriously, hats off to the devs for all the attention to detail in environmental design.\n-Interesting \"conversation boss-battles\" in the form of debates with significant characters.  CASIE might make these too easy, but they were fun anyway.\n\nThe cons: \n\n-Actually atrocious voice acting for people who aren't named Adam Jensen.\n-Groan-inducing bad-guy tropes such as (MINOR SPOILER ALERT) \"I could shoot you, but instead will poison you and dump you somewhere under the assumption that you are dead.\"\n-Story threads that end abruptly or were not wrapped up properly.\n-Fairly lengthy load times when moving between the northern and southern regions of Prague.  Probably better on an SSD.\n-A couple of bugs, notably one with a telescope that traps you there until you reload your game.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it as a worthy successor to HR.\n\nFor anyone worried about the ability to buy Praxis kits and how it might affect the accrual of kits without microtransactions, I finished with more Praxis points than I knew what to do with.

Do not spend more then $30 for this game. I had fun playing this game don't get me wrong there but it had so many flaws that prevented me from liking this game especially how it ended, more on that later.\n\nPros: It had great gameplay that was fun and non-repetitive. In some situations there was more then one way to take on a situation. The voice acting was done well and believable. The story was compelling and drew me in. There was a variety of weapons and being able to mod and upgrade them was a nice touch. I like the rpg element of earning talent points to unlock abilities.\n\nCons: You earn Praxis kits (talent points) to unlock new augements (talents) or upgrade ones you currently have, how ever when it comes to combat ones they few entirely useless or unnecessary. For example you can unlock the Typhoon ability which is not only the strongest offensive ability you can get it is also an AOE ability. I never once used it in this game because i never felt the need to. In the first game i remember using it multiple times to defeat bosses. Use the cloaking ability to get out of a sticky situation, run up to the boss and spam Typhoon a few times to take out a chunk of the bosses health or finish them off.  In this game no such situation.  Which brings me to my next problem, bosses are practically non existent and the ones that can be remotely considered boss can be killed with a few well placed head shots so they die in like 30 seconds maybe less. \n\nAs with combat augments the weapon upgrades and mods are useless, well mods less so. You can spend crafting parts to upgrade your weapon stats. I maxed out all the stats on my pistol and comabat rifle and they felt no stronger or more accurate then it did at base stats. The silencer and scope mods are completely useless. The enemies are alerted to your presence and know exactly where you are after the first shot, so no point in sniping and no point in reducing the damage of your gun by equiping a silencer. Laser sight and combat sights mods are the only usefull mods for they actually help with aiming. \n\nThe game punishes you for doing a lethal play through by giving you less xp so there for you earn less praxis kits, so if you want to unlock as many augments as possible you have to do a stealth play through. Also doing a full lethal run and gun play through is impossible seeing as the last level is a stealth mission where you fail if the enemy is alerted to your presence. About half through the game it start leaning heavily on stealth or you will quickly get over whelmed and killed on certain missions. I do not like stealth games, I don't mind a little bit of stealth here and there but I don't like being forced into it for a large chunk of the game.\n\nNow for my biggest complaint and BE WARNED THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER. The game ends so abruptly, how was I supposed to know that a guy you see twice through out the game that you know is a lackey to the big bad would be the final boss to the game. A boss fight that was SO ANTI CLIMATIC. The boss fight if done the way they want it done doesn't even take place at all. For you see to get the TRUE ENDING you have to save your boss, a senator and a group of hostages while defeating the \"final boss\" in a certain amount of time and the only way you can do that is to use the remote that you were supposed to find if you did a good amount of snooping and exploring. A remote that activates a kill switch that the big bad implanted into the final boss incase he ever turned on them. What makes it better is that there were no clues, warnings or any leading/segway that lets you know that this mission you are going on is the last one in the game. Its sneak around, rescue these people, kill a flunky and.....cutscene then credits. CONGRATULATIONS YOU BEAT THE GAME. WTF....its over? Thats it? How.....unsatisfying. Do you want to know the ending cutscenes are? A reporter giving you a news report and Jensen telling you that he is planning on going after the big bad. So a lame reporter wrapping up the side stories in the game for you and a unsatisfying cliff hanger telling you they plan on making a 3rd game that we might not ever see is what we get for a reward for playing their game and getting sucked into their story.\n\nThe game felt very incomplete, I feel like I bought a game that was only 2/3 done.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506992041, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506992277, "recommendationid": "35431844", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502800", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505678599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4880, "steamid": "76561198020169469", "num_games_owned": 791}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Short version: a great game any sci-fi/rpg/stealth lovers should play.\n\n\nCons:\n- loooaaaddddiiiinnnnggggggg time (shut your av down to save a few minutes)\n- sequel that will never happen, letting most mysteries unresolved\n- main quest not as world-wide as the previous one\n- soundtrack less enjoyable than HR's (the ending theme is good tho)\n\n\nPros:\n- great environnemental narration\n- side-quests really interesting\n- visuals really good\n- nice gameplay (it's a lot easier not to kill someone by mistake, remote piracy aug is a must)\n- more a cop story (save the neighbor) than a spy story (save the world)\n\n\nLong version:\nI don't understand people saying this game is a failure compared to Human Revolution.\n\nSure, the scope is less.\nYou're mainly in one city, and only get out of it for \"dungeon\" levels.\nYet, the player witnesses by himself the slow fall of Prague from democracy to apartheid, with all the phases in-between.

But, no.\nHe's just a soldier waging his own war to the world. All the steps between are standard blockbuster scenario.\nBut that's not the main point of MD.\n\nMD's main focus is the city itself, how it evolves, its inhabitants and how they cope with the events.\nIn that regard, MD is a success, boasting one of (if not the best) environnemental storytelling in videogame history.\n\nUnlike classic RPG, quests aren't given to you.\nYou have to look for them.

Yet, most of them appear naturally, while exploring, or just passing by.\nThe glitch and the copycat are the two side-quests which represents how questing should be handled from now on: surprise, mystery, danger, trap, emotional stake.\n\nUnlike RPG, lore isn't force-feeded to you.\nYou have to look around, read mails in an ordinary computer, move through tossed beers, broken utilities, burned painting or manicles on the walls (cf look closely in the Dvalis Theater), to understand the inhabitants' personnal stories.\nNothing complies you to do so. But it's still here, waiting.\nThe story of the mom who died in the rumbles of the station, the hope of young artists trying to get out, the despair of a father who has lost his daughter to Dvalis lies.\n\nSome complains about the game are the characters. Too one-sided, quite boring, nothing enthralling.\nIndeed, some of them are.\nThe \"rival\" is so-so. The big bad is \"monolithic\". The love interest is inexistant. Alex is more a plot device than anything else. The crazy aug specialist has potential, but is only used at two points in the game.\nI barely met (stun-guned is more precise) the Dvali boss, despite hearing about him all the game long.\nBut others shine.\nAdam's boss, who must both deal with global terrorist attacks, illuminati manipulations, a gay divorce and a daughter tortured to death by TWM to force him into augmenting her (and probably blackmailing him later with a killswitch).\nThe Rabiah's recrutor, whose sincerity and pragmatism are harshly treated by the police forces.\nSamizdat team. Of course.\nHobos and homelesses, pouring out some nice philosophies or social critiques if you take the time to listen to them.\nSmiley and Chang are funny to speak to. Chikane and weapon sellers ( \"Tars is the man!\" \"F***g Clanks!!\" ) too.\nThe female cop trying to do her job despite the general anti-aug policy. The shrink (aka Madam Photograph? ) and her shady behavior. Helle and the professionnal killer.\nSo, yeah, the writing isn't poor, it's different. The player has to play for it, to dig, to deduce, to speak to, to listen to, to look at every doors, windows, posters and props.\nIt's \"show, don't tell\" made into a videogame.

It should have been a great scene, forcing the player to explore and act in a crisis (save Alex or save random people? ).\nWhy letting so many threads unresolved at the end? Surely we could have got a few more bones to chew without compromising the release schedule.\nWhy the ending feels that rushed?

Disable your antivirus to gain a few minutes, since the game seems to zip and unzip gigabits of level before loading it.\nAnd the music, which is a lot less memorable than HR.\nAnd, maybe, boss battles.

Wait, actually I do, but more on that later.\n\nFor some reason I played DXMD just recently and totally skipped its release, also meaning I skipped all the hype about it. To be honest, I even barely remembered what Human Revolution was about, so I basically played this game unclouded without any memories about its predecessor and without any grand expectations.\n\nAnd oh boy, I had a blast! To make this reading easier, I made this review using bulleted list.\n[list]\n[*] Level design is the best part of this game, and always has been since HR. If you like exploration, it is definitely the game for you. It is not only interesting itself, but also very rewarding: many useful in-game items are hidden in secret rooms, vents and behind invisible doors, and if you search everything carefully, you will never be short of anything: bullets, hacking software, Praxis kits and money - everything is there, waiting to be found. Available game world is smaller than it was in DXHR, but it is much more detailed and complex.\n[*] Aside from level design itself, aesthetics and art design is outstanding. Everything - from costumes and weapons to corporate logos and buildings is drawn on the highest level. Look at the models of implants shown on augmentations tree - it's real art right there! In addition, I have to mention closed spaces design - you will never find two identical rooms here. They all are filled with those little details that makes those spaces look like actual living quarters - flowers, cards, books, furniture, computers, small notes, wall painting - there is a lot of work put in here! And it all provides this immersion - once you launch the game, you are inside - inside of not-so-distant future, with implants in human body being reality, with large worldwide corporations being more influential than entire countries, with new global problems and conspiracies - and you have the means and ability to get to the bottom of it all. Great job, artists!\n[*] Technical side is also good here, graphics itself looks beautiful and the game runs on high enough FPS (on GTX 1070). The only annoying thing here is level loading. Game world is not seamless and sometimes require loading which takes some time, but it is probably because my game were installed on HDD, not SSD; loading from SSD should be much faster.\n[*] Storyline is not something extraordinary, but again, it is all about small details. While the plot as a whole is not much amazing, there are so many outcomes and variables in each story and side missions that I am thinking of re-playing the game to see them all and experience those different outcomes. You can complete each mission in many ways, and your actions and choices will affect main story (slightly, but notably).\n[*] Side missions deserve an honorable mention here - try to complete them all, it will really worth the hassle. They add a lot of depth in the game world, and they are really hand-made - a story inside a story, and if you will be observant enough, near the end of the game you'll learn how your approach to each mission affected related characters, which adds a really nice conclusion to those missions. \n[/list]\n\nAlright, so about this 65% rating. When the game was just released, fresh, I heard, vaguely, about microtransactions issue the game had, but I did not care enough at the time to understand what all the fuss was about. Well, now I do, I have seen the in-game shop, and yes, you can buy bullets, weapons, Praxis kits and other consumables there; but really, it looks like all the complainers haven't actually played the game at all. If you will play the game how it is meant to be played (meaning you will explore your surroundings and pick up all the stuff laying around), you will never be short of anything. In fact, when I finished the game, I had 20k credits, 20 multitools, 1k various bullets and 10 (!) spare Praxis kits I didn\u2019t even spent because I already had everything for stealth-hacking playstyle I chose to play. \nSo, all the downvotes were just because of possibility to buy some in-game things for real money, and might I remind you, it's not even a multiplayer game! So I don\u2019t really get what the heck this all was about; including microtransactions in the game probably was a bad desicion, but in-game shop availability doesn't eradicate all the amazing work that was put into making the game itself. Therefore, if you missed that game just because you heard of microtransactions - congratulations, you just spoiled yourself this great game for no real reason. \n\nSo, definitely [b]recommend[/b]. If you want to play the game with rich story and fascinating world - it is a game for you. Do not be too sensitive to unfounded accusations that are irrelevant to the game in the first place.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505132949, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505132949, "recommendationid": "34881854", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508089", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505149785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2242, "steamid": "76561198150232583", "num_games_owned": 40}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "While the loading times are long and the game glitches, the game is still fun and worth it especially when on sale.

Game's fun, story's meh. Runs about 20/25 hours for a regular-speed playthrough. \n\n===========\n:: Technical\n\nDeux Ex: Mankind Divided (hereafter DE:MD) is pretty and plays well. I encountered 1 crash bug in a full playthrough (while triggering weapon customization at the tail end of an autosave - couldn't reproduce), but I ran into zero game-breaking or progress-halting issues. \n\nThere were some minor sound balance issues in some areas where environmental sounds or music made it difficult to hear NPC conversation, but nothing that made me put the game down or even tweak my settings. \n\nI did have to crank down anti-aliasing despite having a hexacore I7 chip backed by an nVidia 1070 GPU. Something about their implementation of MSAA feels off; I couldn't hold good performance while it was turned up. \n\n:: Story \n\nDE:MD picks up after the story of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, plus a couple of years wherein extra story elements were crammed. The game ramps up fairly quickly though the initial trips through Prague seem like they're dragging - then you realize Prague /is/ the main game setting, as it's where all the side missions happen, and they take up the bulk of your time. This is more of a hub-game, not a destination-game. \n\nUnfortunately this is where my big criticism is; DE:MD's story comes off as half-baked. By the midpoint of the game they've ramped up the scope of possible conspiracies to involve Everything and Everyone, then by the time the game finishes you realize it still involves Everything and Everyone That's Still Alive. None of the main plot points are resolved by the game's completion and there's a completely naked telegraph for a future sequel (which, due to poor sales, is unlikely to happen any time soon). \n\nThe \"Story DLCs\" that were released include one prequel mission and one \"this also happened\" mission without wrapping up any of the loose threads. The game won't bring you closure.\n\n:: Verdict\n\nDE:MD was worth playing if you enjoy stealth/action types of games.
