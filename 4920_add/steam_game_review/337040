At first. Because there is some replayability, but the patterns and contents are quickly known, even if there is randomness in the different aspects.\nToo bad the devs abandonned their game! It can be really great, but in its actual state, it doesn't worth playing more than a few hours. The difficulty is quite hard (even if we can deal with that), it's true that sometimes you start a mission that is impossible to finish due to level randomness, and some bugs remains. It leaves a bad taste of unfinished, and that's a shame because it can go so much further!\nI tried several times to asks the devs if there was any plans for the future - as they said there would - but never had answers. \nEven for a such basic feature as the custom keybindings, they apparently don't mind to do something! [b]Users of azerty keyboards, be warned![/b] You can't change the controls, and it's really a pain. That's maybe the main reason why i don't play this game anymore.
