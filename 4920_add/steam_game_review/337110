I got to the first mini boss and the behavior for the bombs was half broken, sometimes sliding off the screen or sometimes detonating out of sync. I must have restarted it over a dozen times and was not making any progress. Otherwise the story seems to be of some kind of... battlebard from real medieval times being somehow teleported to modern times by the use of a modern portable toilet they use at construction sites. He was somehow also summoned by a group of dungeon and dragons kids. It feels very loose as a premise and the game seems to like breaking the fourth wall a lot. The volume for the voice over audio was all over the place from character to character, and the voice acting was not profesionally done, although felt on the overall, somewhat appropriate enough in terms of tone. If the mechanics were cleaned up, hitboxes revamped, and abilities of the character made at least reliable to use, if not fun or varied, then you could slog through the 25 mini levels and see if there is a funny narrative in this title. But as it stands it just is very aggravating. Many flash games would outperform this game's mechanics. The humor is not spectactular enough to justify going through the aggravation, and the cutesy 2D graphics are charming enough not to condemn this game on looks but certainly wont be pretty enough to encourage anyone to overlook other areas where the game is deficient.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495137458, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505094616, "recommendationid": "31828321", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 4}}
