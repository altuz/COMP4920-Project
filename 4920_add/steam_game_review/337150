The best term I can come up with to describe it is \"satisfying\". It's very satisfying to finally beat the villain you thought is very hard at first, using new strategy. It's very satisfying to find out the hero you didn't like at first actually is amazing if used a bit differently or in different team composition.\nThe UI, while being stylized is perfectly functional, which is very important. And there's even a \"rewind\" button if you misclicked.\nCombine it with a very easy set of rules that you'll easily understand after one tutorial match, fantastic music and that cheesy superhero setting that embodies all the genre tropes you can think of yet still stays unique... and you got yourself a fantastic game.\n\nA fantastic game that still has a few flaws.\n\n\tFirst one is entirely subjective - it's art. Some of it is great, detailed, fits the setting perfectly. And some of it is... well... It's very sloppy and at best looks like sketches. At worst - like a 3 year old has drawn it looking at the actual art in this game. And then there are 3D backgrounds that just look awkward in contrast with everything else being 2D.\nPersonally, I like most of it, it generally fits the overall theme of the game very well and gives it a very unique look. And with time it grew on me even more. But it's still a fair warning.\n\n\tSecond, the matches can take some time. If you are looking for quick, Hearthstone-like matches, you probably won't find them here. However. You can turn off most animations and transitions in this game to speed up the process. And the game saves automatically when you exit it, so you can stop and continue from whatever moment you want. So in all honesty, it's not a big deal. But if you are a kind of person that just MUST see the match from start to finish in one sitting, be aware that it can take 30 minutes or more (depending on how familiar you are with cards and UI).\n\n\tFinally. The thing that actually bothers me most. [b]Multiplayer and DLC[/b].\nThere are a lot of DLC and they are somewhat pricey, which is like... mostly ok. Many games do this. Whatever. Right?\nExcept in this game everybody in your multiplayer match MUST have the same DLC in order for any of you to use it.\nLet me break it down. You can not use DLC you bought in a match with your friend if he does not have it. You still can play together, but the game will disable any DLC the other player does not have. Which is just ridiculous if you ask me. Why do I have to pester my friends to buy the exact same DLC that I own, just so I can play the characters I bought? Or, to put it differently, why can I not play the characters I bought if I want to play with my friends? That's one of the stupidest models I've seen in a while, to be honest, and I just can't get over it.\n\nThis issue may or may not be resolved in the future, since the developers stated that that is not the priority. Right now though things are what they are.\n\nThankfully, this game is still a lot of fun in single player, and the aforementioned DLC bring a lot of content - villains, environments, heroes with their unique decks... but if multiplayer is what you're primarily after, think twice before buying this game. \n\nOtherwise, it is an astonishing game and I can not recommend it enough.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499708925, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500910239, "recommendationid": "33436649", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495317", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505328211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7446, "steamid": "76561198097829041", "num_games_owned": 176}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Do you love the board game?

Naturally, this means that the core game is limited in options and selection, urging the player to spend more to get something that feels like a complete game. You do this by buying \"mini-packs\" or \"packs\" and/or subscribe to questionably priced season passes. \n\nWhen you start a new game, you select a variable stable of heroes, a villain and an environment. Each of these selections comes with pre-made decks. While this makes it quick to jump into play, it's also a crude and uninteresting way to make a quasi-deck-builder. The art and appearance of all this is an amateur comic, with generic feeling heroes and villains fighting in trope-filled environments. Not terrible but not at all impressive. The interface and presentation is also clunky and unremarkable. \n\nNonetheless, because the core game comes with a small number of base decks--heroes, villains, environments--combined with the inability to customize those decks or the game play beyond meta-level selections, the game quickly feels repetitive and monotonous. (Unless you're willing to spend more money to buy diversity, of course!)\n\nLuck also has a notable factor, meaning that a bad string of draws by the villain or environment can cause you to lose the game regardless of how strong you'd played to that point. Like it or not, you're going to lose a portion of games for no other reason than being unlucky. Given the sluggish pace of the game, this can be annoying. \n\nThat said, there is some strategy in what heroes you choose to bring against what villains, which is great. However, as you might surmise, this means that there are more or less optimal choices to bring against a villain or environment, further narrowing the variety and flavor of the game. (Unless you spend more!)\n\nWhile I've dogged it here, I won't say it's a terrible game, but it is slow-paced, occasionally frustrating, and miserly. I would not recommend it over competing card-based games like Obsidian's Pathfinder Adventures, The Elder Scrolls: Legends or Card Hunter, all of which offer more robust and engaging games for more competitive cost. \n\nThe other reason to pick up this game is if you're a fan of the original physical game and can't help yourself.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499869648, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499869648, "recommendationid": "33480863", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481303", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 345, "total_reviews": 369, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 24}}
