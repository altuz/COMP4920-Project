While I will insist that the concept is pretty good and can work to become a very good game, full of interesting interactions, intrigue, and many enjoyable hours, this is not the game that will do justice to the concept of managing an adventurer's guild.\n\nWhile the graphics are pretty good looking, and I am a sucker for isometric stuff that also manages to look pretty decent, there are a few too many problems with this game to make it worth spending time, money, and effort on. To continue on with graphics, your entire gameplay area is your guild hall. No, you can not build the building itself, you only have the rooms there which you can fill up in different, but still pre-determined ways.  Characters do not move around in your guild either, they merely teleport to their destination. You can not zoom out to see your entire guild hall at once, and to find anyone in it is a pain due to how close the camera is. This is less about being a guild commander, and more about being the guy who rents a pre-made guild house and then just waits for something to happen.\n\nIn short, there is no interaction.\nYou can send out your adventurers to other regions, but at no point are you shown any of this. You do not even have a map of the place, and the explanation on how to do things has basically shown you the entire game. There is only so long that you can look at a building in which nothing changes before you become bored, and while the vaguely humourous adventurer names and tooltips help you dull the monotony of not doing anything, they do not solve the problem. \nI was reminded of Progressquest, the game about waiting. Except in this game your adventurers do not even level up. Aside from their equipment, nothing about them changes. \n\nThe list of things that could have gone so much better just goes on and on. Equipment is useless, especially if you consider making some yourself. You have no control over your adventurers aside from sending them out once or twice a month, and even that takes 3 or more clicks if you want to send them to some place that can actually use them. Adventurer's stats recover both too fast and too slow, depending on the situation, and it overall just lacks gameplay.\nThis is more of a waiting game, or perhaps an interactive screensaver, which requires that you keep clicking it or it will give you a gameover. \n\nInteresting concept, but sadly it is all just squandered potential. Guild Commander is not something I would recommend to anyone. Not to people who are fans of strategy, nor to simulation fans, and most certainly not to anyone who wants to build or be creative.

Your goal is to get them all to prosperous and survive a last wave that attacks a province i guess.

And there is a genereal training for them aswell in a few steps that improves stats, not that mutch i maxxed out training in the first minutes of gameplay. The heroes have no exp, levels only items that improves stats.\n\nYou wait and send some heroes to provinces not nowing what you are doing in the beginning, and later you build a few trade guilds. The game gets easy with the cash flowing in, you start getting better eq for your heroes and after a while all is good. You sit around and wait and once in a while a province gets attacked. You send your heroes there by selecting locations in a drop down meny for each of the heroes you want to send. Then you can enjoy watching a green 3 digit number increase from a few hundred to 1000.\n\nRepeat watching the digit slowly increase, and click on all of the drop down boxes to send each individual hero, and thats the game.\n\nThe character depth is a few lines that heroes randomly say from time to time, most of the time, your heroes are represented by a digit next next to the province name. Mechanics are not that good, if you want to let your heroes chill at the base then all your healing facilities are occupied and the heroes you need to use will take ages to recover, so you are forced to send your hereos to provinces all the time to keep the guild empy for the ones that return and need healing.\n\nThe game needs more dept, it might be something you can play on your tablet while being forced to watch a bad movie or something.

You manage the heroes and send them out to different provinces to adventure and bring back the loot which you use to pay wages and expenses. There is a small amount of micromanagement in terms of economics and producing items etc and the rooms you can build vary between about 8 or so different types so I assure you there is allot of replayability but the icing on the cake has to be the games sountrack which comprises of some well crafted middle ages folk music which I will have to aquire as background music for later DnD sessions with my mates.

Unless a large DLC then I say charge 1/3 the price for it. This game though being fun can use some needed additions to gameplay. \n\n     The game can often be waiting doing nothing or throwing guild members at armies hoping to topple them. This works and with the addition of creating trade guilds, training, making items, and supporting local guilds it adds more layers and play. But sadly this all feeds back to improving the same aspect. In the future I would say the developer should look into board/card games like dominion for ideas to add more flair and possibly more mechanics to keep the player engaged without pushing them to hard.

Here I didn't. Says something, at least for me.\n\nCONs\n- Lack of variety - it feels kind of repetitive to organize your heroes and thus makes the game very shallow\n- Becomes a drag after the early game - after you research everything and equip your heroes, you spend most of your time waiting for the next thing to happen. Which often felt to be too long.\n- The end - while I didn't expect much of a story (and didn't get one), the end was very... unsatisfying, especially after the long and forced wait until it actually triggered.\n\n\nConclusion:\nIt actually feels difficult to give a simple \"yes or no\" answer to the question whether I recommend this game. \nIt has its weaknesses. Annoying and very time-consuming weeknesses. It lacks depth in terms of content and possibilities. If you're into complex simulations, steer clear of this, you'd be disappointed.\nHowever, if you're looking for a quite entertaining simple little pastime in a unique setting, you'll probably get your money's worth. I feel like I did.

If you want to challenge yourself with hard difficulty and such you will be looking at about 5-7 hours of gameplay which is about average for a 5-6 dollar game. \n\nThe game itself is mostly a strategic accounting style of guild management the little bit of voice work can be amusing at times and after losing your first few campaign attempts (you will lose your first few) it is satisfying enough to beat the game.\n\nThe only cons I would truely be throwing out on this game is your inability to control who you recruit (they just kind of show up and you take them or wait), your inability to remove people from your guild, and the time it takes to actually reach the last boss.
