It is still a fun experience, but it is not a game that you will be playing for hours on end, so be aware before buying. I find it to be a bit lacking in variety of enemies, planet types, and general game direction, but with more work put into it, this game could become a hit. Also, if you smoke a lot, I'd highly reccommend getting this game just for the interesting encounters and psychadelic graphics.
