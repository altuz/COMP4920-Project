After seeing him to play this game I finally decided to give it a go and I must say that it was well worth it.\n\nThe player is thrown into Doom-like environment where they must search for food, gold, weapons, items and ammo while fighting against hordes of monsters. Not only that but you only have about two minutes before [strike]Error Sans[/strike] Death starts chasing you. The exits won't open until you've killed a set amount of enemies so you'll better plan your actions accordingly... or rely on a huge amount of dumb luck to not end up dead.\n\nThe unique mechanic of the game is a blessing/curse system. At the beginning of each stage you'll get to choose one blessing (or curse) to either aid your battle or hinder it. You can also risk it by rerolling the blessings/curses (at the cost of losing health) or letting the game choose one for you instead. This not only makes the game more challenging but also gives the game plenty of replay value. The blessings/curses can dramatically change the way you play the game so you won't be having identical playthroughs anytime soon.\n\nFinding different ways to play the game is fun but the game still has some issues. Some weapons are clearly better than the others (I'm looking at you, Hell's Hand) which means depending on the weapons you find you either blaze through the levels with ease or struggle to finish the first stages of your run.\n\nSome blessings/curses can really screw you over without you even noticing. For example, there's a curse that halves the speed of your bullets but it also halves the range of your crossbow. There's a blessing that makes the explosions three times bigger but it also makes kamikaze zombies more likely to hurt you. Learning the pros/cons of each trait will help you plan your runs better, but I still feel like luck plays a huge role in whether you'll succeed or not. (This also applies to finding the right weapons in the stages.)\n\nThere are also some minor bugs left in the game. There was a time when I ran through an exit that was floating above the ground and I had to time my 3x higher jump to get through it. Once I was smacked by a spike ball before I even got placed on a level and had any time to react. Sometimes it's also hard to tell whether there are enemies chasing you but that mainly happens with the zombies who possess little threat and are easy to dispose. The enemies/levels also lack some variety but the developer has promised that more will be coming soon.\n\nOverall, while I have some nitpicks with the game it's still a blast to play. The soundtrack is great and gets you pumped, the game runs without issues (apart from Steam notifications glitching out at times) and seeing the world turn dark when Death appears really fills you with dread. Yes, the game is still in early access but unlike the most \"early access games\" this one actually feels almoust complete. And unlike the most \"early access game \"developers\"\" this one seems to genuinely care about the game and interacting with people without trying to sue the crap out of them. That if anything makes this game stand out from the rest.\n\nI paid 5\u20ac for this game and I felt like I got my money's worth during my first run. I'm truly looking forward to seeing what the complete product will be like. Until then, I'm grabbing whatever gun I can find and go running at demon hordes pretending to be on the quest to avenge my pet rabbit.\n\nGo buy this game.
