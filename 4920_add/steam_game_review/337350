Minimal controls, clean level design, and a surprisingly stellar soundtrack, it continued to surprise.

Come one day I see that Messhof is remaking it, and I perk up. I saw the trailer, but rather than getting my hype going instead I felt as if it was a letdown: The music was different, the aesthetic was completely changed, the awesome feeling was seemingly absent. I became sceptical, and I decided I'd wait before trying it out. Then I guess I just forgot about it as I never picked it up for a good year or two.\n\nEventually I saw it had gone on sale and I decided I'd pick it up, as I still remembered the original fondly. My fears that it would be a disappointment seemed to be eroding away, at least partially. The music was just as grating and unfitting as I had dreaded, but thankfully I turned it off and enjoyed myself a bit more. Come a few hours later And I'd beaten it. Much like its predecessor, it's a rather short game. But it's also meant to be played over and over, practiced and perfected.\n\nFlywrench's story is quite rudimentary: You are presumably some nondescript hacker or something and you are infiltrating a security system via a little flying bug that changes colors to pass through gates... Yeah it doesn't make a ton of sense but it's not essential to the game itself anyways and can be freely skipped at your leisure. The strongest aspect is its core gameplay: You flap to not only go up but to turn red and pass through red walls. You let go to fall and be white to pass through white walls. You roll to turn green and become bouncy as well as passing through... well you get the idea. The complexity and challenge comes from learning this subversion of traditional \"platforming\" mechanics, and applying how each mechanic affects how you move and when you need to use a specific ability to pass through its corresponding gate. It can be difficult to wrap your head around, but once you ge the hang of it its quite enjoyable, and the game does an excellent job of using simple levels to teach you the basics as well as subtle nuances about the mechanics, while doing nothing to hinder experienced players who will blast through them no problem.\n\nThat's well and good, but what really makes the game sing is the level design. As I mentioned before the opening levels are excellent tutorials, and later the complexities of the game's' mechanics pile upon each other as new mechanics are introduced in each subsequent world, and each word does a superb job exploring ways to make each and every one of those mechanics interesting and challenging while never compromising its fairness to you, the player. The game doesn't feel like it's cheating against you; Each level might be hard, but they are short enough that you don't lose much by screwing up. The game effectively sets up a promise: A promise that every level will be short sweet and to the point; A simple and straightforward challenge to overcome before quickly moving on to the next one. And unlike games like Super Meat Boy, the game doesn't break that promise by eventually becoming bogged down with long, frustratingly tedious gauntlet levels which have way more obstacles than should be fair, too many chances to screw up, and a habit of wasting your time. (With only one exception; The final level)\n\nIt's a very simple platforming challenge game, but with a clever twist on that formula and a lot more hidden complexity than you might realize. Also a level editor and workshop support give the game a bit more longevity than is really needed, but is a welcome addition nonetheless. Buy it on sale, shoot through it in an afternoon, and enjoy yourself.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502241739, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502241739, "recommendationid": "34115617", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 112, "total_reviews": 119, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
