I was hoping for an exploration experience along the lines of Knytt, but that's not really what this game is.  It's broken up into a series of mini-levels that each take about 90 seconds or so to finish, provided you don't die.  Controls are limited to walking and jumping, and the only goal is to reach the portal and collect as many pellets as you can along the way to increase your score.  Touching an enemy or falling into a pit is instadeath, and results in you restarting from the beginning.  There is a checkpoint system implemented, but not very well - if you die, you begin from the checkpoint, but your level progress is reset in terms of points and the things you've collected.  You may also find the titular keys scattered about, and they are collectable, but I can't figure out what they do, if anything.\n\n\nWhile Dream Tale plays just fine, there's a few areas that could use some work.  The store page boasts four worlds, but they all look extremely samey - I'd love some visual variety.  I'd also like some enemy variety, too - there's two basic enemies - the blobs that crawl back and forth on horizontal platforms, and the blobs that fly in one of three preset patterns.  I'd love to see more incentive to complete the game with perhaps an achievment system of some sort or more of the occasional mid-level messages to add to the story.  If this stuff was developed, this title could certainly be better.\n\nHowever, despite its drawbacks, Dream Tale manages to score a positive review from me on the strength of its level design, and on the placement and implementation of the handful of powerups that aid your journey.  In this area, there was a little variety and challenge, and a few hard-to-reach areas or semi-hidden routes.  Do you go for the extra points, even if you're risking death?\n\nBottom line: I had an evening of fun with this title.  I'm not a high-score seeker, so I don't have much incentive to go back and play this again anytime soon.  If you're considering this title on its own merits, you could honestly find other titles that have more to offer.  However, if you're looking at this as a part of a bundle of some sort, well, then you might get a pleasant little suprise, as long as you aren't expecting more than 90 minutes of play at most.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425347968, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425347968, "recommendationid": "14732300", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517021", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1425628176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 13, "steamid": "76561198152345990", "num_games_owned": 416}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Don't let the simple art style fool you; this is a GREAT game.

A very nice original mechanic early on is a red star that somehow charges your ability to float for a short while; the charge is used up by using it, and you can't jump while it's active, so you need to figure out how to get to where you want to use it, and you need to learn how to use it just enough so it'll last just long enough -- and if it doesn't, you usually fall out of the screen and have to start over.\n\nIt's really fun to play, and if it isn't as long as some others, it isn't as expensive either.

I was surprised that with such a simple concept I was hooked in discovering all of the game\u2019s secrets. A neat touch is that you can revisit the levels you beat but I feel like this game would have benefitted with a time attack mode where you compete with others time completion, which would have increased its replay ability. Also, it needed more levels as 20 levels just wasn't enough as there were design ideas that were screaming to be repeated due to the sheer joy of accomplishing them.\n\nKeep this one close to set a bar of quality for future platformers to come.

Let us....oh wait we have one. I will go over the game in a pro/ con style for Dream Tale and finish things off with my conclusion.\n\nPro:\n      Simple makes for fun. The gameplay style is a simple platformer focused around the use of these power orbs that grant the player the ability to glide, rocket up, or slowly ascend up. Its basic at its core but that is what makes it fun. Nothing too complicated just good old platforming.\n\n       Great story. The story is nothing too note worthy but i enjoyed the story that was there. The amazing part is to actually complete the story you must collect the keys to open the last level and finishing the last level grants the resolution of the story. Mind you these TVs found throughout the levels do spit out some hints to the story it is very welcomed.\n  \n       Whats that glorious sound i hear in the game...music? Yes the music like the story isnt overly amazing but I did enjoy the music that was presented in each level. I want to say the game had enough music to count on one had but it is fine. The music help produce mood in the game, a sad or lost feeling can be infered though the music which ties in with the girl's journey to find her dog that went missing. It also doesn't help that you see messages like BFF on one of the TV with this music.\n\n       Collectables to collect. The game has a few simple collectables to find. Theres the puzzle and the keys. Keys are used to open the final level while the puzzle.... i am not sure what it is there for but it forms a nice picture. These items are in some well hidden areas so exploration is your friend. Also do not die when you find a collectable since if you die, the item will be removed from your inventory and you will need to back track to pick it up again.\n\n       Short game for cheap price. The game is short and can be fully completed in maybe 2hrs. Why is this a positive? It is because the game is cheap and it only gets cheaper on sale. Its only $5 so i say that is a good enough price for what you get.\n\n       Challenge but not super meat boy levels. The game isnt so simple to the point that it give you the win so easily. Later levels provide a nice challenge so enjoy the simple jumping over enemies and little bottomless pits while you can. You will soon need to dodge enemies while flying through the air with limited special power.\n\nCon:\n       Really can not think of a negative for the game.\n\nConclusion:\n        This game was really cheap when i got it and i certainly got my money's worth. The story, music, gameplay, all of it was a nice experience. Sure it is not sonic or mario levels of good but it doesnt need to be. All you need is a good idea and provoke a mood by the player then boom you have an interesting experience. The game went for the sad mood and it did it well with subtle story points combined with music. I really wanted to see another version of this game. Maybe include achievements with another version. Finishing the game left me wanting more but not in a bad way like some people think it means the experience wasnt good enought. What i want is more because it was so good, i had my full enjoyment with the game and I would love to see more of it. Besides if I didnt like the game then why would i recommend it?", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1478578802, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1478578802, "recommendationid": "26484096", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459130216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 84, "steamid": "76561198074703253", "num_games_owned": 589}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is flat out boring.
