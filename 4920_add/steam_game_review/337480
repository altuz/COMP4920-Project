It was a good effort, but overall there just wasn't enough polish to make all this extra stuff actually good.\n\nZombie Vikings looks nice, but it was pretty buggy on my i3 laptop even though it appeared to meet the required specs. Every object on screen would shake around like crazy and the game was basically impossible to play. Setting the graphics options to low stopped the shaking and made the game play smoothly, but the options revert every time I load the game, and it doesn't seem like the game is being actively updated as I've finished the game and still haven't had a response on this bug.\n\nThe humour in Zombie Vikings was worse than the graphical bugs. Absolutely groan inducing, and my standards for humour are pretty low.\n\nGame play is alright, though attacks are fairly basic, and although there's a wide variety of weapons and other items to use, there were only a few I actually felt were worth using.\n\nMy recommendation? Play Castle Crashers instead.
