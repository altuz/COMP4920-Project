It has an engaging artstyle albeit inconsistently applied. Some areas have clearly been given time and effort to look wonderful, while others are completely bereft of any assests on the screen at all. The music is also suitably tranquil as you get to grips with the machanics of the game.\n\nThe wheels start to fall off late in the game when the split-screen puzzles become prominent. You will start dying frequently as you try to use both portions of the screen to get to a certain platform or over an obsticle. That would be fine except both screens don't always reset after your demise. Leaveing you unable to progress further. You can also clip through the game world resulting in the same bug. One half of the screen will become useless to you, forcing a reload.\n\nThis is where it gets worse, because you have to reload the entire chapter, it completely forgets your last checkpoint.\n\nThese frustrations sapped the enjoyment out of a promising game and left me feeling like enough was enough. I got to the penultimate chapter, before the bugs - forcing me to once again reload - got too much.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501901452, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501901452, "recommendationid": "34028857", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527254", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502465658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 74, "steamid": "76561198060643243", "num_games_owned": 194}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm giving this a thumbs up because I liked a lot of the ideas, but I did receive it in a bundle and I don't know if I would have been satisfied with it if I had paid full price.

It's a pretty decent puzzle game on a parallel with games like Braid and Fez, where the layout of the world incorporates a platformer game mechanic gimmick to create a mind-boggling, multi-dimensional experience. But I would put this game more on a plane with Poncho as it too is an imperfect experience, whereas the two legendary games I originally compared this to are grand, flawless pieces of art. Still this game is nice, for what it is. The art and music are plain and peaceful. The gameplay perches at the edge of your control but is engaging enough to keep you moving. This wasn't, however, a title I could play start to finish in one sitting. It just didn't grab me enough for that. 7.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503152202, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503153307, "recommendationid": "34351396", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499499511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 159, "steamid": "76561198065223199", "num_games_owned": 923}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An atmospheric puzzle platformer.
