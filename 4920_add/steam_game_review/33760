Although, they may have took some liberties with the story, it really does follow along quite well with history, for beginners. The game is very short though and I was hoping for more history to be involved with the game. The graphics are pretty standerd of most HOG. The puzzle were excessively easy though, but I actually did enjoy the hidden object scenes as they were a bit more challenging then most HOG's I have played. \n\nI can't give this a thumbs up however as it just needed some more story as well as the puzzles were way too easy. As far as the subject matter there is a bit to learn if you haven't read or seen much about Earhart. Otherwise nothing is new news to be sure as I have watched documentaries about the findings on the island in question many years ago but we still haven't had definitive answers yet. I give the game a 5/10 moslty because I'm glad someone did a HOG on an interesting historical person and mystery  and also the HOG part of the game was a nice challenge."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1484415947, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505929", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "29252969", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198074169975", "num_reviews": 263, "last_played": 1484415809, "num_games_owned": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 128}, "timestamp_updated": 1484415947, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's an average hidden object game, not so bad.
