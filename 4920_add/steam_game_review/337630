So when an visual novels come to Steam, I usually purchase them to support said games. It doesn't help that I this game was made by the same people who did \"Unhack,\" a game which I adore immensely. However, the problem lies in multiple aspects, making it confused as to what the true culprit is which makes this game not pass.\n\n     Let's break down the elements on the game, starting with the music. This section will be short because, to be frank, the music is pretty forgettable. Normally, with another game, I wouldn't focus to heavily on this but, with a visual novel, there is a lot more riding on the music, It conveys what the game can't so the music needs to convey every emotion just as well as the character's dialogue and voice cast, if there is one. With \"Bermuda,\" the music felt static. It never felt like it was anything special and, once the scene was over, the music vanished both from the game and my memory.\n     \n     Next, let's look at the story. The story provided is rather silly in concept and is too rushed to be anything special. It also doesn't help that this seems to be a character driven story but fails in execution, which I will discuss later. The plot is sort of there because it needed to be, that's all.\n\n     Before moving onto the characters in question, let's address one of the major problems with the game: the gameplay. To be fair, not many visual novels have a gameplay aspect so, the fact that this one does makes it a tad more interesting for having one. With that said, the gameplay is boring. If it was difficult but well-made, I wouldn't be able to complain. If it was very easy but well-made, I'd complain on difficulty but that's it. However, \"Bermuda\"'s  gameplay finds a way to be  simple, boring, and pathetically easily. You move the main character, Edward, on the same map, accomplishing whatever  goal is given to you. Whether that be going to the top floor, buying time for someone, or bringing guards to their untimely demise. The problem is that it's the same thing, not really changing at all. It's boring is the best way to put it.\n\n     The last point and the largest problem are the characters. There are only about five major characters, not discussing one for spoiler reasons. The first is Finyomu, the acting commander of the ship. She's only about seven years old but acts much older than that. She wishes to know more about the surface world, studying humans to learn more about them. Besides some things that come up later, that's pretty much it. She's a basic character, as if copy and pasted. The second-in-command, Mukan, has even less character. She's the atypical tomboy, liking girly things (poetry, romance novels, etc.) but having to be a hard ass on the ship. She's overly protective of Finyomu though she is her best friend. That's it. Then the human characters. First up is Paul. He's a tough guy who went to jail for protecting another character, Joanna, and is currently in a relationship with her. He's the guy who the reader might identify with in this situation. He happens to also be the most developed character in the story. The second human is Joanna. I hate this character. She's barely in the story but has such a pull on the Paul and Edward. She is clearly in love with Edward but is dating Paul because he asked. She is the only human teleported back to the surface before something goes wrong . That's all we know! Lastly, we have Edward/Eddie, the main character. He's bare bones, nothing special to him at all. Though he loves God...a lot. Exaggerating here but it's almost like every other sentence is about God. That bothered me immensely and made me start to hate him a bit. It's tiresome, hearing about God non-stop. That's all there is to it. \n\n     In case you couldn't tell, the main point in that massive section above was this. The story is too short for the characters to shine. No matter how bland a character might be, they can be exciting in some way throughout the story. Especially in a character driven story, the length can hinder the characters. Many stories, however, don't have this problem but I finished this game in just under two hours. That's too short. Visual novels like \"Saya no Uta\" or \"Little Busters!\" thrive on their characters. Though the latter is muchy longer, the former visual novel is fairly short, only about two to ten hours as listen on VNDB. However, unlike this game, \"Saya no Uta\" has characters which can shine, even if they aren't the best or most well-written. This game just didn't take the time so the characters fall flat, killing it along with it.\n\n     One last point before the wrap-up: the voice acting. Though these voice actors are amazing, having a deep love for Christina Vee and Kyle Herbert, the acting is fairly stiff. I don't know if it's because of the material given but there's something off with these performances. Well, except Christina Vee, who sounds very good and emotional. Everyone else is stiff.\n\n     \"Bermuda\" is a game which I wouldn't recommend. If you happen to have it through a friend or in a bundle you were gonna buy anyway, give it a run through. It most definitely isn't the worst thing out there. However, don't purchase it. Instead, buy \"Unhack,\" which is by the same people and does everything this game should have done but better.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426827822, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1426827885, "recommendationid": "14968559", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576663", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1426612442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 89, "steamid": "76561198045255782", "num_games_owned": 1038}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 42, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Bermuda is a game for 3$ lasts about hour and half.

The entire gameplay consists of exactly one level. The goals and number of guards change, but this does little to make it less boring. It just felt like a tedious stopgap between story segments.

Especially once Mukan started angrily declaring that she didn't believe in God, all I could do was roll my eyes. It struck me as trying to insert controversy where none was needed.
