You know. That's how I roll.\n\nSoft Body is fun and engaging and well-designed.\n\nIt's also quite difficult to describe. Its official website says the game is \"a meditative action game where you control two beautiful, gooey snakes at the same time.\" I've seen people naming it a \"bullet hell\" multiple times. And technically, you could call it that; but for me, it doesn't feel right. I can't relate to the word \"hell\" when it comes to this game. This isn't hell. This is different.\n\nThe thing is: I'm occasionally bad at games, and always terrible at losing them. Seriously. I'm an awful loser. I get mad. I shout at the screen. I ragequit. I'm not proud of it, but most of the time, that's how it goes: it doesn't sit well with me when a game forces me to do the same thing all over again with little to no reward.\n\nIn Soft Body I enjoy getting hit and dying because that means I get to experience the level again from the beginning. I get so caught in the flow of each level I just wish I could experience it on loop mode, with enemies constantly respawning.\n\nThe order in which the levels are presented kind of feels arbitrary at first, and sometimes you may find yourself finishing a stage and wondering, \"that's it?\". But it's also key for the experience. Some of them are more organic - not necesarily easy, but more \"natural\" to play and move - and some of them are kind of merciless, forcing you to be in a constant state of tension. The juxtaposition of the \"easy\" levels and the harder levels is perfectly planned to equilibrate the moments when you're keeping your guard up, playing very quietly and carefuly, and the moments in which you're just relaxing and wandering, watching the two little snakes painting the world around you in vibrant colors.\n\nIt's the perfect game for those times when you don't want to think about anything, and the days you want to think about everything, too. I'm currently struggling a bit with the hard mode \u2665\n\ntldr; Really cool immersive artsy experience.
