I think the $6 price tag is reasonable in and of itself, but if it's on sale for a dollar and some pocket change again, I'd highly recommend buying this game if you're into platforms. On a side note, I found the levels to be designed more like a Mario Maker level than and actual Mario game. I understand that yes, the game is designed so that everything seems good is bad and everything that seems bad is good, but I guess what I'm saying is that the level design lacks a certain \"polish\" that I can't quite explain in words. It's still a fun game nonetheless!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500059680, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500059680, "recommendationid": "33542702", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 19, "total_reviews": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
