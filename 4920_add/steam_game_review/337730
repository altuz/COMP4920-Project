Not much to it, but its really quite fun when playing with 3+ players. Yes there are not many levels, but the levels that have been made each give provide a different style of play, not just a new aesthetic. The visuals are kick-ass too on highest settings, and if you have a BIG tv, then i cannot recommend enough for some frantic action.\n\nThe game's control is particularly good in that you need to press the trigger button to fire from your turrent, not just aim it in the desired direction with the right thumb stick. This makes  a huge difference to the tactics of your game and allows the player greater timing control. The tanks also have some physics, so if you drive properly you are rewarded with faster movement.\n\nOnly drawback is the price: \u00a36.99 is a bit steep considering the amount of content, but if like me you get this on sale, well all that's left to say is THANK YOU to the dev that made the game.

Don't get me wrong, it's not broken by any means but lacks several things that could have made the game more interesting/engaging. Sound design is also pretty bad in my opinion and the whole game feels more like a glorified flash web browser game to me.\n\nThe game isn't per se bad but coudn't get me really interested and the time I played it with a friend did not feel satisfying at all, specially kills felt very unsatisfying, wich is all you will do in this game.\n\nThere where also missions that for some reason forced us into 4 player splitscreen (2 screens where AI) for no reason at all, never figured out how to play it on one screen.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453640921, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1453640921, "recommendationid": "20724850", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
