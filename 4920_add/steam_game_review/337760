The supply system is cut down, no more railroad track building, no more Divison building, nothing.\n\n I was really hoping to have here a \"better\", newer, Advanced Tactics Gold. Unfortunately is is actually a better looking but weaker ATG successor.\n\n Good, the KI is cheating less(because there is no more real suply system, so bo-ho), but this is not a reason to call the DC series real good.\n\n Ok, you can replay WW2 if you have all 3 DC parts(which unfortunately I have, bought them all 3 in a sale), still I think ATG is much, much , much more fun as you can virtually replay it for ever. There will be not one map the same, never the same starting position. If it is a continent or just a lot of islands depends on your setting in the map generator. You can research better, stronger units with PP(politcal points) which is not the case here as well. \n\n I am very disappointed WHERE the Dev went with this new series(at least newer than ATG).\n\n Dont get me wrong, most likely it should be a \"soso\" , neither a thumb up or down, but because this option does not exist I have to use a thumb down.\n For someone who does not know ATG the Decisive Campaigns series might even be good(but they do not know what they miss with the much better Advanced Tactics Gold game).\n\n Dev - comeon, you can do better than that!!!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507160726, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507161121, "recommendationid": "35482683", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 17, "total_reviews": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
