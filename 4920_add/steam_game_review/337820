First off I enjoy God Games in general; Populous used to be my first exposure and remained my favourite for a long time.  Secondly, the art is funky, and the creatures all make appropriate noises.  Seriously, that really adds to the amount of fun I have with a game.  It's also a Goldilocks game for me -- not too simple, but also not overwhelmingly complicated, so it's just right for those times when my brain isn't necessarily at its best, but I am not ready to go to bed yet, and I want something more interesting than point-and-click, yet Civilization is way too demanding.\n\nThe game has a lot of options, which I also enjoy -- you can play in story mode, where you can choose from 5 different missions, starting quite easily and ending with a real challenge.  Or you can play in survival mode, with 3 different difficulty options plus complete customization.  It is possible to play the game 100% peacefully, no pests, no enemies, no disasters at all, which is also something I prize when I want to relax.  And you can make it unbearably hard on yourself, so there's definitely a lot of replay value here.\n\nSo why am I not recommending it?  I want to!  The developers generally did a pretty good job, and I like to reward that, especially with so many games on Steam that are abandonware.\n\nFor one, it's aggravating that the AI is not smart enough.  Mims don't seek rejuvenation in their house when they most need it, especially guardians who have nothing to do but guard the place.  And yet, they don't recoup their energy easily enough, which means I have to micromanage constantly.  Mims who get hurt badly don't march straight for home either, and can easily die on you (\"too stupid to live\" comes true).  I ended up choosing a custom game with only the meekest pest at a low rate of invasion simply so I could figure out where the AI fell flat on its face, and alas there are many places.  And while I can micromanage rejuvenation and attacks on pests/enemies, I cannot make my Mims cut down vegetation; I have to burn it, and the burn rate is not high enough at the start to deal with the regrowth rate. \n\nThat alone wouldn't cause me to recommend against a game; I'd put up with that, because it is of course its own challenge to figure out a way to win within a game's constraints. I find methodical analysis and trial building fun in its own way.\n\nBut here's the deal breaker:\n\nYou cannot save in this game.  And it doesn't even warn you that it doesn't auto save; when you leave, that is it, your game is gone and you have to start over.  You can't set up two different scenarios, compare them, and tweak each.  If you want to spend some time carefully fine tuning your game's economy, you have to basically remain logged into it for days.  Which totally distorts your hours spent, aside from taking up memory from other games you might want to play or from actual work.  And if your computer crashes, it's all for naught anyway. If you build a masterpiece of Mims civilization, better screen print it and then kiss it goodbye, because there is no return to old glories.\n\nSo I am sorry, but I cannot recommend it.  If this doesn't bother you, by all means, I think it's well worth buying even at full price, because you can get many hours of gameplay out of it if you just don't leave the game.  But for me, this is a death knell for a game; I lose all interest if I can't save my work to get back to it later.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1502485625, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500567794, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500567794, "recommendationid": "33675575", "developer_response": "Thank you for Review, We appreciate time  you send to write this review.

Some points would be better improved. However, the game is certainly worthwhile and I recommend it. \n\nThe Good:\n[list]\n    [*]The Art - There is just something that works for me. The aliens look silly; everyone has there own identity. The buildings are all in style. The buildings have rounded shapes, that resemble the Mims. It all looks a bit weird and clunky. It works.\n    [*]The gameplay - As a godgame it really works. Giving you several options to control your mims. Things are easy to understand. It's a godgame.\n    [*]The secrets - There are some secrets on every island to be found this is fun to do\n    [*]Duration - As I have not yet completed the story of the game. Already 25 hours in it is lenghtly enough for it's price.\n    [*]Challenges - While some are hard, \n[/list]\n\nThe bad:\n[list]\n    [*]Controls - Some controls are a bit clunky. Using two buttons to rotate with the mouse. Targetting mims does not always click that well, for me.\n    [*]No save function - This is a big one. The save function could really help with games. Some maps take quite a while especially with my playstyle, taking it slow. I am not going to pause my game and wait for tomorrow.\n[/list]\n\nThe Ugly:\n[list]\n    [*]Balancing - Somethings cost so much energy, [spoiler] Try installing a house for the mims, GOODBYE energy [/spoiler]\n    [*]Menu - some menus or notifications have to much wording, or are unclear.\n[/list]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503506463, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503506463, "recommendationid": "34442154", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483932639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 157, "playtime_forever": 394, "steamid": "76561197965986699", "num_games_owned": 511}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's like a really scaled down version of populous mixed with lemmings.

Once you setup your economy (growing fruits, feeding animals and selling them), there are various ways to achieve every objective, by using your special powers or sending a formation of soldiers.\n\nEvery aspect of the game stays simple. Don't expect a huge technology tree, just a few options. The same goes for creatures and units. But everything works together and provide a good experience.\nOn the other hand, the special powers got quite a lot of work, so you will be able to put monsters in a cage waiting to be killed, or expulse them from the islands with an explosion.\nI really enjoy how each scenario is completely different from the others, and I'm glad to discover new ways to use the gameplay even towards the end of the game.\n\nOn the bad side, there is no save option mid game, so you will have to play several hours straight to complete each scenario (the game saves at the end of each scenario, and let you replay any previously completed scenario).\nThe overall pacing of the game is slow, but if you liked playing a Starcraft or Age of Empire map all by yourself, you will enjoy it.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nDespite several crucial problems, I consider that this game is a true hidden gem so I recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503817513, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503817578, "recommendationid": "34522627", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469139338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1633, "steamid": "76561198121752988", "num_games_owned": 79}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a good game only thing I'd wish for to make it perfect is a save function.
