Especially with Crystal Souls, he's taken the best of fan mods to Escape from the Pit and put his own twist on them, bringing a hugely fun fantasy RPG adventure with very tactical turn based combat.  The difficulty settings make it so that everyone can have the level of challenge they want, even switching mid game if a particular fight gets too hard for you or you decide you've got the hang of it.  He's really tightened up the UI in general since the old days too, making the flow a lot smoother.\n\nThe skill trees provide diversity without being confusing, it's easy to see what kind of characters you want and go straight for it.  Magic sometimes feels overpowered, but there's always the enemies that are nearly immune to it, making a balanced party makeup helpful and desirable the whole time through.\n\nThe story in the original Crystal Souls game was excellent, and just like the remake of Escape from the Pit, Vogel is keeping the best parts intact while introducing multiple new areas and bosses to the game.  I could go on for a while, but I think I'll just close with the fact that even the games of Vogel's I was sure I didn't like I ended up loving when I tried them, so you really just can't go wrong if you think you're at all interested.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421293215, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421293215, "recommendationid": "13990715", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704233", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421849523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4940, "steamid": "76561198040644412", "num_games_owned": 1004}, "votes_funny": 12, "votes_up": 92, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Excellent old-school RPG with turn based combat. As the case with other Spiderweb Software games, it's slightly difficult to recommend though. The game delivers in terms of great world to explore, character development and interesting story as well. However, for people used to current generation of RPGs with full voice-over, character personality, choices, it may be difficult to get into this. It is really closer to Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale type of experience. Coupled with the isometric 2D graphics entire dialogue and quest content is delivered through huge amount of text. Don't get me wrong - story is excellent, but from experience trying to share Avernum series with friends, it really isn't everyone's cup of tea. So, please take my (and others') recommendation with a grain of salt.\n\nThe game is natural step forward from the previous remake (Avernum: Escape From The Pit) and while minor upgrades are there, it mostly plays and looks the same. Unfortunately, some of the interface problems are still there, for example the infamous inventory issue is still there (when you press \"I\", inventory opens, but you can't close it with \"I\"), but these are truly minor in my opinion. \n\nIt's worth to mention that when it comes to system requirements, you can probably play this on your washing machine too, so if you are stuck somewhere with a decade old laptop or something, you can probably play this game without problems.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421346258, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421350951, "recommendationid": "13997874", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607156", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1425961195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 6289, "steamid": "76561197977767351", "num_games_owned": 507}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 52, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm a long time Spiderweb fan and, as such, I'll just start by getting the obvious out of the way: this is a massive game with tons to do that improves on \"Escape from the Pit\" in many aspects, not the least of which is storyline (which is much more sprawling and epic than EFTP's was).  I enjoyed it immensely and if you at all like Spiderweb games or turn based RPGs in the tradition of Ultima, then you should buy this now.  \n\nThat said, it is slightly disappointing at times just how little is improved upon from EFTP to A2:CS and how, in other aspects, the game takes a few step backwards.  A2:CS fixes none of the glaring interface issues from EFTP.  While the terrible pathfinding can perhaps be given a pass (as it would most likely require significant rewriting of the engine), other minor problems are less excusable: the right mouse button still cannot be mapped to actions (no scroll wheel either), the buttons that open the inventory still do not also close them, and despite the MASSIVE amount of screen space provided, you can still only map 4 spells/Battle Disciplines to the interface hotkeys.\n\nCombat also remains a slog at times, with tons of trash mob fights that can get incredibly tedious, especially toward the end of the game when leveling slows down and experience starts to mean less.  Many dungeons have large groups of enemies in every room, which often kills the fun of exploration and means lots of back tracking to towns to heal (especially since energy elixirs are a bit rarer than they were in EFTP).\n\nIn terms of steps backward, its boss battles are, by and large, pretty forgettable.  Most Avernums, and EFTP was no exception, tend to throw in a few gimmicky or puzzle like boss battles to keep things interesting and make you change strategies from fight to fight.  But A2:CS pretty much sticks to the tried and true, \"Dude with tons of hitpoints attacks hard and summons waves of minions as you reduce his health.\"  It does introduce more area of effect mechanics (such as bosses who cover the floor in fire or ice damage), but it uses them sparingly, and apart from one notable exception, most bosses are susceptible to most types of damage.\n\nThat said, I don't mean to give a bad impression of the game from harping on all its negative points without listing its positives (which are myriad).  So I\u2019ll end with a random list of the game\u2019s delights:\n\n-Maxing out Pole Arms and Hardiness on Mages and Priests to create invincible damage dealing tanks with adrenaline rush (i.e. the ability to attack 3 times in one turn).  You aren\u2019t really playing until your Priest can take 5 polearms to the face and live to cast level 3 \u201cDivine Retribution\u201d 4 times in one turn.\n\n-Doomguard fights\n\n-Random 90s sitcom references (\u201cAbsolutely Fabulous,\u201d anyone?)\n\n-Doomguard fights on speed (and also on speed in the game)\n\n-Buying 2 levels of gymnastics for everyone endgame just to scratch an OCD itch in your brain\n\n-Leaving a bottle of Almarian wine in an empty room in a Dharmon Inn for your hommies who have gone before", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425966922, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425967315, "recommendationid": "14818004", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564249", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1474753286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5416, "steamid": "76561198005512752", "num_games_owned": 586}, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 120, "comment_count": "7", "review": "Short version: If you never played Exile II or the first Avernum II, play this version.  If you have, I'd skip it.\n\nI really, really, really want to like this game.  I've played every game that Spiderweb has put out since the mid-90s, from the first Exile game.  But this one I really can't recommend.  Short version: this game just feels kind of lazy.  \n\nFor me the biggest issue is that Spiderweb really doesn't try anything that new with this one.  There are a few additional areas and big fights, but that's really it, which isn't really enough for a third incarnation of the same story; the game is, for the large part, mostly the same as it was in the previous incarnations.  If you've played either Spiderweb's Avadon or Geneforge series (both totes recommended, especially Geneforge), then you known how many choices you face in those games and how intricate the outcomes can be.  Nothing like this has been included in the updated Avernum games, where it is sorely needed.  \n\nNobody plays Spiderweb games for pretty graphics, but there are some things here which I think are just not cool.  Many, many, of the enemy models are also just recolors, some of them used six or seven times, with very few new models introduced from the recent Escape game. If you go and look at the sprite sheets for the original Exile games, which are very lovely pixel art, you can see the huge variety of characters.  A lot of the models are also from older Spiderweb games, some going back 15ish years, and the newer and older models reallly don't go well together  -- it's painfully obvious which are newer and which are older.  Again, it just feels kind of lazy.    \n\nThere's lots of text I remember reading in Exile II, which says something very good about the writing that I can remember it over 15 years later, but using so much text again just feels kind of cheap.      \n\nIf you never played Exile II or the first Avernum II, then you may want to go ahead and play this game, but I'd skip it if you've played either.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422404174, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422937989, "recommendationid": "14200565", "language": "english", "votes_down": 45, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600743", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493518054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10549, "steamid": "76561198035654018", "num_games_owned": 271}, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 44, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Absolutely wonderful game; small but noticeable changes were made from previous games that make this one better.

Worth getting if you're a fan of the originals or new to the series and just  really like good indie rpgs.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421410869, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421410869, "recommendationid": "14010107", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505246", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467611288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6088, "steamid": "76561198027927938", "num_games_owned": 467}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Keeping the flame alive for turn-based, epic RPGs, Crystal Souls proves that you don't need massive graphical resources to have a grand roleplaying adventure.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425580741, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425580741, "recommendationid": "14748295", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505566", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487673049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 3154, "steamid": "76561198007957678", "num_games_owned": 124}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Don't miss out on this roleplaying title.

It was a confusing mess where I had too much control over my character development and too much freedom in deciding what I could and couldn't do.  My party at the end of the game was an absolute mess, where one character was absolute garbage, two could hold thier own okay, and one became the star of the whole war by happy accident. It was one of the most epic gaming experiences I have ever had. I will never play it again for that reason.\n\nThe new Avernums, Avernum: Escape from the pit, and Avernum 2: Crysatl souls, are not that game. They are remakes of the original Avernums 1 and 2 (which are almost unplayable on modern PCs) dumbed down and made more accessible to the general public. There are pros and cons to this, and I would even argue it is a good thing, but I do feel for those who will never be able to capture that first Avernum experience with these new games, becuase they are, quite simply, not the same. \n\nThey are, in fact, more enjoyable, having done away with a lot of the broken rules that made many enemies (especaily wizards) an absolute chore to fight. The new skill trees make party building extremely transparent, preventing the stat flailing at level up that made one of my first characters completely useless. The new overwold map layouts still reward exploration while providing better visibility and more scope to the game in general. Everything done has been an improvement. There is no better time to try Avernum than now. And yet, the game still leaves me dissapointed on so many levels. \n\nI suppose in the end, it's because I'm jaded. In Avernum 4 (and 5 and 6) my characters constantly struggled. Death was frequent. Combat and encounters were unforgiving. The enemy wanted to kill you. You needed to lose. In this version, my end game party killed the final boss like a chump. I had overprepared, and expected a boss more akin to the summon happy bosses of old. My victory felt hollow and underwhelming. I will never have another Avernum 4. I have accepted that. Yet, if you've never played Avernum, if this is your first foray into the series, I could not reccomend it more. Perhaps your first time will end up just as epic as mine was.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469655183, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1469655183, "recommendationid": "24563530", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499465", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1425505171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1318, "steamid": "76561198047740321", "num_games_owned": 188}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Having played Spiderweb's Exile games since around when they released Blades of Exile, I've been hooked on the games in these series for a very long time.  I wasn't sold on the original incarnation of Avernum, but these newer updated rereleases are really good!  I sunk 50+ hours in Avernum: Escape from the Pit to do everything that was needed to fully complete the game, and I can see Avernum 2: Crystal Souls taking at least that long.\n\nI will admit that I was originally disappointed in the way they reduced the number of party members from 6 to 4 and reduced the statistics and magic system from the original Exile series (there were far more stats to sink Skill Points into, and it cost money to train them, and there were around 9 levels of spells in each discipline with up to around 10-13 spells per level!).  However, once I got into the game, I realized that it actually works pretty well in this format.\n\nAs for Crystal Souls, I will say that coins can be hard to come by, even with selling every single thing that has value that you don't need.  Or at least that's how it is for me where I am right now.  Even with that, though, the game is very enjoyable and you get the chance to revisit many of the same places that you did in Escape from the Pit, though there are changes in basically all of them.  It's a much larger game, though, and very much fun.
