THIS.\n\nThere have been performance issues since the very beginning and not a single thing seems to have been done about it except constant \"well it works on our pc's\" and a single patch that noone who was complaining about issues seems to find did a damn thing.

Oh but they will respond to anyone new asking how the game runs and then tell them that their have been no complaints after this first patch WHEN THE COMPLAINTS FROM BEFORE IT ARE STILL VALID AND HAVE YET TO BE FIXED.\n\nIf you already bought this game, I advise you to request a refund from steam. Do NOT give a developer who is this distant and clearly doesn't give a damn your time or your money. Anyone who has been complaining along with me for the few months, supposedly steam is giving refunds for older titles with special consideration. I suggest giving them a shot.

Just tried playing more to  give this game another try. Still shit. the graphics even on the highest setting are atrocious and glitchy. the lights blink in and out of excistance depending on the angle you look at them. items spawn only right as your about to bump into them, and the lighting looks like someone borrowed the bloom out of oblivion and then doubled it. Running is worthless, it is actually the first game to get me motion sick, as when you run your vision locks straight a head aside from some sharp V bobbing.  When you go to get a soda from the machine or use a keycard it just seems to choose a random position and then flail around. directions for the game are almost non-excistant, \"Find out what the scream was\" or some other objective. first thing you find is a locked door and you need a keycard. opened every stupid drawer, door, cabinate and whatever else with no luck before i quit.\n\nThe design just doesnt look good either. Sinks in counter tops, when  you open the cabinate under them the cabinate is empty. Not even showing the sink sticking down into it, pipes, or anything, so evidently the water just pours into another dimension. In the halls pillars stand in the middle of the walk way, meeting rooms are more cramped then closets, and for some reason, several of the bathrooms have the toilets blocking the door. \n\nThe controls are dreadful, as mentioned with running, they are clunky and clumbsy otherwise, the mouse at times seems to drag as if the batteries are dying, or zip about like a humming bird on cocaine. trying to select something means getting it EXACTLY int he middle of the screen, which is harder then it sounds as your just sort of guessing and fighting the mouses grand maul seizures. \n\nI'll admit, i quit after only a while as it was unplayable, in the controls were horrible, and even worse IT WAS BORING!! So hearing of how its suppose to be scary, (the only thing that i saw was one of the hallucinations from System Shock 2, a much more interisting, tense, and scary game thats only 10 dollars here on steam) i went and watched some videos. Ghost hunters has more scares.\n\nNow, i dont mean to rag on the developer, took a risk and put a game out. Just seems it needed a bit more polish and planning.
