To be honest, I think you really need to get the first game to fully understand (maybe even like?) this prequel. I think that it can be somewhat boring and confusing to new readers so make sure to play the first game.\n\n[i]Dysfunctional Systems[/i] was already a \u201cdead project\u201d when I first got into it. The first chapter was good, and I was very sad that the next episodes were cancelled. Time passed and one day I saw that [i]Orientation[/i] was going to be released. From what I read on the developer\u2019s blog it seems that they\u2019ve decided to finish this story. That\u2019s great!\n\nWell, back to Orientation. I liked the previous art style better, but this one is good too. BGM was amazing even for such a short title. About the story\u2026 It wasn\u2019t that great. I feel like this was made more to \u201ctease\u201d the DS fans for the next chapters. I also found this prequel a bit expensive\u2026 Maybe waiting for a sale would be a good idea.\n\n5/10. I only recommend it if you really enjoyed the first chapter and feels like getting more DS material. Even so, it\u2019s not so exciting like the previous game and it\u2019s about Winter\u2019s days at her school. That\u2019s basically it. [spoiler]I also loved Jack\u2019s hoodie. It was adorable lol[/spoiler]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506173331, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506173331, "recommendationid": "35153615", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558388", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
