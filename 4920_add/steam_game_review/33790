For a game with only three cases it would be nice if it didnt involve hunting for the same objects in the same spots in the same rooms again and again.  Worse yet, there is only three patient cases to solve, so its not like they made so many scenes they ran out of ideas.  Some of the puzzles involve looking at an X-Ray as seen in the scrreenshot above, to diagnose a patient.  Notice that you are supposed to be diagnosing the patient, but instead there are spelling and numerical errors on the chart, seems the puzzle should be why this hospital sucks.  Speaking of a sucky hospital, when doing Hidden Object hunting in the rooms with the patient, there will be tons of crap ON the patient, everything from birthday hats, to pepper shakers, worst hospital ever! \n\nElizabeth Fail M.D. Diagnosis Mystery SUCKS!

However, when you have also your private life and friendships being tested, it's another story.\n\nLike I've said, the game is too damn short, as you have only three patients. Elizabeth Find is also belonging to the old gameplay for HOG: list of items on list of items and some puzzles thrown in between.\n\nWhile you'll have scenes in the hospital, you'll be also outside, investigating the environement of the patients, like in House. However, what I'm kinda disappointed to see that, while every character from the first game is there, some of them changed personality suddenly.\n\nAnd if anything, I didn't really enjoy some puzzles.\n\nAnyway, if you're not bothered by only HO scenes, you can go ahead. Although I would take it from a bundle or with a discount. Because nearly 20 euros for three cases is too much."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1388335179, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499329", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8400464", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198055076584", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1407201348, "num_games_owned": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 349}, "timestamp_updated": 1388335179, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good seek and find game.\n\nPros:\n- Lots of objects to search through.\n- Lots of puzzles to complete.\n- Nice selection of puzzles in addition to the seek and finds.\n\nCons:\n- A little more story than I would like compared to the amount of game play.\n- Too much looking for objects you've already looked for."}]}
