First of all I enjoyed reading 'cause there is a lot of text and I fancied every minute of it. Then it's my first Koreen game and at the very beginning it sounded strange and unusual for my ears but soon I was so into it. I'd finish the game sooner but I enjoyed the characters' voices sooo much especially Yuri and Tei. As for the routes the game made me think that maybe there's smth wrong with me 'cause why do I always fall for the damaged types?! like Toma in Amnesia and now Tei... Also there are so many bad endings here, I usually play otome games to experience some positive emotions but here I couldn't help but felt a bit depressed sometimes and ready to cry. But that's really ok, it made the game deeper, made me think a lot.  My thoughts are still not in order, I'd like to replay this game again some time later. Thank you for this masterpiece!\nP.S. I just thought about one little thing that I'd like to be able to improve - the print of the text could be a bit larger...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505136541, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505136541, "recommendationid": "34882805", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505468971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 876, "steamid": "76561198259190036", "num_games_owned": 6}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Sweet", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504901925, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504901925, "recommendationid": "34822334", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 254, "total_reviews": 269, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 15}}
