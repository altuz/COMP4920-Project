I've only experienced 2 out of the 9 endings but from those I know I'll be playing again to get some the others too. \n\nYou can either follow a guide online, or the game will give you tips if you fail along the way, which is pretty nice. But the save feature is bugged on some PCs, it doesn't matter too much though cuz if you fail you pretty much have to start over again anyways because of the stat-raising. It also doesnt support steam-overlay for taking screenshots, which is sad cuz theres some great art in here.\n\nThe art is good all around, backgrounds and characters and 'action shots' are all well done.\n\nOverall this game was a good experience, lot of feels and 'romance' options that don't involve panty shots and boobs flying everywhere (which good be a bad thing?? I think it's a nice change of pace from recent VNs) Would recommend. \n\nAlso do Oure's story.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421480552, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421480552, "recommendationid": "14025852", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617434", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1422355608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 461, "steamid": "76561198078711322", "num_games_owned": 61}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 33, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Here's the run down: X-Note is a visual novel created by Zeiva Inc. You play as Essi, a psychic who's mother died ten years previous to the game, leaving her only with a USB flash-drive with a locked folder on it called \"X-Note\". Essi is approached by a young man named Yuon and invited to join the Xen Institute to investigate a murder and a disappearance that may be somehow connected to her mother's death and the X-Note. Essi accepts, and the mystery begins.\n\nBefore you even play, there's one thing you should know: Bad endings seem rather inevitable without a guide. When a bad ending occurs, most likely you will have to replay the entire game over again. This happened to me on two occasions, and it does get very tiresome. If you want to go forth straight to get the endings you desire, you're better off using a guide. Though if you prefer going on your own, by all means, you should play without a guide. \n\nAs a VN, the game is primarily text with quite stunning but unique artworks, with a few choices popped in here and there, plus mini-games to up your psychic powers (which I will talk about later). Sometimes the choices don't matter. Most of the time, they do matter and lead to a bad end if you don't know who's route you're going for. However, the routes themselves are quite short. You'll spend roughly an hour to an hour and a half going through one, depending on how much you struggle with the mini-games.\n\nThere are three guys in the game you can go for: Yuon, Anon and Oure. I've only gone through Yuon's and Anon's, but they were both really great stories. I especially liked Anon's, for reasons I will not spoil. I do intend to go through Oure's, as there are still things I have not learned and you don't find out every mystery in just one play through which is what I really like about this game. It adds to the replayability and enhances the mystery. To be warned, there are some things are easily predictable in this game. But other times, I was pleasantly surprised and shocked to learn what this mystery had in store.\n\nAnother key factor of this game is pretty much your \"skills\" of the game. Essi's psychic powers. You have the option to choose between Psychokinesis, Clairvoyance and Telepathy. Generally, one power is more helpful in certain playthroughs, depending on which guy you're going for. However, you're still going to want get them all up to max by the end of the game. I think the powers were a little bit of a let down mostly, as your character didn't change really whether you specialised in one form more than the others. There were not really any scenes where the outcome seemed to change drastically by what you had powered up more. I think this game could have improved a lot more if it had more focus on the psychic powers. They were critical in the big picture, just not to certain scenarios. \n\nTo achieve these powers you must go through different little minigames (such as memorising and clicking at the right time) which grow to be quite challenging as the game goes on. They were quite fun, but at times I admit that I grew frustrated with them. \n\nIf you can get this game on sale, like me, go for it. I still find that it is worth twenty dollars however, even if it is a little short. \n\nOverall, X-Note is a really a fun game, with a good mystery and some rather dark scenes within. You feel for the characters, some more than others, and Essi turned out to be an interesting protagonist, with her own quirks and interests (like obsessing over the colour black and drinking straight black coffee). The music is rather basic in my opinion, but nice to listen to and not annoying and repetitive. All the music sets very certain tones for the scenes, which kind of reassured me about what was going to happen next. The story is well written with lots of incentive to go through all three routes, the artwork is unique but lovely in my own personal opinion, and I'm pretty excited to keep playing and go for Oure's route. \n\n7.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422266771, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422266771, "recommendationid": "14175689", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546352", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500739588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1051, "steamid": "76561197996837854", "num_games_owned": 261}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "review": "X-note is a game I have been following since the demo was released on Zeiva's deviantART page some number of years ago (the demo is also available for free off of Zeiva inc's webpage: http://www.zeiva.net/). Seeing the full game now available on Steam was exciting and I was not disappointed.  \n\nThe graphics, the characters in particular, were all very pretty and cohesive in style.  Atmospherically, the combination of horror themes, music and lighting were done well and used sparingly to create dramatic effect during those scenes.  The music was mixed frequently to help break the monotony of background sounds on a loop; plus the music was better than anticipated going into the game.  As a note, there is no audio for the dialogue and narration.\n\nGameplay wise, the game relies on both choices and mini games which boost stats.  There are only 3 stats and only one can be trained via mini game per day.  The mini games are doable without being overly difficult for the casual player.  If you were to get a bad ending due to stats, the game gives helpful advice as to what to do for next time so it eliminates the need to go hunting online for a walkthrough.  There are 9 different endings, and each ending adds something to the overarching storyline.  My only critic of the game is that each path is relatively short and can be completed in roughly an hour.  However, the story is interesting, emotional and I look forward to the sequel Area-X.\n\n\nOne nice thing to note is that anyone who has already purchased this game off of Zeiva inc's website may obtain a free steam code by e-mailing them the e-mail address that they purchased the game with.
