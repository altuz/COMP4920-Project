And not just like normal cheaters who try to at least seem like they're playing normally, these guys wouldn't even bother hiding the fact they were cheating. A lot of the time it would bee a situation like so: I would be running around killing things and collecting stuff/finishing missions and some guy with a knife would fly towards me or appear next to me and kill me in about 1/2 second. End up back at the safe zone and suddenly same guy flies into the safe zone and kills me there somehow.\nThe game itself was fairly clunky for a modern first person shooter, but I could get past that, what really brought it down content-wise was the absolutely appalling quality of the voice acting, especially that kid in the first area that you had to talk to for the quest about the doctor guy. I was pretty high level (or w/e progress was measured in in that game) by the time I stopped playing, the main reason of which was the fact that because of some people abusing the radiation bug for massive amounts of attribute points, which when said situation caught the ear of the game developers, it caused them to decide to spontaneously wipe all progress on the server less than a week after the last wipe where they had promised never to wipe their servers again. I mean, isn't that what the banning option is for? \n\nTo sum it up, the dishonesty of the devs, the lack of proper anti-cheat, the fact that the developers were completely unwilling to ban cheaters and exploiters that people have caught and recorded footage of, and the overall quality of a lot of aspects the game was just subpar at best. I could get over it at first, like I said at first, but eventually I just couldn't take it any more and stopped playing. Had it been released in say... 2006, I would be absolutely in love with the game, but seeing as it was released fairly recently in terms of the passage of time is just a huge disappointment.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487151461, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1487556834, "recommendationid": "29938295", "language": "english", "votes_down": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565225", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465049059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1123, "steamid": "76561198052288149", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 25, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I do not understand why STEAM do not remove crap games, when you know folks are getting ripped off.\n\nGame had potential; now left is disarray.
