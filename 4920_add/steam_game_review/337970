No, it does not! The game it self is not what I was expecting it to be, however like all games it has its upsides and downsides. Upsides: The animal selection is large enough for a zoo game, and on top of that, Wild creatures has extinct animals you can bring back including two dinosaurs, Velociraptor and Archaeopteryx. Another upside is that you can use a certain fences to make a tank using a water pump. Downsides: Like in all zoo games, the guests are as need as **** ( are real zoo guests this flippin' needy!). One thing that I found weird is that instead of placing animals, you place houses that are specific to a species of animal and then you can buy the animal that the house is specified for (what happens if I want to put tigers in an enclosure with a lion house?!). Overall this game is interesting enough if you love animals. \n\nTotal score: 7/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429739256, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429739256, "recommendationid": "15496376", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564248", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459351792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1555, "steamid": "76561198188558326", "num_games_owned": 3}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 27, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is by far my favorite game to play now. I was a HUGE fan of the Zoo Tycoon franchise, and being that it isn't available on Steam (and my laptop has no disk drive) I downloaded the original \"Wildlife Park\" to see how I like it. I LOVED IT, so I downloaded the \"Wild Creatures\" expansion. Having loved that so much as well, I play this game more than any others I've gotten from Steam. \n\nBottom line: LOVE the original title and the \"Wild Creatures\" expansion more than I ever loved Zoo Tycoon and it's entire franchise.\n\nYes, I would recommend this game to EVERYBODY that loved (or even just liked or enjoyed) Zoo Tycoon.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438972234, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438972234, "recommendationid": "17432464", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530098", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1457837711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198176742698", "num_games_owned": 25}, "votes_funny": 16, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "6", "review": "This the worst out of all the wildlife games.If you play this please tell me how to place animals.But i do not recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457838076, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457838076, "recommendationid": "21804779", "language": "english", "votes_down": 124, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.322984", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
