The game has the classic jrpg elements like overworld/city map system, turn-based fighting with set classed characters and various jrpg like item and equipment settings. Unfortunately the enemies offer nothing, one can posion, stun and paralyze every enemy even the final boss(except one enemy encountered in the mid game which is the only adversary worth talking about). The spellcasters and healers in your party are way too powerful and there is an abundance of mana recovery items. Unfortunately the story is not good enough to compensate for the lack challenge in combat. Only recommended if you are jrpg junkie.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499437784, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499437784, "recommendationid": "33344308", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508013", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 15}}
