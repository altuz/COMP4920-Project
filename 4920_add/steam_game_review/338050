You explore, collect upgrades, try not to run out of oxygen, and pass through puzzles and game stages, and collect plants in order to progress to the next level. Very simple premise.\n\nGood things about this game: It has great art, the backgrounds in particular are nicely done. The art direction (Being a very gray low light environment - in fact I think the game only uses something like 4 or 5 colors outside of grayscale) is well executed. It is also fairly inexpensive - I picked it up on sale at about $7,99 USD.\n\nI am very tempted to ask for my money back. Here's why:\n\nIts not a bad game. Its just not worth even $7,99\n\nFor starters, the game is dull. Its simply dull. There is a paper thin plot: Your submarine crashed and you're on the bottom of the ocean and you think you're going nuts and that your robot is trying to kill you. No big deal, I've enjoyed paper thin plots before. However, you generally have to fill that gap with something. Anything that engages the player and says \"Stick with it! You're having fun blowing stuff up!!\" Or \"OOOOO MONOTONOUS YET ARTISTICALLY RENDERED MYSTERY!\" Or \"Compelling yet one dimensional characters dieing in macabrely humorous ways!\"\n\nAnoxemia has none of these things. It fails to engage you to continue playing other than the self-flagellating realization that you paid $7.99 for this, and therefore must crack on to try and pass the movie-ticket test (In that you feel compelled by your own fleeting sense of frugality to extract entertainment value from this expenditure). That is literally why I played at it. My play time owes to the lack of a \"Request Refund\" convenience button for Steam. Should've played the demo. But I digress.\n\nThat said, I've encountered this before and played, and even completed, other games for longer periods. However, Anoxemia has other problems.\n\nThe controls are clunky. Most of the movement is modeled on a tethered partner system. You move the robot, the human (Which the game implies is you) laggardly follows along. Clumsily. Poorly. Stopping to pick up that oxygen container despite the fact that the DRONE OF BEE LINING DOOM is about to magically get you and kill you in one hit. Poor nameless human. Granted, you are on the bottom of the ocean (This is discussed later), so movement should be clumsy, but not unpredictably, stupidly clumsy, to the point of annoyance.\n\nThe human, by the way, seems to be functionally pointless in this game. Aside from carrying dynamite, his purpose is four fold:\n\n1) He is the anchor for the \"Robot is secretly trying to kill you\" plot tension\n2) He is how the player would theoretically relate to the game as a protagonist (This may have been a miscalculation)\n3) He is an excuse to introduce use the color pink in the game's intro cutscene.\n4) He is the generator of one half of the completely uninformative dialogue in the game.\n\nWhich bring us to back to the dullness. The dialogue in the game is almost never related to what you're doing. It explains things unreliably at best. The most useful dialogue line from the ATMA robot was along the lines of \"THIS IS A MINE TURRET, IT TRACKS HEAT AND MOVEMENT. IF YOU'RE HOT ENOUGH!\"\n\nThis very one-dimensional dialogue provides no real explication of why we are doing anything. It tells me I'm gathering plants. I do not know why. Perhaps it is revealed later. Perhaps they are magical plants that are the causation of this war that spread oxygen canisters and comical WWII Mines across the sea scape. Maybe they eat radiation or the magical acid that serves as the INFINITEFOREST of this game. Maybe my character is helping to secretly develop some kind of special wax for his mustache. Don't know, don't care. \n\nAnd that is the failing of this game. At no point was an observable attempt made to engage the player.\n\nBut the game makes a more critical mistake.\n\nIts not challenging. The game is as advertised in one sense: It is hard. However, the developers appear to unfortunately fall into the trap of conflating difficulty with challenge. Dieing profusely is not an indicator of challenging gameplay.\n\nAnd you will die alot, but not because the game is challenging, but because your controls are poorly designed, and the enemies seems mismatched to the puzzles they are placed in. Some of the BEELINEY drones don't even patrol. They just randomly zip around until you go for the plant, at which point they tag you as the level fades out and thus reset your progress. Meaning you have to restart. Sometimes dark enough that you'll think you've won, except SURPRISE! YOU GET TO REPLAY THE LEVEL YOU JUST COMPLETED!\n\nWhich is the other failure of the game. Level start checkpoints only. Granted, the levels are generally short. But it is annoying to have to rinse repeat myself three times in a row for a simple puzzle that failed because my diver dude decided to hang on a corner or randomly pickup a canister. In and of itself, this is not a game killing problem. Checkpoint deserts happen.\n\nIt becomes a bigger problem when you consider that hitting the escape key causes the level to reset when you go to the ingame menu. There is a pause/play option, however. It is the enter key. It does not appear to have entered into the development design process to integrate those two functions (i.e. a pause menu)\n\nTaking final stock, Anoxemia has an interesting premise that is undercut by its execution, despite its artistic merits. Its control scheme, however, does accurately render the experience of trying to solve a rubix cube in quicksand. These may seem like a harsh thing to say, but it is my honest rendering of my albeit limited experience with this game.\n\nBased upon these an other factors, I can't recommend Anoxemia as a solid investment of your gaming dollars at this time.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421603377, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421603377, "recommendationid": "14054049", "language": "english", "votes_down": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580745", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421869786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1051, "steamid": "76561198068620172", "num_games_owned": 19}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Well, as for me, I underline next points:\n\n1) excellent graphics - for indie project it 10/10 (for game below 5-7$ - one of the best choices on steam store)\n2) deep horror atmosphere 10/10\n3) perfect soundtrack 10/10\n4) all what I can say about gameplay - it's very addictive (and when I say very I mean VERY!!)/ I forget about time when I was passing through first 15 levels.\n5) finally it is an honest old school underwater horror.\n\nNot much indie games since last few years make me so happy and excited.\nMy recommendation is strictly positive. 10 underwater samples from 10 XD", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421781545, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421781545, "recommendationid": "14086130", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508815", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421961873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 712, "steamid": "76561197975093091", "num_games_owned": 434}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": "11", "review": "NEW REVIEW - \nIt's OK and worth a try considering how much it costs. Since updating several times since launch, bugs amd issues that are mentioned below and in other reviews have been fixed and some gameplay mechanics have been slightly tweaked to make this a more fun experience.\n__\n\nOLDER REVIEW\n\nGetting a bit of heat for this one, but please give my thoughts a chance.\n\n**Please read the comments below from the developer regarding my issues below**\n\nThe ambient music, look and simplistic gameplay are nice and there is quite a bit of stage variety when you get later into the game.\n\n The controls (using mouse at least) aren't always ideal. I found myself accidentally using the harpoon quite a lot after first finding it because it's set to the same button I used to move. I think it would be nice if mouse 1 was harpoon controls and mouse 2 was move (or something like that).\n\nThe human following you, who ATMA refers to as 'it' (Markiplier, right?), can sometimes be a bit foolish. He seems to love stopping to collect things when there is imminent danger present, so you need to make sure you lead him away from items if you're trying to get away from something. I actually don't mind this mechanic all that much, because it means he really is relying on you to get him out of harms way, so you're own movements mean a lot more. \n\n I found that I wasn't absolutely correct in my video, as you CAN avoid all the extra boxes and still get through the game, providing you know where to go,how to get there and have a sufficient amount of o2 and power. So ideally, to give yourself a good chance on the next level, you should scout out the level, die, then give the level a quick run through getting everything you need.\n\n Exploring the levels can be quite fun and rather rewarding. However, sometimes you can't really afford to if you want a good chance on the next levels, so unless you want to play levels you've already completed over and over, you just want to get all the plants/documents/items as fast as possible to avoid starting the new level with 1 minute of life. \n\n I still maintain it's a bit annoying to collect something, accidentally die (which is quite easy on some later levels) and never get the opportunity to get it again, unless you completely reset your progress and start from the beginning. That seems unnecessarily punishing, especially if you start off with around a minute of power or o2 and don't really want to replay older levels.\n\n Personally, the reason I wouldn't recommend this game is because I begin to get bored repeating older levels to prepare for newer ones, but if you don't mind that, give it a try.\n____\n\nOriginal review 3 hours after release -\n\nCurrently, there are bugs which cause some boxes and some drone power refills to only spawn once per play, meaning you have to speedrun this game and get everything right the first time, or run out of power and die.\nThe game seems interesting and has a lot of potential, but I warn you to stay away until this vital part of the game is fixed.\n\n____\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAQJw7xfl74 - The first few levels and my experience with them.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421442972, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421852070, "recommendationid": "14018569", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504313", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1422468272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 325, "steamid": "76561197983804767", "num_games_owned": 277}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "To start, I'm not done the game yet, I'm about 15 levels in!\n\nLike a lot of puzzle games it may seem unfair and frustrating at first.
