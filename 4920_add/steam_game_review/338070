None are fully translated, but each is playable enough to get the basic feeling of how they work.\n\nLunatic Dawn is a series of dungeon crawler/sim games with a heavy emphasis on freely choosing what you do and where you go.  The first and second games involve creating a character and then recruiting other party members, with whom you travel, fulfill requests, and plunder dungeons.  The third game in the Legends Pack is not party-based, but retains the same freeform structure.  \n\nEach game varies in the details, but the overall approach is very similar.  You begin by creating your character, and determining how you want to play by altering their abilities.  There aren't so much set \"classes\" in Lunatic Dawn, as there are various abilities which determine what actions your character is best at.  For example, if you want to play a primarily melee character, you'd want to sink stat points into the appropriate attributes, like strength and physique, and then purchase the appropriate equipment for that type of character.  Later on, through the training field, you would choose to train in those skills most relevant to your attributes, like \"sword\", \"shield\", or something similar.  There are also certain general skills which pertain to survival, like \"sentry\" and \"camping\", which any character can benefit from.  \n\nOnce in the game, you are dropped immediately into a town and left to do as you please.  There is no drive toward a particular set of quests or a particular area - you are free to travel and interact with whomever you want.  Recruiting party members is essential, as especially in the beginning, combat can be extremely difficult.  They can be found in Inns, and are free to recruit - the tradeoff comes in how they work in combat, and that you must split your loot (including money) with each of them.  On the bright side, supplies, like food and lamp oil, are also split, meaning that you pay much, much less for essential items with a full party than you do alone.\n\nOnce you have a party, you can find various requests to fulfill and places to explore, and generally the amount of reward money correlates with the difficulty of the quest.  Sometimes these quests involve something as simple as traveling from one town to another, and other times they involve finding specific people and hunting them down/finding particular items/clearing out dungeons.  This can be difficult to figure out from the text alone as a lot of it remains untranslated, but for most quests, the game actually displays quest-relevant locations on the map - if anything, you can head to the newly placed markers and generally accomplish what you set out to do.\n\nBattle is a pseudo-real-time situation.  Your party acts independently of your character, but can be encouraged to focus on a particular enemy or move in a particular direction on the field.  Left to their own devices, the entire party will move about on their own and attack what's closest to them - your own character included.   Otherwise, you can choose an action to take by either clicking the screen during battle or when an enemy is killed.  Options exist for battle to play out entirely on its own for when you're facing easier groups.  Party members cast their own spells and choose their own weapons; you are largely unable to influence anything but the most general strategies in battle.\n\nThe third game differs from this formula by being more diablo-like in execution.  You press a key to switch to \"attack\" mode and click to attack your enemy, then switch back to the interactive mode.  As such, battles are smaller, but nevertheless challenging.\n\nOverall I would recommend this pack to anyone interested in a unique dungeon crawling experience.  It can be difficult to navigate due to the language barrier, but the gracious folks in the discussion forums are still hard at work translating and updating info for these and other games as well.  Those who stick it out will find a collection of games that really stand on their own - I can't think of anything else that plays quite like Lunatic Dawn.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456718129, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456718129, "recommendationid": "21539407", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517238", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451596626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 27, "steamid": "76561198232832708", "num_games_owned": 116}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Not a bad series for the time the games were made!
