You can see that some effort was put into the expressions given by the main character - and far lesser effort was put in regarding other character models.\n\nBut the problems with the game are more than just cosmetic. The game itself has a variety of game breaking bugs. The first is game crashing when the game has to minimize or you alt+tab. The game also crashed when encountering your first major bad buys on the bridge, just in the first 20 minutes of the game. \n\nAnother problem is that combat requires you to be right on top of enemies, practically clipping into them, to ensure that your combat strikes are hitting.\n\nTwo crashes in 35 minutes of gameplay that both require hard computer resets ends any further desire to continue into the story of Venetica.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503238591, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503238591, "recommendationid": "34374586", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498949", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 74, "total_reviews": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 24}}
