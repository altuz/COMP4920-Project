The game is simple hack and slash, and is far too easy.

There is simply no variety in the game other than kill all the baddies and move onto the next scene.\n\nIf you were ever and fan of the Commodore 64 game 'Samurai Warrior: The Adventures of Usagi Yojimbo' or even just a general Miyamoto Usagi fan, steer clear of this game and just go play the C64 classic intsead.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455261245, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1455261245, "recommendationid": "21145510", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499677", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466579456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 482, "steamid": "76561197982701393", "num_games_owned": 2686}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Like they said, an uncomplicated retro brawler a la Double Dragon or TMNT.\nNothing fency like Mortal Kombat, less violent and good for younger audiences and like the wonderful comic series recommended to those who enjoy Sakai's art and story telling and who don't need enemies being stripped of their spines or needless other gore fests.\nI got my fun out of it for that price.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422841862, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422841862, "recommendationid": "14290128", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514214", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1422622809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561197970561377", "num_games_owned": 1338}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 27, "comment_count": 0, "review": "4:3 aspect ratio + inability to quit game + no spoken dialogue = Sub-par brawler for die-hard Usagi Yojimbo comic fans.
