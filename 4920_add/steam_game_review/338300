I really don't care about the Chicken Little franchise but ended up playing this game with my daughter on the Wii and found it quite fun. It is basically a 3rd person shooter with lots of unlockables and replayable levels. You get to play as someone on the ground, as a tank, and as a starfighter. Lots of varied enemies and levels. Never seemed to be repetitive. So glad to find it here on steam. I was worried as the gameplay was super fun with the Wii controllers but I have found it even more fun with keyboard and mouse on the PC. Highly recommend this game.

I've tried to find the config file to alter this further, but it's either ridiculously hard to find or non-existent, and to say documentation on this port is poor would be an understatement.\n\nIt's a real shame too, because it looks like this game could be a lot of fun.
