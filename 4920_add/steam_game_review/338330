I've enjoyed it so far, from all the prespectives:\nGameplay: Really smooth and easy, controls aren't hard to learn (I personally play with my logitech controller)\n\nSoundtracks: Nice and well composed, my only problem is that there isn't much variation on them.\n\nCharacters: Any character you choose, is nice and fun to play, there isn't much I can say about this topic.\n\nIn-Game items: There is a variation of items in the game, all fun and enjoyable, especially the shotgun and the fire staff. I like the concepts. I would like to see more as the game advances.\n\nGamemodes: That's where the game gets weak; there are only 2 gamemodes, one is whoever takes the most coins wins, and the other is like capture the flag. I don't like that there are only 2 gamemodes, even thought they both ARE enjoyable, I would like to see more as the game moves forward.\n\nAnyway, for an early access game, it's pretty good. It is worth the money. I give it a 8/10 for now, because of the gamemodes. I really want to see this game grow.
