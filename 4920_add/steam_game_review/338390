I bought this game on a whim as I was in the mood for an RPG and thought it might scratch an itch - and it sucked me in so entirely that I managed to sit through 7 hours of a near-slide show of FPS to continue playing it. Once again, this is the fault of my rig - the game is decently optimized. \n\nThis game sucked me in so entirely that I actually bought the console version so I could continue playing it. \n\nIt's the definition of a hidden gem.\n\nIt's got good characters, an excellent (if a bit unintuitive) combat system and  good quest structure. Its crafting, dialogue and faction systems are all fairly bare-bones, but it doesn't detract from the experience - I was always entertained. It's quite difficult and has a learning curve, but it also has an addictive feeling of progress as you get more powerful over time. Enemies tend to come in varieties that will use varying tactics against you, requiring you to prioritize some targets and change your tactics to suit the landscape. While it has a voiced protagonist with a set back story, you still have a good deal of freedom to develop his personality as you like (think more like Mass Effect than Fall Out 4). All of the environments are gorgeous and feel handcrafted, and each settlement you visit in the game feels fleshed out with its own culture and look. The sound design varies, but is usually good. \n\nThe story, however, is a bit sprawling and occasionally suffers from slow pacing. The first act takes awhile to pick up and resolves itself at a sudden and breakneck pace. Most of its antagonists lack fleshing out - though its easy to forgive the writers, as the antagonists have fairly realistic goals. Enemy placement and lay out is very repetitive and can get boring or frustrating (you WILL get sick of having to fight the same lightning bugs for the seventh time in a row). Bugs occasionally pop up, and some are a little annoying - nothing overtly gamebreaking on my playthrough, however.\n\nOverall, a solid 8.5/10. Definitely recommended to all RPG fans. Pick it up for a little cheaper than $30, however.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504620143, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504620143, "recommendationid": "34757118", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530849", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504798628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3568, "steamid": "76561198150337401", "num_games_owned": 150}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The short version: Get it on Sale. At least 65% off or even 75% off the original price. Really annoying at first, grows on you and will hook you in if you are a fan of Sifi and can get passed it's many flaws. Be aware, you may get sick and tired of it though before the end comes due to repition. I personally liked the story, so I think it's worth a play just for that.  \n\n\nLong version:This probably one of the flawed games I've ever played but once I got passed that, I really enjoyed the game for say the first two thirds of the game. The novelty started wearing off at that point when I noticed I've doing the exact same damn thing since the very beginning of it (it's also the point Yakuza arrived in the mail and was waiting for me). I did get quite alot of milage before I hit that point and the story was interesting enough that I kept playing to see where it was going and wow, it was totally worth, the end was quite powerfull. \n\nCombat:\n- clunky and unreactive at first. Once you get used to it, quite fun. There are 4 trees that you have access to: rogue (knife and gun), defender(shield and club), technomancer (magicish) and warrior (staff). You'll probably be able to fill up a tree and a half by the end without grinding. I personally would avoid the staff (as it sucks) and would only use defender in the beginning as a fallback due it's easy defense but it's gets boring pretty fast. I found the rogue stance (40% upgraded) combined with fully upgraded technomancer tree to be the most fun. Rogue is just the fastest moving stance and honnesly the most interesting. It will test your skill and reflexes the most. It's quite useless at first but if you  upgrade all your weaponry and upgrade 40% of the rogue tree (mainly critical strikes, rolls, damage, I didn't bother with the stab upgrades or poison) it will be quite good considering most of the time your enimies won't be able to touch you. Technomancer tree is a must, complements any fighting style nicely and has some cool spells and effects in it. \n\nThe game is really hard at first and becomes realy easy in the end. \n\nMissions:\nwoven into story with dialog, premiss and a little bit of expose but boil down to kill fetch quest. Complete lack of immagination on Spiders part. I like the fighting, so I didn't mind that until I got tired of it. I also wish I got to kill Alan (like drain all his fucking plasma, -1 karma, the annoying fucking prick. \n\nFlaws:\n- Voice Acting that's hit or miss but mainly miss.\n- Adromeda levels of bad in the character animation: people in the street jerking around, twitching and glitching - 1 year after release!, walking into each other (continuously), twitching all over the place. The main character's eyes are completly dead, to the point that you'll be equipping him with goggles just to avoid seeing them (but helmets seem to dissapear in half the converations so go figure). Characters engage in dialgue with you from the very oposit end of the screen, sometimes with their backs to you. Lazy. \n- Spiders have zero attention to detail, many things feel incomplete or half assed. Here's an example: they strand you in the desert and you have to get out of the valley before the sun rises otherwise it will fry you but once your done with that mission, you can come back to the same location at noon - no problem, no worry. If fact you can run around all over Mars outside without being afraid of the sun. The game would have been so much more fun if it actually made going outside dangerous and forced you to stick to the shadows. \n- Repetive missions\n\n\nMusic:\n- Some it was really good. Some of it made me want to rip my headphones out of the jack.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504802511, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504802940, "recommendationid": "34797997", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521070", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493595025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1767, "steamid": "76561198069819394", "num_games_owned": 146}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty late review, but I just felt I had to give this game what it rightfully deserves.

Let's do this. Sit down for this boys and girls. I had read so many conflicting reviews about this game, but it finally came around on sale for 8 bucks, and I figured, you know what? Let me be the real judge of it. I loved it. Now, let me go ahead and try to elaborate on some of the more common reasons that this game got some of its bad reviews. Graphics wise? It's not bad. Much like Dragon Age Origins or Mass Effect 1. They aren't spectacular, new age graphics, but the animations are great and make you look like a badass in combat. I think the issue so many people have with it is that they compare it too much to Mass Effects incredible storyline, graphics, characters, and content, as well as the flexibility in choices and character development. This game isn't Mass Effect. It's its own universe, with its own character development, lore, depth, and playstyle. Now, me being a causual player, and hearing that the combat system was sooo awful, I played the game on easy to just enjoy the story, and not have to worry about dying all the time and losing interest. I also used my xbox controller for the controls, not they keyboard. I adapted pretty quickly to it, but the display on the screen still shows the keys you'd press on they keyboard, so you'll have to experiment and adapt to learn the controls. Even on easy, there were boss fights and ambushes that still got me killed anyway, so if you're looking for a casual rpg experience, play on easy. You won't feel like you're missing out on a challenge. \n      Content. Trying to keep all the factions together was a bit of a hastle, but nothing that doesn't sink in over time. It's relatively easy to find where your in-game loyalties lie. This game is SUPER sidequest heavy. It was tedious. Going back and forth a lot. There's also a resting mechanic, where you 'have' to rest every in-game 24 hours or so. You really don't, it doesn't impact gameplay or combat (it might in the higher difficulties, idk) but resting otherwise just grants you bonus xp from battles. Leveling up is also very easy. I ended the game at around level 38 or so, which lets you do a lot if you invest in a single skill set and combo style from the start. Character customization is relativley limited, but is limited with really good looking options. It's pretty much guaranteed you'll be satisfied with how your character looks. Also, the games currency can be acquired through extraction of living things. You can get it from animals and farming them for it. Which is also a good way to rack up xp. You can also get it from humans too. However, this is more of a renegade rout, and kills them which has an impact on the way your companions view them. I avoided it for the most part, except when there were moments where it came down to letting a person go, or having them killed. Depends on your morals. Anyway, I didn't go around extracting people, and I didn't run into many problems as far as currency was related in the game. So it's better just not to do it.\n      Now finally, my last reason I have to say why I loved this game was because of the characters and romance option. I mean, duh, it's an rpg, of course the romance has to be good. They are all really great. I personally think that the voice acting was great, and you can tell this is a game where a lot of thought and work was put into it. Occasionally if you find that you built up your charisma to be high early on, you'll find that people will cave in to suggestions pretty easily most of the time. This sometimes takes away from the challenge of opposing viewpoints, but it gets you through the game at least. Back to the romance, I want to state right off the back that this is a great game for people in the LGBT community. The other deciding factor besides the sale, and the only real reason that made my decision to give this game a try was because of how the m/m romace was portrayed. The main character is canonically bisexual, and both romance options have been given a lot of thought, personality, and depth. Of course, the romance is secondary to the game, and the interactions for that branch are limited. But this game's got great representation. By that, I mean the romance is natural, sweet, and doesn't end in soul crushing death or disapointment for the sake of giving the game an edge. Genuine representation. And you get an achievement for it too. And it's called Soulmate, how f***ing cute is that? So yeah, my 2 cents on it. It was rediculous when it was, what, 70 bucks when it first came out? I wouldn't pay that much for it, but then again, I wouldn't pay that much for any game really. If it was 20 bucks, and I bought it, I would have considered it a worthy purchase. I think it is a great game. If you have doubts, wait until it's 75% off and get it. Just abandon any connections between other rpgs you've played, and immerse yourself in the uniqueness of this one, and I think you shouldn't have too many reasons not to enjoy it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505031824, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505032650, "recommendationid": "34856280", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508515", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505013801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 253, "steamid": "76561198059857882", "num_games_owned": 301}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I tried. I sinceraly and honestly tried to like this game. And for what it is worth, I'm going to get my money's worth and play this game, but, That doesn't mean i'm not slamming my head against a desk in frustration over stuff, it does enough right that i think it would merit a playthrough IF, and only IF, Focus and Spiders would understand why their games fail for the exact same reasons, and FUCKING. FIX. THEM.\n\nRant time/ Review.\n\nSpiders, why? Why do you do this to yourselves? You have some strangly good concepts that get thrown around, an asthetic set for your worlds, (The Technomancer, And the other game i think Lords of flame?) That does pretty well on its own, however tropy some of it can get, but you do these things that make me want to like your games, that makes me want to play them, then you just seem to drop the ball in your quality department and just stop caring once the setting is there. \n\nLets explore the quality aspect a bit indepth, because at the end of the night, that's pretty much what this game lacks that stops it from being great, or even good in some respects.\n\nStory-\nYour stories, while most are still fitting in the mold that others have done, are usually in their own world enough to set them apart. So when Technomancer was announced, i was super stoaked because i liked the setting. However i had also played your last two games that had a decent premise with just some god awful dialouge and almost 0 development of characters before making you care about them. This game still, STILL. Does that. The story here has a bit more room to pay around with, as i think this is their (Spiders) largest project, and you start to have those feelings develop sometimes, but seariously, some of the writing makes it sound like i'm supposed to go out of my way to to find areason to like grunt 1 and grunt 2.  I also  had a really hard time getting into  the early story and the first few hours due to just lousy writing. It's like it wasn't even checked for \"Does this conversation even sound like it would work when describing what you are supposed to be doing at this juncture in the story? No? We should fix that.\" none of that, again, story is not bad, its inspired, but suffers from lack of polish to the lore. You are also going to noicte sometimes that the story just doesn't give a fuck about the indepth of itself, and just decides to go full ham to get you to i don't know, jump at some kind of situational action? What i mean by this is in a scenario i will keep vauge to avoid spoilers, someone close to you leaves your station, to probablly do something very dangerous. Almost on a dime, as they warn you NOT to let people gain a secret to your organization, the douche-canoe that most likely got the transfer order for your pal ordered, shows up and is like \"Hey, want to be friends even though i clearly am the ass-clown that got your friend shipped, also by the way whats the krabby patty secret formula? Don't wanna tell, menicing threats to you and your organization of super soldiers that are supposed to be apart of the army we both are, and for some god unknown reason, you guys are slaves to normal joe-shmoes like us? \" That last point about the super soldier bit still gets me and about 5 hours into the game i have yet to understand fully, pass that we are pawns, But why? It's stuff like this that just makes me feel like it was there, and it's barely functional, but were gonna keep moving on. It feels lazy, and does nothing to help the back story, and to the development, leadning into...\n\n-Gameplay\nThis one takes the cake, and i will never not be angry about it.\nIf all else, if the story, if the concept, the setting, the sound, the general lack of rpg elements, all of it, i would be okay with what spiders churns out. \n if this fucking abominiation they have for combat was not around. \n\nSpiders has had 3 games to understand why they're games are functional train wrecks when it comes to fighting your enemies. And for some reason they seem to think that its okay to continue the same trainwreck. The combat feels like a weird arcade- ripoff of an Batman Arkham game. But without the intuivite mechanics, like cool counters that help you deal with crowds, or the simple, yet flow-y way to get around enemies that are diffrent, all of the things that make those game's combat great fall apart here. and you are left with an astounding excersice in frustration. \n\nThere is no counter, it's an \"Interupt\" (Thats a super loose word for what happens. Sometime taking two of these to stop a motion) An attack, and usually, a Skill that is linked to whatever stance you use, for rouge, gun, for staff, area attack, for mace, block. And you get a dodge, now, that sounds all well and good! But one combat session is all it will take for you to see it saying \"Oh! Neat.\" to saying \"Oh. Fucking. Neat.\" It's terrible, unresponsive, and has no right to be reproduced 3 times. Because i'm an advocate of critisim that isn't just \"Lol it sucks\" i'm gonna try to use words to describe where those issues lie. Fighting more then one person EARLY ON. is extremely frustrating, and when you need to really hook people into a game i find that this really can put a hamper on that. As you progress i still feel just as weak, (regardless of upgrades) as i did right off the rip, rocket tag is never fun, and it's frustrating when dodging is shakey at best. Also why are street elements trained better then a super soldier? These guys can feint, parry, and team up together in ways that are not stupid, yet me, a super soldier, and my two friends of millitary back round have a hard time swinging a stick. It's just the little stuff that builds up so fast that you realise how big of a pile it is. Spiders, i want you to read this, RE-THINK. YOUR. FIGHTING. MECHANICS. FOR. YOUR. FUTURE. GAMES. \n\nRPG Elements-\n\nSo, heres the thing. There is a pseudo-RPG element thing going on here, but it makes zero sense. And this also a lack of polish. You get points to assign to skills and \"Stances\" to specailize? Right? Wrong. You have access to all three stances at any time regardless of what you do, and they feel so situational you are kinda silly if you don't use all of them at some point, what this does is one of two things. One, it will make you stat into everything evenly, this wil make you weak and you will not do anything later on in the game from what i can tell already. Two, you will spec into ONE thing. and make everything else irrelevent, which knicks you in the ass for not being able to switch. Yes, going into two of them will make you stronger, and as i progress i have seen that i can get away as long as its \"Attack. dodge, attack, kick, dodge,\" but i feel as if im abusing a system that shouldn't have to be abused. As you level up your stat gains are suprisingly minute, i usually have a hard time deciding what i want to do because the trees all give such nice play styles. Here i'm constantly trying to argue with myself that 10% in the log run is a good investment considering i only get 3-5 in other places for UPGRADES of skills. And when looked at as a whole, i have hard time figuring out what i'm really trying to get too,There is no winning, this is again, another thing that has been around for THREE. GAMES. \n\nThere are a few more issues that this has, such as crafting, items, and money. And the stupid, stupid karma system. But there will never be enough time for me to go into every small detail that is here. This game could be good, it could be great, but the just absurd lack of polish will always kill me. \n\nSpiders.\nYou've had three games, PLEASE take a hard look at your formula.

A lot of times I just could not evade attacks like ranged ones because I was evading a melee attack from another enemy - and all attacks from enemies does massive damage to your hero! \nThe skill and progression are interesting with four different branches and different fighting styles which are great, but technomancer (which is gonna be your main one that can also help the other fighting styles) have skills with a cooldown to cast, which normally makes you miss this spell-attack due to the enemy attacking faster than you!\n\nCompanions in this game helps very poorly in combat! They will probably die faster than you - I buffed them with all wonderful gears I could find but they constantly died no matter what I did (there are in skill tree some stats to help companions health, but it is not useful if a normal enemy can kill you in two attacks).\n\nHowever, the thing that really made me not enjoy this game is the lack of scenarios, monster and a lot of boring quests, there are 3 big cities which you cant explore well. You will always have fetch-quests in specific parts of the city and it starts to become boring. Repeatability of scenarios is one of the things that I really hate in RPG's (I know that this is because of lack of funds but it does not justify it!). All cities are rather similar and lack a true feeling of its own; if you are a player that want to explore different landscapes with interesting quests, this game is really not for you!\n\nI am just going to say that this game is the worst from spiders studio. I really would like to know why they had these poor decisions of making the game and I hope spiders understood what went wrong here and continue producing wonderful games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505483471, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505483618, "recommendationid": "34972302", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503229", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505379070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1182, "steamid": "76561198027626840", "num_games_owned": 51}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE PROGRAMMER TO FOCUS ON GAMEPLAY AND MAPS CONSTRUCTION THAN FOCUSING ON RELATIONSHIP AND CRAFTING.\n\nGameplay: 4\n\nOpen world like my toilet.

I can agree that during heat of combat you tend to forget about other stances and abilities and stick ot 2 button mashing pattern, but its a matter of hour of few to learn and master combat switching in real time.\n\nPeople also complain about clunky controls - i cant agree with that, maybe because im playing with gamepad and analogue movement always feels better than digital movement on keyboard (jez, when all keyboards will get built in ministick to stop using WSAD?), and actually im quite impressed with how they managed to make real-time combat with quick switch of style on limited amount of buttons on gamepad. Usually this type of thing done in tactical pause, even in witcher 1 it was in place, and witcher 3 still has pause on abilities switch, which breaks combat flow, but it does not happen that often in Technomancer, here you only need pause to bind abilities to shortcuts (it wish there was a real time mode for that for pure realism, so that when when you tap and hold its real time, when you double tap and hold - its paused).\n\nAlso im quite impressed with combat AI - enemies dont wait to atack you by one, and while you dealing just with one many other enemies can atack you and you have to be very quick and and careful on avoid atacks of multiply enemies, this makes combat challenging even on easy difficulty! I died at the fist fight with npc who atacked me by group of 5 people and surrounded me, and it was GOOD, i forgot when i saw combat realistic and not retard-frienly like that in rpg games... yes i died on easy difficulty in begining of game, but im happy with that, because game require to use brain in real time and quit fast, and its a good old school kind of thing that missing in modern retard friendly games. I suppose this is another reason modern and not so smart and well skilled players complain about combat and rage quiting game after 20 minutes. Their gaming skills was not trained in hardcore 80th and 90th, they are Modern Warfare age gamers who used to play games where their brains not challenged that much.\n\nI must admit, because most of modern games easier than they used to be in 90th and 1st half of 2000th, my skill lowered without proper training, so its harder for me to play this game, than it would be in 90th for me, but i still enjoy that game treats me with respect like an intelligent and skilled player and not some dumb millenial cry baby.\n\n\nAbout rest of things - im not very familiar with game yet, have not played much, but im so hooked by atmosphere and immersion, and graphics looks pleasant to my eyes, and there some nastalgic 80th and 90th feel in it, soi at the moment i would give game a solid 8 of 10. This could change if ill be disspointed later by story and ending, but right now game feels good for an indie non AAA game with small budget. Im even impressed with their own engine (when most use Unreal or Unity they still dare to make their own engine which looks good).\n\nMy only big complain about this game is its pricing in russia - when game was released it was 1999 rub, which is the price of GTAV there, and now its 1599 which is price of Witcher 3 GOTY (and W3's initial price was 999 here, so i bought it cheaper), and production value and scale of this game way lower than Witcher 3 and GTAV so i think its quite overpriced in my region, and should cost here around 599-799 rub (twice lower than it is now)... if it would not be overpriced like that i would not have to wait 1 year until a good sale with -70%  -  479 rub. But gladly price is now acceptable for while so i bought it with feel that i was ripped of.\n\nWhile i recommend this game (its really good, not perfect, but solid good) it dont recommend to buy it at its full price - its not an AAA game and AAA price tag unjustified. Wait for sale and when you judge the game dont forget that its not an AAA and that for a limited budget comparing to other games they did pretty good job and despite some flaws this game was made with heart and soul (not like some Ass Deffect Dumbromeda cash grab).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504869382, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504869382, "recommendationid": "34812265", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493338", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506365804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2299, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2299, "steamid": "76561198026250470", "num_games_owned": 176}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The Technomancer review - 10 hours in review\n\nI decide it might be fun to write reviews after roughly 10 hours of playing time, as that should be a good enough indication whether or not a game is worth buying. So without further ado: my impression after 10 hours of playing.\n\nFirst off, the atmosphere. The game treats you to a brief introduction of the history of the setting, a colonized Mars, plagued by solar radiation and political/corporate competition for power and resources have led to a downfall of civilization. The result is a science-fiction version of old city-states, in the form of corporations controlling their city and immediate area beyond (mostly where the sun don't shine, quite literally) and competing with other corporations through polticial pressure or outright war. Compare it to Fallout, Mad Max, or even Warhammer 40k, you'll find comparisons, not in the least of the ASC, the scary, secret police that plays an integral role in the game and in design would remind anyone familiar with it of WH40k's Inquisition.\n\nOur protagonist, Zachariah Rogue Mancer, born and bred in the corporation/city of Abundance, finds himself tossed in the middle of this world. Life in Abundance is harsh, hierarchical and based on a clear caste-system, which reflects in the initally \"silly\" last name that the protagonist and other Technomancers carry: he is called Mancer because he is a Technomancer and deemed to belong to that \"Family\". Similarly, he carries the name of Rogue (although Mancer, being of a higher family in the hierarchy, supersedes his previous name of Rogue) to reflect his origins in the slums dominated by \"criminal\" activity. NPCs carry similar names according to their role in society and it is flat out stated that jobs have become hereditary. We are left with a archetypical but well-designed post-apocalyptic feel, where advanced technology is prevalent but existence is ruled by pragmatism and to some extent, harsh Darwinism.\n\nIt is worth comparing this game to the likes of The Witcher or Mass Effect, as they are RPGs similar in nature though very different in setting. In all cases you play a protagonist character that has a name and some predefined history, but make further choices during the story's development as to the exact nature of your persona and his role in the environment. Make no mistake, you are Zachariah Mancer, trained Technomancer, officer in the army. You do not have the freedom to define yourself completely, and some game mechanics, specifically the reputation and karma systems, will react because of this. At the very start of the game, you are clearly told by your instructor that human life is precious and that you should disable opponents without killing them (even though you have the option and it even pays you to kill). I was never bothered by this \"lack of freedom\". I don't need to be a nameless hero. I'm fine playing Zach Mancer in this story, even if that means that the game slaps me with a Karma penalty every time I kill somebody. It's like playing a Renegade Shepard, or a Geralt that demands payment from the poor populance for every monster slain. It is my job.\n\nThe first thing I felt the game dropped the ball a little was in combat gameplay. Combat design is interesting, diverse, and mostly fluid, and it is obvious to see what the developers worked towards. However it also feels a little unpolished and needlessly complicated. As a Technomancer, you have your Technomancer powers at your disposal as well as 3 different combat styles, one which (\"Staff\" or \"Warrior\" style) is clearly linked to Technomancy. The downside is that it seems like the other two styles of Rogue and Guardian (tank) were kinda tacked on for the sake of diversity, though it is worth noting they are viable for gameplay. I went with the obvious choice: fighting with a staff and using my Technomancer powers to buff my staff combat and throwing lightning bolts when desired. \n\nI have to admit I've never felt more like a Jedi Knight, not even in any actual Star Wars game I ever played. Warrior Zach dances around the battlefield like he's one with the Force, dodging both melee blows and gunshots with equal ease. The only criticism I can give about combat it doesn't always feel like I am in control. Granted, I started out on Hard difficulty and I did not expect to not die, but frequently I find I die because the game doesn't seem to really do what I want. Dodging too quickly in succession sends me twice in the same direction even though I pressed the buttons to dodge in another direction. Opponents frequently interrupt me in combat, mostly based on random battle outcomes due to previous actions. In a way such things make sense, I should not expect (due to physics) that I can dodge in a different direction at a 90 degree angle after jumping this way... but then I am also dodging bullets here. My suspension of disblief doesn't really want to suspend its own suspension.\n\nAdd to this that, despite the many buttons to press that are available, combat is a bit repetitive, in that a staff attack will mostly just repeat the same staff strike over and over, and it feels like combat is just a little unpolished. Like it worked pretty well, and they just decided that 80% of the overall idea was good enough. It is just difficult enough to not let me get away with sheer button-bashing (though the semi-randomness of combat lets me do that frequently enough, even on Hard), but not so difficult that I can't bumble through hard difficulty on a first playthrough with some experimentation and a few retries on bossfights.\n\nStorywise, the game seems... a bit iffy to me so far. It feels like there's a lot it's not telling me, but it kinda expects me to make choices based on it anyway. In a game that makes it clear quickly that I am playing Zach Mancer and that killing is bad, it also seems very eager to throw some moral dilemmas at me. The first mission pretty much pits the morality I was taught in the introduction against the needs of the military that protects society, as some quest targets don't complete unless you *choose* to kill. The game does not halt your progress for it, but your questgiver will whine at you for it, and such a situation occurred more frequently. Whilst a completionist/perfectionist like me might balk at this I would nonetheless consider this a good thing: the game does its best to emphasise your choices have consequences, even if the consequence is just a little whiny line in the dialogue. \n\nSimultaneously, I felt a little deprived of information. The game quickly bombarded me with factions, without actually telling me these are factions, and there are factions in Abundance (pun intended). Some dilemmas jumped the gun a bit, gameplaywise. Storywise I can fully understand that these factions have been around, that the issues of society are long-term... but I am the player. I just got here. And I'm supposed to be Zach... so how the hell am I supposed to know if it's a good idea to let the sympathetic rebel leader go or push the arrest? Whilst I'd love to make my own decision about whether Zach is Officer Hardass or Lieutenant Sympathetic, I feel a little miffed when as a consequence the game slaps me with Karma stat penalties for my choice. Technomancer doesn't seem to have figured out whether it wanted to go for the freedom of decision, or a story-driven character development, and with the current hyrbid-ish solution it just feels like it fails at both.\n\nIn conclusion, The Technomancer is an enjoyable game, but feels a bit unpolished. From the somewhat clunky combat, to some a few quest glitches, down to the spelling errors in the subtitles, it seems like it could've used some more attention before release.
