Okay, I made it through and have now progressed another 7 or 8 levels rapidly so that one level was kind of an anomaly. Also, if you land on the landing pad and the game doesn't end that means your time ran out. This is an incredibly fantastic game that is sure to become one of your favorites. Too bad there aren't more levels. \n\nMy original review - This was a great little game until I got to Gauntlet of the Gods which is not very deep in the game but is just about impossible. Then I get to the landing pad in GotG and it doesn't end the level the way it does in every other level. What kind of sadistic game design is that?\n\nMy experience with Terra Lander started off pleasantly. I liked the vector graphics and the way the lander handled with the X box controller. The robotic voice offered hilariously cruel comments. It was a little hard to distinguish the enemy bullets from all the other sparkles in the game but the first few levels were so easy that they bordered on boring and I barely remember them. Then I got to Gauntlet of the Gods and   there are way too many turrets and tight passageways full of richochet bullets coming from every direction. When you get through areas here you're just memorizing patterns of enemy fire. It feels like luck and memorizing when you get through. You're not really learning anything. Its kind of tedious. Then you get to the end, and this is probably after losing 900 ships and being insulted 3000 times, and you land on the landing pad - nothing happens. It doesn't end the level like it does every other time. I wanted to kill a family with a hammer. (See the top paragraph for an explanation)\n\nThis is not retro or a steep learning curve. Its just lazy level design and early access developer sadism and its too bad because Terra Lander has so much potential.

(or else the dev. needs to improve it.) \n\nAs-is (late 2016), it's worth maybe $2 on sale.  But if there was more selection of good level designs it could be worth the full $6 price (and I'd update my review).  Until the level availability is improved just play the demo or get it on sale. \n\nIt starts out good, but then very suddenly gets very annoyingly way too hard, too soon.  not a smooth progression.  the fun just slams to a sudden halt rather than gradually becoming more challenging.  Unfortunately the lack of progression can't be seen in the Demo.  \n\nThe first few levels are quite easy and fast (once you get used to the basic control) and you'll get through them in maybe 2 attempts.  Then at Level 6, \"Gauntlet of the Gods\" it abruptly gets more than 10x harder and you'll burn up an hour repeating the same level over and over.  Then it's time to uninstall because the repetition of getting farther through it inch by inch on each replay is too grindy, and be glad you only spent $2 for a 6 level game. \n\nThere should be a gradual increase in interesting challenges of fuel management, navigation, and shooting. \n\nIt's basically a remake of some of the earliest oldschool moon landers, but with shooting added, and other embellishments, which does make it more interesting & fun. \n\nThe voice is simply annoying and repetitive, not actually amusing.  But you can turn the volume way down.  The music works well with it. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1481647189, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1481647189, "recommendationid": "28346101", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486750991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 54, "steamid": "76561198025825159", "num_games_owned": 198}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Everything about this game is wrong, even the price.
