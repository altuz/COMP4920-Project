In this game everyone wants you dead (Barbarians, carthaginians, Gauls etc.). It's very hard to deal with enemies from every direction unless you're hardcore.\n-a little more historical would be nice: where's the roman civil war? where's Hannibal?\n\nYou might be asking yourself, why I'm suggesting this game if there are more cons than pros? Although flawed, this game is still pretty fun:)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487712665, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1487785372, "recommendationid": "30087541", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
