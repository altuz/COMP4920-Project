Poor UI. Dodgy controls. Lack of options.\n\nReview: Very tablety feeling. Not a lot of depth in the mechanics. You have your trade hubs and quest hubs floating in empty space with simulated space traffic going on automated scripts. You are more or less free to go from hotspot to hotspot taking on elimination quests and escort mission quests to grind rewards to upgrade and do it all over again. Setting seems to be some kind of corporatist sci fi future where people freelance for the man. Not terribly gripping. The little portraits talking to you in the corner were a nice touch but they bothered you a lot for no reason and all these people act like you know them but, you dont, and I am not sure why I should care. Control is mostly just left clicking on stuff and pausing with spacebar. I tried shooting at stuff but no button was responding. Maybe I had to buy a gun first but I was pretty underwhelmed by what i was experiencing and could not find the strenght of will to fight with this game to figure out how to reach any somewhat pleasant gameplay. Needless to say dodging fire by clicking on space is strange and clumsy. The game has a pretty extensive star map connecting sectors together through worhomles. The sectors often dont contain solar systems in them. The game could had been salvagable by being very atmostpheric or having someting hooking you plot wise right away but this game is not that either. Anyways all in all if you are out of options I guess this might be servicable, perhaps, if you can deal with the controls and have a lot of patience and time on your hands. But for anyone who has a fleshed out Steam Library the time investment is probably not going to reward you with a valuable enough experience to justify going through the hassle.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498292140, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505086741, "recommendationid": "32716571", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 13}}
