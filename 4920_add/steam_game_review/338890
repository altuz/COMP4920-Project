The challenge here makes me remember the games when I was a kid in the 80's! I just finished Harold (all tracks but not all in 1st place and I need 4 more secret passages to discover), and you need to train a lot, remember the level design...like old game! To deserve each of your victory, you need to be a real good player. But when you get it you feel that you're the King of the world! ( untilyou watch the leaderboard and you understand that you can improve much more cause some guys here have 15 second less than your own record! How possible is that! I wanna see a video of that race!) Nevertheless you can finish the game without beeing first at all race, so if you just wanna enjoy the game even if your are not an hardcore gamer, that's possible, you just need to practice the race a bit (thanks for the practice mode -first time that I really need it as much)! The graphics as you can see are awesome (espescially for someone who like anime or cartoon), the music is beautiful and interact with your way of playing (when you get a better rank the choir cheers you up).

While the experience was enjoyable, those little frustrations will wear on the player, but not enough to not have fun messing with other racers, and the concept in a whole. Those who like repeating to shave seconds off their time and improving themselves will most likely like Harold. I personally would wait for the game to drop down in price, but it is a game worth playing. \n\nPros:\n-Interesting Gameplay design, and engaging. \n-Varied paths in tracks, and interactive items sometimes are good not to use, which makes you question things.\n-Background story is actually interesting. Like the idea of being a guardian angle.\n-Controls are spot on.\n-Smart use of practice mode to help the player in the races.\n-Races are challenging yet fun.\n\nCons:\n-No keyboard support: this is only controller gameplay. And no way to rebind (I hate using LB AND RB to hit the bumpers). Definitely shows its console roots. \n-Challenge mode just doesn't change enough to make it feel different from the regular race.\n-Lack of retry button on practice. This means if you screw up, you HAVE to finish the portion in order to retry, which is really really annoying. Some obstacles just slow you down, and with trying to go for speed, that's really freaking annoying.\n-Sometimes, messing with other racers or jumping into a pit seems to be a benefit. While use lose a \"puff\", the spawn time really makes it so that sometimes it actually helps in terms of time to race. Which is annoying.\n-Early on, protagonist is hard to relate to, in fact, he seems like the asshole in question. On the other hand, they are setting up for a character building moment down the road, so only slight against it.\n-No sound sliders.
