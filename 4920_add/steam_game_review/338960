Rescue Team is a tad repetitive and misses some convenience features, but the fun level design makes up for some of the shortcomings.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nRescue Team is a typical time/resource manager with the usual mechanics: use 2-3 workers to collect resources, and then spend them on various level goals\u2014mainly road work and reconstruction, expanded with a little rescue and firefighting to match the title.\nAn interesting bit to note is that the game is so bent on standard mechanics that even the resources follow the old food/wood/gold trio. There is something funny in repairing a highway with timber or collecting gold bullions as a rent from an apartment.\n\nAlthough most casual games nowadays try to include some kind of a story, Rescue Team 1 was made in an era where this was not prevalent, so do not expect any plot. Expect some nice time management levels instead, where each stage acts as simple sequence puzzles: find the correct order of collecting the resources, so you can advance further into the level. Since the workers move fast and production buildings can keep up with the spending, the game has a great pace that easily can result in a \u201cjust one more stage\u201d situation\u2014which, thanks to the 60 levels, may last for a while.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493402878, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493402878, "recommendationid": "31421865", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513659", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494904412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 82, "steamid": "76561197994971393", "num_games_owned": 1282}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A cute \"worker circuit\" mechanic, very similar to the 12 Labors of Hercules series.
