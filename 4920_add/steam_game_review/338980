There are six in this particular series at the moment done by alternating enterprises.\n\nThis is a 'Time Management' game meaning it\u2019s a game that tests you in your ability to successfully plan when exercising conscious control over the amount of time spent on specific activities to reach certain goals. This is all laid out on the framework of a story where you become stranded on a fictitious island parroted with some symbols and beliefs to that of Easter Island which is all made apparent thanks to Moai (great big head monoliths). The natives thinking that you are a gift from above promise to help you on your way again as long as you help them first and return the island back to its former glory. Unfortunately this means you are getting the raw end of the deal as you endeavour to gather, construct and defend the island against hordes of annoying cartoon ghosts, an active volcano, frost bite sickness and several notorious tribes and bandits.\n\nThe first ten levels are nicely presented as a learning curve which have a generous amount of time allocated to them that it would probably be possible to blindfold yourself and randomly click away at the screen and you would still pass all 10 levels with 3 stars. However after this the difficulty really ramps up and even with successful planning your heart pulse will raise and you will be forced to wipe sweat from your brow if you intend to continue to try and master a 3 star rating for all 64 levels.\n\nThe progression of the story is all nicely illustrated in story book animation while a well done narration helps in maintaining the mood and the need to progress. Several artwork backdrops and game concepts contain an odd nod and wink here and there to Easter Island folklore, however I must admit some liberties have been taken there as well (ghosts/moai).\n\nIn a game like this a sense of completion and achievement is made when one nuts out a perfect strategy against pressing time management. The game successfully tests the gamer in whole range of ways and never did the 64 levels feel like I was doing the same thing over and over. Neither did it ever feel like one strategy fits all. As each level adapted, my game play and techniques had to adapt too.\n\nMy biggest surprise is this, for the first in the series alawar and toyman did a number of things correct in their time management game which other companies have definitely failed to implement or master. Some of which are...\n\n* When each level begins you have the ability of running your cursor over each object on the map and see the different requirements needed, this allows the player to really think about a method of execution before beginning. As soon as you click the first item on the map though, the game is on.\n\n* While time and resource requirements are very challenging at times they were never impossible. This helped maintain the games reputation for being a casual enjoyable game. Many companies fail to take into account the transition of app design and PC. Distances needed to travel on a large pc screen with mouse and pad can be quite significant in comparison to touchscreen which many companies fail to take into account.\n\n* The versatility of strategy tested here was quite praiseworthy. There were a few levels which required you thanks to limited land resources to even 'destroy' current resources when you had enough and construct different resources so that you can reach all stated goals. Many time management games I have played have NEVER tested this concept and often a one tactic fits all. \n\nThere are many things to enjoy with this (2013) gem which kept me entertained for well over a week. Definitely worthy of a gander if it ever goes on sale.\n\nBelow is a sample of someone else playing level 9 it should be enough of a sample for you to work out if this is a game for you.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/n0hIClDb1OU\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504140597, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504140597, "recommendationid": "34622331", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 42, "total_reviews": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 12}}
