I don\u2019t even know where to begin.  I\u2019m not going to hate the graphics as they help set the more laid back and casual tone of the game but I will call out the horrible animations.  Look at a game like Strider, which is what it feels like this game wants to be to an extent, when you push the attack button there\u2019s this really cool sound and the enemies get a little bit of hit sun and there\u2019s a little light that pops on them to signal you hit them.  It\u2019s satisfying.  In this game the character kinda sloppily waves his sword around and the enemy just kind of dies after a while.  Oh and ninja stars and AK47 bullets have the same graphic!  And I feel there\u2019s a lot of questionable design decisions like that in this game.\nLike why can I only double jump at certain times?  Why is it I can only jump slightly upwards or be committed to a record attempt at the horizontal long jump?  Why can I push up wanting to go upwards on a wall and get hurled across the screen.  Here\u2019s a good one, why is it I can be walking along the ground just fine but I go beyond one girder and all of a sudden the floor instakills me?  For real that\u2019s a design choice in the game.  There\u2019s no indication either that floor past a piece of scenery, that looks exactly like the floor before and after it, will instantly kill you.  These are very bad examples of game design.  The game does very little to teach you anything.  The most it does is give you like a ghost you to run ahead and show you how you\u2019re supposed to make various jumps.  As mentioned earlier though, the game is very finicky about double jumps wall jumps.  Thank god it gives you like 10 hearts that take 4 hits a heart.  You\u2019d never survive more than the first half of the level that way.  See you\u2019ll first try to kill enemies, realize how boring that is, then you\u2019ll try to jump over them to skip them.  When you do that you\u2019ll discover all you\u2019re going to do is bounce on their heads like a non-performing Mario.  Huh, there\u2019s actually nothing I can think to say positive about the game other than the music is very fitting.\nFolks I couldn\u2019t play this game more than 20 minutes.  When I say this game is bad believe me this game is bad.  Don\u2019t give your money up for this schlock.  Spend the extra 10$ and get Strider.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419904177, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1419904177, "recommendationid": "13702993", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542493", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1419768358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561198094252569", "num_games_owned": 221}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 87, "comment_count": "2", "review": "What went wrong with this?

You can't get anything much better from unreal engine. I'm Ukrainian myself, and I can tell you, this game is very accurate representation of how it is to live in Ukraine.

Music sounds asian, but that's ok cuz most Ukrainians are weebs, so that's what you would usually hear outside. Character are memorable and relatable. Story is deep and touching. Gameplay wise, you have to dodge the bullets, rockets and stuff like that, just like in real life, you know. You also have to explode various Russian heavy weaponary, just like in real life, you know. This game also requires you to be good at navigating building destroyed by explosions, you know, just like in real life. You can also play with your friends, and feel despair as all your friends around you die.
