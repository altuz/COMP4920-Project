Graphics aren't everything but even the response time after a mouse click is nearly a full second at times.  The concept is sound but Cogs was released in 2009 and it looks and runs MUCH better than Plith.  I love games like this but short of them completly rebuilding this game from the ground up I can't imagine it getting to a level of polish that would warrant charging for it.
