The game also has a story line, that is enjoyable to do as well. The main game is basically 100 levels and each level has a different board to play on. Instead of endless just matching pieces though, you are given goals to achieve to pass each level which keeps the game interesting as you go along. So checking your goals before you start is the best way to get going. What also makes the game more tactical in thinking is you can also turn the board to the left or right in 90 degree increments. There are four game tools that can be used as soon as they are \"filled\" up by matching certain pieces as you move along. One tool breaks one whole row or column that the tool is used in, one breaks a whole row and column. Making sure you know what fills each tool up can make or break you getting your board done to move on to the next level.\n\nThe story line consists of building up a village, each building you complete gives you extra moves to use when you want to. The games graphics are very beautiful and makes the game very relaxing to play. The graphics alone were a big reason I purchased the game. Getting all the achievements is not hard at all, so making 100% achievements is very do-able.

There are 3 different ways to play:  Swap, Chain, or Pop.  Swap is the traditional match 3, as in Bejeweled, where you click on a tile, then click on a second tile to swap them and make a match.  Chain is like in Tidalis, where you use the mouse to create a path of the same type of tile and then clear them.  Pop is similar to Season Match, click on groups of 3 or more matching tiles to clear them.  Personally I prefer Swap.\n\nThere is also 2 different modes.  Challenge mode gives you a set number of moves to finish the level.  Casual gives you no limit.   \n\nThe graphics are decent.  Nice backgrounds of Japanese scenery--both day and nighttime scenes.  Let's face it, you're probably not playing this game for the cutting edge graphics, so what do you expect?!\n\nThe background music get boring after awhile.  But again, are you really playing a puzzle game for great sound?  Sure it would be nice but it's not essential.\n\nThe story is bare bones, but they keep it interesting by having you purchase buildings for your village.  The buildings do not do anything, but it makes it seem like you are making progress rather than just playing for no reason.\n\nI highly recommend this for match 3 lovers.

I picture a design meeting where they asked everyone to call out the first thing that came to mind when hearing the word \"Japan\".\n\n  \"Sushi!\"  yelled Bob from accounting.  \"Samurai!\" called out Jim, the janitor.  \"Good, good, keep em coming.\" said Jane, as she jotted down the suggestions.  \"Geisha!\"  \"Ninja stars!\"  \"Rice balls!\"  Excitement filled the room as more and more wonderful ideas were called out.  Suddenly Albert the night watchman called out \"Happy Ending!\"  The room got quiet for a minute, then everyone started to cheer.  \"We're totally putting that in there, or my name isn't Jane Doe!\" said Jane Doe.\n\n   So yeah, it's about rather blandly generic, or possibly generically bland as you can get.  This game accurately depicts Japanese culture about as well as Taco Bell depicts Mexican cuisine.  Now, I must say that I'm a regular American, and I really don't care how they depict anybody, except maybe Americans.  Point is, the whole \"Build an ancient Japanese village \" and \"Exciting adventure\" thing isn't all that thrilling.\n\n     So how about the gameplay then?  Well, the next point in the description is \"Rotate the board make the best matches.\"  At first rotating the board sounds pretty cool, until you realize that you can just keep rotating the board until you win, with the occasional match made by you to free up some space.  There are also your typical match-3 game powerups, charged by destroying gems.  Nothing revolutionary there, except maybe the bug that prevents you from clearing certain tiles.  Yes, I know they said they fixed it, and yes, it is still happening.\n\n   If you're a match-3 player, there are certainly other games out there better than this.  Heck, HuniePop is a far better match-3 game, albeit one attached to a whole other, less savory H game, which is not an inherently bad thing, but not for everyone.  Tales of the Orient is, despite the lovely description, rather bland.
