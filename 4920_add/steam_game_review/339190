In this game it's almost 'touchable' - everything is in ruin, life is worth nothing, brute force is a main way deal with many things. So background is more than ok, what about game itself? It is a rather simple point and click adventure game, with nothing really special in terms of gameplay.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Climax, story\n    [*]Very nice art\n    [*]Pretty straightforward, good title for starters\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Almost no puzzles, 95% of time is item hunting/combining etc.\n    [*]You get achievements for doing silly/stupid things, so it;s very easy to miss many of them. Not good for completionists, walkthrough is almost essential in this case\n    [*]This is part one of the story, no info about second one up till now\n[/list]\n\nOcerall I enjoyed DS very much, as said before, background and story is great.
