It\u2019s comparable with a Zelda game but not so expansive as those games. The game contains fight and puzzle sequences and quest where you must find objects. So, it\u2019s a traditional RPG.\n\nThe colourful graphics, sound effects and music are good.

I really wanted it to. But its BORING AF. \nThe enemies are so easy to kill, the fight mechanic is slow and...JUST, DULL... \n\nEvery area is just so minimalistic and empty, and the MOMENT you try to speed up your own momentum in order to compensate for how TORTUROUSLY slow the game is, they GIVE YOU A SWEET TASTY YUMMY LITTLE  MIDDLE FINGER, BY HAVING AT LEAST 1 SECOND PASS BETWEEN THE ENEMY DYING, AND ITS ITEM TO DROP, FORCING YOU TO EITHER COME BACK TO THE CORPSE, OR WAITING THERE LIKE AN IDIOT, UNTIL YOUR SHREITY COIN DROPS.\n\nAND DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE ITEMS. YOURE MISSING HEALTH? THE NEXT BUSH/ENEMY YOU SWING AT WILL DROP NOTHING BUT HEALTH. MISSING MANA? HERE, LET US PRIOROTIZE IT. BOMBS? ARROW?
