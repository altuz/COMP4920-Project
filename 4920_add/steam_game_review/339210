I had a multistory fire raging out of control and yet mrs brown is wandering under it on her way to play bingo. Where were the cops to put down road blocks, tape off scenes of accidents etc?. \n\nI remember playing a similar game recently in which you had to control police too as well as engineers. I was hoping this game would include these aspects too at the least as they don't have at present. \n\nDoubt I will bother to play this game again without a little more depth. Good for a few hours if youre hardcore, but does need a little bit more gameplay and a mission generator with more incidents.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506443436, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506443436, "recommendationid": "35225266", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498511296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 397, "steamid": "76561198061253036", "num_games_owned": 241}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "review": "A recycled version of \"Rescue: Everyday Heroes\".
