It holds up pretty well despite the game's age. I also love the concept of if you're survivor dies then you'll play as another human survivor and you can collect your equipment from that survivor's dead body. Your main protagnist or female protagonist has to survive the zombified land of London, England. You do get help from a mysterious man known as \"The Prepper\" but he will constantly tell you how to survive, take care of yourself, which weapon you found, and what resources you should have etc. This game does have a little story to it and you get to meet some other survivors in this game. You can also upgrade your weapons, store your equipment, use a computer monitor to find items or things you missed in certain locations in the game, and also you can fast travel to different sections of the zombified London, England. All in all this is a pretty great zombie survival horror game and even better when you buy this game at a heavy discount. I highly recommend this game! :D", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500096598, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500096598, "recommendationid": "33551932", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509239", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500823297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 85, "steamid": "76561198057359786", "num_games_owned": 329}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "While primative, and graphics are a bit dated, it is a solid zombie survival game.  pace is as slow as you want with amble chances to save if you wish.

I really enjoy the \"new survivor\" mechanism (should you opt out of permadeath)- it really adds a sense of both despair and continuity to things. While parts of it were old hat and nothing new (and oh man, those QTE's...) it is a good enough entry to the zombie survival horror genre that it helps stave off the rising tide of the absolute BOLLOCKS zombie games that are a nightmare on STEAM today.
