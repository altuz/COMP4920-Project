I hope the developer decides to roll back to the original version of the game from 2015, because the game which I just re-installed and played was a complete different game.  \n\nIt started off well enough, I saw a camp, a much better start than the original game which saw you awakening in a hospital.  I made my way outside and began talking to a few NPC's..  Ok gooe enough, nothing to see here..\n\nJim Bob, or Billy Bob, or whatever the heck his name was instructed me to take up arms as infected were coming to play.\n\nI went into the gun shack and!!!!  Controls didn't work..  Alarm bell goes off...  gun shoots ring out..  Still nothing, I can see my gun sitting there, taunting me,  yet it won't pick up.\n\nAfter a 20 seconds about 20 infected decided to invade the Gun Shack... WTF happened to the Zombie models from the 2015 game, these ones were stretch out and odd looking.  Fake, unrealistic.. The only one that looked even slightly decent resembled Slenderman I guess.   I can't imagine which part of the development team decided altering the game in such a way was a good idea..\n\nThis has to be one of the single worst games I've ever played, the SS's on the storepage were taken from the 2015 version of the game, which are no longer valid,  the newest version of this game is a complete and and utter flaming turd.  This game which had so much potential at one time is totallly.....  \"In the words of Gordan Ramsey, the developers are out of control\"  They took the few positives and removed them, stamped on them, set them on fire, and continued to add gasoline just to ensure no resembelence to a good game existed.\n\nI'd suggest you never buy this game, in fact if you feel like buying this game, poke out your eyes with an ice pick, or better yet, gather up all your worldly possessions and burn them.  In fact just burn yourself. you'll have more fun waiting for your skin to char and crisp then you'd ever have playing this piece of crap.\n\nUgg I played the updated game for a few minutes and needed a shower, I now know how an inmate feels after being passed around for a few cigerettes..  \n\n[h1] PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS GAME, TRUST ME, BURN IT, KILL THE ABOMINATION[/H1]\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459794312, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1459794312, "recommendationid": "22240442", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527513", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423962147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 12, "steamid": "76561198104089191", "num_games_owned": 243}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Revamped Review.\nIts dead.

Heck the diologe menu when talking to NPC's is the same as Fallout 3.\n\n- The game plays great. Gameplay is very solid and each item is diffrent.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Poor optimization. The game will run great on full settings in some areas but just goes from 60 to 8 in others, now I can play higher quality games then this on full settings and get a better framerate.\n\n- Zombies kill you in 1 to 2 hits. For the player it takes 7-8 hits to kill a zombie but you die in two.
