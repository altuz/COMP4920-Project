It was a baby moba, so its hard to comment on how it would have grown, but its start, its seeds, were pure gold. Interesting champions crafted with all of the knowledge and reflection of S2's previous ventures, a brilliant reimagining of the map that really did feel like it was constantly creating new and exciting interactions, and a brilliant items system that simultaneously outshined the out of match persistance of Lol's masteries, and the in game progression of Dota's archaic three stat system.\n\nBut S2 walked away. Out of nowhere it seems. One weekend, long ago, they made all of the champions, and all of the cosmetics free to everyone. They sliced their revenue and walked out. I honestly don't know why the game is still:\n1. running, as they certainly cant be covering their server costs\n2. listed on steam, because the beautiful game is now dead. \n\nTaps for Strife, the second great MOBA by S2 that will never get the praise it deserves. \n\nAlso fucking shame on you S2. Stop letting your children die. Games aren't easy, they're risky, and they're not always friednly, but you guys put months and months into the preproduction, and development of this game. You poured your minds into inventing brilliant systems, and captured the hearts of an immensely loyal player base. And then you fucking walked away, without even a comment as to why. You used to be one of my favoirte companies. I've looked up to you guys since Savage 2, and now that I'm entering the industry myself I have enough perspective to be empathetic yes, but more so dissapointed that the heroes of my adolesence have killed so many brilliant games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485461611, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485461611, "recommendationid": "29508421", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548949", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471051151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 816, "steamid": "76561198193261959", "num_games_owned": 20}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 29, "comment_count": 0, "review": "lovely moba but no one plays it anymore\ndevelopers completely gave up on it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487550272, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487550272, "recommendationid": "30047488", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545745", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487991162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1104, "steamid": "76561198071546483", "num_games_owned": 40}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I played this game when it came out for the first time and after a long time I decided to download it again because I really liked it's design and the idea behind it. \nTo make it short...\n\nPro\n+Interesting character designs\n+Heroes feel relatively balanced\n+Decent amount of skins and color variations\n+Free stuff for playing the game\n\nCon\n-Some pets are too good/weak\n-Dc or rage quit \n-No more developement\n \nI can definately recommend playing Strife even tho S2 abandoned it!

(Hate to kill them lol)\n+ There is a lot of attention to detail in craftmanship reflected throughout gameplay.\n+ It's not to hard or not too easy to play in terms of enjoyability and challenge\n\nCons:\n- While I can see the player base is not very large atm, you will have Bots join your team against the AI when you do Co-Op against AI.
