Is this a typical game for a free mini game website. Does this fit on steam? uuhm i would say no. \nLets tell where its all about; its a puzzle on time when you need to build the castle, on the way they already showed. It's on time but also so much going on, like people who are attacking your castle and rain what blocks u to build.  You need to focus on so many things!\nI dont have the feeling that i spent my money well. I payed to much if u ask me. I prefer this game on a free website and not on steam, not even an achievment. But you can earn prices and more levels so yeah... nice try but no..\n\nUPDATE 7 januari 2015 23:05: \nFor now it's too simple for a steam game, i hope they update in the future with more features so its more a complicated game with more possibilities so it's more worth it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420640527, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1420668555, "recommendationid": "13879515", "language": "english", "votes_down": 96, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490237", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1422673542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561197972586459", "num_games_owned": 217}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Saw it on sale for cheap so not too much of a loss.\n\nGrabbing/holding parts doesn't consistantly work (60-70% fine), game decided at three different points to resize from \"Fullscreen\" to \"Original\" - whatever damn resolution original is...", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1425513741, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422674087, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422674087, "recommendationid": "14252136", "developer_response": "Thank you for your review.
