There are also blind spots that become difficult to feed through, even if when able to see through the walls, that you have to angle the camera to find an opening or possible route, and have to memorize it but at a specific angle.\n\nIt was very frustrating to control the snake head in order to solve puzzles, than it was on the puzzles itself.\n\nI sadly can't recommend this game due to the controls and camera frustration.\n\n-----\n\nCheck out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BPUGL]BluePaw's Underrated Games List[/url]\nJoin and/or follow if you wish.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498977921, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499058674, "recommendationid": "33117902", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504937", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
