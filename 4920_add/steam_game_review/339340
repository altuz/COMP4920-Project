The big difference here is allowing the player to control two characters which works as a double edge sword.  While it does allow for some well crafted puzzles having the extra pair of hands unfortunately cuts a lot of tension from the game. This is also hampered by the fact that  Resident Evil 0 ensures there is  constantly enough ammo  for both characters,  removing  the dilemma of having to choose your fights wisely. Though a far cry from the best, Resident Evil 0 is by no means the worst . Definitely worth playing if  you're a fan of the old style, but be sure to have some reservations. \n\n6.5/10\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506934667, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506934667, "recommendationid": "35409330", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 416, "total_reviews": 482, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 66}}
