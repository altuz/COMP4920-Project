Upon starting, it seemed to be just a big wall of uniteresting text. However, once I went beyond it, I realized I had discovered a gem of a game. In my first game I created a robot similar to that of a synth, started an international corporation, sold robots to the American military to fight in a war, became a war hero, then started a rebellion in Alaska, only to die fighting rather than fleeing. The next game I created a robot nearly identical to that of a child, worked with my friend in a robot toy business, converted my child robots into military robots, developed extremely realistic human looking soldiers, and made companion bots that were nearly indistinguishable from humans, marrying one in the process and starting a family with her raising a human child and my original robot child. The game is written like a sort of fanfiction which really isn't a problem in my opinion. \n\nIt tells like a story and I love it. I have played through this game about 4-5 times trying to min-max my decisions to achieve the most success and get different endings. After staying up an extra several hours to play this rather than sleep I stayed up longer just to plan out how I can get new endings and better scenarios. I highly recommend this game and I hope that the other games like this are just as good, but I doubt they are as quality as this lovely game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506227293, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506227293, "recommendationid": "35170634", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1288, "total_reviews": 1322, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_negative": 34}}
