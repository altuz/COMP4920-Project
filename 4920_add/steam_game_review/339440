I highly recommend it.\n\nHowever there are some suggestions and tips how this game could get better. (Since its still early access and I just had some ideas, maybe theyre stupid, but hey you can just ignore them.)\n\nIdeas: \n\n1. I haven't completed the campain yet but I already wish there would be more levels. Maybe some more stages and/or Bosslevels after a Chapter.\n\n2. More characters. I dont now if you have to unlock some first but it would be cool if there were more options depending how you think you could survive best.\n\n3. A co - op mode would be very nice. Dont now if local is needed, but online has to be a thing.\n\nBugs?:\n\n1. Dont know if that is intented but some monsters just clip through the environment. And I checked, no, the obstacles were completly intact.\n\n2. When an enemie ( for example a dog) stands right infront of me, the bullets spawn behind him and do no damage, which is annoying when you are not fast enough to back off.\n\n3. Balance: The diffuculty is nice and balanced. The only thing bothering me are the special enemies with special guns, which make so much damage if you dont look out. Most of them are big enought to see, but some look very similar to the \"normal\" guys and get overlooked so easy. And the red bar doesnt realy help. Maybe make the similar looking ones just bigger or shinier? Would be very helpfull.
