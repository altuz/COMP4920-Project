I love the Pixel-styled artwork as well as the numerous computer-related humor and gaming references throughout. The music is awesome, too! \n\nSome of the level progression can be quite difficult, but it's not like they throw you at a wall from the beginning. The level design teaches you as you move forward, both giving you enough to learn how things work, and still able to rack your head around some obstacles. Their extra Challenge Rooms are definitely a control-breaker.\n\nI don't think it shows much of it in the trailer video, but later on in the game it isn't just jumping on platforms anymore. There is a lot of timing and thinking involved to move on ahead. They really introduced some cool concepts with the teleporting ability, and I found myself enjoying the different parts.\n\nI wish they integrated the story a bit better. You gain background story by collecting the Memory in the game, but it's usually just flavortext inside the menu. You can essentially progress through the game without ever reading any substantial storyline. NOTE: I've only played the beginning area, so that might change later on. But if you DO read it, it reveals quite a bit of history and story in the game that does open it up to more than just jumping around on platforms.\n\nI don't play a lot of platforming games, but this is definitely a fun one. A bit difficult at times, but definitely satisfying. \n\n8/10, I would recommend to any platform loving gamers out there.\n\nAnd if you're still not sure, check out my First Look video below! I talk about the game concepts and show some gameplay.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z8Icz2Gisl8", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428208225, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428352552, "recommendationid": "15213407", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510178", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441380812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1780, "steamid": "76561198046671183", "num_games_owned": 100}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Here is my first review of a game on steam, english isn't my mother tongue. Sorry for the mistakes, I'll maybe update it later to give a french version too.\n\nI've played the game without controler, only with my keyboard. Done this review after finishing the game 100% except deathrun.\n\n[h1]PROS :[/h1]\n\nA Pixel Story is probably one of the best games i've played so far. I had it on my wishlist for two or three months and I finally decided to buy it as I was looking for an hard 2D plateformer. The game in itself isn't super hard to finish (I mean, in a first time); even if there are some passages where you can find a bit more of difficulty. The story is hilarious (lot of references) and the atmosphere was wonderful. As a fan of the genre, I've found exactly the same feeling than when I played Crash Bandicoot on my PS1 when I was child (atmospherically speaking).\nBut, if you want to finish it to 100%, this game is really hard. In each location, there are two or three \"challenge rooms\" where you have to finish it without dying and give a real challenge (that's why they are called \"challenge rooms\", right?).\nEach challenge room finished will give you a \"piece of memory\" that you need to complete the game, and ... it has been a hard time to complete all of these, my fingers are still bleeding .. but I had a great time.\n\n[h1]CONS :[/h1]\n\nIf you are not a fan of die-and-retry 2D plateformers, you'll maybe like this game, but you won't like completing it to 100%. \nNot a lot to say ... If I want to be the devil's advocate I would say that a few things are badly indicated but you can totally find it by yourself, taking a bit more time to do it.\n\n[h1] SUMMARY :[/h1]\n\nTotally worth the money and I feel a bit sad that this game hasn't more players, he totally deserves it..

You awaken to find a helpful robot named Search who informs you that you are the \"Chosen One\". You come to find out that this means you will be essentially repairing the system.  You do this, following a few tutorial puzzles, with the help of a hat that allows you to save your position and thus transport back instantaneously when needed.\n\nThe puzzle difficulties ramp up quickly normally showing themselves to be more infuriating due to precise timing  requirements and less about how much they boggle the mind.  You will me made to do a minimum number of puzzles to acquire colored gems called \"Memory\" in order to advance in the story. In addition, more challenging puzzles are available by opening doors with the coins you pick up along the way.\n\nAs I am writing this review I am, I believe, still very early in the game and enjoying it thoroughly. The puzzles keep me on edge and though the story is fairly cliche, it is keeping me interested enough to continue speculation of whats to come.\n\nLike puzzle games?
