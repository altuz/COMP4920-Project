I see-sawed from one side of the stat spectrum to the other, did questionable things for money and played the dating field with zero noticeable consequences throughout the story. All the choices could be made to feel more important simply by removing some of the ones available to you based on your current stats.\n\nStory wise the game has promise, but there was a definite feel of it being rushed towards the end, and the ending itself was a bit of a letdown. \n\nIt's possible that if I were to replay the game that I might see more impact on some of the other choices available, but after the experience had on my first playthrough I just don't feel compelled to return to Psy High anytime soon.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497685761, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497898503, "recommendationid": "32496981", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502660", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 88, "total_reviews": 107, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 19}}
