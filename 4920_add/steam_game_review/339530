(This may still be uploading)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/W-dphbFbPzU\n\nFactions looks great visually. The two maps available I think are wonderful looking. The character models are unique. The abilities that the factions have look good as well.\n\nNow as far as what to expect. I cannot stress enough how much you need to read and research your games before purchasing them. \nPlease take a minute and actually read the dev's comments in the \"Early Access Game\" section. That is where you will decide if this is for you.\n\nI for one am excited to see this game grow. So for now, I'm going to recommend picking this game up with a caveat -  [b] [u]Don't buy this game if you're expecting a polished finished game filled with content at this moment.[/b] [/u]\n\nConsider that this game will continue to grow. However, if you're expecting a complete product then early access and this game are not for you. \n\n\nFor more Early Access and Indie reviews please check out my website - www.earlyaccesspodcast.com and my youtube https://www.youtube.com/c/earlyaccesspodcast", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427143649, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1427144601, "recommendationid": "15025198", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494052", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452738614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 128, "steamid": "76561198101867598", "num_games_owned": 1305}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I have watched and waited and wanted OoM to turn into something great since the first Kickstarter had been attempted. The developers clearly are very passionate about their baby and it shows. However, this has been a very difficult development cycle that has seemed to go on and on without anything nice, new or big to show for it. Early access? Yes and believe me you should take that into account when you read this review, but every change and step seems to go backwards, not forwards. Once OoM finally released on Steam in EA, there was not much to do, but the world was beautiful to look at. Slowly there were some things added but clearly it was going to be a slow process. However we now see another big change, to the Big World. Are visuals everything? No, of course not, but it has to be said, the beauty of the world really no longer exists. And sadly, there still is not much of anything to do in the world and the combat while not near complete, is to me boring at its core. AI is still buggy. For the life of me I can't find my experience bar but know I am gaining experience. After such a long period of time since the game was being developed, there should be more. The continued changes, to me, also signal a game that will never truly be what it wants. It should also be pointed out that everytime I have logged on in the past 6 plus months, I see nobody else around.\n\nI do want to mention how passionate and helpful the developer team is. The best story I have for how passionate and helpful they are, the day OoM released, I could not log on to save my life despite meeting every requirement. That same day I had personal contact with the team to figure it out, and figure it out we did. That dedication is something I wish more teams had.\n\nThis is early access, so if things improve will I change my recommendation? Yes, of course I will. Like I mentioned the developers are clearly very passionate and not trying to simply take your money like other studios in EA. But even with that, I can't recommend this game at this time. I have waited for more patches since the initial change to the Big World, but with those I still see nothing that changes my mind at this time.\n\nGameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CuGRmiGlns\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_Zs5iIirrM", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452822434, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1452822434, "recommendationid": "20532433", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501411", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498378308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 328, "steamid": "76561198080280143", "num_games_owned": 116}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "review": "UPDATE: Seems they are fixing it :D\n\n\nWas a great, promising title, great Unreal Engine graphics, great action combat. 3 months and they had finally made it playable, but no content... They decided late 2015 to revert to a cheap-looking graphic engine, with tab-target non-action combat, and worst of all, horrible controls. Now sad to say as of 2016, they have officially announced their termination of development due to lack of funds and lack of motivation. I truly hoped this could be what it looked like during the Greenlight video they had submitted. But alas, it seems this game was said to be too good to be true. \nTherefore, I can no longer recommend this game, as it has become yet another WoW, Aion, Lineage, and PWI.\n\nUpdate: They decided to completely abandon this I guess. No update in over 3  months, and no servers. Game is currently a title screen, devs seem to care less about how players feel as they came into this with no money and basically ran with what they did make off of this game.\n\nTL:DR Don't buy, another themepark MMO.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461388667, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1483751679, "recommendationid": "22580661", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505325", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445202957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 60, "steamid": "76561198027098571", "num_games_owned": 75}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "WHY IS THIS GAME SO HARD TO FIND ON THE STEAM STORE!!\nIn other news, yes this game is in development, I fell in love with the character design, yes my played time is nihilistic, buttfucking christ they got ALIENS THAT ARE NON CONFORMISTIC, I.E.
