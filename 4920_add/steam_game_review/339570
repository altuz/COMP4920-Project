The only thing that stood out at the time was it was \"Xcom like\". So I went to hit next and saw something in the about \"Realistic physics simulation\"...that peaked my interests. I would like to also point out, if this game did not have a demo I would have never purchased this game, leaving an empty hole in my life forever. Enemy has to be one of my all time indie favs and im still under 10hrs of gameplay. \n\nSpeaking of gameplay, its fucking brutal at times and thats a good thing. A good example, I managed to get two of my boys killed after we already wiped the level. The both of them were standing next to the house one minute and the next... the house was a heap of burning wood and rubble and one boy was under it all while another was almost thrown out of the map. What happened was I had lit the house on fire in a previous fight and some kind of explosive was inside without my knowledge. Basically what im saying, never expect to survive even if its not a high end level.\n\nWith all of that said I do think the game should get some more love. Although I enjoy the random generation, the game could also use some more flavor for the price point like a few new biomes/mini bosses/enemies. Something like caves or dungeons along side of the castles would be great. Wishing it went under a more \"early access\" approach. \n\nTl;dr Enemy is as brutal as it is mesmerizing and I highly recommend it. Coming from a guy who isnt a fan of turn-based combat. Enemy will without a doubt go down in my top games of all time. The demo is always a choice and I say you should really give it a try, dont let this gem get away from you like I almost did.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504130351, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504131375, "recommendationid": "34619536", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 69, "total_reviews": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
