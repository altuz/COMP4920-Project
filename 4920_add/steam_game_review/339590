The universe is interesting, and I wish there was more to be had on it. The only real lore I've found so far is in the hard to find transmission pedestals, and in the trading cards. \n\nThe gameplay is solid and fun. You control Crowman and Wolfboy with WASD and are running from the darkness that's hot on your tails. You can run from it, but eventually it will catch up unless you collect light orbs, which stall it for a small time. An interesting mechanic is that the game's soundtrack will quiet down as the darkness approaches, so you know danger is impending before you see it. The game introduces new mechanics at an alright pace, with things such as air dashing and double-jumping which can seriously mean life or death in some levels. However, sometimes the game's camera (which follows the protagonists) can be slow to keep up. If you're dashing or falling, the camera takes a moment to speed up to catch up to Crowman and Wolfboy. This can be frustrating in sections where you're falling, as sometimes you're falling into areas with spikes, enemies or other hazards and you won't see them until you hit them. Other than that, the gameplay is fun and intuitive with a mix of platforming and quick-reaction running.\n\nThe art style is gorgeous, with most of the art being done with shades of black, white and grey. It truly helps to captivate the morbidness of the game; you're a pair of outcast darkness creatures just trying to find another life, and everything is out for your feathers. Or fur. The black character silhouettes make Crowman and Wolfboy easily visible in most environments. However, in places with dark or black backgrounds, the only visibility of the pair are their eyes, which glow white in the darkness. This can be confusing, as the eyes can sometimes be mistook as light orbs, and you can lose track of where you are, hitting an obstacle or falling into a pit.\n\nThe sound design is alright. The music could use some variety, but the sounds for Crowman and Wolfboy are great, with growls, grunts, chirps, pants, squawks and screeches. Wolfboy growls loudly when he attacks, and pants if he climbs or runs out of stamina with the claw attack. Crowman himself is pretty quiet, but that's understandable; he's riddled with anxiety and fear of the impending darkness, and that's forever implanted on his eyes, which always seem to be sad. \n\nThe animation is lovely. Crowman runs in a lanky fashion with fear in his eyes, and Wolfboy seems to charge forward with intent, indicating their different outlooks on the situation. When jumping in the air, Crowman holds Wolfboy with his talons as they fly, and Wolfboy squints his eyes as if the wind is hurting them. When climbing a surface, Crowman rides (rather hilariously) on the back of Wolfboy, who clambers up. The pair aren't separated during gameplay (from what I've played) and their bond can be seen by how they always stick together.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game with some minor issues, but fun nonetheless. Definitely worth a buy!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496780685, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496780685, "recommendationid": "32227019", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
