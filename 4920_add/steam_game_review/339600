This game has so much potential, but it falls short due to greed.  The game is beautifully rendered, fun to play, strategic and challenging, but not too difficult.  Unfortunately the negatives way out weigh the positives.  The negatives, and there are two only, are:  1.  this game is pay to win to the nth degree, and 2. there is a ton of down time waiting for ships to build or repair.  To put this into perspective, building a single mid-level ship would take 4 days to build, or you can do it instantly for $20.  Yes, build one ship for $20.  You have seven fleets of 6 ships each, for a total of 42 ships.  Let's do the math here.  If you want to pay to fill up your fleets with these mid-range ships it would cost you $840!!!  That is nuts!  Well, if you want to build them without paying it would take you 168 days!!!  This also leads to a ton of down time.   After you reach level 40+ (mid range), there isn't much to do other than grind.  Many of the events are above your level, and all of the quests are done.  So you can grind.  And wait.  And wait some more.  And wait even longer.\n\nLook elsewhere for your fun, and to spend your money.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487642185, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487642185, "recommendationid": "30070190", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557894", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505320156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 103869, "steamid": "76561198300726225", "num_games_owned": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Kixeye has made this game so that unless you want to spend loads of money you can't compete or keep up with the new stuff coming out.
