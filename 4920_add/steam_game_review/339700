Literally, it's block once in a while, slash once in a while, and that's about it.\nObviously a PC port. Lacks volume sliders, rebindable keys. Doesn't even bother to bring up the right explanations in parts to show what you need to use to activate certain moves.\nEvery weapon feels relatively the same.\nThe lock on feature breaks for no good reason at times, which is a problem in breaking the flow of combat.\nAnimation quality at times is poor, which doesn't help in combat.\nAI is pretty basic.\nIt's NOT FUN.
