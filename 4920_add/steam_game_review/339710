Even one-liners are there (and voice acting is damn amusing). The script is well written and dialogs are witty. Sounds, visual design, art and music are all there and very competent, nothing to write home about but fairly good. Design-wise all cogs are working in tandem to bring you rock solid game...\n\nBut... it is unpolished beyond any reasonable means, it's like some beta-version with numerous issues. Wall-jumping is barely working, UI is straight up awful and jumping and aiming are unrelieble and gamepad controls are floaty at best (kb+mouse works better).\nAnother example is when the game says 'press button for details' it won't show you any details, it'd open map with the same thing and nothing else. Often the game fails to explain where or what you need to do. Map itself is straight up unusable (it basically only shows you the name of levels where upgrades and collectibles are). To be fair it's pretty linear game, so you might be able to beat it without running around much.\n\nThere is some badly designed enemies encounters that could block you unable to move, there is some turrets that are set right into the elevators so they can push you off, there is some walls that doesn't block properly, sometimes arenas are locked wrong so you could fell off and the game will ignore it so you'll be forced to exit the game, enemies can push you off arenas with you being unable to do anything, when you teleport back from bank you might be spawned on top of enemies, turrets that shoot off-screen and are unavoidable, hits not registering to drones, repeating cutscenes and so on. Nothing big, but small issues are all over the game.\n\nThe biggest issue that enemy shots interrupt reloading (which takes more time than firing a mag away). And it makes late stages very hard to beat - enemies shoot at you constantly and you can't fight back, while enemies are quite bullet spongy and regenerate (each enemy could take around 3 mags)... Not to mention that all guns have very limited amunition which is only refilled at shops. You got an idea - the game becomes absolute frustrating trash.\n\nAll in all it's pretty good game ruined by lack of polish. It's enjoyable at first but there is high chance you won't be able to complete it. So buy only if the game is dirt cheap and prepare to be disappointed when you stuck.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499657348, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499673932, "recommendationid": "33421230", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514407", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
