I have been on pins and needles waiting for it since it was in Greenlight, and I was NOT disappointed. Made it through the first boss so far. DEFINITELY challenging, but in a fun and engaging way. The way the developer blends the coding aspect of the game into the gameplay is brilliant. This game is perfect for teaching kids coding, and keeping them interested while learning... heck, I went to school for this stuff, and I am STILL having a great time!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498029995, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498029995, "recommendationid": "32611880", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520864", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498298053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 47, "steamid": "76561197998784211", "num_games_owned": 133}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Wow, this is a really unique concept.  It is very professional, feels like a full release to me, but it is still early access.  At first it looks like it's going to be a typical platform shooter, but the gameplay is totally unlike anything I've come across.  \n\nI think the fact that I am a programmer may influence my reaction to this game, but if you are looking for something challenging and different, it is well worth the purchase price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498298260, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498298260, "recommendationid": "32719681", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502871", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
