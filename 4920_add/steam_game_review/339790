Even after 12 years, it still holds up. This game has so many mods that you probably could probably point to any race track or car on Earth and there's probably a mod of that somewhere for rFactor.\n\nIs rFactor playable on a controller? Yes. You need to tweak it quite a bit, but it's playable. Like any sim though, you will never be as fast as you are with a wheel.\n\nThe graphics? Well, the game came out in 2005 and the game was never designed to be graphically amazing. This is below any modern sim in that regard. But that doesn't hurt the game at all. Some of the best mods for the game look pretty accurate and don't look that outdated. It shows its age, but I feel that its aged quite nicely.\n\nFor the love of God, don't play the game with stock content. This game was literally designed to be modded. There are probably over 10,000 mods for the game. Go on the internet and find stuff. View forums. There are tons of things out there.\n\nI'd also recommend having multiple installs of this game. There's a guide on Steam that tells you how to do it. I've personally not seen the game slow down, but I will tell you that mod packs often intersect and break one another. For example, the EnduRacers mod will most certainly break an install of Blancpain Sprint 2012.\n\nThat brings me to another point about mods. Mods will break if you mess with them too much. I've had to delete my modded install and start over plenty of times because I wanted to edit something. It's not much of an issue, considering it takes maybe 2 minutes to copy over the Steam install to a new folder. There's tons of forums that are worth checking out as they'll have useful tips on what to do and not do with modded installs. But that is a warning, like with any game that has mods.\n\nIs there a career mode in this game? Yes and no. Yes, you can buy cars and you have credits. No, there is no \"career\" in terms of races. You create race seasons. It's a little confusing at first but it's not that difficult. You might think it's boring to just race against AI but it really isn't. But if you get tired of AI, you can probably still find racing leagues or servers online. This game is not dead, despite how little is still being made in terms of mods.\n\nIf you want to race your local track with your favorite cars with physics that still hold up, you should buy this. If you want league racing, you should buy this. If want something like Assetto Corsa but with more mods, you should buy this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499974462, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499974462, "recommendationid": "33510305", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506388", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503983156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1162, "steamid": "76561198185041705", "num_games_owned": 69}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "even after a decade.
