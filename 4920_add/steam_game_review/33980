This time - in the distant town somewhere on Mid-West of USA. What I like about the game - is that it stays on the bright side of things. You know, the Zombie Games are usually Dead Serious. Not a bad feature, but all of them are so similar on the basic level, that it is absolutely no fun. Stubbs the Zombie was different, one-of-a-kind gem... But there are too little count of games trying comical approach on the zombie pattern - and that's a mile behind the cinematography. Which is strange, as generally games are far more creative with things, in comparison with Hollywood...\n\nNow, Pound of Ground is not something worth a long review, really. The \"Hero\" there doesn't have Ash Williams charisma and chainsaw, but other than that - it's the same type of guy.\n\nThe game starts a bit confusing, but quite soon you'll get a bat to crush z-sculls, then a car, a pistol, a shotgun, a long-ranged crossbow, and finally, a dynamite. Zombies will be upgrading as well, there will be monsters with distant attacks, sages-which-raising-hordes, and even bigger things on the dessert. Controls are a bit off, but only a little. In general, it is rather easy-going arcade game with semi-open world, some zombies to kill and some hills to jump with your red cabrio. Full complete in less than 10 hours, and way better aftertaste, than with so many other Zombie games. Especially when we're talking about smaller ones, like Dead Pixels, which so many people seems to like without proper reason...\n\nSure, Pound of Ground has many flaws, if you care to look for them - like strange name in the first place, followed by wacky start of the game, somewhat clunky controls and gameplay in general... and not-so-good code, as the game tends to crush every now and then, usually on the loading screens.\n\nOn the other hand, it is doing well the thing the games are generally made for - it is entertaining. I really like it just the way it is (except for unstable code, of course). It is short and fun, if a bit mindless, comedy action game about zombies. With great fusion soundtrack, which I really enjoyed.\n\nMy mark is 8/10. I usually play serious long-winded games, like epic RPGs and strategies... But sometimes you just can't force yourself to take the playtime so seriously. After 16h-work day, for example... And Pound of Ground is perfectly fitting that niche of short and easy action. There should be more games like that!"}, {"votes_down": 28, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1394629457, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526881", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "9438060", "votes_up": 48, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997992108", "num_reviews": 119, "last_played": 1394797953, "num_games_owned": 2105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 564}, "timestamp_updated": 1394629457, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I went into this game expecting it to be one of the worst games I have ever played and in that I was disappointed, I am a bit of a Masochist when it comes to games and I do seek out bad games as well as good ones.\n\nThe other user reviews on this game plus TB's \"Why do I own\" video made this one sound like that would be that bad it would make a great video, So when it came on sale for 1\u20ac I grabbed it.\n\nThe game is average.

Careful tho, as your car is damageable and can lose parts of its body.\nDriving is quite enjoyable and responsive.\nYou got 5 weapons (One of them is a baseball bat which sends zombie flying scoring home runs).\nYou simply are an average hero who's going to save the world from a zombie invasion.
