However, this is the most unfinished one I've ever laid eyes on.\n\nFirst, you get given very vague instructions, there is no map, there is no objective indicator and the enemies can literally sneak up on you with no sound or even effect noise for their attack.  I just happened to look at my health at one point and realized something was trying to eat my face.\n\nThe enemies can't be looted, and the initial map (crash site) is huge, but since you don't know where and what you're supposed to be collecting/doing, you just sorta run in circles hoping you get the right item by accidentally running over it.\n\nI think the premise is nice, I think the game will MAYBE one day be playable and worth it.  But as of now, I'm feeling super cheated as it's the bare skeleton of a game and not anywhere close to what they think it will become.\n\nI'll keep hoping that I see it's updated in my steam window in the future and give it another try, but for now, it's just going to haunt my harddrive as the little game that maybe could one day be worth playing.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1423254047, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419805434, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1419805434, "recommendationid": "13675021", "developer_response": "Our team is back from summer vacation (we really needed that) and we're focused on Skeptical's negative review. It was actually very positive for us, because we were having a hard time deciding what to do next, since we're a very small team. Anyway:\n- I agree with MadDogBiff, we're not gonna be that much user-friendly and most will be figured out finding information ingame such as books, letters or computers. Anyway, considering Skeptical's review, we decided to add a small tutorial at the beginning just so the player doesn't feel completely lost, to give a sense of direction at least.\n- Enemies will be lootable, but we're still deciding some things such as: should they drop resources? Should they drop the weapons they're using? Should they respawn?\n- Earth map being huge: well, with the NPC's dialogs we're writing and the texts (letters, books and computers), the map will be the same size, you'll still feel lost because you can only find maps if you access the alien ship's camera hacking the computer, but at least you'll probably die soon anyway.", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551562", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433715214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 69, "steamid": "76561198107236744", "num_games_owned": 37}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Not a complete game. At all. There's no guide, it's too dark in the beginning. Buildings disappear, you can't tell if you're inside or outside sometimes. It is rife with bugs, aliens that you kill, getting 'stuck' on you and continuing to do damage. The UI is clunky and inelegant. I spent over an hour trying to find food. The second objective the \"tutorial\" gave me. There's no maps, there's no compass, no way to tell where you are...and you can't see anything. It's a 3rd person game with all of the horrible weaknesses of field of view of a first person game. And dark. Did I mention dark? There's not even a setting to crank the brightness so you can see. It sounds like it has a lot of potential, but releasing this game for $10 on Steam was irresponsible and borderline unethical. It is in alpha, at the best.
