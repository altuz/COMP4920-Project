Amazing graphics and cut scenes. Big differance  with \"The Moment Of Silence\"  is it's  more like a movie/game than most pure 3rd person  point and click adventures..  Very iIntersting  futuristic setting (sort of)  and easier gameplay in that you can't make a disasterous mistake. Still took me over 21 hours to play.. That was off and on however!  What I really loved about this  stroyline is that no matter how  long you left it when you  came back it never got to the point where i forgot the goal/mission or what the story was about. That happenes far to often in some adventure games!\nMy only negative to be honest is this game probably has the most I chit chat in it i've ever seen!\nStill, I'm looking forward to finding more like this!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493500026, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502380694, "recommendationid": "31449233", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514794", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 7}}
