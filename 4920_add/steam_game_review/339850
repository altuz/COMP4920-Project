You never use it!\n-----\nStory:\nDave McNamara a DC psychiatrist was sent to a New York Psychiatric Hospital to try and find out what caused  5 young adults to end up patient\u2019s under nearly the same circumstances. \nDave/You will interact with them all recording the sessions and re-playing them for each other to spark memories that become Flashbacks. Flashback\u2019s start with a Cut Scene then you control each patient through their many memory sessions.. (quite fun)\n\nAs you keep playing and record sessions with them everyone\u2019s lives begin to intertwine and the pieces start to unravel.. Dave\u2019s own life unravels as well! \nEdge of your seat stuff here people.. \nI\u2019M NOT KIDDING!! \nThis would have been a great movie!\n\nThe storyline was fantastic! Had me fooled so many times.. \nI thought I had the ending all figured out by Chapter II--Not even close!\nI had every single person as the \u201cBad Guy\u201d at some point.. \n------\nCasual 3rd person point and click maneuvering and easier to use inventory item\u2019s .  \nMost of the game required a lot of thinking, listening trial and error! And then there were the WTH moments where I had to save the game and look up what to do, or how to do it often! \nOne puzzle entering a code in the last chapter really required memory from hours past and that still didn\u2018t work for me.. Had to cheat-more then once!\n------\nCon\u2019s, Sort Of: \nWe should have had some way to re-call dialogues (like a diary) when Dave loses his PDA permanently.. Otherwise you need a Steele trap or photographic memory for the ending!\n\nThey did such a good job on graphics for an older game except when Dave\u2019s glass at the bar doesn\u2019t come anywhere near his mouth it looks like he dumps all his whiskey in his lap. \n-----\nTid Bit\u2019s:\nI noticed something right away that I thought was a clue.. In the patient files everyone was sent there by a Judge. It say\u2019s Hon- for Honorable so and so on everyone\u2019s chart except for Cell #1 it just had a name. Either the developers did that on purpose to fool gullible people like me, or it was a blooper! \n\nThis game reminded me of some Nancy Drew games in that you might want to take some notes.. I did.. \n\nAs with the last 3 games I\u2019ve played by Adventure Company they inserted playing computer game\u2019s into this one, made references to playing and put some of their own work  in this one as well.  The Poster by the bus stop is an ad for \"The Moment Of Silence\" by House Of Cards..\n\n1. Funny thing I missed the first play through.. Keep an eye on the car in front of Dave's hotel!\n\nI really wish there were 100\u2019s that play like This one..", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494269592, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496795641, "recommendationid": "31631996", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510196", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497831310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 784, "steamid": "76561198105661704", "num_games_owned": 818}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is an pretty solid, above average point and click game that I think any fan of the genre will enjoy.
