I have played games that were free to play that are many times better than this, and from my first hour in game, I can't reccommend this at all. I will however, continue playing, and perhaps things will get better and I didn't just waste 30$\n\nEdit: All right, after.. approximately 30-40 more minutes after first impressions, I decided I couldn't take it anymore (partially because the camera is awful, but also because I seemed to have fallen through the floor...) \n\nAnyway, the game is not good, and especially for the asking price, I would say don't buy this game unless you literally have nothing better to do. Even if the devs are the greatest people in the world, and they could be, this game is pretty awful.\n\nToo much running time between encounters, pretty much empty maps, junk crafting mecahnics (in that it's incredibly time consuming and there's no way to craft multiples at a time.. just have to click one by one) make this game.. Well, pretty awful in my opinion. \n\nThe entire thing would have worked better as a jrpg with pixels, and the game certainly feels like an (old) jrpg with pxiels and awful camera... in 3d.\n\nSo yea, I would highly reccommend against buying this, unless you'd like to be generous and give the devs a donation. Haven't tried the other package (battle tactics, or chess) and that could be better, but I would definitely pan the primary game itself.\n\nEdit 2: Since people are clearly not finding this review helpful either via bias or because they think I need more information, let's update this review again.\n\nWhy Combat is Bad: Combat is basically sitting next to a monster and using auto attacks on it. Each auto attack is 3 mana. In between auto attacks, you have the option to use one of the skills you have unlocked which consume more mana and do extra damage as compared to an auto attack. (Or use one of the hp/mana consumables) While this is acceptable for something like a jrpg, in a format such at this game, it leads for very dull, uninteresting combat where you sit around and wait for cooldowns to pop up before clicking on a button.\n\nI suppose one could compare this to many themeparks on the market, but for this game it's especially bad because the graphics are lack luster. On the flipside, the simplicity means that anyone can understand combat after a few minutes of it, so the game has that going for it.\n\nAnother gripe I have (minor, really) is that hp/mana do not regenerate out of combat. You must use consumables to restores these stats, or walk into a glowing barrier like thing, where upon you get teleported to the entrance of the zone with full health, but the same amount of mana. \n\nThe crafting of consumables is easy, but because the crafting menus don't allow for producing more than one 'set' at a time, you end up sitting at the npc's who craft (Yes, your character does not actually craft, as far as I can tell), for a long time, reptitively clicking \"craft->main menu_>craft->main menu\" until you can finally craft either mana packs or health packs, which each require at minimum 6 clicks, as far as I can tell.\n\nNow, all of this is bad, but what compounds all of it and makes it worse is the maps.\n\nThe maps are HUGE, giant!... And very, very empty. Now, I could be completely wrong about this because I didn't spend much time exploring any of the maps, but the maps seem to be huge just to be huge, with 2-3 monster spawns of each enemy 10-15 seconds away from each other. This is annoying at best, especially given that either running or walking is relatively slow, there's no eye candy to explore, and the camera is jerky and takes some time to get used to.\n\nSo then, we have bad combat, irritating crafting, giant, empty maps, and bad cameras.\n\nAnything else I'm forgetting..?\n\nAh quests. Quests are generic kill monsters here, or find the npc. Nothing intuitive about them, and they use all the worst aspects of the game to complete (combat and moving from place to place).\n\nGathering is acceptable, albeit very lackluster in that you walk up to a box and click gather. You wait a few seconds and then the resources are in your inventory. Wait about 15 seconds before gathering the same type of node again, because otherwise the boxes will be marked as 'empty' (No, they don't despawn).\n\nI think that should just about cover why I thought this game was bad, and I hope others find this more helpful now that I've gone over the game more in depth.\n\nAs a side note, I will say the game would have made a perfectly good jrpg, but the game attempts to be a jrpg in 3d format and... does so very badly.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428196064, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428266134, "recommendationid": "15211633", "language": "english", "votes_down": 34, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592722", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432150368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 60, "steamid": "76561198111350656", "num_games_owned": 197}, "votes_funny": 8, "votes_up": 64, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Well as it stands this plays like it still a alpha not even ready for beta game play. Reason I say this is the basics like camera control and key board config is just a plain mess. They insist on using mouse button to control the camera but it also the move button to. And the camera zooms around at fastest setting no way to scale it down. So in combat you end up looking at undersides of monsters you fite or at random things as  you move thrue the map.Then you got the keyboard setup that just dont work. They use the F1-12 keys and so does steam.  Set something on f12 and was taking screen shots and healing.They use a key layout that was used 10+ years ago and even then they place a odd key to throw you off. Then you got the targeting for monsters its so small of a area to click you miss it all the time with the camera like it is. If you want to see it at its worst try clicking on the quest manager its maddening at times.

I tested this game years ago when this solo developer project started.  The single player game and the original browser game was fun, though the browser game was a bit of a money grab project for those who did more than play it casually.\n\nReasons why you shouldn't buy this game:\n\n- Storyline feels like it was written by a middle school child.\n- Controls are horrible, worse than old school EQ1, and yes that is very bad.\n- Graphics are just as bad as a game that was created back in early 2000's (EverQuest 1, Dark Age of Camelot (before graphics overhaul, etc)\n- Gameplay is clunky as hell and delayed reactions of every skill as if the server actually a person's laptop that is about 7 years old.\n\n\nOverall the quality of this game should make it worth about $1.00, if that.  As I said before, this is a single person developer project and was developed years ago.  Why this game was revived with absolutely no new additions, no new graphics, no new anything is beyond me.\n\nOne other thing I must add is that the developer of this game, Thywill (or something close to that), does approach purchasers to request that they write positive reviews. Offers forum positions and moderator positions in the various amatuer games as a reward, aka bribing.
