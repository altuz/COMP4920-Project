Even thought I had whishlisted it for a long time and expected a lot.\n\nThe beginning starts quite well. The base of the plot is well... not very original but one can feel it could get interesting.\n\nAlso, the graphics isn't bad -- even though everything is 1024 capped with 4/3 aspect ratio, but I don't mind.\n\nBut then you start to notice the very bad voice acting, the clumsy gameplay where you basically have to go back and forth in countless areas just to get an item that you couldn't pick earlier...\n\nTalk to this guy, go there, pick item, come back to the guy, new dialog is unlocked, etc.\nAlright that's like the basics of adventures games, but for this game this is really a waste of time.\nAll of that is made to make the game longer. Really.\n\nThe gameplay was so pointless that at the middle of the game I started to use a walkthrough just to PLAY the game instead of wandering aimlessly everywhere just to find a piece of paper or a piece of grass (yeah, true story) or whatnot. I just wanted the story to continue.\n\nAlso, the closer you get towards the end of the game and the less detailed everythings gets.\nYou cannot click on random stuff anymore and have your character comment on it, or having nice description of the surrounding. I believe even the music is gone too near the end. Even though it wasn't that great in the first chapters, it was still a little bit immersive.\n\nAnd, when the end of the game comes, we can saddly notice that everything has been rushed. The story falls appart and then comes dissapointement.\n\nHowever there are some dialogues and comments that are kinda funny.\nThere is a little bit of humour in that game that will make you laugh for sure.\n\nBut yeah... no I cannot recommend this game."}, {"votes_down": 14, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1396822315, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547979", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9749025", "votes_up": 46, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987067772", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1396821221, "num_games_owned": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 483}, "timestamp_updated": 1396822315, "received_for_free": false, "review": "\"Wait...

The story isn't very engaging and by the time you get any sort of meat to sink your teeth into, it ends. You get a few solid plot nuggets throughout the game which ultimately go unresolved leaving you unsatisfied and wondering what the point of it all was in the first place. Honestly, it feels as though they had unfinished 3 plot concepts squished them together and hoped for the best. \n\nWell, at least it was a challenge and fun to play right? Nope... It encapsulates one of the most reviled characteristics of the classic point and click adventure games. In order to progress through an obvious puzzle you first have to interact with something 10 screens away so that the option then becomes available. The constant backtracking, the inability to collect stuff without you'll obviously need before interacting with something unnecessary and the occasional pixel hunt make the game play nearly insufferable.\n\nThe sad thing is, despite the game having a largely unfinished feel... Actually, I think it's safe to say it is unfinished. The art work is actually pretty good. Some of the sub plots are fairly dark and interesting, even though most of the story is just hinted at, and no real plot is there.
