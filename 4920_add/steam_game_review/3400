Half of the fun of wackamoke is actually using a hammer, and that doesnt translate well on a computer, you end up with a targeting reticule and this ends up being more like shooting ducks than wackamole. As you progress through levels gnomes increase in variety with small variations on how to wack them. Misses hurts your health which can return a game over screen. Popcap did great work with the sound in this game, its not annoying at all, punchy and upbeat and goes with the game well. There is a lot of negative however, you can collect points and coins, and doing very well can speed up the game, but upon losing the game you are booted back to the very first level with no level select screen, the coins cant be spent on anything, and increasing the speed just makes it more likely that you will lose your progression. The options are limited and chances are if you have a modern computer screen or television it will not fit properly on-screen. So this game does a lot of things right but I cant even guarantee that a wackamole game better made than this one wont ever surface, which wasnt that high of a bar to set. Given the demand on this type of game thats unlikely however so thats probably the best you are going to find in this very niche and not all that exciting genre. It makes for okay entertainment for people with short attention span, children, and the like and the reboot to the first level is at least friendly for hotseat."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1437378080, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506831", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "17136680", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198067347675", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1437378011, "num_games_owned": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 71}, "timestamp_updated": 1437378080, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Still just as fun as it was 12 years ago"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1451169002, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504358", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "19976599", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197983603755", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1451168833, "num_games_owned": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 23}, "timestamp_updated": 1451169002, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of the finest games ever crafted. \nRivals games like Final Fantasy VII and Planescape: Torment.\nSo sad there is no sequel."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1301804981, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501767", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2722814", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011647032", "num_reviews": 482, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 7484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 603}, "timestamp_updated": 1301804981, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Got a quick mouse and fast reaction!? If you do then this will be the game for you! It adds humor to a classic style of gameplay were you whack the heads of gnomes back into a hole. The game starts out simple and easy but then it can get really fast and hard to complete each level. The graphics are cartoon like and each gnome is unique in how many times you have to hit them or what happens when you hit the wrong gnome. It is a game of fast reaction and not a trigger happy mouse. It will teach you when to strike and when not to strike. There are achievements in the game that motivate you to keep going and beat the game. It can be a challenging game or a stress relieving game to some. If you enjoy braking gnomes and want to get some aggression out on them then this is a game that you shouldn't pass up.
