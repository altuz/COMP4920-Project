I will say it tends to get a little cluttered, since there are lasers flying all over the place, and if you're not great at paying attention, it is easy to forget what  your next goal in the game is, as there aren't any heads-up displays (lol head joke) about tracking your current missions.\n\nIts got fantastic humor and fun animation, and the designs of the levels and characters are a true artistic joy. The colors are fantastic and really give you that retro 60s/70s feel. It does start to feel a little long at times, since there isn't easy fast-travel and the levels are rather maze-like, but they're still fun to navigate once you remember to keep checking your mini map.\n\nTL;DR:\n\namazing level designs, characters, and colors, quick pacing, neat power ups and upgrades. Can get frustrating from the amount of running around you have to do, fight scenes can get cluttered and there's (often) not much strategy other than FIRIN MUH LAZER in literally every direction.
