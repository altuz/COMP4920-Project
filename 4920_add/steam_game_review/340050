Above everything the only thing I'd like to see about this game is updated/more things to build,  more story. The one it has is good but I would love to see a resolution to the lady needing Insulin.

I enjoyed this strange adventure/survival blend that the game has to offer but what really impressed me was the rich story line. I became so attached to all of the characters that I had picked up that it really makes you sad when one of them dies. I think that emotional attachment to your group really makes the game epic. \n\nThe combat with zombies needed a bit of work but all in all, I would say this game is a masterpiece and definitely worth the low asking price to add it to your library.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506446494, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506446494, "recommendationid": "35226131", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500400", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1479338271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561198086785399", "num_games_owned": 94}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "controls suck......too clunky", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505167252, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505167252, "recommendationid": "34890998", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478129", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484331652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561198163258538", "num_games_owned": 90}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "im starting to think people are afraid of giving a negative review on things.
