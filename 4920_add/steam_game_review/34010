Different weapons, appearance customization, several big zones(countries) each with itsown atmosphere...\n\nBut the most important are truly role-play elements: interesting story choices and cool system with real-time dialogues options choice: want to tell something? Then think or react fast! The game has an interesting spy-plot too! Also you can kill everyone or walk through in stells - choice is yours!\n\nNot too much different ways like at old-style RPGs but still Alpha Protocol offers enough of them!\n\nGame is really good. And it's nice to hear information from Obsidian that they are thinking about Alpha Protocol 2! Want to play RPG at modern time? Alpha Protocol will offer you a really good experience!"}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505071946, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514864", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34869608", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024451265", "num_reviews": 217, "last_played": 1504983682, "num_games_owned": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 926}, "timestamp_updated": 1505071972, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1]Unpolished[/h1]\n\n[h1]May be worth picking up & playing once if you catch it at a good sale price.
