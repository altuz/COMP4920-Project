This is a game that is somewhat different from most other games you'll find in the Early Access area, one that given its current status, is worth buying now, as it is, at the current price. Its only uphill from here. The gameplay's unique, the art style is distinctive, the tone well set. \n\nGiven a year or two development, to flesh this thing out, we'll have a cult hit at the least, and quite possibly and indie darling at the best.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505702382, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505702382, "recommendationid": "35037443", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510974", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505500027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2376, "steamid": "76561198139391207", "num_games_owned": 118}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ez Good\n\nSeriously people you paid $10 or less and your acting like you expact GTA 6.
