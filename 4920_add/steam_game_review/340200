There are also various obstacles and mechanics that you encounter and have to overcome, such as pendulums, elevators, etc. The art style is minimalistic, yet aesthetically pleasing, and suits the game quite well. To draw a comparison to another game, Bloop is sort of like Crayon Physics Deluxe, but with fluids instead of a rolling ball. Given the nature of this type of game, I feel that working with fluids, rather than a ball, allows for more flexibility and mechanical complexity (of which I am a fan of); the other side to this coin is that this causes a spike in difficulty that not all players will be able to appreciate. While I am a fan of difficult games, the quick spike in the transistion of difficulty between levels does cause a bit of frustration and can be a little off-putting at times. That being said, it isn't enough to turn me away from the game, just enough to cause me to take a break and come back later with even more determination.\n\nWhen I first started this game, I had a small and inconsistent problem regarding it crashing a few times. I posted a review that stated my problem so that potential buyers could be aware of this. Whithin a mere minutes of my post, the developer (a SINGLE person) messaged me on Steam, asking what the problem was, and offering to help resolve it (the problem was resolved). This is a developer that TRULY cares about his work and his audience. These are the type of developers that are saving the gaming industry, one game at a time.\n\nThis game is enjoyable, difficult, and requires you to think outside the box, so to speak. I recommend this game to anybody who enjoys physics-based puzzle games that require deep and abstract thinking. The difficulty ramps up a little quicker than it probably should, but that's really my only gripe regarding this game.

Sometimes the game doesn't start, cutscenes get stuck, alt-tabbing frequently crashes the game on windows 8. So you have to aware that there might (most likely) be some issues.\n\nSecondly, the game itself. Difficulty curve is not well laid out, the first few levels are too easy, then the game gets too hard very quickly. (as I said, I'm not a big fan of puzzle games, so that could be related to my missing experience in this particular genre) The game mechanics are very simple to learn, and each level has multiple solutions. The game is proud of that, but that makes the game feel strange. You never know if that is supposed to be a proper solution or some kind of workaround or glitch. The same goes about the behavior of lifts and other elements in the game. Even if you find a solution, it just won't feel right.\n\nThirdly, the music and all sounds are just simply annoying. It makes you tear your ears out, and hang yourself. Yep, it's that boring. The art itself is somewhat similar to that too, generic, nothing special.\n\nFourthly, the texts. Asides the few grammar and composition issues the texts are the worst part of the game. The author tried to be cute and funny so hard, that they became irritating. It's like ponies on fluffy clouds. Makes you want to kill yourself the second time after you hanged yourself because of the music. And the third time. The fourth time. The fifth...\n\nSo in short, avoid the game.\n\nHowever, if you still want to try out a game from the developer, and you are interested in the concept, check out Bloop Reloaded. That's definitely a big improvement over this one.\n\nAnd there is something else I have to say here. I presonally don't like the idea of releasing a game, then release a better version as a separate purchase a few weeks later. I understand the circumstances of the releases (this version being stuck in greenlight for a long time), and that the products are separated by years of development. However I still think reloaded should have been free (or greatly discounted) for Bloop owners. \"The right thing to do.\"", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423442230, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423442230, "recommendationid": "14396593", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493824", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463157478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561198014765810", "num_games_owned": 333}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "First off I would like to say that I am connoisseur of the finest memes life has to offer, that being said, I am fully aware that this is considered by critics to be \"medium\" quality on the Blart Scale of Spicy Memes.\n\nAnyway to the review:\n\nGraphics:\nComparable to Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 in terms of art direction and style, which makes sense because both this game and that film have HR Giger on their production teams.\n\nSound:\nEffects are decent at best and \"poop bloop\" at worst all things considered.
