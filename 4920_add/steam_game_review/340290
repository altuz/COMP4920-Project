Poor level design. Nonsensical setting. Pacing issues with weapon damage balance, enemy hitpoints...  \n\nDoes not fullscreen correctly, huge sidebars on each side of the screen. XBox360 pad detected and working correctly. The story is almost ecology propaganda, where you are some moogli type abandonned kid whom for some reason goes by the name doctor and defends nature with a gun because of course that would happen if you get raised by wildlife and ended up as it's guardian. So you gun down foresters with shotguns and axes. They sponge too many hits and it slows the action down. Platforms are badly designed so the dev added double jump so you can sort of coax some progression out of the controls but its all pretty lackluster. You gather acorns because reasons. Sprites could be worse but they have no attack animation and you just get hurt when you make contact with an enemy sprite. Tiling for environment was a little disappointing\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502156033, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502156033, "recommendationid": "34093360", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "total_reviews": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 7}}
