Whatever.  The two-year-old loved the first game, and was excited about there being another, so as an adult, I figured I could deal with all that.\n\nWhat I cannot deal with, and what bored my two-year-old, was getting STUCK on the freaking river multiple times.  And don't even get me started about the stupid ducky mini-game.  My daughter kept getting mad because she was pointing at the ducks and I wasn't getting them.  I was getting mad because the freaking kayak refused to go the direction I was clicking and kept getting stuck on the edges of the river.  ARGH!\n\nSeriously, this sort of stuff ought to have been fixed before release.  I had low expectations for this game (since I'm an adult), but the game didn't even meet those.
