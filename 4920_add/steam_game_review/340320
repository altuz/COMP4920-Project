Hard to say if I recommend it. Sinless is a point 'n click game that tears me apart, like not many do. \nThere is a very good storyline on a real and deep cyberpunk background I really much appreciated. It's not often that a game leads to such more or less inner philosophical and topical questionning. Is this what awaits us? Is that the kind of society we want for tomorrow? And so on. \nSadly Sinless is too much of a visual novel. There's not much to play with, nothing to do, no interesting enough puzzles. I felt like something was missing, although I ran through it till the end because the story was good enough.  \nI can't say much about the graphics. Perfect for the cyberpunk atmosphere but quite simple and a bit pixelised or blury. That's fine by me since it doesn't hurt the eyes and it goes with the art style of the game. But some might dislike. \nI enjoyed the retro underground musics here and there. \nI keep my thumb up because the story has a lot of interesting aspects that deserve to be defended. The universe beyond is gigantic. If you're interested in prospective or Sci-Fi novels you should enjoy it. If you feel like being interested but are reluctant to play a game which is actually only a short story, get it on sale!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507030863, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507047889, "recommendationid": "35442853", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506210", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 48, "total_reviews": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
