The answer is nope, not yet![/b]\n\nTomb of Tyrants is a Match 3 (technically 4) / RPG hybrid with the twist being you're matching tiles to create a deadly dungeon. Depending on what tiles you match, you create a deathtrap filled with different rooms, cunning traps and angry minions in order to fight off those pesky adventurers that want to slay your tyrant. You roll the row to make a match (in a similar style to 10mil / You must build a boat), but you can also move in multiple directions in a single move and when a tile is used blocks can fall as well (physics matching?), tetris style. There are a fair few tile types, but thankfully you get a mouseover on each one because it would be a nightmare to remember everything. Less thankfully you have to squint at the screen to actual read the text most of the time.\n\nIt's a deep strategy game from the very first playthrough. Deceptively hard, it really took me a little while to figure out, so despite being a match 3 game it's really not casual at all. I'd definitely recommend having your coffee (or tea, if you're British like me) before you launch this in the morning.\n\n[h1]Imagine if the Dungeons series, Tetris and Bejewelled had a weird threesome baby...[/h1]\n\nQuite an ugly baby mind you, because the graphics are incredibly \"retro\". I like a bit of retro gaming don't get me wrong, but I also like a few more pixels too. Just one or two, pretty please? Playing this game on a 144mhz 37\" gaming monitor feels a bit redundant but it uses incredibly little space and resources so would be a great game for those playing games on a toaster-pc or for people wanting to challenge their eyes as well as their brain.\n\nEnough waffle, I'll break it down for you.\n\n[h1]\u2611  Pros: \u2611 [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Unique concept\n[*] Deceptively complicated game play\n[*] Lots and lots of strategic elements\n[*] Good sense of player progression that saves even when you wipe\n[/list]\n\n[h1]\u2612  Cons: (they're kinda all the same issue - visuals) \u2612 [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Retro retro graphics, which can sometimes make seeing what you're doing a little difficult.\n[*] Text is hard to read even with the \"double res font\" option ticked.\n[*] The interface is incredibly cluttered and it can be hard to follow.\n[/list]\n\nConsidering this is made by a single guy, it's pretty impressive overall but I do wish it was a wee bit easier on my old, tired eyes.\n\n[h1]Recommended for the complex strategy. As long as Match 3 hybrids continue to bring something new to the table, I'll keep lovin' them.[/h1]\n\nP.S. I am starting to gather my reviews up through the curator system.
