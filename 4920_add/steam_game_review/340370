Here, Carol tries to publish a book about one of her previous investigation (The Blue Madonna) but fails to do so. However, one of the publishers contacts her after a writer disappeared without contact. It's up to Carol to find why Gerald Black is hiding from the world and who wants to hurt him.\n\nTo remind you, Carol is a British national that visited Sweden and fell in love with the country. She's now living there and is a private investigator. As the gameplay didn't change from Bosch's Damnation, the previous game and the first one to be on Steam, here's part of my Steam review for this one.\n\nIt's a point and click game, you find objects, you use them, you solve puzzles thanks to clues and you speak with people. The game is done with real life pictures and real people. There is no video inside but you can see differences in the pictures: people are making differents expressions, if you open a door, you'll see it open.\n\nIt could be a walking simulator as you're walking from scene to scene without having to search something and each close-up doesn't bring everytime a clue or an object, just a nice view... and the fact that in real life, you would have looked at that.\n\nThe soundtrack is as usual a good one, and the voice acting is really interesting.\n\nIn terms of plot, the game is well-written. You're really going from surprise to surprise (Mrs Allegra was a huge help for example though your first meeting with her was kinda... intimidating). Besides, the achievements added aren't tied to the story but to actions you may do or not.... but there is one that nobody seems to find as it's the publisher and not the developer that did that (developers are selling their games on their site, I should perhaps play the older Carol Reed, now that they accept ways to pay that I can access).\n\nSeriously, Shades of Black is really a good game. It's maybe less focused on Swedish culture like in Bosch's Damnation due to the fact that you've gone from museum to museum in that one but it's still enjoyable.

The tutorial was very straight forward and simple.  I looked how real pictures are used and people with voices. I  liked looking for things without all the clues (like sparkles saying \"LOOK HERE!\")  It made the game more challenging having to watch for the curser icon to change from a yellow dot to a hand, magnifier or gears. It was nice to be able to pan around the room by clicking on the far right or left arrows when they appeared.
