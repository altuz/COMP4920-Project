Now don't get me wrong: The total package isn't yet flawless, but hell, I still wouldn't recommend anyone to stop playing the game before they reach the end.\n\nI'll try a little numbers chart. Since it's my first time doing that it may look unrefined, but whatever.\n\"Bigger is better\" applies to every score except the Stress Level.\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Aspect[/th]\n        [th]Score[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]8.5 of 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Characters[/td]\n        [td]9.0 of 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]8.0 of 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Sound[/td]\n        [td]7.5 of 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Graphics[/td]\n        [td]7.0 of 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Difficulty[/td]\n        [td]7.0 of 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Operability[/td]\n        [td]6.5 of 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Stress Level[/td]\n        [td]1.5 of 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nMy overall enjoyment of the game, which favored some aspects over others, lead me to give Lucid Awakening 2 a score of 8.6 out of 10.\n\nAn explanation to the above follows, where I feel it's needed to understand my point.\n\n[u][b]Sound & Graphics[/b][/u]\nwere judged following the criteria of whether or not I felt it fit the game as a whole and how it compares to works of other publishers that used the same engine.\nI'm not easily impressed when it comes to music and while some innovative use of themes at certain points in the game did improve the experience, the soundtrack and effects per se aren't excellent.\nThe graphics were good enough, not to make me feel, like I played \"yet another RPG Maker game\". So that was nice.\n\n[u][b]Difficulty[/b][/u]\nwas OK for what the game seemed to be opting for. Could have been harder though.\nIf you're looking for really challenging RPGs, this is not for you.\n\n[u][b]Operability[/b][/u]\nis what I use to judge how optimized the input as a whole, for maneuvering through each aspect of the game, was.\nIt's not terrible, but a few \"barriers\" within the menu should have been removed and the overall view could have been improved to make searching things easier. The game also suffers from RPG Makers lack of \"proper\" input customization.\n\n[u][b]Stress Level[/b][/u]\nis best understood by reading the preamble.\nYou can see this game largely didn't stress me out at all.\nIn fact: Just for the pure enjoyment factor I get by being able to play instead of plan a game, this is a true winner.\n\nI hope this helps someone.

The story stands well on it's own even if you haven't played the first, definately check the primer to get filled in, makes a couple of things clearer.\n\nThe job system is pretty fun aswell, allowing you to mix and match classes and roles with more being unlocked as you go along, it can be quite confusing at first however. You have to work out when to switch classes in battle, such as when an enemy is about to attack so you can absorb damage or when you need to use an ability and you have to think a couple of moves ahead, you can change the battle system to pause when you are making a move so you have plenty of time to think, or if you want a more hectic fast paced experience you can change it so that it doesn't pause on your turn similar to Final Fantasy 6.\n\nIf I had to nitpick and find a downside I would say the environments are not interactable, I would like to be able to break into people house and see if they are hiding healing items under their plants or find out if their clock has stopped, if it was added it would make the game world feel more alive to me.\n\nOverall I think this is a very good game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the earlier Final Fantasy games or Chrono Trigger to give this game a try, they might just find a new world to get lost in.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466517646, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1466517646, "recommendationid": "23686042", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450886942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 747, "steamid": "76561198164476021", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Even though I had a few problems to start with I would still rate this 5/5 because the developer was active and helpful.

The battle system while still turn based feel strategic and you can avoid battles if you really want to, the game is llinear until a certain point in the story. I had a few thingsthat bothered me and I`m sure a few others will have too: The heath bar of ennemies sometimes seem misplaced in battles making the ennemies hard to see at times. I just wished that the parts where npcs joined you were longer, i also had issues with one particular dungeon in the games. Theses negatives points doesn`t make the game not enjoyable in my humble opinion it`s a matter of preferences. The developer is also really open to his fans/players and use their feedback to improve the game which is a big + for me.
