This game has nowhere near the level of playability, physics, and refinement  (yes I get it's early access) of the MotoGP and Ride games from Milestone (which are both far from perfect).  Here's my experience so far with this game.\n\nLoad game, main menu, no career mode as stated in the description, see a very limited option for races, select easy race 1 oval, choose default bike (only option) and go, despite the decent graphics (in highest setting), surprised at the primitiveness of the race mode, blew by the computer racers after about 3 seconds and lapped the oval 3 times without brakes (minus crashing once into the incredibly slow AI before finishing).\n\nTried another race - california circuit, started out passing a bunch of slow AI until running into a clusterf*ck of AI that crashed into each other.  Physics were very difficult to manage on circuit course, and the AI lumped together and crashed every single turn making it impossible to pass without crashing.  Eventually respawned outside a barrier, unable to get back on track, then kept uncontrollably crashing then finally falling through the graphics into a bottomless pit.\n\nEnded up quitting after 7 minutes.  I want my money back.  Game needs a ridiculuos amount of work.\n\nEdit: I have the non-VR version of the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457235884, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1457235939, "recommendationid": "21656836", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506056", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1424974848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 28, "steamid": "76561198020823154", "num_games_owned": 312}, "votes_funny": 15, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": "7", "review": "utter gash", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424975207, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1424975207, "recommendationid": "14665041", "language": "english", "votes_down": 50, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434413", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
