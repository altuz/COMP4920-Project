The full experience, which is so worth it, is a time commitment that other fighting games don't have and I think people need to be prepared for that. the game plays in sets of 8 rounds. You go through and pick one of the starting classes and go up a very deep and intesne class tree. This is not  a casual game that you and 10 of your friends can all sit and get the full experience of like smash bros. This is a casual game that is a lot of fun and I would totally recommend it but it is not a party game.

Writing our own netcode was ultimately too ambitious and threatened to sink the project, I don't want to waste your time with behind-the-scenes drama but our team of 3 effectively became just my partner & I as a result of tensions surrounding this. I'm very sorry that we've been unable to deliver on our promise of online multiplayer, there are so many other areas of the game that need our attention, though, and come hell or high water we're committed to making this a big fun thing. Fleshing out the local content, adding mod support and Steam features, packing in the polish -- we're making real progress here and the game is better today than it's ever been.\n\nCould we have managed this Early Access phase differently? Definitely. Publicly announcing a feature before it's 100% determined to be feasible and within the project's scope was a mistake. It's hugely disappointing for all of us that an online Grand Class Melee won't be happening any time soon, but while plans may have changed, this isn't an abandoned game and we aren't running away from it.\n\nThanks for taking a chance on GCM2.
