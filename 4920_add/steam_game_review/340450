VR actually adds to the depth of the gameplay as you can better see the terrain and navigate your vehicle through the 360 labyrinth as fast as possible.  Your vehicle will explode if it takes too much damage.  I wish there was a way to know how much damage your vehicle has taken though.  It seems as soon as it starts smoking, it's about to explode.  \n\nI do recommend this game, especially if you can get it at the current sale price of $2.49.  There's lots of levels to get stars in (like mobile games), but each level is pretty unique (some levels look the same, but have different challenges in them).  It runs smoothly and the different languages added make it quite unique (even the credits are done interestingly).  I played this game with xbox controller on Oculus Rift and I had zero problems.  Ran very smoothly.\n\nRating 7/10 considering the value here", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502851985, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502851985, "recommendationid": "34268311", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 18, "total_reviews": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
