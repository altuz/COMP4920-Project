(Thank you SeattleEgg)\n\nI just picked it up today, but I can definitely say that the immersion is there. I went into my own little world pretty quickly and started to bounce with the beat as I tried to pull off perfect sections. There are lots of bonuses available for trick shots, recochets, accuracy etc. Additionally, right mouse button will charge objects providing a charge bonus when you shoot them. I can see that there's more for me to learn about getting higher scores, but after half an hour it felt like my mouse hand was going to fall off from all the button mashing. One concern I do have is that the cursor seems to feel a little laggy at times. I'm not sure if it's meant to be lofting shots (ie balistic arc) or if it's a bug, but it can be a little confusing at times. \n\nPros:\nNice to look at\nImmersive\nSeveral different levels\nComplex bonus points system\n\nCons:\nProbably not for anyone that doesn't like electronica/dance music\nThe cursor seems to lag sometimes making shots feel like they're being \"lofted\"\nConstant button mashing will generate muscle fatigue\n\n***EDIT***\n\nI was having a bit of difficulty understanding the bonus points system, so I asked the Dev to explain it a little, here is his response. I'm adding this to the review, because I thought it would be very helpful for people playing the game. I also thought it would be a good way to show that the Dev is actively involved. Cheers!\n\nDEV RESPONSE FOLLOWS:\n\nHere's the basics...\nLeft Click - If you direct hit a target (over the target on fire), you get a laser blast + bonus.\nIf not, you'll get a pulse shot which will auto-target in a certain radius.\n\nRight Click - If you direct hit, you get another laser blast and a larger bonus than w/ left click.\nIn addition, it freezes the target. You can left shoot the target to explode it\nOtherwise it's an energy beam (you can hold this down).\nWith this beam, you can use this beam to \"energize target\".\nEnergized targets are worth more points when shot.\nWhen energized for a second or two, will freeze like on direct hits.\nAfter a couple of second holding, you can release for a \"photon pulse\".\nYou can shoot this pulse for a large explosion and multi-target hit.\nYou can use the right click beam to redirect left click shots.\n\nA few trick shots...\n- Left click shots will stick & act a proximity mines. You can place them strategically.\n- Lots of special shots: bounce/ricochet, quick shots, variety bonus (many bonus types active), detonations, and others.\n\nOther tips...\n- If you feel confident, right clicking for direct hits will get you about ~2x multiplier.\n- You get points and multipliers. score = multiplier * score. So, if you have a high multiplier, any points you get will mean big points.\n- Keeping your streaks going is key to large scores (sounds like you figured this out already). \n- Accuracy is worth a lot, so don't miss (or use the right click beam to turn a miss into a hit). \"Perfect accuracy\" is a streak of direct hits.\n- Perfect sections have a long cool-down. And if during that section, you dont miss or even better don't miss and hit with all direct hits you get modifiers on your perfect sections & they're worth much more.\n- Unlocking the secret words can help keep streaks going. Also, each level has some hidden targets often places to help you keep streaks going. It's possible to make it through every level keeping your streak going the entire time (though this is not at all easy).\n\nThat's the basics :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421462407, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421954798, "recommendationid": "14022956", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529593", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423257581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 52, "steamid": "76561198079462150", "num_games_owned": 86}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "While the game may not be AMAZING, I can say that this is a fun rythym game when you're in a casual mood.

As soon as I opened the game, the lag intantly hit. My cursor had atleast a fourth of a second delay on the basic 720p settings, and you don't even want to hear how bad it is as the resolution was raised. It was sad to force myself into going to the lowest possible setting to actually have on-command instantaneous response because in this game, aiming is a vital utility to have.\nI have the requirements (surpass them quite a bit actually). It would be nice if this was fixed, because a laggy game is not worth 5 dollars (which is the only reason I'm giving this a negative). I've played Unity engine games before, and that seems to be a recurring problem with the program. Maybe something in the script could be affecting the framerate.\nNow, on the other hand, the story and setup of the game are enticing and neat. The music is something that many people can \"rave\" to, and the environments I've played through express a deeper meaning that I intend to explore in time. Until the game is revamped, I'd rather not force myself to play on a low quality setting. I want to fully experience this exciting game in the best quality possible. :)\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421901164, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421901164, "recommendationid": "14106688", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473128", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421793962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 53, "steamid": "76561198024249880", "num_games_owned": 91}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game has the ability to cure depression.
