This game has a lot of loot. Usually I hate games like that, because I end up spending the vast majority of my time comparing stats with minute differences. As a result of that, nothing in those types of games ever feels like a significant upgrade because of the amount of loot saturation. This game has a lot of junk loot, but you end up wanting all of it, because recycling it is one of the main way to get crafting materials. While that sounds like a chore on the face of it, it's basically just two buttons (I should mention, the UI is also nearly perfect). This also means that when you get enough items to craft something, you're doing it because you want it. It's likely going to be a significant upgrade, and not just another component in a seemingly never ending chain of an item recipe.\n\nThe story line so far has also been interesting. I get bits and pieces here and there from journals that have been left behind. I like this mechanic, because I can collect them while exploring and keep them until I get back to my base where I can go through them and read them all. I'm not forced to constantly switch from a exploring/combat mindset to a mindset where I can appreciate the narrative. I really like that aspect of this game.\n\nIt also seems like you can progress through the game at your own pace. I like crafting the absolute best equipment before venturing out, and so far the game's allowed me to do that. I'm only on day 8, though. Maybe I'll die on day 9.\n\nThis is a very good game.

It's atmosperic, there is lots of things to do and understand how things work, and fight monsters occasionaly. The mecanics seems fairly interesting as well. \n\nBut after about 10 hours when you have done basic stuff it gets extremely repetetive. Go out, grind through 6 (six!) floors which has nothing but monsters on each of them (and one/two items you want to look for + recyclable garbage). And while you grind through one location there are even more monsters spawning in the other ones. And in addition one can never finish 6 floors at once, but maybe 2 at best due to various game conditions. A very good idea, but the implementation of middle game is unfortunately too boring with whole formula: open door, run back, shoot dozens of enemies, open next door (repeat for next floor, repeat for next location). \n\nI think the developers should really make the locations more interesting and reduce the number of floors considerably for this to feel fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506608908, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506608908, "recommendationid": "35263210", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501888", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507130275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3335, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 4105, "steamid": "76561198056049121", "num_games_owned": 136}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "The devs ruined their own game with a bad end-level design and a story that disappears halfway through - How stupid is that?\n\nMAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD:\n\nI worked my butt off grinding this game. I grinded and grinded, must have upgraded and researched a million times. Such a tedious chore, but GD I researched every item in this F$*@*#^ game. It was only OCD determination that got me through this game. Long after I had about level 2 chips, there was no longer any story (where it was milkwater to begin with) and really I have no idea how I stuck with this, at any rate. I mean, there was ample opportunity for the devs to hire writers to write lore and stories and diaries and hide them for players to find, like in Fallout and, well, every other game, period, but no, I guess they didn't see the need for lore, or story progression, or character development.\nAnyway, this is how they ruined their own game: After all this grinding, just to get the shuttle off of MARS, they have the character blown up and crashing back on stupid Mars. OK, kind of lame. So you mean the whole game was centered around leaving, when all I had to do was walk over to the airlock and walk outside? WTF? Anyway, after the crash back onto Mars, you will die. Why? Well, because the game lets you launch the shuttle without stressing the importance of that EVA suit. Yes, I know, there is a PDA on the floor with a note about requiring the suit, but my argument is that the game should not even let you launch without the suit. I read the note but thought it didn't apply to me, I am escaping, this is the end-game. IMO allowing the player character to launch EVA-less is more stupid than hiding that research chip inside the candy bag with the red mark. Idiots! I had to Google both problems. You should, as a game player, never have to rage quit and google anything for any reason ever just to simply proceed, and this is the 2nd time I had to stop and google a problem. Come on, now. Unless this is Myst you should not have to Google solutions to a mediocre top-down action game.\nSo here I am, on Mars, full battle suit, oxygen full, therms full, plenty of meds, bandages, yet I die. Again and again, I die. Can I go back to an earlier save? Yes, thankfully I have an autosave of my character in the command center. \nWill I go back in and try to beat this game? Yes, probably eventually, but for now this is a rage-quit. F#(^ you, Subterrain, and f$*& you devs.\n\nIf you love grinding, though, and bad moods and sullen disappointment are your thing, then get this game.
