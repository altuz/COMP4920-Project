I would play it a lot more if there was something, like a final boss on 100 lvl. Or even a world record to beat. Anything really, so I could get a satisfaction of a closure: \"I did it!\".

I find it to be what many call 'cozy' similar to the old Win3.1 game Castle of the Winds. Although this game isn't nearly as complex as that game, despite being much more advanced graphically.\n\nI saw everything it has to offer hours ago and am just trying to go as deep into Lady Tallowmere's dungeons as possible, but I find myself coming back to it when I'm between other games or just momentarily bored with my current PC game. Success is kind of contingent upon the gear you can find, but that's usually the case with games in this bloated genre. \n\nUnlike many other games in its genre, weapons all have different handling dynamics and some impart special powers, like the valuable daggers which allow you to move unseen unless you attack or are touched/damaged and are vital in setting up your approach to taking out groups of monsters. Most of the time I've died I've unintentionally killed myself, and once you know how to handle all the things your game can throw your way, it's really only about optimizing your equipment and keeping strategies in mind. The mechanics are extremely simple but it's easy to understand how they work and if something happens, it's because you messed up. You will blow yourself up with grenades. Be forewarned.\n\nThe one mark against it is that the procedural generation occasionally screws you royally, particularly with placement of buzzsaws, but this is the nature of procedural generation.\n\nYou may want to wait for a sale, but $3.99 isn't all that much for what you get, especially since the game has a sense of humor about itself which I enjoy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505888326, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505888381, "recommendationid": "35078554", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 214, "total_reviews": 226, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 12}}
