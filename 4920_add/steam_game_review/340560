Might recommend, might not. I will git it a thumbs up, because there is some potential in it.\nMultiplayer works ok, but everything in this game is not polished well.\nThe game does not explain all the buttons.\nThe game does not explain all the powers.\nAt one point I couldn't progress, because we had no idea how to destroy a tower in mission 2...\nThis game probably needs half a year to finish and polish...

Not ideal in the intended scenario of couch gaming with my wife.\nSometimes when controller is selected as input method, it still requires actions to be performed with mouse.\nThere are issues with button remapping; the function seems to be there, but doesn't work.\nThe tutorial is infuriatingly slow, with long delays between dialogue lines, actions and transitions. It also doesn't tell you how to play with controller; even with controller selected, the tips and objectives are all given for keyboard controls.\n\nThe game is aiming for cheesy over-the-top humour, and not quite nailing it. The computer voice-over especially is incredibly dull. \n\nWe have decided not to persevere with this one, it isn't worth the effort.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1483774634, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1483774634, "recommendationid": "29080873", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506654", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482819373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 32, "steamid": "76561198067418843", "num_games_owned": 95}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's not really that the game is bad. It's just that it lacks content you'd expect. I feel like there isn't a huge weapon variety or selection. It's basically 'shoot crates for ammo and grenades and capture stuff for bounty'. If you like that concept then this is the game for you, after 30 minutes of play I already fell into that 'boring grind monotony' feeling and it wasn't a game that gave me a smile or that really shocked me. The visuals are relatively nice however the character animations are lackluster. I do like that they offer a tutorial which explained a bit about the controls, however I feel that the tutorial was not specific enough regarding interacting with objects (Which is the E key) and it seems as though the game was made more for a controller than a mouse/keyboard.\n\nIt's still fairly clunky and I think given time the game could improve and be better, I feel like this game is really Early Access content and not so much final release content, the devs could have and should have given it more time before launch. Like I said I do like the concept, but as the game is in its current state I personally wouldn't recommend it to anyone.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1482819732, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1483601090, "recommendationid": "28701026", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508705", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
