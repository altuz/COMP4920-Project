I love TCG and am happy to support any developer brave enough to attempt to make their own. However I can not recomend this game when I can say I am honestly this bored of playing it after twenty minutes. Needs improvement on pretty much every level. I think unfortunately they may have oversimplified the basic mechancs a bit too much in an attempt to target card players.\n\nThe artwork is great and I give them points for trying something a bit different than the MTG, Infinity Wars, Might & Magic, Solforge, or Hex all of which I would recommend for a first time player over this. Even with the learning curve involved players will be rewarded with a deeper appreciation for the strategy and tactical awareness each has to offer. That's something I see missing from this game. I will be checking in hoping for some updates but for now I've got to give it the thumbs down. Points for trying to do something different and putting together a decent UI (not to be understated in how enjoyable a digital tcg experience can be) but overall this is just not quite worth your time or dollars unless your a tcg fanatic such as myself.\n\n2/10 (Early Access Review here's hoping it goes up)\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420321211, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1420321211, "recommendationid": "13816491", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535097", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1470100146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 291, "steamid": "76561198028196914", "num_games_owned": 963}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Hasn't been updated since Feb 2015, DO NOT BUY.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1481432947, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1481432947, "recommendationid": "28302759", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435560640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 79, "steamid": "76561198010895932", "num_games_owned": 182}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I've been playing MTG for 5 years and nothing will ever compare to that so never get your hopes up. This game is trying to stand out on it's own and it does just that. If you've ever played a TCG then you already know how to play this game. So far so good although I just finished the tutorial and checked out deck building. \nGive it a shot, help this game grow into what you want it to be with forum feedback. You will pay less in Alpha now than you will in full later. Already my first trading card is worth $1.00 on the market. Makin' money! I will update this when I play more.\n\nUpdate-ish: Well I played a bit more. So far there are two match variants: deathmatch and horde. Deathmatch is always 4 player unless online. You can attack anyone. \nHorde mode I do not understand. I'm pitted against one other and I can seemingly only use each card once during the fight then nothing happens until I quit the match... It happened twice. I just played Horde again and beat the first guy, then two more A.I. showed up and our health was reset and they killed me eventually. So this appears to be some kind of survival gametype.\n\nThe lack of cards available and card variants so far makes this game kinda stale out of the box but that will change in due time. The cards you can choose from are Creature (oppressive), Witch (defensive), aaand that's it. Now, they do call a card type the \"Hero\", he adds a permanent boost to your playstyle depending on which one you choose like auto-healing every turn, taking one less damage from each attacker, and so on. The cards have a bit of synergy to them but are basically the same across elements (fire, water, air, earth). At one point myself and two A.I. kept healing and attacking and running out of stamina (mana) and this kept on forever until I had to quit because no winner was surfacing. There needs to be more card types similar to enchantments or something so the game can feel more suspenseful rather than predictable. \n\nIn the end I think this game will evolve into a whole system rather than alpha-chunks but for now try it out, give them feedback, and help make a great digital card game.\n\nMonday, June 29th, 2015: Update: No work done on this and it's still stale, not worth it any more, it had promise.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420546182, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1435565183, "recommendationid": "13863094", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497995", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459200447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 800, "steamid": "76561198056324539", "num_games_owned": 478}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I bought this game yesterday.
