At \u00a31.43 you get more content than it's asking price. The game is short, about 6 missions short and took around 1 hour to complete. However if you are looking for a quick fix for the night then this is bang on das kapital. It's just a classic hack and slash game where you can relieve your frustrations on Pigs, Skeletons, Rhinos etc and finally a Minotaur. After the game is completed there is a cut scene explaining that there will be more episodes so maybe the developers are creating more (hopefully free) updates with aditional levels. One problem is that the game essentially becomes allot easier when you realise that all you need to do is chuck ninja stars to win although this did not stop me from having to replay the final boss a few times.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QTEwuYkQco", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420492006, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1420541465, "recommendationid": "13854174", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506656", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429813232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198149805362", "num_games_owned": 70}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "worst game iv ever played", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428011760, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428011760, "recommendationid": "15176053", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504929", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1422855916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23, "steamid": "76561198173314277", "num_games_owned": 11}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's kind of boring.\nEventhough the controls are very simple, it doesn't really go hand in hand with what you want it to do which causes me to die plenty of times in the game, which i do not enjoy.\nIt's got it's sense of humor but for gameplay, I wouldn't recommend it at all for anybody.
