If you're a game snob, or any kind of snob, there is a good chance you will hate this, but you will be missing out.  A lot of people are turned off by RPG maker games or games that aren't bright and shiny.  I've judged based on appearance myself but something about this game intrigued me so I bought it. I'm really glad I did.  It has an insanely original feel.  If you can get over superficialities and are a hardcore fan of RPG's, please give this dude your money.  It feels like the etsy of video games to me.  It's incredibly obvious to me that there was a lot of work and heart put into this game.  The story is true to to the feel of old school RPG's but feels fresh. The music seems to be written and recorded personally.  I'm pretty stoked to hear guitar as opposed to your everyday digital video game music. The art done for the battle scenes scream originality and although it's odd at first to see something like that in an RPG, it's quickly endearing and if i'm being honest, pretty effing adorable.  I'm truly excited to get deeper into the story and discover what's in store. Kudos to the developer. Seriously. Some may speak down on it for seeming crude or using RPG maker.  Don't listen to them.  Not everybody is a coding genius.  This guy took what he had and put all of it and more into a labor of love that seeps originality into a genre that can be quite repetitive and tired.

RPG Maker games tend to get a bad rap, mostly for their low quality and lack of original resources.

And the art and monsters, (Though seeming drawn on MS Paint) are really colourful and well made.\n\nThe music too is all original and quite catchy.\n\nThe game play although at most times is very typical of RPG Maker, there are a few times the game uses it in ways I haven't seen before.\n\nThe game suffers a little in the dialogue at times, but overall the story is very enjoyable.\n\nYou can tell a lot of heart went into the making of this game, and I love that I get to play something I can tell someone else really loved making.
