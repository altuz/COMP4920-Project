Dated. Derivative. Repetitive. Marginally funny for youth\n\nReview: Like so many other ressource management clicker game this one uses the sytem where you have a central HQ and workers run in and out of it as you click on a variety of hotspots around the map. This one is vaguely fantasy themed as you control what looks like frankenstein and some gremlins. Otherwise its the same as the rest. You gather food, wood, gold from hotspots that respawn. You can also use altars which stockpiles a ressource that allows you to trigger buff and prevent debuffs (monsters coming in to steal stuff). The entire game seems to be voice acted, which is great. However the voice acting talent is a little bit underpar. The music loops constantly the the point of driving you mad. The rendering is alright once your eyes adjust to it but it really is on the dated side of thing. Game consists of a bunch of levels where you have to start with food, and start harvesting the other ressources and clear obstacles by spending your initial food stockpile, up until the point where you reach a quota of ressources gathered, power ups used, or buildings completed. You are constantly re-doing the same things over and over again as the game gradually adds more elements to the mix. Its very drawn out. There is a customization shop for you to dress your gremlins and your frankenstein up but it is pointless.\n\nIn the end I found that the Weatherlords game from Alawar had overall greater polish than this title and was superior in every possible way except maybe the humoristic tone so this title is effectively made redundant.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497809382, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505086892, "recommendationid": "32545158", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
