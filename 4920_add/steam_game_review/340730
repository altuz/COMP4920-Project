Lots of time management and lots of grinding.  It often feels like the game is going on and on and given the game follows the metric version of the calendar (which got junked after the French Revolution), it pretty much is a long game.\n\nHowever, I enjoy it because the plot in most of the routes is very intereting and while I cannot honestly say that the character development is top-notch, it's a fun little diversion.  Moreover, I find the game to be more grounded in reality than other visual novel type games in that not every day is full of fun and excitement and advances the plot.  Because like reality, this game forces you go through tedious ass chores as you stress out more and more.  Then every now and then, you can make a little room for your girl.  Makes you appreciate her more.\n\nIf you liked Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, then there are a lot of little jokes and references to find.  By the way, the order of girls in this game is Ava > Sola > Chigara > Asaga.  Asaga is just plain weird.  Skip that one.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506121612, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506121612, "recommendationid": "35139583", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506306522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 346, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 699, "steamid": "76561198096091974", "num_games_owned": 17}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I hate myself, but this is pretty good", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506306550, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506306550, "recommendationid": "35194850", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505739951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1495, "steamid": "76561198104352290", "num_games_owned": 16}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505580998, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505580998, "recommendationid": "35001972", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506052527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1169, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2377, "steamid": "76561198095234437", "num_games_owned": 68}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I would like to preface this negative review by saying that I still liked the game. However, I am a glutton for punishment, and I could not wish such a fate upon another sane human being. The story, writing, and art are all very good. I very much enjoyed the actual visual novel segments even if they were ultimately incredibly shallow and fanservicey. In case you are unaware, this is a purely fanservice spinoff to the main Sunrider series, of which I am a huge fan. \n\nHowever, the bulk of the game's time has you managed various clubs while also trying to earn money and improve your stats. This is known as a stat managment game. And honestly, if the game functioned properly as such, I would have left a positive recommendation. Unfortunately, it does not function as intended. For the first few months, you'll have random encounters with the whole cast of characters, funny dialogue that progresses the (still shallow) plot, and your decisions feel like they matter because your resources are stretched very thin. This all changes once you get to the 4th month out of the 10 in the game. By then you will have earned enough money to buy every single item in the game, removing any kind of progression, and you're left to just mindlessly grind out stats for 6 months while you are drip-fed the rest of the story of whichever girl you chose back at the halfway point. It's not just boring, it's mindless. I was just spam clicking on the screen eventually to get through the meaningless screens in hope of a new portion of the actual visual novel. Oh, and for some reason, the only people who will talk to you after the halfway point are your girlfriend and your little sister. Your sister in particular shows up everywhere for some reason. \n\nFinal thoughts: Very decent visual novel dating sim wrapped in an unsufferably boring stat managment game. Am I glad I played it? Actually yes. I am a huge fan of the Sunrider series and I am very glad that I got to see the Ava route, but even I am going to need some time before I can go back and play another route full of spam clicking. So please only play this game if you absolutely love Ava, Asaga, Chigara, or Sola and need more romance with them. It's truly the only reason to wade through the hours upon hours that this game will suck from your life.\n\nExcept for the sex scenes, those are actually some of the most well-made eroge scenes I've seen in a visual novel.

Literally half of a day. \nConsider it this way:  The average human being lives for approximately 23,000 days  I have wasted 1/2 of those days on this game\n\nLife is short.  Very short.  In fact, ask anyone over the age of 40 and they'll tell you that life feels like it's gone by in the blink of an eye.  Hell, I'm 26 years old.  I'll be 27 in April,  6 months from now I will have officially lived over 33% of my life, and it doesn't really *feel* that way.\n\nThis game is a time vampire.  It possesses no qualities which redeem it,  it doesn't teach you anything, it doesn't improve your real life in any way shape or form,  it's not even really entertaining.  \nTruthfully there's nothing in the way of storyline that sets it apart from anything else, it's a dating sim... and not a good one!\nA good dating sim (I've played a few but their titles elude me right now)  teaches you, via osmosis, real lessons on how to speak with, approach, and deal with the opposite sex.  This game?  It's a resource management game but it's so unrealisitc it serves no real intrinsic purpose beyond being frustrating and a \"challenge\"   the \"Demon's Souls (fuck dark souls) of dating sims.\"\n\nAs I've said,  I've played this game for 12 hours of my finite life and I've managed to make it to the BAD mid point ending, the disappointed little sister.\n\nFor what purpose?  What have I gained?  Nothing.  This game adds zero value to your life.  Even Huniepop trains you to quickly spot patterns, a tool useful for developing and improving logic and logical thinking.\nThis game?  It spits in your face,  it pretends to be a management game,  but there are simply not enough hours in the day,  you will randomly find yourself clicking through a pattern of events. \n\nI can't, in good conscience, recommend this game.  It's just a waifu hunter and a tax on low testosterone.\nPick up a different game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505887594, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505887851, "recommendationid": "35078438", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495890", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505736223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 973, "steamid": "76561198290463672", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "its more like management simulator than date sim", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505548846, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505548846, "recommendationid": "34990539", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490474", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497158487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 121, "steamid": "76561198067158198", "num_games_owned": 154}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "thought i was gonna get a stupid visual novel, got a rng timewaster with progress mostly decided by random events. make the bobbs more seeable 2/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504732250, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504732250, "recommendationid": "34783266", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481179", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 412, "total_reviews": 477, "num_reviews": 7, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 65}}
