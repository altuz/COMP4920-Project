Unlike many similar games, the weapons in the game feel like they are doing some damage which adds to the feel of the game.  Couple this with the fact that the game is often played at a frantic pace and you'll find you have a winner on your hands.\n\nThe reason I am writing this review so early on into playing the game on Steam is I feel the dev deserves a massive thank you for the work they have done ironing out early bugs in the game.  Initially my controls were reversed (as was the case for others), but despite updates sorting out controllers for what felt like everyone else, mine still had the same problem.  Orange Pascal kept working on the issue, despite it seemingly only affecting me, and ultimately got to the bottom of it so I can now play the game with my chosen controller.  I don't think I can recall a case where a dev would work on a game to please one single customer, and if that is not fantastic customer service then I don't know what is!\n\nIn summary, great game, great dev and doesn't cost a lot of money.
