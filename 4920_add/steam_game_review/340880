Secondly, the interface leaves much to be desired; controls don't always work as you might wish (in particular, the space bar sometimes acts as \"pause\" and sometimes acts as \"click\", meaning that for a while, if a popup happens, you may reflexively hit the spacebar and accidentally select whatever the default action is in the popup). Also, there is a fair amount of burrowing down and popping back up through popups, especially when shuffling officers around.\n\nAnd there's a lot of that. This is the primary caveat: thus far, the game feels more like the logistics exercise of deciding who to promote and generally how run the admiralty, rather than the tactics of space combat. In other words, it plays a bit like dinking a spreadsheet. The thing is, I'm enjoying that process; so far, at least, there are enough interesting bells and whistles on the individual officers for me to want to build the perfect crew by proper career guidance. In that way, it reminds me a little of the class XCOM, more than it does of, say, Master of Orion (there is no exploration in this game).\n\nOne particular element that is unusual and highly satisfying to me is the mechanic of actual orbits. The entire battleground is simply the solar system, but there is no instantaneous travel (thus far?), meaning that the location of, say, the Earth relative to Mars or Jupiter matters, and changes over the course of the game. I don't know how realistic it is, but it's novel and adds a feeling of \"reality\" to the game that is often lacking in many similar games.\n\nIn general, the whole thing is lacking a lot of polish. I'm finding it a possible diamond in the rough -- satisfying, at least -- but I suspect that many people won't. Anyway, given that every last one of the reviews currently present is positive, I thought it best to add a note of warning to this. At the very least, buying this game should be done with eyes open.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429485854, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429485854, "recommendationid": "15456729", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544937", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1420852428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 272, "steamid": "76561198129406429", "num_games_owned": 143}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "When I first found out about Solar War, it immediately reminded me of the now obscure early 1990's Japanese series Regional Power by Cosmos Computer. With elements from early-type Romance of The Three Kingdoms and Civilization, the Regional Power games had left me wanting more of the same. So when I came across Solar War, it was with some excitement and trepidation - had I finally found a game I had been wanting to play but that had either not existed or lain undiscovered?\n\n+Unique gameplay\n+Highly moddable\n+/- One-man developer\n-No music & minimal graphics\n-High price\n\nThe best element about it is the unique gameplay. \n\nFirst and foremost is the officer and crew management. \nYou assign officers to ships in one of four designated roles: captain (Leadership), tactical, navigation, or engineering. All officers have stats in those four categories, and are enhanced or adversely affected by the captain's leadership. \nAll the officers have ranks and can be promoted, and their rank enables/disables certain roles. They can also have skills and be awarded, amongst other things.\n\nShips also have a crew, separated into several ranks, that gain experience and can be reassigned.\n\nYou manage relations with the countries on Earth, research technologies, build and outfit ships, bases and colonies, not to mention battling aliens.\n\n\nAnother element that is very well done in Solar War is the moddability of the game.\nIt is accessible and wide in scope - just about everything is available within the xml files.\nYou could add new countries, random officers, unique officers, technologies, or make new scenarios, to name a few things.\n\n \nHowever, for me at least, there came a point when the game rang a little bit hollow and this is probably due to the fact that Solar War is a one-man operation. \n\nFirst off, there is no music whatsoever in the game.\nSecond, the graphics while serviceable in quality are minimal in quantity. For instance, the inclusion of officer portraits and battle scenes would have increased the entertainment factor by many times. \nAnd third, the officers can end up just becoming a bunch of names. There are a lot of them, but they die easily and have no official histories.  \n\n\nTo conclude, Solar War has well-made and unique core gameplay mechanics. \nHowever, it is an almost ascetic experience lacking the luxuries that makes a game what it is.\n\nIf you at all like turn-based strategy and sf, then I recommend it despite the high price just because there really are no other games like it currently for the western market. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421204419, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421204419, "recommendationid": "13977775", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502909", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452216018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1762, "steamid": "76561198038118796", "num_games_owned": 274}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very adictive, much like a cross of X-com and a Stragety, could be optimised with many places that could use automation.

Solar War goes the opposite direction, using fairly minimal graphics while, at the same time, focusing on creating meaningful strategic and tactical decisions. \n\nHere are just a handful of the things that happen in Solar War:\n-Planets orbit at different speeds, so attack paths naturally open and close over time.\n-Sometimes the heat sinks get shot off your ships, and you'll have to decide what systems to keep active, and how long to keep them active for, so that your ship can keep functioning as well as possible without overheating. \n-Who gets the command position: the most competent person, or the person from the nation that contributes a lot of your funding and is thinking of cutting it?\n-There's an enemy ship behind you. You designed your ship with front arc weapons, armor concentrated at the front of the ship, and thrusters optimized for speed rather than maneuverability. Now what?\n\nThe focus here is definitely more on tactics and ship design, with economics more of a consequence of battle outcomes than anything else. The economic game is not trivial by any means; the typical \"build everything everywhere\" strategy of many 4x will not work here, and the officer management and internal Earth politics sometimes require a good bit of thought. But it is in the ship design and the (turn-based, tactical) combat that the game really shines. \n\nNo, it's not flawless. Replayability is limited compared to more heavily randomized games, there's no multiplayer, and there are some cheesy strategies that the opponent has a hard time dealing with. And yes, it does look like what you see in the screenshots-- you can pick from a few things, but the overall appearance is pretty minimal. But, despite its flaws, it manages to be what many modern space strategy fail to be, namely, interesting. \n\nOh, and: if you thought the Antaran fleet in MoO2 was a bit of a letdown as an end-game boss fight, try taking down Solar War's alien mothership in direct combat.

In the game, you will lead the effort to protect Earth from the aliens and battle them for control over the Solar System.\"\n\nThis actually sums it up pretty well. You play as the leader of earth's defenses, and your mission is to take over from where the Xcom boys left off.\n\nSome good combinations of ideas here. The majority of the game takes place in a quasi-4X style strategic map that actually reminds me a lot more of Xenonauts or the older version of X-Com's  strategic map than an actual 4X game.  You have to get Earth's nations to provide you funding by meeting their needs (the U.S. likes you to be on the offensive all the time, Japan likes research, some nations only care if you put their officers in charge of ships, etc.), as well as building ships and defenses.\n\nFighting in done in the style of Master of Orion 2 (turn based, with a great deal of control over ship movement and weapons firing order), which is great, and also makes thinking about your ship and fleet designs important. It's a little management heavy initially (not so much once you get things set up), but that's something I kind of expect from games that play like this, so it's not much of a negative.\n\nAs everyone else has said, there aren't really any graphics, and there is no sound at present. I personally think the graphics fit the theme really well (you're a general looking at a map), though having different graphics for the ships would be nice - I don't mind the basic-ness of the display because it fits the game, but if you're going to have actual ships instead of representative radar dots, then there should be a bit of difference between how they look. I didn't really mind the lack of sound either because I usually play with it off unless required anyway - it's not exactly a demanding game on your system, and you can always play music in the background if you need some.\n\nThere's a few little menu things lacking (don't pay too much attention to what you find on youtube though, the UI has been made a bit friendlier since then), and a the tutorial just kind of drops off after giving the most basic of rundowns (though you can look most stuff up on the in game manual), but it's not really that hard of a game to get into from a 4X standpoint, or from a turn based tactical point of view either. It IS rather slow paced (I think, anyway. I feel like I'm perhaps not understanding the pacing properly), but that's not really a bad thing for this game and doesn't ruin the enjoyment.\n\nAll and all, it's probably the best 4X-lite tactical game I've played (maybe the only one). Only thing I'd really caution prospective buyers about is that this does not support all intel graphics setups - it is right there in the system requirements, but not something I noticed, and for the price, it's worth mentioning. That said, it's working fine on my intel laptop, but you may want to go try a demo or something to be sure before you buy,\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429591850, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429591850, "recommendationid": "15472527", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502572", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449485328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2229, "steamid": "76561198041136706", "num_games_owned": 453}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Unpolished, quite short, but very interesting concept.

At this time, the tactical game is more or less shooting at eachother and coming closer to eachother. The only real tactical part of it is that you can choose which weapon you fire at which enemy.
