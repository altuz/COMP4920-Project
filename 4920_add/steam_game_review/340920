Just started playing but so far enjoying this game. Seems like the dev put a lot of work into this.\n\n           Edit: Just a few hours into the first campaign, or as we turtle's call it \"The War of Owl Aggression\". The owl horde is advancing quickly into turtle territory. We recruited armored grunts for our front line backed up by herbalists, slingers and hunters. Research is slow as we've put most of our lumber, stone and iron resources into troops and housing. Our lone hero is now level 3, and his army is whooping owl ash. Turtle peasants worked hard to build a citadel in the heart of enemy territory, but now a huge owl army lead by an insidious enemy hero is marching towards it. We built several watchtowers at our enclave to aid in the fight in case our last stronghold is attacked. \n             It's Christmas time, and although every turtle's heart is gripped with fear at the sound of winged death flying overhead, the peasants still have the heart to decorate the enclave in festive lights. The Chief Thane has decreed that some of the cucumber crops that have fed us through the hard winter must be uprooted in favor of watermelon, to aid us in battle. We huddle close in the barracks, as we hear the horn blow, signaling the order to march.\n            We meet the enemy on the field of battle. We can see the bloodlust on the beaks of our enemies. What can turtle's do against such hate? With a roar of vengeance in our hearts, and for our families, our ancestors, we advance into the fray. The demon owl's wings flap against our shells, and their claws scratch our faces as our front line grunts deploy a pikewall to try and stop their furious charge. Our slingers and hunters unleash a barrage of ranged death at our foes. The battle rages on, until both sides fall exhausted on the battlefield, neither gaining ground. We look to our leader, our hero. We've fought valiantly, and suffered casualties. Surely a tactical retreat is in order? CHARGE!!!!!!! He commands. Like madturtle's, we scream \"FREEDOM\" as we waddle towards our enemies, mad with fury. The owls fight back, only to give ground and finally flap for safety as we drive them from the field. The day is our's. \n\nAll for less than 5$.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423888401, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423955117, "recommendationid": "14457635", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520084", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423893449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 109, "steamid": "76561198133864071", "num_games_owned": 77}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game was boring. The enclave design wasn't bad, and the building/resource system worked reasonably well, but the battles were just SOOOO uninteresting. Would have been better to just make combat purely turn-based to let the player move through them at their own pace than bog the whole system down with the attempt at forcing real time controls.
