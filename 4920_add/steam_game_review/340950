Your trees must provide cover for mushrooms on the ground, while at the same time avoid blocking sunlight for all the flowers. It's aimed predominantly for children and adults to play together. Problem is that there really isn't much on offer here and you will probably be bored with it within an hour or so. This isn't to say it isn't enjoyable to play, it is, but there isn't really anything challenging here.\n\nThe hand painted art is very stylish and the sounds of children laughing and the gorgeous accompanying music will often inspire a smile. There is a number of animated birds and butterflies which also help you become at peace as they brighten up your tree and make it come to life with all their fluttering\u2019s and noises.\n\n34 levels, but they all follow practically the same principle, after you have done the first couple you can literally jump to the last level and pass it easily. You will then be given a key to open a door and credits roll, the end. This game is like another one I have played and if you enjoy this, then you would definitely enjoy 'Reach for the Sun' also available on Steam but has a bit more to offer in the way of a challenge than it does content. Because of the lack of playability on offer here I would honestly recommend to wait for a sale. Normal price seems way overpriced simply on the basis that there are a LOT of better games on offer that go rather cheap on Steam.\n\nTips for developer...\n* You like to make informative games (your web page says) but there isn't anything informative here other than flowers like sunlight and mushrooms like shade. Maybe add a section where you unlock an information card with each tree you successfully grow as it would encourage the gamers to try each tree.\n* Steam achievements would be a plus even for an easy game like this.\n* It would have been interesting if the tree had to attend to the wildlife as well. Rebuild nests. Feed. Water.\n* Seasonal mechanics would have been an interesting way to teach children as well such as rain, snow, and intense heat, autumn.\n* Trading Cards, would really like some backgrounds for my steam profile of this game as the pictures are so relaxing to look at.\n\nIn final a game all about making a connection, but due to its simplicity you may wish for a summer sale...\n\nBelow is me playing the game first few levels, then showing you the last one...\nhttps://youtu.be/wJJCvwC3WBg\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485396256, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485396256, "recommendationid": "29493714", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513910", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447369921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 232, "steamid": "76561198170373046", "num_games_owned": 76}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's definitely relaxing, and is exactly as it seems from its sale page.

It was a cute game, but I look forward to updates that make the purchase a bit more worthwhile as the developers continue to improve the game version. \n\nSome suggestions may be to allow players to place flowers along with the branches, more levels, the ability to rotate pieces for less restrictive placements, perhaps levels with clouds (providing areas with natural shadow to work around), and maybe a wider range of creatures like squirrels, bats, spiderwebs, or even exotic themes with a whole different cast of animals, flowers and tree types.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423897411, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423897411, "recommendationid": "14458904", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466617", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440780677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 31, "steamid": "76561198011489303", "num_games_owned": 247}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I love indie games, I really do.

This is definitely something that you will pick up again and while away time with once completed.\n\nThe placing of tree branches works well, and despite my best efforts to the contrary, the devs have done an excellent job enabling you to end up with something that does look like a tree.\n\nThe animals do a really nice job making the scene really alive, and the sound effects work well, even the butterfiles, which have the sound of laughing children.\n\nThere are one or two minor annoyances with the music.  The background music is short loops of tracks, and some of them don't loop too well.  While the soundtrack is not too bad, it definitely gets a bit annoying after a time.  The music is simple versions of well known songs, so is not too much of an issue to lose.\n\nIf you are looking for something different, to while away some time, something that will engage your brain, and senses, without putting too much strain on the grey matter, pick this up.\n\n8/10\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435976627, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435976627, "recommendationid": "16870892", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466289925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 114, "steamid": "76561198025802559", "num_games_owned": 1448}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Does this makes any sense?
