I'm-a enjoying & loving it a lot too!\n\nIt got so much of your favorite songs or maybe the songs that you will love much. But the VVVVVV music (in this game) will really give you the great feelings of dancing to the video game music remixes assuming that you enjoyed the Nintendo games.\n\nI always play on the hardest difficulty however I go one difficulty down if I can't get past the first half of each song but I'm not ever playing on novice or easy because I'm too good for those difficulties and it can also weaken my skills for this game.\n\nWith the Steam Workshop support, we won't even have to lose our Stepmania songs by accident since it will be similar to Garry's Mod and Source Filmmaker where you create your own contents and upload to the Steam Workshop instead of putting in a file storage for others to download. I'm happily tuned for that. Even everybody should make charts of video game music remixes too (for Steam Workshop though)!\n\nI may need a dance pad for this game too because real girls are good at Dance Dance Revolution and other games that inspires it and 40+ year old men aren't. Even the Touhou vocals can really help out even more!\n\nIt should even be on Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Wii U too unless it can't go on home gaming systems which will be too bad.\n\nThis game is really great, it's again the best Stepmania-inspired official game on Steam ever. If you love rhythm games, you should actually buy & enjoy this game. I do.\n\nNeppu neppu!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497725596, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1497726165, "recommendationid": "32514389", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 17, "total_reviews": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
