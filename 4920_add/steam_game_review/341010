First off, the enemies attacks are impossible to avoid, and instead boil down to \"attack, run away until their attack is done, then attack,\" rinse and repeat. If you get trapped between 3 of these enemies you are pretty much screwed. The shooting 'recoil' feels very awkward and hinder my shots aim, thus making the main shooting mechanic frustrating. The controller feels awkward on an Xbox 360 controller (should allow customized controls, D-pad for movement and anologue stick to shoot definitely doesnt feel very good.) I love the music a lot, although I do wish there was more variation (more tracks.) I also feel like this game would do very well with hidden areas and secrets.\n\nSo, as it stands I do not currently recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438584491, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1438584491, "recommendationid": "17362477", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523500", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472154426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 26, "steamid": "76561198322622376", "num_games_owned": 31}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "==Pluck Feedback==\n-The sin-wave on the title screen logo looks a bit goofy. I like to reserve sin-waviness for stuff like collectables. Seeing the logo move back and forth kind of deprives it of any sense of weight / epicness.\n-You might prefer \u201cPress Start\u201d to \u201cPress Key\u201d. The former is a general convention that means \u201cPress anything\u201d. The latter confused me, when all I had in my hand was an xbox controller. \n-Gotta have analog stick support for traversing menus.\n-The menu selection cursor moves vertically, then appears to update its position horizontally on the following frame. It gives me a bit of a headache, and looks jarring.\n-Toggling to fullscreen softlocked my game. I can\u2019t see anything anymore, but I can hear my cursor moving back and forth.\n-The deadzone on the thumbsticks is non-existant, which is really unfortunate. Most xbox controllers experience some amount of thumbstick drift as they get older, so deadzones are a necessity. As soon as I began the game. I my character was already shooting!\n-The help menu told me I could move with the thumbstick, but apparently we\u2019re stuck with dpad movement. Dpads aren\u2019t great for this kind of thing.\n-I really wish the music changed going from the title screen to the gameplay. It feels a bit cheap, and by the time the player enters gameplay, they\u2019ve already been exposed to the same music loop for some time, which sours them on it.\n-Notice that, if you shoot in the direction you\u2019re running, the bullets actually start behind the player (visible via their tail), and they don\u2019t travel as far in front of the player. You should add the velocity of the player to the velocity of the bullet at the time the bullet it spawned. This should make it feel a bit better to shoot.\n-The \u201cwall-fall\u201d effect is very pretty!\n-The little ball of magic that the player avatar holds switches sides depending on where the analog stick is, but this can look really jarring when I\u2019m aiming up or down. When I\u2019m aiming straight northward, the ball freaks out, moving from side to side quickly.\n-Hopping animation is cute, and an efficient way of animating.\n-The game has a framerate hitch ever second or so. This isn\u2019t game breaking, but it makes the game\u2019s movement feel a bit choppy.\n-Destroying crates is fun, and could use just a bit more juice. Maybe a slight bit of screen shake?\n-Hits on enemies is indicated by a soundeffect, but not a great deal else it seems. You might experiment with making the enemies flash, or using some other aesthetic indicator of pain.\n-I tend to die alot, and very suddenly. It\u2019s usually a nasty surprise, because it\u2019d somewhat difficult to know your health in this game. When people are looking at the center of the screen (because that\u2019s where all the action is), they\u2019re not looking at the bottom of the screen (where the health bar is). Find a way to show the player\u2019s health at the center of the screen, so players don\u2019t have to divert their eyes from combat to get that information.\n-The dash mechanic has potential, but it doesn\u2019t get you very far. I would really like some Smash-Bros-Style Pikachu functionality, where you can chain dashes to go around corners, dive around attacks, etc.\n-Please consider zooming the camera in a bit. The sprites are pretty tiny, and there\u2019s really no need for the player to be able to see into 9 rooms at any given time.\n-I want to love coins, but I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re for yet.\n\nThe game has a number of accessibility issues, and combat isn\u2019t particularly satisfying, but there are some real elements of polish here, and I like the concept for some of the attacks (the swords are pretty nifty).
