Your tiny range forces you to overwhelmingly rely on the downstab and upstab attacks because they last for more than a tenth of a second, unlike anything else you can do. Having such a tiny range could be less of an issue if it wasn't so easy to get inside an enemy's hitbox and then you take contact damage, forcing you to re-engage.\n\nMost enemies that have some capability for defense you need to wait for a time where they're vulnerable - which may take a while - and on some of them this vulnerability isn't just so that you can damage them, it's so you can damage them without getting damaged, because sometimes you'll kill an enemy and in the process go through it and hit a trail of fire it left before it died. Some enemies are simply placed in such a way that if you get unlucky there's nothing you can do - such as a spike thrower enemy that will shoot roughly a dozen spikes at you in a hallway and you can only block low spikes and the hallway is not tall enough for you to avoid the other spikes so you either just get hit or try to hide somewhere and wait for it to end and hope you can get to the enemy before it begins.\n\nI feel like the idea that's tried to be passed with the horrendous combat is that the player character is no fighter - which I'm fine with, it makes sense - and this is reinforced by the fact that other than bosses, very few enemies actually have to be defeated and doing so will barely reward you, if at all. This doesn't explain problems such as getting stuck inside big enemies and other clunkiness issues.\n\nThe music password system may be good in concept, but running around dungeons to get passwords to open doors gets boring, fast; if you have a walkthrough, you can just skip them, at least.\n\nYou eventually get a wall jump powerup - it behaves oddly with the previous double jump powerup in that you can't double jump after you touch a wall and sometimes you'll jump directly at a wall to try and slide on it and you'll instead do a double jump. Also, you can't attack immediately after a double jump, which takes some time getting used to, as there's a lot of sections where it feels like you have to attack at the apex of a double jump only to be reminded that, no, you can't.\n\nI'm pretty sure the game didn't have a map when I first started playing, but I gave up for several months before coming back and now it has a map, so at least it's a bit easier to not get lost.\n\nAlso, during the final boss? You can't deal damage to it without taking damage afterwards. It's not a bug.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504375251, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504378554, "recommendationid": "34691561", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502221198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 23, "steamid": "76561198019134425", "num_games_owned": 363}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Sadly, one of the most disappointing games I've ever tried to play.\n\nIt's a disgrace to the whole Metroidvania genre: you roam around pointlessly doing nothing.\n\nThere are almost no enemies, those few are a joke, you immediately get lost into mazes of doors, areas are very small and uninteresting, jumping from one platform to another is a pain, and attacks slow you down.\n\nBefore creating a Metroidvania game, you should really play Symphony of the Night and learn from it. If the authors tried to do it, they failed badly.\n\nI'm very sorry to write such a harsh review, but unfortunately the game did everything in its power to earn it.\n\n(yes, later in the game I expect there will be enemies to fight\u2026\u00a0sure\u2026 but I quite long before that.
