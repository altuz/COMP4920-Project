While this game isn't too in-depth I feel this is a positive point. We focus on conquering the world and not spending an hour on every battle. It is like playing a Total War game auto-resolving every battle and not having to build anything. As for those people that say you can't do anything but one turn a year, I say move your darn armies fools. My armies move every turn four times a year. At the start of every year I am buying more armies. Once the game gets going a bit I have two or three armies going conquering the world. Navies are purchasable too and will attack with your troops in certain instances as well as fighting other navies. I usually use them for dropping off troops on other continents and when not doing that bolstering the defenses of my homeland. Recruiting is done at two provinces of your starting areas so defending these are crucial. I enjoyed this game for what it is and it is fun and not impossible to get all the achievements in a reasonable time.

Every year you have some income and  can build more armies and ships. And that's it - every turn equals three months, and so you give move orders to the armies, and build more of them. \n\nIt's kinda like the classic \"WAR\" board game. Armies are stones, build more, throw them at the enemy, next turn, rinse and repeat. However much simpler. Actually, there is pratically nothing to do in the game besides building more armies (which in the game are mere numbers, say, 15 armies, 73 armies), and moving them around. \n\nThe sad thing is that this isn't all too bad if there were at least something more, like say cards, events, some province management, but ... no.
