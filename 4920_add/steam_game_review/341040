It's like \"RISK the Boardgame, Superdeluxe Edition\" or something like this. This is NOT a big wargame and anyone who expects something deep like Gary Gigsby or the likes will be severly dissapointed.\n\nThe game plays very slow, each turn is in phases and because theres a (quick) animation between the phases the overall pace drops severely. This is added by the battles being in phases as well, also with both popups and watching the 10-sided dice go. A single battle doesnt take too long, but since you don't have any input, and there may be quite some battles per turn, this can drag on. The battles are actually quite weak I think, they look cool, kind of reminds me of \"Victory and Glory Napoleon\" or what it was called, but you have, besides maybe putting a card down in the beginning, not really any influence.\nNow not having any influence might be OK, there's many games where you dont, but if I don't, I'd like the battles to speed up, because in Normandy for example, you might have 5 battles in a row with no input from your side whatsoever, each taking it's sweet time to role the dice and give you many many unnecessary popups.\nThis get's annoying over time, but for me personally, not a dealbraker. Do keep in mind that when you sit down to play this you really want a drink or something because you'll spend quite some time not giving any orders and just waiting and clicking away textboxes.\n\nThe game had a pretty rough start with a broken Scenario (Hastings), BUT I dont feel like this is representative of the overall quality of the game. When the first thing that happened was the game crashing multiple times I was shocked, but now that I played the other scenarios, I did not encounter more bugs and feel like the QA did a decent job, yes they missed a HUGE one, but **** happens, right? Also: The Devs were very quick in the Forum to respond to both bugs, Ideas and critique, so I feel that should be mentioned here.\n\nAlso: The pricing policy of the game changed right after release, and as someone who bought the \"classic edition\" because I wanted the smaller maps (It used to be that both packs only give 3 scenarios), I now feel kind of cheated, because the Expanded Edition now has all the scenarios of Classic + the other three for just 4 Euros more - while these would cost me 30 Euros in DLC! Now I know I shouldn't complain, just because someone got something for free... but still...\nAlso, I think even after the price changes the DLC are way too pricy. 10 Euro is enough for a decent game, asking this much for what is basically just a map is too much I feel.\n\nBut enough of my whining, to summarize, I think it's fun and depending on your personal value of money the game might be worth it.\n\nSo TLDR: I would probably get it again, I'd buy the Extended Edition now that you get so much more for the 4 Bucks (5 when the sale ends), but actually right now I would wait a tad, the developer mentioned a \"complete pack\" coming soon and depending on the price of that, it might be worth it since the single DLC are so increadibly expensive....\n\nHope this helps! :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493990491, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497050903, "recommendationid": "31558942", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550788", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493952668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561197997127377", "num_games_owned": 525}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 55, "comment_count": "5", "review": "I was super excited for this to come out, but the pricing model is just awful. $99 for everything is to much in my option for this game.\n\n\nSome of the scerseiros are basiclly copy and pasted, its not worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493952871, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493952871, "recommendationid": "31551791", "language": "english", "votes_down": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574953", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494618428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 70, "steamid": "76561197986639926", "num_games_owned": 543}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": "8", "review": "While the concept of having one game that can simulate essentially all conflicts troughout our history seems like an appealing concept at first sight, it also very much brings down the game-mechanics to a very low form of simplicity due to the sheer scope of it all.\n\nThe gameplay consists of turnbased movement and dicerolls during combat, certainly inspired by board-games. With serveral different useless phases for each side, where one has to spam next turn to progress the game. The complete lack of any sort of campaign is also dissapointing.\n\nBut in the end, the real problem is the great number of DLC's that came along with the very launch of the game. Most scenarios avaialble from the start appears to be rather short and contained with the above mentioned lack of deeper gameplay mechanics. So straight of the bat, the developers seemingly realise the lack of content and proceeds to ship out one hour long scenarios at 5 to 10 bucks left and right at launch. All of them combined going at a total of 84 euros just a week after launch. \n\nUnless it's on sale and you're really into boardgames with very simplistic mechanics, I would not recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494696501, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494712096, "recommendationid": "31729275", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534295", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505608433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 992, "steamid": "76561198190102646", "num_games_owned": 169}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really want to like this game. It has great graphics and some really good game concepts. I like the use of cards in this game. Unfortunately, the AI is one of the dumbest I've ever encountered. I attack one of its stacks with a much larger one of my own and easily defeat it, forcing it to take losses and retreat. On its next turn it will attack my same superior stack with its same depleted stack in what can only be described as a suicidal death wish. This occurs regularly no matter what difficulty level you play on. Also, the AI just stinks when its in an offensive role (e.g., Germans in the Battle of the Bulge). It just moves its stacks around, back and forth, without going after any strategic objectives, even when it has superiority.  There's some real potential to the game, but it hasn't been realized.
