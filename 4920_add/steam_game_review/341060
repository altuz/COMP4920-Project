Still regret wasting that on this. \nLet me start this review by disproving all of the \"features\" listed on the steam page\n\nFeatures (directly from steam page)\n\n\"The most unique Female Protagonist to ever appear in a video game\"\nThis is wrong for so many reasons. I will list two of them. All the Lady is is a sprite that looks like a zombie and doesn't exist from the waist down.  We get absolutely no character development from her at all. There is no reason to root for her because we know nothing about her, AT ALL. \n\n\"Five unique levels each with their own play style\"\nYeah thats a lie. all you do is walk back and forth occasionally stop for falling glass and maybe shoot a thing. At some point a door appears and you go to the next stage. Rinse and repeat with only slight variations to each level.\n\n\"Retro difficulty\"\nNo. Just No. If by \"Retro difficulty\" you mean the game has no checkpoints, and closes the games window if you die three times then yes it is \"retro difficult. (It's not).\n\n\"No tutorials, no hand holding\"\nThis should not be a selling point. I know that some games get out of hand with tutorials but a little bit of help would have been much appreciated. EXAMPLE: the first time I played this game I walked back and forth and a \"door\" appeared. Well because it looks like a bar of static and nothing at all like a door I had no idea that it was a door. So I kept walking until it rained glass on every inch of the screen to insure I died. Now, would it have been \"handholding\" if you put a fucking label on the first static bar that said \"door\"?\n\n\"Puzzle exploration\"\nThis is such a lie that whoever wrote it should kill themselves. As previously mentioned all you do is walk back and forth and wait for a door to appear. There are no puzzles and no exploration. \n\n\"A story that will make you ask questions about \"The Lady\" and about yourself\"\nTo be fair this is true. I did ask questions about the Lady and myself. I asked: What the fuck is happening in this game? And: Why the hell am I still playing this garbage. There is no story. You are dropped into the game and crazy shit happens. I think that it is supposed to represent mental illness or something but I wouldn't have know that if I didn't read the Steam page. I learn more about the story from the Steam page than the actual game. If you ask me, that is a problem.\n\nAnother thing to mention is the game talks about its Noisecore soundtrack as a plus. I would not qualify this \"soundtrack\" as neither music nor good. It's essentially static that just goes on and on and gets irratating really fast. I would have prefered some real music that fit the atmosphere of the game not this shit. I could record the noise between radio stations and call it music, but that doesn't make it music. \n\n Do not buy this game even if it is on sale, Not worth a dime.\n\n2/10 Shit.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499480675, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499480675, "recommendationid": "33360718", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517099", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498332620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 75, "steamid": "76561198084598828", "num_games_owned": 95}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "For how cheap the game is I don't understand why people are giving it so much hate...people will spend upwards of 20-25 dollars for a walking simulator horror game, why is this instance any different?
