Weak real life punches and unbelieveable actors don't hide the QTE even driven game. For a student film, it's alright, but for a 5 dollar game on steam, it just doesn't come up to snuff. \n\nAlso, it's 2014.

As difficulty increases, so does the time you've got to press the correct button (sequence) become shorter.\nIf you do it right, well, then you get to see the according video sequence.\nNot much to it, but if you like old skool action movies. Then this might be just the thing for you.\n\nI like it a lot, because the developers found a way to keep the game interesting control wise and created some nice HD videos to accompany the different fighting techniques.\n\nDon't expect to see Bruce lee or Chuck Norris in this game, because it's made with a limited budget. (Which can be seen)\nBut, the budget has been put to good use, since the overall quality is more than adequete.\n\nI recommend this game. Even if it's just to see a future release including samurai, ninja and jedi knight or something.
