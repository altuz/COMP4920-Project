The elements on your way will interact depending the actual color you have. simple isn't it ?\nWhat makes the whole thing interesting is the succession of the differents patterns that asks you to be very focus on your color switch. It may be frustrating in the beginning, especially when it feels like the pattern is unfair to you (looking at you rotating pieces), but in the end it's very enoyable to successfully chain the different obstacles you failed at before. Speaking of failure : you will fail a lot. Nexus is demanding a lot of reflex and skills, maybe a bit too much in the higher difficulties. But the pain of failure is quickly gone thanks to the fact you can restart almost instantly, and so you find yourself starting over and over again to beat that 3 seconds record you just made.\n\nThe Collect mode helps to re-new a bit the experience of the game (some will find it more interesting).\nBut the core mode seems to be the Co op mode wich split the ship in two pieces (the two colors/ players) that can fuse into one, when this happens both players can move the ship around and it asks some serious coordination sometimes wich lead to a fun experience when you can't seem to play exactly together. The color modealso give more meaning to the color system.\n\nVisually great, nexus also shines thanks to the soundtrack with the electro style that fits perfectly with the general theme of the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425008559, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425008559, "recommendationid": "14670922", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516428", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493509341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2384, "steamid": "76561198012554138", "num_games_owned": 170}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fast-paced neon arcade game which is extremely addictive, has very fluent and simple yet unique gameplay and you can choose your 2 favorite colors (in my case it is yellow and lightblue).

Hope it gets online at one point.\nThis game is very challenging, I've been playing for quite a few hours and I haven't unlocked much of the content... Feels good to actually feel like you're actually beating the game. It can get really crazy at times, the feeling of speed is great.\nControls are fluid, I fond them a little stiff until I found out you could change the sensibility of movements. Actually, there's a nice amount of customizable content, from the ship to the colors used for the force fields, the music played, controls... It really feels like the game is giving you enough tools so that you can face it fairly.\nGood addition to my library, would struggle again.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425322443, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425322443, "recommendationid": "14727697", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500658", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430418104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 325, "playtime_forever": 134, "steamid": "76561198016432675", "num_games_owned": 834}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "4", "review": "There's a solid concept here, and some alright gameplay, but lack of variety for the runner doesn't justify the $10.00 price tag. It's Ikuraga if it met the runner, and while that looks good at first, it wears off quickly as you continue to play it. Controls are fine, but the environment it spawns you in can be too restrictive at times, as you feel like you've got no room to react and run into a wall. You have to put 2 and 2 together after the tutorial regarding the walls and dashing through them, and honestly it's just a game that couldn't keep the interest.\n\nIt's a game to get on the cheap, but Other then that, it's a pass.\n\nFor More Information and First Impressions: http://youtu.be/XtGFK5OoHy0", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424977498, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424977498, "recommendationid": "14665554", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498329", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451138691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198004469267", "num_games_owned": 248}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Has the tags \"Co-op\" and \"Local Co-op\" in the description, but there is no online co-op available.\nBorderline fraud.
