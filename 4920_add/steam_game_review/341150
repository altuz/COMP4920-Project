Over 8 years on Steam and 18+ years playing this type of game, I've never been inspired to write a review until now. I'm a huge fan of turn-based strategy, rpg's, adventure, and fantasy work so this seemed right up my alley. Such a great concept, unique mechanics.. I really liked it in so many regards, but they totally ruined it on a few different fronts.\n\n1. The actual software ran abysmally on my computer. If you played more than 5-6 battles in a row the game would get so laggy that it wouldn't be able to scroll or respond to commands until you waited 30-90 seconds or just restarted. Second, clicking in one place often gave a different result then when you clicked there previously, wtf? Finally and perhaps worst: there are mouse-over tips and explanations, that only activate every 8th-10th time you try and you have to hold your mouse *perfectly* in the right pixel point over the button/tooltip. You no joke spend 10% of your time in this game trying to read this really crucial gameplay info and if you're one pixel off, you lose it. \n\n2. Writing. wow. I feel like they put some \"work\" into this (which is generally a good thing) but they bombed pretty hard. I've never actually seen something so neck-bearded-fedorah-wearing, cringey, and intent on sending a message of \"women are evil and i've been broken up with in an unfair way\" that it actually bled into the storyline. It's really kind of shocking. I'm a pretty center of the road dude and this is one of those times where I realized that this is what they mean when they say that there are toxic cultural messages in computer games. Just stop it, it's making everyone uncomfortable. Ask a female friend what's up if you really don't get it.\n\n3. Difficulty levels. This one's a minor faux pas in that grand scheme but it mattered to me. There are 4 difficulty levels. Novice, intermediate, accomplished, impossible (paraphrasing). I started out intermediate (the recommended setting for all skill-levels, apparently) my first run and played through the whole campaign no problems. Second campaign I feel like I've got it down and try the accomplished setting. I've played through and restarted going on 12 times now and still haven't played through. I know some folks desire this, but for me I want to sort of step up in difficulty to learn more, not just run straight into a wall.\n\n4. Attention to detail. There's some really annoying stuff here. Misspelled words, obviously bad grammar (their =/= they're). Either hire a college undergrad to proofread your copy for $50 or spend a little more time on it.
