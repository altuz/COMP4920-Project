The story and writting and VO is some of the cheesiest absurdity Ive seen in a long time, which I can appreciate. It certainly is not taking itself seriously at all. You can beat the story mode in about an hour, then replay any of the enemies in Heroes Mode. Its not an amazing game, but its worth picking up for a few bucks on sale. Overall, Steam Heroes is a compitent match 3 game with a fun theme and some interesting ideas.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442747485, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442747485, "recommendationid": "18115319", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492161", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471675265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 308, "steamid": "76561198263047938", "num_games_owned": 474}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "great", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1471702707, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1471702707, "recommendationid": "25033334", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477638", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465797999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23, "steamid": "76561198020743803", "num_games_owned": 59}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Meh... hardly interesting, but then does this thing even save your progress?", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466813695, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1466813695, "recommendationid": "23774017", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
