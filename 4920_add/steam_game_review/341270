I wan't to believe in miracle and cheap AAA games, but those doesn't exists.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477614984, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1477614984, "recommendationid": "26253926", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508512", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467822997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198068759000", "num_games_owned": 468}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This game in seems to have a large amount of potential. However at this point, it doesn't even feel playable. \n\nWhat I mean by this is that you only have sandbox mode, can't edit your characters appearance or use skills. However, those are the good things as they clearly show that these are edits to be placed into the game soon. \n\nWhat makes this unplayable is the fact that once you start the game you fall into the world there and there is some animals, berries, ores, trees and water. You have a shovel equipt and the game only tells you how to pick berries and travel (once you get all the way to one side of the world). In other words, you get no explanation for how to equip items or what to do with the many animals in the area. Honestly, I don't even know what I was supposed to do with the berries or anything I dug up.\n\nDigging is a hard task in itself as your character is a giant compared to the amount you can dig at one time. So they'll need alot of space to walk to anything you dug out or to climb up. Also, some of the objects to dig them out you need something your not provided. While I didn't play for very long I wasn't shown anything more than the same basic things in about 3 worlds and I definitely wasn't going to try digging again after the pain it proved the first time.\n\nTo add onto this the controls are notoriously bad as to do actions you need to use the mouse. But in order to jump or move to a new area you need to use either the space or E key and the arrow keys at the same time. This has the player constantly switching hand positions and feels extremely uncomfortable. \n\nWhile I do believe the game has potential it doesn't even feel like it can be called a game at this point let alone be on steam. Might be best to wait for a bit more progress in the game before grabbing it up but definitely worth a follow.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467824046, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1467824046, "recommendationid": "24138116", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510464", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458864924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198045266609", "num_games_owned": 116}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "5", "review": "I didn't play long due to a rare glitch in the game that cause me to start without the spade and axe, making me unable to do anything. After finally getting it to start with the spade and axe I was actually able to do something. From what I did experience in the game I will say this: The game just felt a little rough and bland, but with the game being early access that is to be expected. I have changed my review to recommended because I realize it may be a different experience for some one else. I am going to keep up with the game and hopefully in the future try it out again, but I will say try out the game if you think it may be fun for you, if you don't wanna try it out right now wait for some further updates and keep up with it like i've decided to do.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458882507, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1459336162, "recommendationid": "22036038", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496328", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502805609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 237, "steamid": "76561198065010584", "num_games_owned": 48}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "love the game cant wait for next update, keep up the good work :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458587263, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1458587263, "recommendationid": "21968968", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487044", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458327827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561197986119673", "num_games_owned": 156}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Off to a great start!
