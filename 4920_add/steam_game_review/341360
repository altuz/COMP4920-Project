Play it with your friend(s) if they're with you. If you're of drinking age try playing when you're drunk or very tipsy for a REAL challenge! You'll be shouting obscenities and slamming your mouse before you know it. The AI provides a decent challenge, so play it if you're bored and want to kill a little time. While the absence of online multiplayer is likely to be a turn-off for most gamers with a competitive streak, I believe this game's quasi single-player/co-op style of gameplay falls nicely alongside other similar niche' titles like Brothers and Never Alone. At the end of the day $5 is a real steal, SO BUY IT!\"", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424478663, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424657468, "recommendationid": "14568005", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518357", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1424197157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 325, "playtime_forever": 47, "steamid": "76561198016432675", "num_games_owned": 834}, "votes_funny": 9, "votes_up": 41, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This game does have a good concept under the hood: but the lack of options and problems that occur lead to a game that just finished a little short of what I think it needs. \n\nIncluding Gameplay Footage and First Impressions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e308RQcXCqk\n\n+:\n- Against a human AI, first several matches will be fun and chaotic.

This game was designed to be a multiplayer experience, and it shows in the powerups and the AI.
