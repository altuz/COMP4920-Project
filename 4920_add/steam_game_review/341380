I was rather excited to begin playing it. Then as I progressed through the game I found it, 'boring'. This game has hardly any puzzles, not to mention that none of them are difficult in any way, and the game was in no way imersive or scary. This game doesn't even have an intriguing storyline. Honestly, this game is not worth $7.

I purchased it with only one review written which was my mistake. The game is nothing more than walking through a maze of doors solving a couple simple puzzles to get keys to the next maze of doors and on and on. No interesting storyline to accompany you through the dread either.  I found it to be a boring chore to play. In fact, I did not even finish it due to lack of interest.  Countless rooms of boredom. What is even more disturbing is that this game is actually on Steam and costs money. I find this to be worse than downloading a virus. Stay away.
