After I tried it for several minutes, I found it was not that simlpe in term of game play.\nThe player is set in the boots of a captain living among islands and isles looking like somewhere in the Carribean. You can aquire and complete quests, battle and loot other ships, find buried treasures, buy and sell goods, and upgrade your ship to better models and equip it with looted items, and the match-three game exists only in the naval battle.\nThe first 2-3 hours were exciting and enjoyable. However, after that the game become old very quickly, since there are only a handful kinds of missions, the profits from trading becomes very neglectable, and the battle are also relatively repititive (the system itself is okay, but you have to do it again and again uncountable times, especially in late time where you have almost nothing else to do).\n\nSo in summary, this game feels like a simplified version of Sid Meire's Pirates.
