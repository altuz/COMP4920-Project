Sidebars on widescreen monitors. Gimmick involves using a camera. First off you will constantly hear the high pitched sound of the camera flash over and over again. Secondly, you will have a whiteout everytime you use the gimmick, I am not epileptic but it still felt rather unhealthy and unpleasant. Thirdly, the gimmick works against you as much as it works with you, it is finnicky, and forces you to think differently: In this game, the amount of ground around you is good, you activate your ability and rush out to the nearest impossible jump, in the hope that the floor you captured from the camera flash will now cover the gap you need to bridge. Of course you will often fail your timing or capture the wrong section of land or obstacles, especially since you are going in blind. Which means that you will constantly fight with the controls, trigger a bunch of flashes, and sometimes plunge to your death, unless you like crawling forward and slowly planning out your approach. This is made even duller by the fact that most of the assets are unpleasant ugly brown tiling that looks underpar even by SNES standards. The protagonist for indie 2D would had been okay if it werent for the lack of microdetailing, and the idle animation was very bare and consisted of minimal blinking.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506673498, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506756138, "recommendationid": "35286329", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490371", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 241, "total_reviews": 397, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 156}}
