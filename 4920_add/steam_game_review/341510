You get to choose from two stats to gain a point when leveling. Price is great for the content.

I can't say I'm that hopeful after attempting this one after several tries. Anyway he can be found here...  http://www.outergridgames.com/\n\nGraphics overall is set out to be charming and won me over. Sound and music always fitting and adds to the overall atmosphere. Light hearted humor throughout the game bringing the odd smile or two to my face. Game play consists of a turn based RPG which records your history of your numerous attempts which is always fascinating to glance over. All this revolves around a paper thin story involving your customized friends being kidnapped and needing to be rescued. The settings take you to a school yard and then a cemetery creating a very quirky style backdrop for the simple to understand story. So if all these things are a plus why do I give it a solid thumbs down?\n\nIt's ROGUE as rogue can be. (Sad face) and the developer seems adamant to keep it that way regardless of the countless throngs of customers which have already requested an easier progressive mode to be added to the game. SERIOUSLY... the game apparently takes 4 hrs which I have never seen, because after two hours in I come across an unfair room while I have nothing left to defend myself with and unable to back out, I die. No saves once your dead. No chapter reloads. No progressive leveling with your next character having slightly higher stats. No siree your back to the start to have to grind through the whole thing again just to get back to the same bleeding spot and die. After 10 hrs of game play and several psychiatric visits (self admitted) and several correspondence with the developer, your left with shrugged shoulders and the puzzling question as to why on this planet would a game developer who wants to be recognized pick a niche market (turn style rpg) and further limit its appeal by making it COMPLETELY ROGUE??? Who has time for that? Gamer's have lives! Jobs! Family! Why would you not ALSO add an easier mode???\n\nBut alas he does not believe in the golden principle of 'Customers are always right!'... So while hundreds camp outside the developers fortress brandishing pitchforks and torches, over turning cars setting them alight and shouting give us what we want or we will start storming the walls. He lies with deaf ears in the bowels of the dungeon creating another....\n\nI think someone else said it best with their review of the game and I wholeheartedly concur with this statement that they made.

However, there are several crucial problems preventing me from recommending this game.\n1. The control is very labour-intensive: you have to click for each and every movement of the hero, because there's neither even the simplest path finding nor keyboard movement control. So if you pick a wrong door, you may need to click a hundred times to go all the way back.\n2. This is an old-fashioned PURE rogue-like game. You won't gain anything for subsequential plays. If you die, you have to begin a new game with empty hands (expect for a set of random starting weapons) all over again. The layout of rooms is substantially fixed, while the enemies and items in a map are generated random. So you may die in the third room after starting a new game. \n3. The combat is heavily dependent on chances. As someone has mentioned in an earlier review, the hit/miss results seem to be completely random. Since you have only a dozen of HPs and you are going to face hundreds of baddies, the dice will eventually fail you.\n\nOverall, don't be fooled by the appearance of the game.

The gameplay was very simplistic and easy to understand.  Despite picking it up fairly quickly, I managed to make it to the 2nd area, got surrounded by enemies, and died.\n\n2nd play:  Armed with a bit more knowledge about dps, stats, and item usage.. I re-started with a new name and managed to get very far. After several hours I had gotten to level 10, with X amount of chapters completed.  I decided that I was too tired to continue but used the save & quit feature so that I could continue later.\n\n\nThe runback: It's a very fair and easy to pick up rogue-like that can be very comical at times. Most enemies are pun-tastic and have a variety of differing actions making them fairly unique from each other. If you're new to roguelikes this would be a fairly good introductory game. IF you are a veteran, you will most likely get a kick out of the fantastic puns and homely comedy.\n\nWell worth the money if on sale.
