As it is early access I may change my  opinion  as time progresses, but that will depnd on what the developer does for the game.    It says the artware  is an open world  environment;  for me that conjures up   the thought that you are able to explore every part of the  world you find yourself in. Sadly  I found there were many places I wasn't able to explore, for example  trying to  get   from many places   via hills, you aren't able to climb anything steeper than about 45 degrees, this  basically locks off  loads of  area of the world so far created.  I tried for hours to find ways to access  certain area's, but   was always held back by the inability to climb anything too steep.  \n\nThe actual  artware/game (I include game because  Steam imply that its also a game  when it asks the question,   'Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?') is basically an exploration game, nothing else, just wandering around looking at the weird  shapes and colors.  For  several minutes I found this  quite exciting and stimulating, but  eventually  found it a little bit too much  after  an hour of wandering around.   I was determined to contine, but had to break the experience up into  chunks.\n\nI know the developer has said they intend expanding the game and adding different worlds.  I'm sure   those additions will add a little more interest.  also they said    that  the game was a  visually tantalizing open world artware that culminates the player to relax and enjoy a safe enviroment for them to explore at their own pace and that there are no objectives, no rules, just beauty and art.  Yes, I can agree with that, it  does   definitely help you to relax, but   why are we calling it a game , or   more  truthfully  selling it as a game.  As a piece of experimental  artware, I'd be happy, but I  wanted a game..  Okay, I read the  description and still purchased the 'artware'.  Still I wasn't expecting it to   be so tedious.  Lets hope the additional content the developer has promised will  materialize and expand on what's already here and in fact evolve it into more than just artware; lets see an artware based game  with  some substance to it.\n\nfor example:\n\nI really think think  the game/artware  needs a little more than just  more places to explore.  We need   some incentives to carry on exploring the world; maybe some  puzzles to unlock hidden area's, mini games,  or even a mode  that allows   some sort of co-operative play or PvP.  These would certainly add interest and  IMO would  increase  the  numbers buying this game   three fold or more.\n\nThankfully the price of the game even without the   initial release  discount  is quite cheap at \u00a34.49 (probably even cheaper in the US), but, unless you really like   games with little content apart from weird, colorful  and pretty visuals, I'd steer clear unless it goes on sale or   the developer   adds some thing more to do  apart from wandering around.  To be honest, I can't believe I've spent 10 hours on this game.  (Maybe   I was enjoying myself so much i didn't realize the time, though it's more likley I fell asleep at times at  the keyboard.  :)\n\nTo the developer.  If you do read this,  I'd like to say, I really want to like this game,  the color palette you've used is excellent, the visuals are pretty awesome  and the game has loads of potential, but  please please please  add some  content (some examples quoted above)  that gives the player an incentive to carry  on playing, or at least add  the ability to interact with other players or NPC's, maybe  make the odd characters and animals (eg the camel) that I found in game  actually  animated rather than just statuesque.  I really did loved  the   visuals and look forwards to seeing more, but I can't recommend this to my friends as it stands.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1421223880, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420686263, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1420707181, "recommendationid": "13888663", "developer_response": "You really want this to be a game, I understand. \n\n\nBut you must take this experience for what it is, the whole point of the game is to observe and explore.

[Insert Drug Dealer Joke]\n\nThe game is a walking simulator. The pull is the world. The gamer-oriented object (thus far) is to collect sprites. \nI qualify that last point thusly because the dev has expressed that the intent IS more of an [footnote] interactive art installation [end footnote], rather than a trippy \"game,\" per se. \nI have heard, however, that the dev is seriously considering tweaking the vision into a form more akin to \"game\" - what I've heard suggested that it might become something like Pokemon Snap. Research and observe the structures and creatures; use a camera and take notes.\n\nThere is currently no music. \nThere are too many invisible walls. \nThe lack of a sprint is to the players' advantage (more time to explore); however, I think different means of locomotion might add to the experience. Crawl, slither, fly - whatever. \nJust give us some curve balls that will provoke further \"Woah\"'s. \n\nIf the screenshots interest in any way - If \"walking simulator\" isn't a bad word to you.\nThere should be no hesitation to Trip.\n\n[footnote] From the few posts I've read pertaining to Trip: Steam Edition, the players complain about that lack of interactivity. You truly do just walk around, marvel at the sights and collect those sprites, should you find them. As a free non-Steam game, that's not really a valid complaint; it's being called a game is not called into question because there IS some sort of interactivity. A free trip to a fantastic virtual world. \nWith it being sold for money, of course people will expect more. In general, from what I've seen, walking simulators that live up to the name usually have Mixed user ratings. But. Those that have a gimmick are more well-received.\nThe Stanley Parable; truly a walking simulator. Due to it being so unique, the positive reviews outweight the negative. \nWith Trip, the uniqueness is strictly in the visuals. There are other comparable games to it, like FRACT OSC and NaissanceE and Kairo - these are first-person puzzlers with an abstract style. \nTrip is all about the abstract.\nMight seem like I'm subverting my recommendation with this cyclical talk, but I contest that Trip is worthy of patronage, so as to further fuel the vision, whatever it amounts to. Personally, more of the same with no further \"gamey\" mechanics implemented would be fine; I would then hope for an open world, but... \nI just want this game to succeed; at least as a walking simulator, (I think) it has more substance than most... my saying so challenges the definition of \"substance,\" but the abstract has that effect.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430688311, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1430694721, "recommendationid": "15676461", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512382", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445691355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 100, "steamid": "76561198010939476", "num_games_owned": 101}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "i want my fucking weed back", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445691910, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445691910, "recommendationid": "18656972", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499144", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1461842483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 29, "steamid": "76561198028813195", "num_games_owned": 1099}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Recomended with LSD Dream Emulator OST by Osamu Sato", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461841793, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1461841793, "recommendationid": "22686285", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492821", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491031118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561197995181049", "num_games_owned": 505}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "sup beyotch", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491031118, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491031135, "recommendationid": "30869927", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493993", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477112337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 42, "steamid": "76561198184366174", "num_games_owned": 1341}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "wow, riche, fort, moving, intrigant, mesmerizing and so on, so on ...........\nexellent", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435288483, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435288483, "recommendationid": "16711907", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494875", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435471429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198189294975", "num_games_owned": 30}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "ummm... k.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435471444, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435471444, "recommendationid": "16754427", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490269", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448784152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 26, "steamid": "76561198060504564", "num_games_owned": 66}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "When your tripping very hard this is the game for you if your not then just dont touch it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434936804, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434936804, "recommendationid": "16609225", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495526", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466566123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 31, "steamid": "76561198027985974", "num_games_owned": 490}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Video Gameplay:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ8FhYED9DY\n\nSomething Different, Nice exploration.
