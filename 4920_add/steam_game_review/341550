The weapons have the same feel and impact, often the same sound effects. The explosions and the way enemies bounce away when hit are the same. Even the sense of progression through a place is the same, with each level culminating at the entrance to the next. Everything feels like home.\n\nIt doesn't just perfect the fundamentals, though. You also have at your disposal two key features from some of the later Contras. The first is the ability to lock yourself in position and fire in eight directions without moving (you don't have the option of locking the direction of fire [i]whilst[/i] moving, as in Shattered Soldier, but you won't miss it here). The second is the ability to charge your shots with an additional fire button. Like in Shattered Soldier, each weapon's charged shot has a unique function - charging the spread shot, for example, gives a devastating focused attack that vastly improves its effectiveness against bosses.\n\nThe weapon selection itself is familiar and conservative, and you still acquire weapons by shooting down pods that pass overhead at intervals. Crucially, though, the weapons are now all automatic. A few seconds into the first stage you'll have upgraded from your starting peashooter to the classic red-gobstopper machine gun (now with subtle muzzle flare), and not long after you'll have discovered the laser (which now gives a more continuous, reliable beam) and of course the spread shot, which you'll still want to hang onto for as long as possible. There's also an 'E' weapon that's literally just the fireball from Super C rendered as a purple blast of electricity, and the 'R' power-up which increases your rate of fire and reduces charge times. There's the screen-clearing smart-bomb, dropped rarely, and a 'B' power-up that grants you a generous few seconds of invincibility - anything that touches you during this time is toast. It's like the rare potion in the original Castlevania, except useful - it appears in places you'd want it to, places with a lot going on.\n\n[i]Most of the game[/i] has a lot going on, of course. Super Cyborg is hard. Not just \"Contra hard\" or \"NES hard\", whatever those might mean. It's possibly harder than any Contra game to date, arcade or console, but without becoming the poorly-judged mess that fan-made tributes to difficult games often are. It manages to remain considered, doable and fair throughout. Most situations, setpieces, phases of bosses, etc, are fairly reasonable taken by themselves - it's their collective, unrelenting onslaught that's taxing. \n\nThough on the face of it the game's styled after the NES Contras, it shares a lot of its design sensibilities with Hard Corps and Shattered Soldier. It certainly has a much heavier focus on bosses and minibosses that require rote memorisation, for example - you're frequently tasked with learning how best to position yourself for each of a new boss's phases, and where the safe spots might be, etc. Timings can be strict and movements swift, but they're generally well telegraphed. \n\nYou settle into each stage, after the initial shock, and start to appreciate its design. For the most part you're running and gunning as you always have - negotiating platforms whilst dodging fire from turrets or wall-crawling enemies and laying down a suppressing spread-shot fire on the respawning kamikaze cannon fodder. This is when Super Cyborg is at its most exhilarating. Then, and when you're finally clearing a stage after taking some time to practice. Any Contra fan will be familiar with the incredible sense of reward you get from having executed by the skin of your teeth a meticulously planned run, or having taken down a boss you had decided was beyond you. This game creates moments like these constantly. They are its most addictive draw and are felt all the more powerfully because they're so hard-won.\n\nWhere this clone perhaps makes a misstep is in its sudden late-game changes of [i]form[/i]. There's a top-down level like in Super C. Like in Super C, it's the easiest and least engaging one. It's about four years long, fairly uneventful and absolutely the weakest part of the game. Unlike in Super C, it shows up as the [i]sixth[/i] and penultimate stage, by which point it comes as an unwelcome and unnecessary bait-'n'-switch, killing any feeling of mounting intensity as you approach the finale. Other formal surprises fare much better, however, like the branching paths in stage 5 - one leading to a miniboss and the other to a tricky gauntlet - which genuinely add to its replay value.\n\nThe length can be exhausting not just in stage 6 but also the final stage, and the developers knew this, because they gave both of them checkpoints, which aren't used anywhere else. And while they might reduce the amount of time you spend wrestling with these levels, they don't necessarily make things easier, since they can lock you beyond the point at which you could grab your preferred weapon (although, fair play, the spread shot is always available for the last boss).\n\nFor me, Contra games are at their best when they're short and sweet. Five stages, around twenty minutes from beginning to end. Even for an experienced player blowing through it on a single life, Super Cyborg clocks in at a whopping fifty minutes (at least). That's an incredibly long time for any arcade-style game, and even titans like Radiant Silvergun and Gradius V don't necessarily [i]get away[/i] with being this protracted. Thankfully, Super Cyborg manages to remain engaging and exciting for most of its hefty duration \u2013 outside stage 6 there's no dead time, no wasted space.\n\nIn spite of these minor complaints, I really think you ought to play this game. It captures so much of what makes the Contra games exciting and addictive, and manages not only to emulate their unique flow but to escalate and build upon it, creating many moments of electrifying tension and payoff. It's exceedingly formidable, to be sure, but it's a game that gets more and more enjoyable the more you get to know it - you start off floundering spasmodically and swearing you could never make any headway through [i]this[/i] mess, and before long you're effortlessly dispatching hordes of hapless nightmare-mutants with a cocksure swagger. Blowing through all of the early stages without breaking a sweat on subsequent runs through them is an immensely rewarding experience, and you'll be doing it sooner than you might think. Super Cyborg doesn't have an original bone in its body, but it doesn't wish for one. It just wants to be a barnstorming Contra game, and it is!\n\n(This was a truncated version of a lengthier waffle, which can be found here: http://talking-time.net/showthread.php?t=19312)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500064915, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500064915, "recommendationid": "33544371", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504660", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503982076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 371, "playtime_forever": 436, "steamid": "76561198135143088", "num_games_owned": 557}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Blatant rip-off of Contra/Probotector, but it's not poorly done and includes some nice additional features.\n\nIf you liked the NES Contra then you'll like this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503712096, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503712096, "recommendationid": "34494046", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499689850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 295, "steamid": "76561197986862576", "num_games_owned": 417}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "We may not have Contra on Steam but we have good devs that are as much of a Contra fan as you are.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499717427, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499717427, "recommendationid": "33439649", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500760", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500191398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 699, "steamid": "76561198000057269", "num_games_owned": 1082}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Hard but fair platformer side-scroller shoot-em-up.
