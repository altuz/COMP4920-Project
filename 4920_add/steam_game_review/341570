Along with positive movement in the multi-player. I feel confident this game will continue to kick ass and take names. The team seems very receptive to feedback. The few minor bugs I have encountered, altho I should have reported, I am lazy american. LOL So instead I ingnore them. And love the game for what it is, a solid TD.\n\nEDIT2: After the first half dozen levels, the maps get LOTS better.\n\nEDIT3: Game keeps getting better and better. from balance to gameplay options. This game is heading in a very positive direction.\n\nI am torn, altho the level design is uninspired the gameplay is pretty decent. At first the mechanic of \"powering\" your towers was off putting. As I played a couple rounds, it grew on me and became part of the challange. This TD game has a lot of potential. The devs have mentioned multi-player as well, in the not so distant future. That was the selling point for me. \n\nIf you have not been jaded by previous EA burns, and you can go long on the game, I would recomend this game for its price. BUT if you are looking for a polished game that is awesome, wait a couple months and see how the progress unfolds. \n\nWill this be a fail like \"the dead linger\"?  or will this be a hit like \"the forest\"? only time will tell.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447194544, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1452214292, "recommendationid": "18999364", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531669", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1461851962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 498, "steamid": "76561198025452527", "num_games_owned": 743}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is the most frustrating game I'll ever recommend. Gameplay is difficult, made more so by the amount of stuff that you need to know which the tutorials don't address. The single player campaign requires tremendous amounts of grinding, because your overall strength is limited by how much cash you make, and that's limited by what levels you can play on in what difficulties, so there's a fairly linear grind that has you replaying these same, circular little levels that do nothing and go nowhere (the singleplayer experience of this game), as you try desperately to keep the number of creeps below 100 (the unstated lose condition for the game, though you figure it out quick; there's also a nice visual effect that makes it clear you're boned as the creep number climbs up).\n\nBut it's a lot of fun. Seriously, give it a try. Funstrating. There are deep mechanics to this simple looking game. It's compelling to try to get further. Levels are unforgiving, even brutal, as a lot of the difficulty ends up being down to not allowing exponential increases in the enemies on screen... Balance seems to be 1. good, and 2. absent, in that 1. you'll find levels get progressively harder and you'll enjoy being challenged, but 2. there is no real effort made to ensure the player progresses at any given speed - you just slam into a brick wall of unsurpassable difficulty, or the level is easy and you can do it fine. Either you're over the hump and can do more damage than the enemies can take hit points, or you're not and you have to replay earlier levels more.\n\nThere are a number of improvements possible for this game, but it's already a quixotic, charming, maddening, enjoyable title. Hopefully the designers will continue to improve it. But I can recommend it as an enjoyable and even somewhat innovative Tower Defense title right now, as long as you're willing to lose quite a lot if you're trying to progress through the levels too quickly, and don't mind a total lack of hand-holding past a few basic tutorials.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461782200, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1461783318, "recommendationid": "22666597", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503470", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1479925210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1631, "steamid": "76561197966633699", "num_games_owned": 205}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great TD and very cheap!\n\nLittle buggy in MP, but the developer need feedback on bugs.\nThey wrote and fixed bugs the same day I post them, so they are alive! *cheers*\n\nReport bugs here : http://steamcommunity.com/app/341570/discussions/0/496880503067139198/\n\nIts like Circle TD in WC3\nGood balanced!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467324923, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1467324923, "recommendationid": "23967957", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452716897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 515, "steamid": "76561198029822430", "num_games_owned": 223}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Why is this TD-game great?\n\nIt a complex true TD-game that won't just be nice with you and let you win, you need to use your brain, with MP support.
