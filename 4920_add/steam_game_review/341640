(Hint: gravity falls off approximately equal to r^2, which is a paraboloid, not a small dent in the space-time field) b) so massively effected by space-time distortion weapons, that you're effectively creating gravitational weapons that do hojillions more space-time manipulations than your ships, planets, and galactic black hole do.\n\nNext, the scale is so unbelievably small, that it's like beach balls rolling around on a trampoline... it's like, \"ok, these things are pretty big, but... they're not really doing anything... why are they orbiting like that?\"\n\nBasically, for wanting to replicate real-world relativity, they've done a pretty poor job of it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434847082, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434847082, "recommendationid": "16569233", "language": "english", "votes_down": 55, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532144", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431307642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 79, "steamid": "76561197972319504", "num_games_owned": 287}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fairly fun if a bit slow and repetitive feeling. \n\nPretty fun for time-wasting, but not quite enough content to really get into.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431307786, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431307786, "recommendationid": "15781827", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515027", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492168917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 215, "steamid": "76561198132102007", "num_games_owned": 179}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really like this game - clever concept, good use of physics and relativity.\nThe interface is a little clunky, and could use some work to make it easier to do multi-planet tasks, like:\n* Build at all planets\n* Patrol/Attach from all planets\n* Colonise all available planets", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433281249, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433281249, "recommendationid": "16142661", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513429", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429113981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 296, "steamid": "76561198178987659", "num_games_owned": 2}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm really enjoying this so far.
