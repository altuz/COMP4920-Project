I have never felt so lost in a game in years! \n\nFlying aimlessly trying to understand the controls first, then what is benefitial to do and what is not. Controls are not intuitive, but that is fine, I do like a challenging game. They are very sensitive though and rather unforgiving with a controller. Precision of this does improve as you play further, and taking into account the physics better as you fly.\n\nSometimes a number in the bottom right of the screen goes up then it goes back to zero, I hit things and stall or go faster doesn't seem to make any difference as I haven't been able to find a way to die or string anything together consistently to start to piece together the obscure game mechanics. Sometimes a special move pops up in the bottom left corner that I dont really know how I did it or how to combine these to get something/anything going. Gather I am meant to get the circles, but not sure what that does. I get a few circles, then the string of them often disappear into the fog (I guess I go the wrong direction perhaps)? What are the hazards, should I avoid hitting things or not, or go faster/slower, or just get the circles as quickly as possible.. I'm so confused.\n\nThere is a HUD which has no explaination to it (a bunch of circles and other symbols/colours that change as you move around), nor what to do to get any score or navigate through the endless level. Procedural generation is basic from what I have seen with the same shapes with high level of fog to hide things from view. Felt like I was going around & around which becomes somewhat nausiating.\n\nGraphics do look nice in the simplistic style used though - they have depth when coupled with the fog effects. Audio/music gets rather repetitive in a short time although it does add some nice atmosphere to the game & complements the graphic set. No real complaints here other that the HUD/UI I have previously mentioned.\n\nWith a game with such abstract game mechanics the lack of any type of tutorial, guide, manual or explaination on what is the goal is or how to play is baffling. This might be a great game but without any explaination on the mechanics, scratching my ball sack is more enjoyable. I am clearly in the minority looking at the primarily positive reviews, but in my time playing it has been unenjoyable & frustrating. I like a hard game, a game of skill (as the store page suggests this is), but at least explain the basic rules first!\n\n\n[u]Update post Devs comments:[/u] [i]I have watched the brief introduction instructional video linked in the comments and also found an extended advanced 22 minute video on the channel that I have also watched. This does help explain some of the mechanics of the game and some of the possible moves you can do. To be fair, I returned to the game to give it another try and did find my initial frustrations diminished to a degree. I was able to string together some higher scores & get some of the achievements. Saying this, I do still maintain that the game needs better explaination for new players and should not need to search online to see how to play.\n\nOnce you get start getting the hang of the plane controls & physics, the game becomes more enjoyable, but ultimately I do not see this as a game I would come back to play regularly. Other than getting a higher score the game itself is repetitive with the same scenery, sound effects/audio & layouts (which do progressively get harder to navigate). Wall grinding seems to be the best option to increase your score, but I did try for the circles to see if I could progress and hit a few of the harder achievements. Finite control still eludes me so hitting a bullseye of a circle for example was next to impossible & the HUD still seemed redundant (or I did not pick up what the circles and symbols mean from the videos). Also, it is hard to judge how close to the bottom of the map you are where (I now know) your score resets.\n\nI always admire a dev who is willing to try something different and not churn out the same game or game mechanics we have seen in a 100 other titles. This is a good effort, and enjoyable to a point once the game was understood, but there is not enough content or variety, and does still need better explaination of the mechanics for new players.

I honestly wasn't sure if I was going to like it, I've been a fan of the developers streams for a while but wasn't sure if this was quite my cup of tea. \n\nThe game seems brutally difficult at first, but upon a few trail and error attempts and reviewing the controls, I found myself becoming more and more accustomed to the gameplay. Within the first twenty minutes I was coasting off of walls and blasting through rings at lightning speed! \n\nThe gameplay get's very intense, as you scrape by buildings at blazing speeds you'll hear gusting winds as the camera shakes vigorously giving you that feeling as if you're an ace pilot in a big budget action film! It makes the game's learning curve SO worth it! \n\nThe biggest plus for me however, is the game seems to adapt to any style of play. If you're looking to collect rings as fast as you can, scoring multiple bullseyes while preforming skill chains will phase the player into what is known as \"B-side\", were rings scored will award double the points but it's significantly harder in the process. However if you're looking for something more laid back and chill, you can traverse the map at a laid back pace and still remain competitive against other players.\n\nThere is no ineffective way to play this game, and that's probably the game's strongest feature. Some have stated that this game is anti casual. I'd argue the opposite. Once you take the time to learn the controls and physics of StratO, it's very easy to log in, play it for ten minutes, and go back to your work space feeling completely satisfied! \n\nGameplay: 5/5 - Difficult to learn at first, but after a while it all starts to make sense. The physics are incredible!\n\nGraphics:   4/5 - Simple but effective. Nothing looks awkward or out of place. The lighting in some of the later maps is beautiful! \n\nSoundtrack: 4/5 - Clever use of game mechanics that change the in game music while rocket boosting make it hard to resist muting the music for something else. The in game music, particularly the \"default\" map track which is most commonly used is great! It's not too fancy and fits the atmosphere well. My only complaint is there needs to be more music tracks for the game to swap through as you get into the later maps.\n\nStory: not applicable - It's an arcadey game, what'd you expect?\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433252780, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433252780, "recommendationid": "16132977", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.989457", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451326847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 136, "steamid": "76561198081156677", "num_games_owned": 368}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is very fun and is worth every penny!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437095011, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437095011, "recommendationid": "17085081", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498192", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506198800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 437, "steamid": "76561198123493214", "num_games_owned": 139}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Very fun and addictive. 10/10 would rate again", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433186207, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433186207, "recommendationid": "16121085", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504546", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446443283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 502, "steamid": "76561198006837859", "num_games_owned": 160}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great casual game with refreshing controls.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436425445, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436425445, "recommendationid": "16954187", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999429", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483737519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 520, "steamid": "76561198079543742", "num_games_owned": 94}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Followed this game for a while before release and was not disappointed.\nFantastic engaging mechanics in a beautiful arcade world.\n\n10/10 Gameplay\n10/10 Visuals\n10/10 Audio\n10/10 Colorblind setting (Thank you!)\n\nEagerly awaiting any updates.\nEagerly awaiting the next title from this promising developer.\n\nGood work!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433282970, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433282970, "recommendationid": "16143203", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999429", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466114377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 911, "steamid": "76561198043426917", "num_games_owned": 54}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is perfect for aeroplane/flier fanatics.
