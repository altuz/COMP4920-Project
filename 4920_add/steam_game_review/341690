It is now available on the PC - as usual the adaptation has slightly better graphics but some gameplay elements and the main menu easily give it away (i.e. you can clearly see it was initially meant for smartphones).\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n\n+++ Great hand-drawn graphics! It really reminds you of the old Lucasart's games that came out in the '90s.\n+++ Similarly to those classic gems this one also uses humour as part of its story-telling. I especially liked the many references to films, music, celebritites, politicians and - naturally - to those classic games.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n\n--- While the game has excellent soundtrack it misses the voice-acting. I'm not sure it would have greatly increased the file size considering it is not that long. Afterl all, current smartphones have quite the memory capacity these days. Or they could have just done the voiceover for this particular version. Remember Day of The Tentacle had 2 versions (one with and another without a dub)?\n--- The smartphone effect: the inventory is opened by finding the button on the left side and moving the cursor (while the button is pressed) from left to right. Surely the press of a button would have sufficed.\n\nRecommended purchase for adventure game fans; just bear in mind that it is relatively short due to it being an adaptation of a smartphone app.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494452789, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494452789, "recommendationid": "31673061", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520813", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494801068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 182, "steamid": "76561198145416535", "num_games_owned": 120}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Paris in the Autumn...\n\nOf all the references, the George Stobbart one was the best and this is reason enough to recommend the game! :D\n\nAll joking aside, I really can't understand the negative thoughts regarding the subject matter of the game. It has a pretty standard Orwellian aesthetic, but acts as a satyre on current affairs: Mainly the finanancial crisis and increasingly harsh copyright laws, with nods to the refugee crisis, the ever increasing wealth divide, the importance of Art and the power of money.\n\nFrom the credits, I gather the developer team is based in Spain and as such has first hand knowledge of all these themes. As a (southern) European myself, I can see where the inspiration comes from, and in no way I find it \"too left\", or \"too out there\".\n\nOn the other hand, I have some issues with the technical aspects of the game. The controls are better suited for a touch screen (it is a mobile port after all), and the (slow) walking back and forth was a tad annoying. But that's it mostly! The game is short, so just sit back and enjoy the story!\n\nOh, and Mme Merkel makes an appeareance too! :D\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494804397, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494804397, "recommendationid": "31759104", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511473", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5}}
