I knew that it would be a rudimentary interface, answer multiple choice questions to affect your character's destiny, etc. And the premise is very interesting: play out the life of an elderly Frenchman and try to help him stay alive as long as he can, etc.\n\nBut the game doesn't really value life, and takes a denigrating and condescending stance toward older people. I myself am 66 years of age, so I noticed that the game just seems to have this one-dimensional view of an older person living in humble circumstances. I go along with tracking the character's mood and other attributes, but there were just too many instances of the character stepping in dog feces, having a bird defecate on his head, being made fun of by younger people, etc. Three or four years into the character's game life, he is about 68 years old, and a screen pops up asking 'just how long can one live and have life still worth living?' or words to that effect. Since I myself am 66, it seems to me that the game simply forecloses on the possibilities of living for its protagonist. You get the picture? An inevitable, unchangeable slide toward death, with what remains of life being totally mundane and uninspiring. There's just nothing engaging about the game's storyline.\n\nThat said, I do think it's possible that the game's developers are onto something. My generation in the USA, the 'baby boomers', are certainly concerned with what life still has to offer us. Playing out life's possibilities for a person of humble origin in the later years is something I would try again. What about giving us a dozen different characters, from backgrounds including bedouins, Congolese, Australian Aborigines, Native Americans, etcv., etc.? This sort of game could have fantastic educational potential; could help make the world a better place.\n\nSo I say, 'Try again' to the game's developers, and am grateful that they tried this idea out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1421965839, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1421965839, "recommendationid": "14117536", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718510", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421400647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 53, "steamid": "76561198071545180", "num_games_owned": 403}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 43, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have a review for this game, but I'm going to type a wall of text here in hopes that you can't see my review. Because I think there's a major point to this game that you can't ever have someone tell you about. I think you have to experience it.. I think you have to feel it.  If you can come to that point on your own, it's a beautiful and amazingly well designed game for a very low price. \n\nThe problem is, in my review I'm going to spoil what I believe the \"secret\" point of this game is. I know some of you will click it anyways and miss out. But I'm challenging you. Is $2 really so much to pay to believe in another human being? Just please. Trust me. Don't read the rest of this review until after you've at least played through the game once on your own. \n\nFor those of you that insist on seeing it now, or for those of you who have played through once and are back now to read this, here is my review: \n\n\nThis game is magnificent. It's not amazing as far as gameplay, sound, graphics.. No. It's clearly not meant to be that type of game, but is any visual novel really about the visuals? They're just an accentuation for the story you're being immersed in. \n\nThe point of the game is the reason why I love it. I played the game for about 45 minutes. Just one play through. The first ten to fifteen minutes, I was treating it like another silly game I didn't care about.. Halfway through I started really getting interested in the story. It hooks you in and goes from using third person references to saying \"You did this. You remember this. You were sad because.\" ... without you noticing, the game goes from telling you a story about someone else to engaging you in a story about yourself. \n\nAt some point, I think year seven or so. The stories stop. The family history goes no further. You learn about your parents, how they met. You learn about yourself. You learn about your brothers, and how you struggled. You learn about your first love and how she was your pillar when times got hard. When times became harder she was only there for you more. And then suddenly the history stops. The GAMEPLAY stops.  And you're asked.. there really a reason to balance your life? To prolong your suffering and loneliness? To keep thinking about things. To keep hoping for another love as deep and fulfilling as the one you lived. \n\nAnd at that point I realized. This game lies to you. The game tells you the point is to keep yourself alive as long as possible. And yes, you can do that for the leaderboards if you like. You can be a robot and experience life in the most optimal way for survival. Or you can do what you feel is  right as you come to terms with death. \n\nIn my own final days, I visited many loved relatives and friends. Put aside money for my children, even when I didn't have any. Went out to theatre and surrounded myself with people I cared for. People stole from me and silly things would bother me.. And one day the money ran out and I died. I cried a little bit but.. I died living to the fullest. \n\nAnd that. That is what I think this game is truly about. It's not a grind to live as long as you can. It's only a grind for as long as it takes for you to realize that grinding your life away is NOT the life you should want to live. At that point the game teaches you something deep about yourself and allows you to come to terms with human mortality. \n\nFor that reason I believe this game is magnificent.  But who knows. I might be seeing magic where there is nothing. Perhaps it wasn't their intention. Regardless, I'm very glad for what I got out of this game.. I'm kind of sad I would have missed it if it wasn't so cheap. \n\n10 out of 10 .

Okay, give me a moment to arrange an actual review from the crippling strike of empathy that I just took to my guts.\n\n[i]Cahors Sunset[/i] is a unique mini game that invites you to become an elderly French man named Valentin Puget. You live and recount your life's tale, alongside witnessing many political changes of France's own history. Your main goal is to keep the old man alive as long as possible by making everyday choices like either drinking a fine wine, or simply visiting your doctor. You have to keep an eye on his social, financial, psychological and physical abilities to present a well balanced life. As months pass and the old man ages even more, he suffers certain ailments and penalties to all his stats. Every single thing that you choose to do carry both positive and negative consequences on different assets. Also, you are the object of happenstances of life that you have no control over, just as real life.\n\nNarration is elegant and realistic, shedding some light to the story of a life and an era while asking the player to emphasize himself/herself with someone that resides in the winter of a life. Challenges of being old, vulnerable and fragile; living side by side with the possibility that it might be your last day on earth is heavy to say the least. You keep living, and living, and living... and at some point, you ask yourself: is this living?\n\nThe game leaves you with a sudden urge to stop whatever you are doing, pick up the phone and call your grandparents; just so you can share something, anything with them while it still matters. It leaves you with a short, but strong experience that you can benefit from as a humane virtue.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439068062, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460025384, "recommendationid": "17448913", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555814", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1422231589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 161, "steamid": "76561198005299723", "num_games_owned": 11558}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 25, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Cahors Sunset is an interactive story board  with  a choice of three decisions each month of a sixty odd year old man; each desision you make affects various arrtibutes such as happiness  weight, anxiety, social life etc.   The aim of the game is to keep your man alive as long as possible by keeping these attributs well balanced.

Every action you take has an effect on your character and not all choices are good; many contain unwanted side effects, mainly dropping his mood(when it came to choices I would pick). The idea is to balance the positive and negative effects of each action you take and the impacts they have on the old man's health... However, unlike quite a few other visual novels, or choice driven story games, I find this flat and really not compelling enough to want to sit there for a solid 3 to 5 hours just clicking various text boxes.\n\nThough this novel had the chance to be something great, I feel as though it fails to reach the level it could. I can admire what they were trying to achieve by making this a fully choice driven story, where your decisions directly effect how long this man lives, but it takes the most stereotypical view of elderly people and just flops in trying to convey anything really deep and meaningful.\n\nIt just feels like an empty and random number generator. So long as you keep attributes at a stable level you'll live longer, so long as some random thing doesn't happen to make your anxiety or mood drop to a near nothing.. Like a song you don't like playing on the radio.. At the end of it all, the payoff feels really unrewarding. \n\nOn the positive notes, it has a really nice soundtrack, a lot of solid effort to convey what is going on within your characters life, full texts and decent length.\n\nDoes not balance out well between pros and cons, as it's more or less something you'll pick up for about 5-10 minutes and then go along your merry way.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435075872, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435075872, "recommendationid": "16651888", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513991", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1421178663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 283, "playtime_forever": 76, "steamid": "76561198062232099", "num_games_owned": 4837}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": 0, "review": "TL;DR: The game is a random number generator dependent upon RNG. So long as you keep attributes at a stable level (sometimes dependent upon a lot of luck) you'll survive. The payoff is unrewarding. The game has potential to be more than what it is.\n\n\nPurchase reason: Game appeared in the new releases of Steam. The description piqued my interest. There aren't many games on the platform that appear to have this type of background. Further, my partner adores French culture and history so that helped the purchase decision.\n\nInstall note: Be forewarned that the game will attempt to install Adobe Air when you try and start the game for the first time.\n\nInitial reaction: The concept plays out a little too simply - You make a single choice for the month (they can be very simple things that would be a common occurrence in everyday life such as attending a sports contest). There doesn't appear to be nearly as much substance in the game as what there could be.\n\nIn game music: It's pleasant enough to listen to at first. However, I must admit to turning the sound down/off before completing my first game as it became grating.\n\nA possible subtle point of the game: Each month the game provides a description of what is happening in the world beyond your control. This effects your own life minimalistically. As such I can see that this is one of the points that Locomotivah may be attempting to make with the game. That we as individuals believe that what happens in the greater scheme of life may not impact us nearly as much as we may believe it does.\n\nAt the beginning of each birth year you make a fresh resolution. This resolution provides a positive and a negative effect each month. One option is to take up smoking which increases your anxiety while decreasing your physical health. Another thing that happens each birth year is that you lose a point in each attribute for each year that you've survived. For example, after your first year you lose one in each category and so on.\n\nPost-first game reaction: My initial reaction stands. The game has potential for deeper gameplay than it currently provides. At this current point in time it's essentially a random number generator with different categories that you can't drop beneath.  So long as the RNG is in your favor and you select the most appropriate choice each month you will continue to survive.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't believe that the reward/payoff is rewarding enough for spending much time with the game. Unless, of course, your goal is to get into the top of the leaderboards. That's about all you can hope for as the game has no achievements nor does it have trading cards (yet).\n\nMy Recommendation: It's one of those games that deserves an inbetween recommendation. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it by itself - even though at $2 or $1.69 with its 15% launch promotion it's certainly priced correctly - but it is something that's worth a playthrough if the setting and the mini-storyline piques your interest.

Valentin Puget will start at the age of 65 and you need try to get him as old as you can.

Cahors Sunset starts you with random stats, the main point is, that you must keep his stats above a certain margin, otherwise, if one of the stats is under that crucial margin, he will face the chance of death. For every intentional choice you make, one random event will happen, whether that will have a good or bad influence on your playthrough is up to the game.\n\nBesides that simple mechanic, the game features a fleshed out background story of how the life of Valentin Puget came to be.

It showed me with what difficulties seniors have to deal in their everyday life and how important it is to cherish your last memories and moments while you are still alive. Because once we die, we all just become dust but we want our memories to be forever set in stone.\n\nThe game entertained me for as short as it was and with its challenging premise really awakens a sort of spirit inside me. I felt attached to Valentin Puget and a rush of sadness embraced me, when I realised, that this could very well be the fate of any person in the world. The game exists less for its gameplay and more for its meaning. If you enjoy games, that make you want to see the bigger picture, I can safely recommend this game to you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450626222, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451217370, "recommendationid": "19805803", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506972", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438546563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 127, "steamid": "76561198050836852", "num_games_owned": 521}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Like me, you probably read the description of Cahors Sunset and quickly decided whether you were interested or not, and if the concept didn't grab you outright, I doubt it will win you over even with its many charms.\n\nIn Cahors Sunset you play Valentin Puget a 65 year old French man, with the goal of keep him as healthy and happy as possible as he approaches man's inevitable end. Each month you are presented a choice of three activites for Valentin to perform. Each choice will affect his six attributes, anxiety, social life, mood, weight, money, and physical health. For example, going to Paris with a friend may raise your mood, and social life, but will be a large blow to your wallet. If any of your attributes fall below 25, you put Valentin at risk of death. Some events however, are out of your control. These seemingly randomized events will yield a loss or gain to your attributes, but even when things don't go your way the consequences are measured enough to avoid feeling cheap. \n\nAs each year passes and Valentin ages you will take a penalty to your attributes, and be given a choice to select a new year's resolution which will passively affect your stats every month. Vowing to travel less may slightly increase your funds but lower your social life.\n\nThe light RPG mechanics work well enough, but to me the story is really the games main draw and it delievers it well. As each month game unfolds, you will uncover snippets about Valentin's life, loves and loss. It begins with the story of his parents, and makes its way to present day. The game also sets the stage with current events unfolding in 20th century  France.\n\nThe game was clearly made on a budget, but the developer made smart decisions for the presentation which bolster the solid writing. Each screen has a backdrop of a beautiful photo from France, taken from Flickr. Although they are all from different artists, they feel surpsingly cohesive and are unified with a Sepia filter. The royalty free music chosen blends well the photography, making for a languid, melancholy atmosphere.  \n\nI wish perhaps though, the photographs could have been credited strictly in the credits. Its a minor complaint, but something about Flickr being referenced outright when I'm in 1960s France is a little mood breaking. Also a zooming effect performed on some of the the photograpy leaves a strange rippling effect which can be a bit distracting. It could be an issue with my monitor though.\n\nI suppose now the its time to ask the question lingering the back of everyone's minds when discussing these more expiremental games. Is it any fun? Well, I don't know if \"fun\" is neccesarily right word to apply here. I think instead I would choose to say that Cahors Sunset is \"affecting\". I can't ever recall imagining what it's like to be an old man 1960s France, or the last time a game made me really and truly think about aging and how I will look back on my own story in the years to come. To me that makes Cahors Sunset a success, and I'm glad I got the chance to experience it.\n\nAgain, it's difficult to recommended this anyone who is not intially open to the concept, but if you find yourself among the curious, I think you should give it a try.\n\nIf you like, check out my first impressions video on the game below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5ZjKgQWGXSU", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438642023, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438703659, "recommendationid": "17374448", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502920", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427810996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 144, "playtime_forever": 32, "steamid": "76561198024975130", "num_games_owned": 931}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Wow, this caught me off guard and really got me emotional thinking about my own life and my father and his passing.
