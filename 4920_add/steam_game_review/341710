The content is lacking: there are no formal objectives; no way to advance civilization; no rival tribes; no aggressive wild animals; no unforgiving environments; no way to interact with or smite individual followers.\n\nThe main draw to \u2013 and the only real gameplay mechanic of \u2013 Crest is the ability to compose commandments for followers from a Mad Libs-style, pregenerated list.  This is a great concept I would love to see explored more deeply in the future.  Unfortunately, standing alone, this mechanic is not enough to hold my interest.  Insert a subject, a verb, and an object into a blank, and [i]voila![/i] you\u2019ve written a commandment; you\u2019ve explored most everything Crest has to offer.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t enjoy Crest.  The game is aesthetically pleasing, the music is relaxing, and, yes, some of the commandments I issued were amusing (\u201cThe young shall consume the elderly\u201d and \u201cThou shalt share thy blessings with the lion\u201d were among my favorites).  I\u2019m glad I experienced Crest, but it\u2019s an experience I could have had watching Markiplier or MatPat's play through on YouTube.

Unfortunately, for me at least, there's just not enough here yet to make gameplay enjoyable.\n\nInteracting with followers solely via issuing commandments is a really cool idea, but given that this is the central (and essentially only) gameplay mechanic there's just not nearly enough variety in the kinda of commandments you can issue.  They all consist of three basic parts, essentially a subject, a verb, and an object.  Without going into too much of a tangent about how this works, I'll just say that in practice there's really not much control you have, and not much you can do.  For example, two of my cities went to war, and I wanted to help my initial city triumph; however since they were located on the same types of terrain and surrounded by the same animals etc, I wasn't able to issue any commandments that would only apply to one of them or the other, so any action I could take would equally help or hinder both cities.\n\nEven when I was able to assemble a useful commandment, issuing it to the followers feels almost pointless: some cities simply ignore them, and those that are receptive will usually corrupt the commandment into something else before too long. The nature of the corruption was often arbitrarily different from the initial commandment: for example, a commandment like \"those that are have metal, hunt lions\" could be turned into \"those that are near lions, make babies\".  If you have enough influence it's possible to approve or reject these bastardizations, but that seems to have little effect on whether or not they actually go away.  Finally, all commandments seem to have a time limit after which they simply expire, so even the most successful commandment will be relatively short-lived.\n\nThe final straw for me at least was the lack of any real goals to strive for, in either the short term or the long term.  There are no foreign civilizations to war with, and the wild animals don't seem to attack your people, so the only conflict comes from \"civil war\" among your followers.  In these battles it's not particularly important who wins, and indeed I'm not sure whether any of my wars ever ended: the UI does not make obvious the standing between cities.    It's supposedly possible to lose the game by having all of your followers die (of starvation, presumably), but even when I just let the game run by itself on max speed without bothering to issue any commandments, things ticked along just fine, with no danger of a species-wide extinction.\n\nThat is the fundamental flaw with this game as it stands right now: the player's role feels entirely superfluous, as he/she is able to offer at best only minor assistance to his/her followers, with little impact on the game world, and even less incentive to care one way or another.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507093572, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507093572, "recommendationid": "35463427", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502606", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 45, "total_reviews": 61, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 16}}
