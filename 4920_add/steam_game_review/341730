The main issue is the level design(s). Most levels are meant to be finished within 3-4 minutes, some maybe even in 1 minute. With only 25 levels, that doesn't sound like a lot a content. Obviously, it does require multiple attempts to get a gold medal for some levels, but the length is still questionable. The lack of content becomes even more visible when you notice some levels are repeated. You have to fly through the same cave atleast 6 times, and that is excluding attempts to get a gold medal. It becomes tedious fairly quickly in overall because the whole premiss of the game is to retrieve an objective and bring it back to base. With a maximum of 8 places in your chopper (less with the starter choppers), this means you'll have to fly back and forth many times.\n\nIt isn't a very challenging game, despite the inconsistent controls (especially in the caves, where your movement might even jump up in speed randomly). It's a simplistic, little game, with little customization that suffers from poor game/level design. Worth a look when on sale, and best played in small, 10 minute sessions.\n\nPS: this game does NOT have full controller support. You still need a keyboard to activate menu selections and to pause/exit the game. In fact, you can only bind the 2 commands (going left oand right) to the triggers or face buttons of the controller.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500247697, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500249526, "recommendationid": "33596511", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520288", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 61, "total_reviews": 72, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
