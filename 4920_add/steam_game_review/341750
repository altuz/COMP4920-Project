I'm writing this to try to get this game out of the \"mixed\" and into the \"positive\" catagory. \n\nI saw this game when it was on sale and it looked very interesting so I bought it and it is easily worth the full 7 bucks. I am really enjoying the Sensory Experience (which this game has won an achievement for). The music is awesome, the fact that everything interacts with the music is amazing!!\n\nMore to come as I spend more time in the game which I plan to do over the next couple weeks.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437791604, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438015992, "recommendationid": "17214133", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 8, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
