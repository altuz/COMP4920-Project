That being said, the game is highly re-playable and being a speed runner you'll be back improving on your previous times to get the gold medal or place in the leaderboards which will extend the games length by quite some time.\n~ Visuals can be repetitive but it adds to the retro style\n~ Doesn't make use of the analog stick - DPad only for movement. Having analog support would be nice but I don't believe it's required, I never felt like the Dpad was holding me back.\n~ Keyboard controls are odd at first honestly but can be rebinded in the menu if needed.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430257072, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430257072, "recommendationid": "15602631", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523277", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431426469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 121, "steamid": "76561197969661496", "num_games_owned": 52}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ahhh this game brings back memories. In short it's like playing Mario doing parkour. The difficulty level increases very quickly and it makes you want to finish the maps and beat your times.

The difficulty is fair, like some of those great early games!   You just want to keep on playing.\nThe art is wonderful, with scrolling backgrounds like in Sonic.  The first level gives us places to walk through that give a story through these nice pictures.\nThe controls are very responsive!  I also enjoyed the music.\nIt was great seeing the leader board to encourage you to keep trying to discover ways to beat others times just like in the old ARCADE games!\nThe only thing is that you may be frustrated.  But why is that a bad thing?  Just keep playing anyway, just like in the classics!  We are too used to games holding our hand and not letting the player fail even a little bit that people forget the classics of how games used to be made.\nThere are infinite lives, so that should cheer you up :)\nGo on, support indie games like this!

Green's complement, something like Magenta, would have made a lot more sense.\n-Doesn't really offer anything substanial. Nothing new or interesting, or solid in nature.\n\nFlem does attempt to be a speedrunner, but basic elements of level design and layout show a game that doesn't have the elements to appeal to its core audience. Leap of Faith gameplay combined with off screen projectiles can frustrate the player, while precision with jumping due to using the dpad with a controller for an example hinders the experience.
