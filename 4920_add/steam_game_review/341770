Most of the puzzles can be completed without thinking by randomly dropping the wheels in various places until everything starts moving.\n\nThe game mechanics are very limited. There are four types of gears:\n\n[list]\n[*]white (small and big): You can pick it up and drop it in any free space you want.\n[*]yellow: Has a fixed position and rotates on its own.\n[*]blue: Has a fixed position. All blue gears need to rotate at the same time to complete a puzzle\n[*]orange: Has a fixed position. It attracts your white gears (if close) and therefore prevents them from falling down (they stick to the orange gear)\n[/list]\n\nThe levels also contain varying amounts of green pegs, which prevent your white gears from falling through. A few of the later levels also include glass \"walled\" areas where direct placement of gears is not possible (but gears can fall into and through those areas if placed outside and moved there by other gears/gravity).\n\nThe only puzzle that I spent more than 2 minutes on was the last one, which actually did require some thinking and planning to complete. All others were simply too easy.\n\nBeyond that, there are many other things to criticize:\n\n[list]\n[*]There is no music.\n[*]There is no fullscreen mode (the game starts with a fixed resolution/size window and can't even be resized).\n[*]There are no options (e.g. to disable sounds or change the volume)\n[*]The game doesn't keep track of completed levels (all levels are selectable at any time)\n[*]The \"Menu\" is just a level select screen, that also allows to select levels higher than 30 (by clicking the white space below the last levels), but which just results in an empty playing field with \"Level XX\" printed in the top right corner, e.g. \"Level 47\".\n[/list]\n\nUltimately this just feels like a test application for a simple physic engine, not a game. And the physics aren't that great to begin with, as the gears tend to jerk around and even have their teeth move through each other, when you create a lock-down situation which forces two interlocked gears to rotate against each other instead of with each other. \n\nThis \"game\" is, in my opinion, just a very simple tech demo. Which was very disappointing, because the game mechanics could be vastly expanded upon with (what should be) little effort:\n\n[list]\n[*]Require a specific direction and/or speed in which the blue gears need to turn in order to win a puzzle\n[*]Magnetic gears that are only magnetic while they rotate or gears that have other special effects only when they rotate\n[*]New mission types, e.g.: prevent already rotating yellow gears from turning (intentionally produce deadlocks)\n[*]Additional layers of complexity: e.g. make the players choose (with some limitations) what type of gears they want to use. Or give them a limited amount of \"paint\" to choose themselves which color the fixed wheels have (e.g. there are 6 fixed wheels, you get to choose which two are magnetic).\n[*]Maybe even give the player other types of gears, e.g. \"sticky\" wheels that would stick to any other gear that they touch, similar to how magnetic gears work.\n[/list]\n\nIt really isn't hard to think about ways that could make the simple \"place cogs to cause motion\" game mechanic a lot more engaging and allow for more complex and difficult challenges. But until then:\n\n[b]My final verdict:[/b] If you like challenging puzzle games, search elsewhere.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431720602, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431721226, "recommendationid": "15843742", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604214", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431748686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 83, "steamid": "76561197984406904", "num_games_owned": 1156}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Picked it up because it looked really interesting and fun, and it is, but it really feels unfinished.
