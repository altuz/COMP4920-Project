Fantastic visuals, Awesome musical score, challenging combat, and a few fun extras like boat combat and free movement fighting in the arena. Would definitely recommend especially if you enjoyed the first, as basically everything was improved from the first game. \n\nI especially would like to point out that the final boss is not an anti-climactic pushover like you see in some games, as I found myself pulling out all the stops and items I saved throughout the game and still barely managed to beat him(I even did a couple hours of grinding beforehand!) That being said I'd just like to also make clear that the game wasn't too heavy on the grinding levels either so it doesn't get tedious.\n\nI'm really excited to see the DLC for this game and later on more episodes.

After RPG's today have become so complicated that even a strategy guide isn't going to help, this is the kind of throwback that is required in today's setting. \n\nBe prepared, however, that you might want to play the first game before you play this, so you get an understanding of the events of this game, though it won't be completely necessary. The first game is full of humor, and this game takes a turn to the dark side, with dark humor, which is my kind of humor, as well as a more serious tone to the game. \n\nThe game has a strong opening, but unless you're paying attention, you're gonna get confused because, in a similar fasion of Final Fantasy VI, the game splits up the party into groups, each with it's own unique storyline and undertone. Characters do not level up with you, so when you get to another party or group, the levels they had before the split (if any at all) are not up as well. There will be some grinding, however, the Scion Grid system, similar in fasion to Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid (except each character has their own and you cannot enter anyone elses upon completion) to get your skills and big stat boosts. \n\nI've heard a common complaint that you can't use a mouse to play this game. Why does that even matter, this is an RPG, not a first person shooter or even a third person. The mouse should be for clicking NPCs in a 3D world, not a 2D world. Also I play with an Xbox Controller, so the mouse would be more of an inconvienence if it was implemented into the game. Another common complaint I've read is that it's made in RPG Maker VX...yeah, well, I've seen worse games done in other engines, so using that as an excuse to not play a game is really lame.\n\nThere are a few things that are annoying. One of my biggest pet peaves in any game is the hit detection on some moves. Skills and magic CAN miss in this game, and it will make you cuss in some cases (with me it did). \n\nAs stated before, the game is extremely dark compared to the first, so humor, unless it's messed up like mine, you will not find a lot of it in this game. Also, the storyline, you HAVE to pay attention to it or you will get lost or confused. And word of advice, take notes on locations of towns and people. Yeah, that does sound bad, but in some cases, it'll help you later in the game when you have to backtrack if you need to restock or anything.\n\nOne other annoyance is the missibility of some items as well as a \"Point of No Return\" situation in some cases. Lots of saves are required in case anything is missed, whether it be a certain item or an achievement. Again, multiple saves are necessary.\n\nOne thing I did enjoy is, like Chrono Trigger, you see the enemies on screen, making it easy to bypass battles if you are injured and need to get to a save crystal or something similar. However, I do not recommend avoiding battles, as you do need to get your levels up to withstand a boss or two, as well as ensuring your HP is good if you hit a trap. Items do restock in the towns as well as new goodies, so pay attention to the on screen text when a character says they shops are restocked. \n\nMoney is also kind of a problem, as there usually requires some grinding to get enough in game gold (steryn) to purchase items, equipment, upgrades, etc. etc. and you will go through it like an archery contest. Not until midway or late in the game (depending on when you do it) will steryn not really become a problem to achieve, and once you get to this point, you can stock up on as many potions and ethers as needed in the shops. Once this is achieved, unless you honestly suck or get bad luck, you'll be ready for anything.\n\nThe graphics are stunning for a 32 bit game, with good detail and in depth colors. The storyline is dark, and if you get emotionally attached to your characters (don't say this doesn't happen to a gamer in any game, if you do, you're not a gamer), you will shed a tear or feel bad or gut wrenched in some cases. The music has some headbanging to it, though the boss music, get ready to get tagged on youtube if you decide to upload your own footage. I do like the title track \"Subside\" which is an original composition to the game. Very beautiful song, and headbang worthy too.\n\nI played this game directly from Kisareth Studios, so my play time is off by nearly 10 hours, but sticking with the main storyline, the game has over 25 hours of playability, and with the side quests, an additional 10, for a total of around 35 hours. It is well worth it, as well as additional goodies coming soon. \n\nIt's worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434320993, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434320993, "recommendationid": "16402421", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501419", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1476123994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561198031859124", "num_games_owned": 272}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "ok had a ctd runtime issue in the first few min tried to reinstall but still crashed :(", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1476124071, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1476124071, "recommendationid": "25970374", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427766600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1101, "steamid": "76561198050761009", "num_games_owned": 104}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great continuation of the story from Episode 1.

Good luck, it never works.\n\nSpells you learn do not become more powerful with leveling up.  Rather, the  spells you learn at higher levels are more powerful.  This is really annoying.  It means that flamberge you learned at level 10 won't be doing much damage at level forty.\n\nEnemies don't have elemental weaknesses unless you give them one!  This is so annoying.  Although its supposed to be why you have the Tiarna on your team (She can give elemental weaknesses to enemies) good luck keeping her alive long enough to use her.  She's really weak.  And, as far as I've leveled her up, she doesn't learn any elemental spells herself.  So you also have to keep alive your valmerian mage/conjurer or pair her with magus in order to use her effectively.  It would be nice if some enemies had elemental weaknesses already built in.  Most don't.  As a player, this can be really confusing.  (you constantly have to guess what random spell is going to be effective against a boss, for example.) I don't think a game should give you all the answers, but a working elemental system is something to be expected from an rpg game.  I defeated a lot of enemies just by striking, which gets tiresome.\n\nEnemy variety: although there are a lot of enemies in this game, the variety in each stage is really repetitive.\n\nVictory message variety: there isn't much!  If I had a dollar for every time I heard Nightshade complain about potions I'm pretty sure I'd be a millionaire.\n\nOther problems:\nNo sidequests.  I was really hoping for some.  Having multiple places (more than two) to go on any given map would make the game a lot more fun.  The overworld maps are huge, but there's almost nothing on them.\n\nYou almost NEVER pick up armor.  It would be nice to at least pick some up so you don't have to buy it at every shop.\n\nThere's no downtime between battles.  Believe me, defeating Lord Anto's first form and then not getting a save?  Oh. My. God.\n\nStill, there are a lot of positives.  As you go along, you get more and more attached to the characters and you want them to win.  (Although Magus is a complete slimeball at points).\n\nThe developer's room is clever.\n\nI'm not even sure what to think of the game over screen.  It is....unique.\n\nWould I recommend?  Yes, if you need a game to keep you occupied.
