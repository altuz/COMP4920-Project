A nicely challenging game about plushes, which cannot be on a bed together as long as they aren't positioned after rules, that only a child could make up. It is quite clear, that a father and his daughter had a lot of love to share, giving us this game. Worth every penny, and really heartwarming. Who doesn't want to have a bed full of happy plush animals?\n\nFollow me as a curator at http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28337205-Fair-Minded-Witness/?appid=298050", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503360707, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504476901, "recommendationid": "34405279", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505396", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 29, "total_reviews": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
