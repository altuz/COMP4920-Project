The secondary developer known as \"Maxwolf\" (who helped develop some minor features) was given permission to publish the game on Steam if he split the profits with Mladen.  Unfortunetely, there was a falling out between the two and Maxwolf has been keeping all the profits to himself and has shut Mladen out of the game entirely.\n\nMoving on to my review on the game itself:\n\n+ Gameplay is actually pretty fun. It's a first person shooter adventure game where you basically go from level to level destroying a bunch of robots with various weapons and vehicles\n+ Visually I thought each level was very detailed, and there's a mix of indoor and outdoor areas. \n+ Story and enemy design seem to be influenced a bit by portal. They even refer to each room as \"testing chambers\" with a \"robot mastermind\" (GLaDOS) who talks to you as you progress. There's even writing on the walls from previous test subjects.\n\n- The voice acting isn't great, and at times it's hard to understand what is being said while fighting through hordes of robots.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493382280, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493382347, "recommendationid": "31414812", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690602", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "total_reviews": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
