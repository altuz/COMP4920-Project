You control a war elephant to kill hostile aliens and rescue civilians of the earth. The visual effects are overall pleasant to the eyes, expect that the alien soldiers are too small to see sometimes. The level design is nice, making most of the play course very smooth and fluent, like the classic Sonic games (which were also from SEGA). \nThe game is not quite hard itself, but some check points are placed improperly and may require you to back-track a little for killing the enemies shortly before the check point which are not recorded after your death.\nAnother minor thing I want to complain about is that the water tanks automatically fill your water supply but render you vulnerable by holding you in position for about 1 second. I got hit a hanful times because of this delay, especially in the last boss fight.\n\nOverall, Tembo offers fun 2D action game experiences for about 4 hours (just clearing all the stages, without completing all achievements) at a reasonable price.
