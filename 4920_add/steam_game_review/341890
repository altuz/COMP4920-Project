Of course if more people would be playing this game you could actually play multiplayer. But for me its whatever you could set the bot difficulty on max and they would play betetr that most players. Id give this game an 8/10. And if a couple thousand people would play it every day  then it would be a solid 9/10. Really proud of m purchase, even more when it was only 2 bucks on the summer sale. But anyway it has a good soundrack when youre ingame, and the game itself is well programed. If youre skeptical on buying it try the demo, its free.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498993920, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498993920, "recommendationid": "33126446", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 4}}
