There is a large choice of races and it is playable in splitscreen up to 4 players !\n\nTHE ONLY CON is it is not available for Linux -_-\n\nTo play in higher resolutions : \n\nYou just have to edit the file settings.ini located in : \nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Sonic and SEGA All Stars Racing \nto play with this resolution. Easy, simple and efficient.\n\nIt also supports controllers, i play with a PS3 controller, to play this way :\n\nFollow this link to configure it without motionjoy (avoid motionjoy if you can) : \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse/discussions/0/864980009937564570/"}]}
