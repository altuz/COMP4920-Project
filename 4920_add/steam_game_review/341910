The tension and onslaught of Space Hulk, where campaign ending death can occur at any moment.\n\nRogue-like randomisation, permadeath, one-save, possible to make campaign ending mistakes both tactically and strategically.\n\nOldschool difficulty.  Normal is hard, hard is Ninja Gaiden/Battletoads sewer difficulty.\n\nTons of items.  Random unique shiny loot.  Melee weapons.  Lasers, flamethrowers, tranquilizers, rocket launchers, miniguns, and everythig else under the sun.  Each weapon has multiple attack modes, mods, and different types of ammo.  Will you survive long enough to make use of any of it?\n\nHelpful, responsive developer.\n\nCons:\n\nTedious, at times infuriating looting system that trolls you and can cause campaign restarts.  Your commandos only have 9 slots, most of which will be filled with essential items, which means you'll spend a lot of time micromanaging inventory space to pick up loot after battle.  Missions will abruptly end before you can reclaim deployed equipment/pick up loot.  I'd kill for an option just to have all discovered/deployed items on the floor automatically looted after a successful mission.. it's all just unnecessary downtime that gets in the way of the tense combat .\n\nWeird, arbitrary firing angle rules on the majority of weapons/firing modes, limiting your shots  to UDLR and diagonals. Granted a token few are simply LOS, but the vast majority use the \"star\" aiming system.  Overwatch/defend mode and monsters completely ignore these limitations.\n\n\nThe visuals are what you'd expect from a one-person project, but combat/gameplay trumps everything.. and USC has damn good combat.

It doesn't perhaps expand on them a great deal. You do the usual of equipping your squad with a range of weaponry and other equipment, finding upgrades, crafting materials and protoypes to get better weaponry, whilst gunning down aliens en masse on te tactical map. A game doesn't really need to expand on something like Laser Squad to be good fun. And this is mostly true of USC.\n\nKilling aliens seems to be a case of expending huge amounts of ammo; clicking lots of times for low-cost shots that knock of relatively small amounts of health. This gives the game a certain attractive aesthetic I quite like of marines pouring vast quantities of lead at hordes of aliens. On the other hand, it also takes quite a lot of time and makes it seem like a bit of a grind. Aliens explode into blood splats (often toxic radioactive blood that is dangerous to step into), and the playing area rapidly fills up. Preparation is a big part of USC: you have to make sure you go into a level with the right weapons, equipment and enough ammo, otherwise you'll be in trouble.\n\nHowever, USC is rather a mess. The UI is undoubtedly clumsy. Sure, you'll learn to navigate it at least reasonably smoothly, but it should be better. Everything is graphically cluttered: the interface, the levels which are totally full of stuff and frequent narrow corridors (reminiscent of Space Hulk). I find the procedurally drawn levels have annoying bugs: corridors without access except by destroying walls; once my marines arrived into a level and the start room opened straight into half a dozen crates blocking the passageway that I had to destroy before I could go anywhere. I'm not sure how well worked many levels are: some listed the resistance as \"low\" and yet my squad of four ended up permanently swarmed by aliens (aliens can spawn: no matter how many I killed, there seemed to still be another 40 left) until I ran out of ammo and/or medkits. Unless the mission is some sort of hold out as long as possible (and it wasn't), this is more tedious than it is fun.\n\nIn the end, I think USC is a significantly flawed and slightly frustrating game that falls well short of what it could have been, and in some ways less fun than its stylistic ancestors. Nevertheless, if you like this sort of Laser Squad type of game, you'll find something to enjoy, and it has some promise that I hope the developers build on.\n\nIt is with these caveats and the modest price tag I just about recommend it; I would be far less forgiving were it more expensive.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431885978, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431885978, "recommendationid": "15875465", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520778", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433409955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2907, "steamid": "76561198071927590", "num_games_owned": 296}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An interesting game with some intense combat and roguelike dead system.

The combat similarly seemed very chaotic at first (especially when I jumped right into a one-off single mission with hordes of weird aliens - I tried to hide in my elevator but they started eating through the walls and electrocuting me and who knows what. But then I started the campaign and tutorial scenario and it was nice and slow and full of skippable explanations and things made sense from there out. Now there is still often all sorts of chaos, but it makes sense and I get what's going on even when monsters are eating through nearby walls and chain reactions of fuel and ammunition are ripping through a base and setting monsters on fire who go running away while other types come creeping in, etc...\n\nIt has most of the things I want in such a game, including many that are fairly hard to find all in one game:\n\n* A campaign where you can manage your squad, trying to keep them alive through many battles, see them improve through experience and adjust their equipment and so on.\n* Enough challenge and risk and permadeath, and no expectation to savescum/replay when things go wrong.\n* More or less fully destructable environment, where missed shots and violence damage everything - walls and doors and objects, accidental \"friendly\" fire, etc.\n* Tactics that mostly make sense and arise naturally from simulating the situation in ways that mostly make sense, with overwatch, use of cover and doors, a variety of weapon effects and skills, etc.\n* Interesting, meaningful, and logical choices both at the tactical level and between missions.\n* Freedom to try various approaches, as far as weapons and tactics, but also taking time to rest and repair at the risk the aliens will come after your base, etc.\n* In the campaign, you manage 16 men but only use one or two squads per mission, so you can choose who to send on attacks, who to leave behind resting or doing repairs, and whether to try to get experience for the greener people or not.\n* Nice relative absence of contrived scenarios and hoops to jump through, compared to some games. More of a chaotic simulation feel, which I like, though also with a fun/gamey/dark-humorous flavor.\n* Details of ammo/equipment management, but not too much.\n\nOne great thing I didn't expect is the Defend The Base mode, which lets you set up a base and try to defend it against increasingly stronger waves of aliens, with damage details (including spilled fuel and acid and so on) being carried over, and limited resources to repair or re-arrange things, and an option to retreat rather than hold once the position seems untennable. Nice!\n\nAlso, the game is still in development and the developer is listening and adding some things that players have asked for, which is awesome, and in my very long experience with games, is what makes for the best games. For example, one thing that was jarring to me was the firing arcs of some weapons, which were limited during one's own turn to firing along straight or diagonal grid lines, which the developer had an interesting intention for doing, but which seemed unnatural to me (in contrast to the way most of the rest of the game works in ways I would expect, in nice detail, in fact). Turns out in response to player comments, they are working for an option to not do that, for players who don't want it, which may be in the next patch. Sweet!\n\nI have a few gripes but nothing major. The odd firing arcs of some weapons was probably my biggest nitpick. The looting and inventory manipulation can be a bit fiddly but it hasn't bothered me too much yet, and I quite appreciate all the detail and choices. I could even wish it were more fiddly, as I find the recycler and manufacturing of new items during the campaign is very generous and I'd be interested to have to make do more with what I find. (Though without the recycler/manufacturer the lack of storage slots would become an issue.) Mainly I'd just like more of the same. I expect I will eventually have had enough for a while and wish for another campaign, but for now I'm happily hooked.\n\nAnyway, I quite recommend Ultimate Space Commando!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449176402, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449176402, "recommendationid": "19465100", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512732", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1434065453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 435, "steamid": "76561197963664525", "num_games_owned": 715}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A surprisingly well made game.

It allows a lot of customization in terms of what kinds of weapons you want on your squad, and what other support equipment. And specialization of your characters into different roles.\n\nDestructable terrain and explosives play heavily into the tactics.

I really don't think this should be marked as a \"full release\" yet. There are a few reasons why.\n\nThere are a few minor (but noticable) spelling and grammar mistakes, along with a lack of continuity, at least where I got in the campign (which is barely past the tutorial). A character has the rank of (in their panel) Petty Officer, but is addressed as a Corporal by a Lieutenant. What? Did the writers not agree somewhere?\n\nThe basic gameplay and mechanics is more or less XCOM, but in space. If you've played XCOM, you've played this game. There isn't anything I've seen so far that sets it apart, although this is subjec to change.\n\nWhat I [i] don't [/i] like is the fact that you're stuck with character names for the campign. While I guess it makes sense, it also puts up a barrier between the player and the game, because they aren't able to relate as well with characters the dev's named, in this sort of game at least.\n\nThere are also no animations, in regards to movement and attacking. It's sliding around on the screen, with sound effects. The first thing I thought of, was ToME, in regards to it. Games like that can get away with it, because they're cheaper. At least very minor ones would be nice, for a game that is charging $20 (keep in mind I bought this at $15) to play. Not that it's terrible how it is, it's just kinda a mild annoyance.\n\nIt also suffers from the same annoying \"multiplayer\" that some other indie games do. The one that is inputting an IP address, and hoping it connects. Unless you know somebody who can port-forward every day, or some shell server, you won't be getting on multiplayer, as there is no server browser or even a quick-match service.\n\nWith the rather hefty price tag in mind, unless things get patched and added for the game, this isn't a game you should pick up if you have played games such the older (or newer) XCOM.

Quite a bit of micro, and lots of freedom to do what you want. It's a yes.\n\nReview Proper:\n\nUltimate Space Commando is a bit deceiving. The name sounds like a weird Japanime crossover thing that's gotta be horribly translated, and the graphics are kinda ugly, even for a retro-esque game like this. That said, the gameplay itself is great, the freedom the mechanics offer is pretty hard to match, and it's certainly addictive.\n\nThe concept is pretty simple - you've crashlanded on a far away planet, and need to escape. To do this, you need to fight through enemies, collect materials, and maybe uncover some answers as to what's been happening. You'll upgrade your gear on the way, meet increasingly scary [s]sprites[/s] monsters matched only in their deadly-ness by their ugliness, and uncover little bits of a surprisingly well translated story on the way.\n\nAs many have mentioned, it plays a lot like older X-Com, Jagged Alliance, Silent Storm, etc. etc. As of such, there's some great stuff, some stuff you might love or might hate, and some meh stuff.\n\nThe Good:\n\nFirst off, this is currently about the same price of a pack of smokes. That's never bad, particularly when the game is actually good, like this one is.\n\nThe combat is interesting, and the \"18 distinct weapons\" are actually pretty distinct. Even the shitty starting guns can be upgraded to respectable death machines with their own advantages. That's kinda cool.\n\nThe story is good for this kind of game - for one, it actually exists, and for two, it's reasonably coherent.\n\nDev support is great. Think I waited something like 3 hours to have my question answered. Given that you'll often only hear the words \"there's only one dev\" followed by some excuse as to why it shouldn't matter that a game sucks, is broken, or what have you, it's actually pretty mindblowing when you consider that this lady has managed to make a game that suffers from none of the above, is more indepth and packed with features than most multi-dev projects in the same genre, and is just genuinely good, while still having time to reply directly to the fanbase in a prompt manner.\n\nIt's [b]HOTSEAT MULTIPLAYER[/b]. Seriously, why the fuck are all games like this, not to mention turn based 4x games, not hotseat multiplayer anymore?\n\nThe mechanics run deep.\n\nYou generally don't die because something utterly unfair has happened. Sometimes you get unlucky, but usually, you just fucked up.\n\nThere's really alot of good to say about this game, but the store page itself lays most of it out very well, so there's no need for me to do it again.\n\nThe Mixed:\n\nYou need to buy and manually equip every bullet you fire, every healthpack you use, and literally anything else you might expend in a mission. I don't mind this, because I grew up when games were like this, but some people might.\n\nYou have a very limited inventory. Your guys can only carry what they can carry in nine inventory slots, and you can only store nine things at your base. There are some good mechanics to help you not lose out on potential loot during a mission - namely that materials are automatically picked up at the end of most missions, and you can \"field salvage\" weapons and stuff for a percentage of their value if you don't have room to pack them back - but if you like to hoard stuff, you might find this irritating.\n\nIt's a little punishing. The mechanics run deep, but aren't usually very evident. Part of the fun of these kinds of games can come from figuring stuff out, but there's just some things you can't know until something goes wrong, or unless you ask the devs directly. Or read the manual, but who does that?\n\nSimilarly, the UI is oldschool. It's not as incomprehensible as some of the games it imitates, but it's not incredibly intuitive either. On the flip side of this, it's actually pretty simple once you get the basics down, and thus the learning curve isn't so bad.\n\nThe translation is surprisingly good, but it still seems fairly evident that the writing is either done by a complete amateur, or a non-native english speaker. That really doesn't matter at all to me, since it's still effective in getting the story across, and you're supposed to build your own attachments to your troops in these kinds of games, not have them thrust on you. But it might matter to someone. The only real complaint this causes is that sometimes, instructions are a little unclear.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThere's not a lot to say here, but a two things do come to mind.\n\nThe fields of fire are messed up. You can only shoot straight, like a rook in chess, unless you're in defensive mode. Then you get a much larger field of fire. I'm guessing there is some reason behind this, but I haven't encountered it yet.\n\nIt's ugly. I couldn't design something prettier, but it's basically animation free, overly sterile, and just not pretty. This usually doesn't matter to me in games, and likely wouldn't here if the graphics style was something else, but I just don't like it much.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll in all, this is really a hidden gem. It's cheap, has hotseat and online multiplayer, great gameplay, and tons of replayability. It's a really good game that catches the feel and style of 1990s turn based games very well, without descending into mediocre mechanics and design flaws.\n\nI should also mention that there's a ton of other features such as an annual tournament, a series of challenge and other game modes, and a bunch of other neat crap I didn't touch on in the review because I haven't played around with them yet. There's a good bit of content I don't even know about, personally.\n\nIf this is your type of game, then you may find this is the best ten bucks or so you'll ever spend on Steam.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477529281, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1477798661, "recommendationid": "26238955", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502587", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1470789217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 617, "steamid": "76561198069922743", "num_games_owned": 65}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Have logged a few hours, both on & off Steam.
