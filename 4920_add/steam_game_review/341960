To begin with its simple to add animations to 2d images, I bought it to use as a quick way to make backgrounds and title screens in game development.  I am very happy so far.\n\nPros \nEasy to use.\nCan create fantastic effects quickly.\nExports to multiple formats gif, PNG, AVI and lots more.\nHas lots of potential.\nActually really fun to mess around with photos you have saved on your pc\n\nCons \nNearly twice the price on steam than buying directly (with steam you get lifetime updates, buying directly you only get 6 months).\nSteam user updates every 3 months (not a problem yet but as I have paid more I would expect major updates around the same time).\nLimited amount of animations (this will grow depending on how much the developer decides to invest in this project).\nUnable to create custom animation brushes (yet?) Can add some of your own such as text and upload animations, the built in animations seem really flexable you have a lot of options to play with.\nAs new lack of some features I.e. undo expected in future developments so do not let this put you off.\n\nOverall has lots of potential and suits my needs at the moment give it a go you will be amazed at some of the effects you can create.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424301303, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424332597, "recommendationid": "14536312", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601592", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484479904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 4670, "steamid": "76561198023457942", "num_games_owned": 216}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I like this program! I did a video on it how you can stream live and use the animation maker doing effects during a live stream and currently is my top video I have ever made on youtube. Its been about 1 week and the video has had over 80,000 minutes watched. Quite a amazing program I would like you to see me using the Dp Animation Maker.

This thing is like magic or something.

My mind is flooded with all the possiblities that this software can help me relize. Although super easy to use and accaully fun to use..there is real power here going on in the background.
