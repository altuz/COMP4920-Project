It has aged, but not exactly gracefully. It's not horrible either. But it just isn't really good either.\n\nFor 5\u20ac, it's too little. I bought it in the Popcap Bundle, so it was alright, I guess? \n\nStill, for demanding 5\u20ac and then giving you relatively monotonous gameplay... it's too much money. It's just too much for so little actually happening. That's why I wouldn't recommend buying this game.\n\nOh, and just for the sake of completion: You play as one of four heroes to save the Iggles, a race of furry little creatures color-coded and caught in bubbles by some kind of evil force. Yeah. That's the sum of it. You move through a little labyrinth, collect the Iggles, avoid the baddies, and send the Iggles home with the approrpiate home fields.\n\nAnd... that's it. For 101 levels in Adventure mode.
