That said, sadly, I don't really feel this game is worth the money. \n\nThe map designs are done fairly well, but the tilesets are all stock from RPG maker and it gives it an overly familiar look since I've seen them all many times before in other amatuer games. It looks like the only original items are the character sprites. There is a good use of scripts though from around the web, I can see a few from Yanfly and others that the game maker must be using. For those that aren't familiar with RPG maker, there's modded functionality in this game, things like mouse support aren't part of the basic RPG maker engine, which is nice to see. \n\nThe biggest drawback to this game is unfortunately the storyline and the dialogue. Story and dialogue should be the meat and potatoes of an RPG. The opening scene has a CEO just proclaiming \"I want to go on adventure!\" and then gathering a few friends amongst unexplained happenings, and then transitioning with \"They adventure for days until Catz suddenly falls asleep\" segwaying into a dream sequence that also doesn't explain anything.  Characters are introduced with groan worthy lines like \"Ugh, I can't stand you my non-vampire twin sister,\" and then follow up with lamenting that her sister hates her, going to check on her mecha blueprint, and activating a dreamworld. None of these are explained as to why someone's a vampire, what they're doing with a mecha, or what the dreamworld is. The lack of explaination extends to zero character developement and the whole game feels very much like you're playing someone's poorly written fan fiction. I don't know if there's a character primer I missed somewhere, I didn't see anything on the store page linking to one.\n\nI feel like this game is still a hobby project and not quite worthy of being on steam for sale. I applaud the creator for sticking with a project to create this much material, but the writing is so poor that it pretty much ruins the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429727072, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429727072, "recommendationid": "15493969", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655094", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429696088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 52, "steamid": "76561198028398042", "num_games_owned": 193}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 43, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So far not worth it... would have played longer if the game hadn't crashed. (might give it another go later)\n\nSo few words about it, the trailer video gave a really nice impression of the game, like there would be a deep story or characters with brilliant personalities. But immediately after starting the game I was stunned by the lack of, well any and all of what i consider a story. You're thrown into this world with very little knowledge of what's going on and zero backstory. I mean cmon, what i learned was basicly that the main heroine is a CEO or something and the first words i hear from her mouth is \"i wanna go for an adventure!\". There's no story arc (atleast not in the begining, what i consider pretty important) to immerse the player into the game, nor even clear directions, the first area is a big ass building and i had no idea where i was supposed to go.\n\nReally i will try it again because i wasted my money on this, had there been a review telling me anything above i wouldn't have bought it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429696945, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429696945, "recommendationid": "15488563", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534030", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438092414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 503, "steamid": "76561198061606765", "num_games_owned": 357}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I wanted to like this game, truly. But after completing it I have to mark it as a not recommended. Here is why. Hopefully the developer can use this information to fix the game in the future, or maybe for their next game. \n\nI'm going to use the GIMLET system the RPGAddict uses on his website to rate this game. Here we go:\n\n1: Game World: The game takes place in a world where there are vampires. That is about all I could gather via the game. There is some back story somewhere buired in a document, but in game you learn nothing. 1/10\n\n2: Character Development: Characters level at about the same pace as a standard RPGMaker game. Nothing new here, for good or bad. 5/10\n\n3: NPC Interaction: Minimal, and what little there is makes no sense when it happens. Also there are bugs where it will show people talking to the NPC that are not in the party (which shows up in flashback scenes if you go off the beaten path). 3/10\n\n4: Encounters and Foes: Starts off ok, but the developer seems to LOVE the paralyze status aliment. Expect to get paralyzed early and often. Also, paralyze never wears off, so until you can afford cures, paralyze is a death sentance. There is one early enemy that if it gets lucky enough to paralyze the wrong person (which happnes 1/3 of the time) its a game over, as you will be unable to kill it before it uses an attack that ko's the entire party. Endgame enemies also spam paralyze, silence, confustion, etc. Come prepared to want to punch something on your desk when you get to that point in the game.\n\nBosses come down to luck, as a couple of them have attacks that can paralyze the entire party. If it hits all 3 of your members, its a game over, as it will *never* wear off. And don't get me started on stun and how that has no cure either, as even the item that supposedly cures ALL status aliments but KO doesn't cure stun.\n\nIn summary, expect major balance issues, and random battles that are tougher than bosses, and bosses that come down to luck on whether or not you beat them. 0/10\n\n5. Magic and combat: The 'innovative' combat system was spam attack until everything is dead, though that does change when you get the overpowered skills. One will try to paralyze all enemies (which makes random battles a joke then). Another skill adds doom and paralyzes the enemy, and never misses (except on bosses). Cast that 3 times, battle over. 2/10\n\n6. Equipment: Despite 5 accessory slots, I never found a single accessory in the game. Armor is a joke due to how little it blocks, as you gain DEF at such a slow rate that having the best armor give +50% DEF means nothing. Also, why is there nothing to boost the MAT of the spell casters? They don't care about the ATK stat. As it is, I was better off attacking with them as they did less damage with their spells by the end of the game. 1/10\n\n7. Economy: Broken as can be. Early game you can't afford KO revival items, but if you get past that and to the second and third zones, you can easily afford the best weapons in the game (which, sadly, the best weapon costs the same as 8 KO revival items)! After that, battle is just spam attack until they are all dead. 1/10\n\n8. Quests: A couple side quests are hinted at (monster arena, trials), but that's about it. The main quest is as random as a squirrel on energy drinks and has no logical flow to it. 1/10\n\n9: Graphics, sound and interface. The one strong spot of this game. The graphics are nice, and the sound is nice too. The interface is a little odd, especially in crafting, as I often accidentally started to craft as I had no idea I had selected an item yet! Also, when you go to equp an item, the stat changes do not properly show, so expect a little guessing there. 7/10\n\n10: Gameplay. Plays ok. If you can handle the old school Wizardry and D and D games you can find some fun in this. Myself, I kept going as I wanted to see if this went anywhere at all. And while some people rip the opening of the game, many old games of the 80's and 90's start off much worse than \"I wanna go on an adventure!\". \n\nOn another note, the dream sequences need to go. They add *nothing* to the game. If they were meant to add something, it needs to be explained somewhere in the game, as I saw zero point to them. 5/10\n\nTotal: 24/100. It has decent graphics, tries to introduce you to a new game world, but needs more direction and better balancing before I can recommend it. Add in more on *why* you are doing what you are doing. Better balance the enemies. You don't need to spam every status aliment under the sun to make a battle tough. You don't need 147500 HP to make a boss tough. Also, add a tutorial please.

Personally, I like even amateur games like this, knowing that someone went through some effort to write a story and use this medium to express their creativity.  It isn't perfect, but it is fun.  I splurged and bought the Deluxe Edition, and appreciated the additional manga and pictures.  In time, I think this developer will come out with something even greater.  Until then, I'm enjoying this.\n\nEdit:  In an attempt to make this review more helpful, I'm going to give details.  I like that the game has multiple difficulty settings.  I started playing in the hardest mode and find it challenging, but not TOO hard.  For flaws, yes, there are spelling and grammar errors spread out.  If you're looking for a deep story, it might not be here.  (I'm playing this to the end and I'll update as I find more depth.)  \nHaving not played an RPG Maker game in a long time, I like this game's combat system.  You have Mana and TP, giving more variety to kinds of attacks you can use.  I think the TP regenerates on its own as time goes by, but Mana has to be regenerated with potions.\nI like how your characters hit twice, though the enemies take damage as though it's one hit.  Each character can use 2 weapons at the same time, so you can attack with fire/ice at the same time, or normal/dark.  Switching up weapons can make a character's attack weaker or stronger, depending on the enemy.\nThere is a crafting system.  Though items seem to drop on Rare occasions, and I don't know whether you can collect them in the world (oh, if I could just chop a tree for wood!), it adds a fun dimension to shopping.  As I found out from my first experience, you have to pay attention.  A little red bar fills up, and you have to left-click as soon as it turns green to successfully craft an item.  If you fail, you gain some crafting XP, but the items are gone forever.  SAVE before trying this.\nAlso, there are fun test puzzles throughout the game, the first few dealing with pushing/pulling orbs around and getting to an exit.  The rewards tend to be small, but potions come in handy.\nLike the days of Dragon Quest, a level-up is a long way off, and earning money is hard (at least in the most difficult setting.  I don't know if it changes on easier settings.), but I enjoy the grind and the effort that went into creating original characters.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429883664, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430231464, "recommendationid": "15518275", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504336", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432882190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 100, "steamid": "76561197987494077", "num_games_owned": 170}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A game broken in every important way and with some truly spectacularly bad writing.\nhttps://youtu.be/jTsYZ_8S8wA", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432929270, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432929270, "recommendationid": "16063689", "language": "english", "votes_down": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490290", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441359511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198060726510", "num_games_owned": 302}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "i liked the generic names such as 'Catz' but the music really made me want to die.\n10/10 cat girl vampire power activate!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441359571, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441359571, "recommendationid": "17874308", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489292", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429728247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 76, "steamid": "76561198045890777", "num_games_owned": 332}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "4", "review": "the game stops being able to be played when u get ur shop 1 hour or so in cause of Xeno non stop ... .... ..... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... ... .... .... ....", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429728351, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429794472, "recommendationid": "15494245", "language": "english", "votes_down": 34, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446559", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 8, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 6}}
