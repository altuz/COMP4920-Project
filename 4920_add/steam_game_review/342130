It's loads of fun for the price it costs.\n\nPositive points:\n- Glorious Soundtrack\n- Great classic art style\n- Fun fast-paced dungeon crawling gameplay\n- Every dungeon feels unique.\n\nNegative points:\n- There is no tutorial on how making dungeons works.\n- The game is a grind.\n- Still buggy.\n- Some enemies are over-powered, whereas others are too weak. No balanced gameplay\n\n\nNOTE FOR THE DEVS: [spoiler] I was playing through a dungeon as a robot and the final boss was the mana guy (pink one, I forget the name). I beat him as the robot and kill him. As the death animation for the boss is playing, his attack is still going on (weird) and it kills me. The game pops up a white text box saying that my game has crashed and I need to abort. Weird glitch.
