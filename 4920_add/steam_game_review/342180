I started playing the story mode and for the next 3 hours thats all i did, and it was worth it. It was so much fun, and such a great expierence that when it ended, i literally refused to accept the fact it ended. I want more, i want so much more. More story, more environment, more guns, more of the amazing voice actor you chose for the character, more freddy, I just need more. More of everything. I'd literally be willing to pay for a 2nd campaign. At first i thought i wouldnt like this game, but incase i did i decided to give it a try.

I don't know if it was just my copy or if it is a larger issue overall, but I experienced some bizarre texture/geometry issues where items or textures would appear and disappear as you moved around them. More prevalent towards the end of the storyline, and even with that happening it was still amazing.\n\nI was disappointed with the lack of functionality of a lot of items you can pick up. IE, stabbing a zombie with a shovel has no effect. The character you play as complains about being super thirsty, but when you find a bottle of water you can do nothing with it but throw it away uselessly. Melee weapons would add a lot to this game, but even still it's awesome. I loved finding the pistol I own in real life in one of the scenarios - +1 for weapons!\n\n9/10, will play again", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505483252, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505483252, "recommendationid": "34972220", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506405898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 242, "steamid": "76561197963870514", "num_games_owned": 218}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Favourite shooting experience in VR.
