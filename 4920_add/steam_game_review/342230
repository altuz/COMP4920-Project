(You don't need any skills. just fire away)\n\nThe thing is:\nDo you feel ripped off by Air Guardians? Well, to be honest, not really for such a price upon release.\nIt's not easy creating an air combat game from scratch, so you should take that in regard also and so far it's okay for the price.\nMaybe, with more work on the weapons systems (Limited number of bullets/rockets/bombs and target lock) it might be even better. But, on the other hand, it's not a simulator or AAA game. So, there's that.\n\nI think it's okay. Just for the fun of it and for the courage of the developer(s) to get something like Air Guardians done for a cheap price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422577396, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422577396, "recommendationid": "14232981", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620996", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429144432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 50, "steamid": "76561197985253346", "num_games_owned": 650}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 29, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1] A positive experience all things considered...\t [/h1]\n(Scroll down if the bottom line will suffice ^-^ )\n\nTo truly appreciate this game in a fair manner one has to compare it to something in it's own price range. This game costs 2,99\u20ac on steam at the time I write this review. 2,99\u20ac is roughly the same money I'd have to pay for a kebab or a bowl of noodles at our local chinese diner. Both worthwhile products in my opinion. \n\nWith that in mind, the game has a higher actual value than a meal in my opinion since A: you enjoy it at least a little longer and B: you can even replay/re-enjoy it (which would be fairly disgusting with the food I imagine...).\n\n[b]All that said, I'll start with what annoyed me[/b] (because I think that's what I'd usually do):\n\n[b] Horrible support for different controls [/b]\n- The game DOES offer some limited control customization, like, binding roll, yaw and pitch to different joystick axis and allowing to invert them as needed, along with a few select button functions needed in the game... actually there ARE just a few functions so I guess I could say 'all of them'. \nHowever the game does not recognize all buttons and/or axis on joysticks and controllers, some clearly different axis are registered as the same, some buttons aren't recognized at all while some multiple buttons are recognized as the same. HOTAS systems are the worst, as the game seems to randomly recognize roughly 10 or 11 buttons wildly strewn about both devices (I had to use a Hat on the throttle unit to fire minigun and missiles because triggers and releases on the stick weren't working). \n[u]Now for the fun part[/u], in order to play with mouse and keyboard, the game asks you to first unplug every controller and restart the game (quite the pilgrimmage for me...). \n\n[b] No Sound settings, no volume controls [/b]\n- The game is really really loud and it doesn't offer any way of adjusting volume to the user's needs. It's a small issue since you can simply reduce the games volume in windows' volume mixer, but nonetheless annoying.\n\n[b] Too short, too little content in general [/b]\n- Which, as I previously stated isn't that bitter since this game has the price tag of two big bottles of Coka Cola... and that stuff is unhealthy anyway...\nThe game has 7 short levels, one being the tutorial, one patrol (plain dogfight), one escort, one fleet battle, one bomber swarm intercept, one ground base attack and one space shipyard attack mission. All of these were fun but still ultimately sadly short.\n\"Story\" narration and general writing of dialogue for the short video sequences was outright horrible, and ultimately almost nonexistent.\n\n[b] Sad weapon balancing [/b]\n- There are three playable weapons in the game, heavy-hitting dumbfire missiles, Fire-and-Forget homing missiles and the fighter's autocannon. The missiles fulfill their purposes well (one being against larger ships, the other for fighters of course) but the autocannon has proven to be sadly pointless as it's damage output is too low to compete with the dumbfire missiles while it's bullet speed is too low to actually relieably hit fighters with it. Sad because it's (at least in my opinion) the coolest looking weapon.\n\n[b] Now for the positives =) [/b]\n\n- The gameplay is very simple and easy to master which provides a quick, short time enjoyment for which the game was obviously made. Simplicity isn't necessarily a bad thing after all.\n- Designs of fighter jets and and also some of the larger ships are quite cool, even in their simple technical execution some of these are superior to ones seen in some other games. \n- Nicely chaotic aerial combat. A few large vessels slugging it out among each other while you fly around between them hunting fighters, large numbers of enemies and allies in each battle, anti-air fire from larger ships or ground emplacement looks rather nice and\nthe most positive thing about it in my opinion:\nDestroyed enemy planes or ships don't just explode, they will fall/sink to the ground as burning smoking wrecks... really really cool!\n\nOkay I'm done. \nIf you like a quick uncomplicated piece of fun for the price of one kebab, if you like dogfighting in a decently cool sci-fi setting that lives without the classic laserguns and energy shields (also cool =D), if you don't mind possibly fiddleing around with controls or unplugging a controller and if you're fair enough not to expect too much from a game at such a price...\nI recommend it =)    \n\n     -> I've seen far worse, more expensive games being highly rated and sold a lot for smartphones.

Except that the turn and roll rates are quite slow, so it's a bit like playing a 3D FPS while standing in quicksand.\nEDIT: Turn rates somewhat improved as there was a bug affecting mouse sensitivity.\n\nAircraft move quite fast, so I found it very hard to get into a dogfight or bring my cannons to bear, as we'd just zoom past each other unable to chase each other every so often. The proximity (homing) missiles work though.\n\nThe game seems a bit unfinished. There are no ingame options or graphics settings. You can't customise the controls as far as I can see.

But probably not worth paying more than $0.99.\n\nIf you've got nothing else to do with your time, have a spare buck, it's on sale, AND you like to play flying games where pushing forward on the mouse points your nose at the ground, then sure, try it out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454952163, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454952163, "recommendationid": "21056506", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504772", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477687399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 52, "steamid": "76561198099788302", "num_games_owned": 165}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A good but also a very short game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451513050, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451513050, "recommendationid": "20129291", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436234232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561198009979779", "num_games_owned": 515}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "In the critical real world = 2/10\n\nIn the cut them a break; it's not a AAA game, It's a few bucks and quite a fun little game you'd expect to find at like an arcade, kind of \"world\" = 7/10\n\nI'm actually quite enjoying the game. Only on the second mission but still. I got it for $1.97 and I'd gladly give them double just to help the devs out. It does support Logitech Extreme 3d pro joystick. Probably supports others but that's the one I got. The default controls are wonky and weird. So definitely rebind your keys.\n\nPros:\nQuick, fun little dogfighting game\nPretty good landscape/background/ground textures/graphics actually\nInteresting plane/ship models\nControls are fairly responsive once you rebind them\nPretty good arcade style physics, speed is key\nJoystick support\nUnlimited ammo, regenerative health \nPretty \"diverse\" set of locations considering\n\nCons:\nGraphics are obviously overall pretty dated but clearly some love was put into them. (Not a biggie)\nVoice acting was pretty \"bad.\" But didn't bother me\nHorrible default keybindings (especially for joystick)\nNo graphical/audio options. Though any computer post 2008 can run the game but still. Would have liked to downsampled the game to get rid of the little bit of aliasing here and there.\nFew UI issues here and there, no biggie\nNo ECM/Chaff to help with avoiding lock on missiles, must dodge\nOnly 6 missions. I want MORE and I'm only halfway through it\n\nOverall: I'd say grab the game (even at normal price, $2.99) if you're into quick, fun, indie games that had some effort put into them, are updated, and aren't blatant cash grabs. Which this is NOT. Or if you enjoy dogfighting games. Let me be clear, this isn't an Ace Combat game, it isn't a AAA game, it doesn't have much of a story, or really a top knotch anything. BUT if you just want to have some quick dogfighting fun in fairly large aerial battles pick this up, help a small time developer who isn't all that bad. I'm only the second mission but really wanted to review thiis because I was actually pretty impressed considering. I didn't go in with high expectations and am pleasently surprised \"SO FAR.\"\n\nPick it up.
