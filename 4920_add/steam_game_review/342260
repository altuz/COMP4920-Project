You will explore the mind of people who've experienced a psychological trauma that they have forgotten or have suppressed but nevertheless defines their present state of mind. Your goal is to explore the strange surroundings the subject's mind shows you, piece together the traumatic event and solve a few puzzles that represent the mind throwing up barriers to hide the trauma from the subject's conscience mind and from your poking around. All this results in a very surrealistic gaming experience that screams originality, but I should warn the faint of heart that [i]Nevermind[/i] does contain some disturbing images due to its subject matter.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nGameplay-wise, [i]Nevermind[/i] plays like your standard first-person adventure game made with Unity. Controls are very basic: four keyboard keys to move around the game world, left click to interact with objects in the game world and right click to cancel an action.\n\n[i]Nevermind[/i] has controller support which is always a nice option, of course,  although I don't feel the need to grab a controller to play a game with such extremely basic controls and no dexterity requirements. And here I also need to mention an annoying fault in the game: when you have a controller plugged in, keyboard + mouse controls don't work. So you need to dive behind your PC to unplug that controller if you want to play [i]Nevermind[/i] using the keyboard + mouse. \n\nThere's one fake patient (a tutorial level) and four 'real' patients' minds to explore. In each patient's mind you start at a photo wall. While exploring the patient's mind, you'll find 10 photographs that each represent a thought or experience. You then need to select the 5 photos that are related to the traumatic event and put them in the correct order for the patient to face (and eventually resolve) the trauma.\n\nEach patient's mind is a very distinct 'world' with surrealistic landscapes and objects that hint to the traumatic experience. The mind throws up barriers to prevent you from getting at certain information, which is represented by puzzles you need to solve. Most of these puzzles aren't too hard, but a few of them do pose a challenge and will require some thought or a trial-and-error approach.\n\nWhen you've completed a patient's 'level', you can go back in and do it all over again but the second time, there's an added challenge of finding a number of objects that have something to do with the patient's trauma. On the one hand, this feels like a cheap way to add replayability but on the other hand, I didn't mind going through the 5 'levels' once more.\n\n[h1]Biofeedback technology[/h1]\n\n[i]Nevermind[/i] has an option to hook up compatible hardware like a webcam and/or supported heart rate sensor to measure your distress levels. When you're distressed, the game will translate that into the game world, as shown in one of the screenshots on the Steam Store page. I did not make use of this option so I can't judge it. If you want to try out the 'biofeedback technology' but setting it up or the result ends up frustrating you, I suggest you just forget about it and play the game without it. The game is certainly worth playing without this optional function and it seems that some people don't like the game only because the biofeedback doesn't work (properly), so don't let it get in the way of you enjoying [i]Nevermind[/i] as is.\n\n[h1]Graphics and sound[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are wonderful and impressive, especially considering [i]Nevermind[/i] was made with Unity, an engine that inherently results in cold, sterile graphics, which only a few developers have managed to hide well enough. I've rarely felt the need to take screenshots from a Unity-based game for my library but in [i]Nevermind[/i] I found myself often looking for the right angle for a nice screenshot.\n\nThe music, ranging from classical pieces to hard rock music, sounds fantastic and it always adds a lot of atmosphere to the scene. On this note, I really need to add that there's only one tune that sounds awful and even amateurish, and that's the very first part of music you'll hear when you start the game and you're in the office building where you'll be working from. First impressions are important, and the fact that [i]Nevermind[/i] first throws a piece of musac at you and only reveals its genuinely great soundtrack after that, is a poor choice on the part of the developers.\n\n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n\n[i]Nevermind[/i] has 6 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.\n\nThere are 17 Steam Achievements. They're all awarded for just playing the game and finishing all the levels, so there are no optional or missable achievements. Because of that, it's strange that all of the 17 achievements are marked as 'hidden', which just makes tracking your progress more difficult while serving no practical purpose like hiding story-related spoilers.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506189395, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506524960, "recommendationid": "35160033", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520934", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 60, "total_reviews": 95, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 35}}
