Simple enough, but where [b][i]Zombie Kill of the Week \u2013 Reborn[/i][/b] really shines is in the added layers of depth and huge variety of features and customisation available.\n\nSurviving longer gains you ZKW-Points which you can cash in to customize characters, customize weapons, buy new weapons, buy different perks, open new maps, and a lot lot more! Players also earn XP as they play, allowing them to level-up their character and develop them to fit their chosen gameplay skills. Survival is all about learning to use whatever you have.\n\n[b][i]Zombie Kill of the Week \u2013 Reborn[/i][/b] is a brilliant 2D shooter and is a great addition to the zombie genre.\n\n[h1]8/10[/h1]\n\nDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | [b][u]GREAT[/u][/b] | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503406353, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503406353, "recommendationid": "34415153", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505127", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503206555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 292, "steamid": "76561198276319873", "num_games_owned": 17}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Zlo\u010destiste", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1504170366, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504170366, "recommendationid": "34629752", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502909674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 481, "steamid": "76561198142485007", "num_games_owned": 337}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Welp im am the ones who tried (and proudly finished lol) Panic-Art version of the game.ZKotW REBORN is cleary better than ever.It still has the feeling of the original.\n\nBasically just buy it and give it a try.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502655379, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502655379, "recommendationid": "34221903", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506897994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3758, "steamid": "76561198169296924", "num_games_owned": 106}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very fun must buy 4 pack for friends have fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504323286, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504323286, "recommendationid": "34675202", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502624566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 513, "steamid": "76561197990748489", "num_games_owned": 156}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It makes me feel simple that I enjoy this game so much. The gameplay; shoot all the things. Sometimes this is a really boring design choice, but here it works perfectly. Tension builds as you try to manage opening up new areas of the level vs buying weapons and amo, sometimes you really need that extra space to flee to as a wave overwhelms your position. \n\nI found I died a lot when my character was new, but levelling up brings the difficulty down significantly, and after a point, surviving becomes quite easy, especially if you are playing online or with a bot buddy or two. Without the hectic struggle for survival, and with a level fully opened up, there needs to be some end point. As far as I can tell, there is no end to the waves of zombies. Perhaps there is a huge grind involved to complete a level, but either way, it ultimately leads to a level ending with a quit, rather than from death. This is the game's biggest failing.
