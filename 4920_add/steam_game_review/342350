Whilst the game is deffo more slow burn than high octane, the overall experience is pretty enjoyable. The sounds and low-fi graphics combine to give a good old skool horror vibe. \n\nThere are puzzle elements, most are logical and not too taxing though there are a couple of puzzles that are not as they fisrt seem and require a little thought. Still for the most part the puzzles do not detract from the game overall.\n\nSo all in all for the money, this is a very enjoyable little horror game, and to add value, there are actually two different builds of the game included in the price.
