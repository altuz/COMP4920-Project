All of those complaining about how the characters are shallow and without depth have NOT played the whole VN! In case you have no idea how to reach all of the 9 (!!!) endings, use the walkthrough the developers provide on their website!\n\nWell, now about the actual VN and what you can expect:\n+ beautiful artwork\n+ nice soundtrack\n+ interesting characters (who all have their own story to share if you dare to find it ;D)\n+ abstract storytelling (loose threads that don't connect until the very end)\n+ some horror elements\n+ heavy topics (life & death, suicide...) -> trigger warning!\n+ many secrets (side story, gallery etc.) unlocked by passwords you gain by reaching all of the endings\n\nI simply love it. There's truly nothing negative I could tell you about it. Maybe the story builds up a little too slow in the beginning and there are to many loose threads you need to connect BUT it's all worth it!\nI REALLY recommend using the walkthrough guide on the developers' page of this VN, because it's really hard to reach all of the endings and understand the story.\nOh and I played WAY more than 2 hours. Probably around 5 hours total including the special content I unlocked by collecting the passwords :D", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496678483, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496678483, "recommendationid": "32202440", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508246", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
