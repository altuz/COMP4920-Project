The idea of a Quake 3-alike being built around a granular level editor sounds great, but unfortunately the core gameplay doesn't hold a candle to the genuine article. The guns just don't feel that great to shoot, and there's way less variety than you'd expect if you want to keep your weapons at all coordinated with the level theme. If you want a chaingun in your map, I hope you're okay with it being bright neon blue.\n\nAnd that's before you even get into the community being dead. You will struggle to get into a match with more than one other player, and this game does not shine in 1v1, especially since most of the custom maps people make are way, way too big. \n\nBasically, the game isn't very good, and even if you'd want to try it, there's nobody to play it with.

What kind of trap is this?\n\nThe concept is really good but that's the only good thing about this game, otherwise it's utterly trash.\n\nBeing able to create our maps and missions on a  \"retro\" game like this, it should be awesome, shouldn't?\nWell, it is not.\n\nThe bad:\n\nBrainless AI, no... seriously... They hear you shoots 4 feet away and they're doing nothing about it, you have to either get really close to them (and they must see you, even if you run away making lot of noise behind them, they won't even notice), they barely use their gun, like, they don't even shoot, maybe 2 - 3 bullets every 2 minutes? Right, I'm exaggerating, but just by a little.\nThey'll miss you 50% of the time and that's when you don't move, if you move and doge, they'll miss their shots 95% of the time, Star Wars stormtrooper pretty much isn't?\n\nThere is not enough content, really, even if you pay 10$ for it, there is not enough content, that be weapons, enemies or blocks, it's empty, it's pathetic how barely any content there is.\n\nNo bots, why are there no bots? For all gamemodes, even the campaign/co-op? It would be pretty cool, and this game is almost dead so it would be important to have bots.\n\nNo mods support, why? Being able to port and create mods for this game would be great, being able to fight against hordes of Doom's creatures using weapons of Redneck Rampage or even Shadow Warrior, or even creating our own stuff by ourselves and sharing it with the community, but nope.\n\nCrappy animations, Shadow Warrior 1997 had better animations, come on now, you have no excuse.\n\nIt seems that the developer is no longer working on this game, what a waste, it could have been something great, but it is not, it actually wouldn't even be worth if it was entirely free (gold edition for free)\n\nStay away from this game, if you want good retro shooters then play Unreal Tournament, Blood, Turok, Quake, Doom, Shadow Warrior, Redneck Rampage, Wolfenstein, S.W.A.T., Blake Stone, System Shock, HeXen, Rise of the Triad, Duke Nukem, the first Half-Life, Strife, Heretic and there's so many more.\n\nAnd you can create your own maps and mods on most (if not all) of them so forget about this, don't waste your time on this.\n\n3/10 - Good concept but unfortunately bad and really weak on content.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498941647, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498941647, "recommendationid": "33100567", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507336", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 26, "total_reviews": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
