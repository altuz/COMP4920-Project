Art on sidebars not sufficient to compensate for lack of play area. Bland. Generic. Boring. Somewhat engaging due to simplicity. Xbox360 pad helps a lot. Still clutters the library and distracts from better titles in the subgenre.\n\nPhone-port Zelda-clone with Xbox360 pad support, minimalistic 2D sprites. Very simple barebones gameplay and level design and fairly fast progression with miniature everything. Controls fairly and simply. Animations are ugly but predictable and help with the controls.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504393817, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505264367, "recommendationid": "34697628", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496969", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 77, "total_reviews": 98, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 21}}
