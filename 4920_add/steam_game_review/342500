And honestly with an undo button or some other way of seeing where a ship would end up after moving I would have liked it.  Instead, this game is an exercise in frustration.\n\nYour ships get to move twice, and may shoot before the second move.  Logically, your first move should be to where you can take your shot, and the second to a safe spot.  The game helps a little by showing if you will take shield, hull, or destruction if you end your turn in a particular hex.  But, way to many times after making the first move to take a shot, all remaining possible moves end in destruction.  All that can be done is restarting the whole scenario, replaying all moves which go exactly the same, then trying a slightly different move.\n\nI have no hope of this being resolved as the developers appear to have abandoned the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439432203, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439432203, "recommendationid": "17514045", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571830", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1424101618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 195, "steamid": "76561198048521710", "num_games_owned": 145}, "votes_funny": 8, "votes_up": 59, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I had high hopes for this game after reading some of the other reviews, but after playing it for a few hours, I found it to be an exercise in frustration.   My main issues center around the ship movements and the weapons firing arcs.  It is impossible for any of the ships Ive used to move backwards or rotate 180 degrees.  This results in having to loop around in order to fire at your enemies, much like you would in a sea battle piloting an old sailing ship. This in and of itself wouldn't be so bad but when combined with narrow firing arcs and blind spots in your weapons' field of fire, it becomes irritating very quickly. It's not at all unusal to have an enemy ship in the hex directly adjacent to you 30 degrees left or right of center and not be able to fire at it.\n\nAlso, many of the weapons are only effective at certain ranges or against either shields or the hull (not both).  That combined with the limited movement and firing arcs results in your capital ships being almost useless.  Because they are so slow, it seems almost impossible to move them into a position where you are pointed in the right direction, at the right range, with the right weapon to hit your target. And even if you do manage it, you will get one shot before spending another 3 turns looping around to try to get another.  \n\nOh, and did I mention that you are always significantly out numbered?\n\nI dunno... I got through the first couple of missions, but I just didn't enjoy it.

It is decently hard, but only in that you are required to take a moment and think about the consequences of your moves.  Most of the missions I have been able to finish with all bonus objectives on the first try, it is not punishing.\n\nIt is an interesting take on space combat.  Each ship has its own movement and firing patterns, so it does take a moment to learn.  Some ships are mobile enough that you can reliably dart in and out of combat with no problem (aided by the overlay which shows you which locations are safe to end your move.)  Some ships are powerful but slow, and you need to plan their route and make sure nothing impedes their course.  It does remind me of chess, but more complicated and with some computer assistance to plan your moves.\n\nThe campain has offered a variety of goals so far to keep things interesting, and I am now carefully weighing which ships to choose for the next campaign (and finding that balance is decent, and some ships I had disliked are becoming more tempting once staying power across an entire campaign is taken into consideration.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422412644, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422412644, "recommendationid": "14202076", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522103", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441377854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 523, "steamid": "76561198007030482", "num_games_owned": 637}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A pretty interesting game on the concept that lacks a bit of sould and frankly a bit of fun.

It took me a few attempts to beat it and a couple of hours but when I did it was a Eureka moment in terms of how to play.\n\nEach ship shoots in a different way and moves in a different way so none are alike in terms of how you should attack with them and certain weapons do damage to shields or hull so you do have to think about placement but once you get your head around the game mechanics it is not that difficult. It does require you to think strategically and plan your actions but it is a strategy game so I'm not sure what people expected.\n\nA lot of the reviews have focused on no undo button but again it's a strategy game not a trial and error game! \n\nTo me, it's kind of like the Sid Meier's Ace Patrol series but if that game had a full squadron of many different airplanes that you would take to the skies. Or a battle isle/Historyline game (for the older gamers!)\n\nIf you like something that requires you to think about your actions and consequences on a chessboard type arena then you will like this. If that kind of stuff frustrates and you don't have the patience to fail then you will not! \n\nThe Negative side is that the tutorial missions are a bit week and there is no help guide, which would have really sped up my understanding of how the game mechanics work and how the ships work! So the first few missions require some trial and error in understanding how to play, which will put people off (because of the lack of an undo button) but once you get past that it's a great strategy game. \n\nIs it worth \u00a314.99? Depends how much you like strategy games. I bought it on sale and I'm not sure I would have taken a gamble on it given the negative reviews on here.

So many homers, hah.\n_________________________________________________________\n\nI find my ship doing 270's when it could just turn 90 degrees and move.  I also couldn't figure out how to stay in one spot and turn the ship around, though I suspect I was a bit dim in that aspect, assuming it's that left and right arrow at the bottom left of the screen.
