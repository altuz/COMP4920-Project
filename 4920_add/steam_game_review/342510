Its basically BeJewled but without gems. The story is very vague. All I know is that I am versing NPCs that are absolute garbage at basically BeJewled. Its basic and good. I liked it quite a lot even without trading card and achivements. It makes you appreciate the game for what it was for. It seems like a good basic game. I don't think it exactly worth $4.99.
