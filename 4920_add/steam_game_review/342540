Game is very stiff with simple and clunky npc scripts, a non interactable environment, and a purchased/asset flipped map that I saw when I played gynophobia. Some npcs were non interactable too, most of them actually. Seems like gameplay is a simple breadcrumb game where you talk to a npc in a starting area, he mentions someone, or something somewhere, and as you talk to them they do the same thing and mention someone else. Kind of like a game of tag. No one seems to be doing, saying anything interesting. Worldbuilding and stage setting is absent. Just very hollow and unsatisfying.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501644419, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501644474, "recommendationid": "33962729", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 5}}
