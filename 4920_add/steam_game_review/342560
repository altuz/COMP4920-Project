One side would be the interior rooms, the other would be the exterior/ armor. But the process would take hours, and combat left my paper ships full of holes.\n\n Airships: Conquer the Skies really reminds me of that. Except it's way better, the game makes it easy to design awesome ships.The combat is fun. When a ship is destroyed it explodes very nicely.\nYou can design a ship and save its design, so that you can mass produce a fleet. Then send that fleet to destroy your enemies.\n I really enjoy this game and thoroughly recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506106073, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506106073, "recommendationid": "35134972", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506202646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1814, "steamid": "76561198393845905", "num_games_owned": 2}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a very fun game the graphichs and setup are really nice. the modding is supper easy you gust subscribe to mods on the workshop this game is supper fun overall", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504970870, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504970870, "recommendationid": "34839959", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505048342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1442, "steamid": "76561198028100405", "num_games_owned": 223}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Good game!
