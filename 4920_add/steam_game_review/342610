Not so! Instead, you roam about, and when you see a gateway to another land, you can (usually) go through it. (Sometimes you can't, at least at first, but that's because...well, never mind, you'll see for yourself when you run across an example of it.)  \nIt's simple to learn, simple to play--a mouse (or trackball) works perfectly--has a lot of nuances, and when you die, as you inevitably will, it takes two clicks to start a new game. \nI love this.
