If you're looking for a game to be updated, good luck. If you're looking for the quality that Re-Logic brings, good luck. Neither of those are here. The game is dead. Now, that was really negative. If you're looking for a side scrolling squad combat game, then go ahead, this is a good game, but its dead. The devs sold all assets and the forums are no longer online.
