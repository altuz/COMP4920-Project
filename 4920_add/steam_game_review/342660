You can play with bots or online. Although there is not many players online now you can still have a fun time with the bots! There are 3 gamemodes: Soccer, Deathmatch and capture the flag. Each one is really fun! You can choose from different cars and weapons to mach your play style.\n\nPros:\n1: Different gamemodes\n2:Bots, splitscreen or online\n3: fast paced and action packed game\n4: Really good looking\n5: customization!\n\nCons:\n1: Bugs (as to be expected in early access)\n2: The bots need to be worked on\n\nOverall it is a great game, I recommend this game!
