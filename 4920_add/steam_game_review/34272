With some particularly novel gameplay elements and fluid, responsive, quasi-beat 'em up controls it's still surprisingly fun to play and not a bad buy if you are looking for something a little bit different to blow $3.50 on, although I'd recommend grabbing it in the Classics bundle instead. It's also got an awesome (?) midi-metal soundtrack that Sega actually released through their record label back in 1992. Look it up, I'm not kidding."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1304179418, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519824", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "1616030", "votes_up": 32, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995413446", "num_reviews": 48, "last_played": 0, "num_games_owned": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 0}, "timestamp_updated": 1304179418, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Hell!
