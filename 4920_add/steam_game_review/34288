It was released somewhere right between 1993 and 1994 and was made by Sega Interactive, which was third party developer Interactive Design before Sega of America acquired it. One of early games to have 24 Megabit ROM. EC was marketed heavily by Sega.\n\nThe game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.\n\n\nNow, for usual technical part about Sega's emulation here:\nThe Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for \"Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Classics\" game that should appear in your library.\nBy default it runs 3D bedroom Hub. Since emulator itself is based on 2006 one made in Java and 3D Hub is made in Unity, both famous for having not-good optimization, the performance in this hub varies from one PC to another. Sound lags as well.\nIt's recommended to run Simple Launcher, which can be done by Right Mouse Clicking the Sega Classic title in Steam library and selecting it. It still isn't perfectly accurate emulation, but it's acceptable. Sadly, it doesn't have user-friendly access to mods.\nHowever, Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu, so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time! Also, yes, emulator supports quick saves.\nAs alternative, you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Kinda like when people use ZDoom source port to run Doom on Steam. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in \"uncompressed ROMs\" folder that program itself doesn't use, the file for this one being \"EternalChampions_USA.SGD\".\nI also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. Go to \"manuals\" folder of game root and open \"EC_PC_MG_EFIGS_US_150ppi.pdf\".\n\nWhile the game has multiplayer mode for two players, the emulator doesn't have any online function for that, so it's local only.\n\nThere is no movelist in-game. You have to either find original US manual scans or just search on Internet for movelist, like GameFAQs.\n\nAnd yep, one of the games to use all 6-button controller. Street Fighter 2 type of controls.\n\n\nEternal Champion has summoned nine great warriors who unjustly died before being able to change the world for the better. He has power to bring back only one back few seconds before death. Let the contest begin!\n\nI am sure that most of you are aware of over the top violence in Sega CD sequel. However original Eternal Champions is very tame: just blood dusts on near-dizzy hits and the only finisher is overkill that produce barely any blood. Just maybe skeleton with eyes popping out. Overkills are stage fatalities \u2013 do a strong final attack in certain spot in stage from certain direction. Hard to do but I like it this way. Just keep playing as usual and be happy when they happen.\n\nThe game actually has a positive vibe to it despite the gritty setting. Eternal Champion just gets dissapointed if you fail to beat him. Each ending of the character is almost sobby level of happy, albeit sadly endings are just plain text. Overkills appear to be pure accidents. All good until Dark Champion infulenced the contest in the sequel.\n\nAnd it sure is gritty. Just look at this HEAVY abuse of dithering. Feels sickening. Which isn't helped by the music that is while gives nice atmosphere to each stage, sounds weak instrumentally.\nThe reason for this heavy dithering abuse is because at that time most common TV video cable was either composite or RF. They had artifact where two horizontal pixels will colorbleed into a mixed color, so EC looks darn good on such cable. Too bad no one told devs that it works only horizontally so there are few ugly spots. Sadly Sega's emulator doesn't have any filter to simulate that.\n\nThe devs really crammed those 24 Megabits real good as it has quite possibly the largest animated fighters in SF2 style games on 16-bit consoles! Albeit the animation is stiff at times. What cheapens it is that there is only one animation for taking hit no matter where it lands. There are voices only for taunts.\n\nBut yes. It's a SF2 clone. There are usual light, medium, strong attacks. But each version of punch or kick may actually have different attack from expected, such as rolling back. All special moves input either are charges or require press of few attack buttons at same time. This game has almost no combo chains outside certain special moves. I mean, I hate long high-damaging combos in fighting games but this is a pushover. So yea, a defensive kind of game.\n\nAnd yep, got a bunch of characters. They are painfully generic 90s cliches and yet are somehow memorable. They aren't balanced though, Trident is obviously the most overpowered one. But hey, special moves with originality. Such as transforming opponent into another character.\n\nWhen I first tried game years ago I hated it. Why? The main mode, contest, forces you to play against computer on maximum difficulty. And that means all of your offensive is going to get blocked. Also, you and opponent have slowly regenerating Inner Strenght that special moves waste. It balances some powerful special moves. But here is a thing: CPU ignores IS! It also means that there is no point in taunting that takes away some of opponent's IS.\n\nThankfully, as I kept playing the game I was slowly starting to learn how to beat the CPU. And unlike Mortal Kombat 2 where you beat CPU by doing some cheap exploit, you use proper tactics. Mostly just interrupting attacks, using various attacks, learning behavior of AI. It doesn't spam some moves all time. It was like fighting bosses in video games. Not following same rules as you yet still fair despite being hard.\nAnd battle timer in this game goes fast so stalling the match is a valid tactic too.\n\nThough another nasty thing is that if you lose a match then you go two steps backward in the ladder. And you have only two rounds to beat the final boss otherwise it's game over. You have to beat 5 phases of final boss in the row. At least you get some health inbetween.\nThanfully we are playing on emulator so you can fix this with save stating.\n\nAnd when you look outside of main mode then you see another feature of a game: lots of options due to being console-made game. Such as char bios. Can go back in menu. Sadly, no way to leave the match or movelist. But hey, ahead of time.\nIt also has a training mode. A good intention but a wrong guess. Instead of having an opponent that you can set behavior of or infinite health, you either get a flying ball or aggressive AI here. And there is a minigame where you hit balls flying around.\n\nThere is Battle Room. An arena with cannons moving around. You can select up to 5 \u201cdeathly devices\u201d which means that types of projectiles that cannons shoot around. Doesn't affect how often they shoot. Exception is the ground rolling blade. Might be fun with a friend but AI opponent doesn't react to the traps so it's too easy. Not being able to move back due to blocking isn't helpful either.\n\nThere are practise against AI and two player mode. Can change a bunch of setting. Skill setting affect damage handicap and AI skill. Less blocking! But most unique is Instant Replay. An unusual thing for a 16-bit fighter! You can watch parts of match that ended or highlights or so on. It's limited but it was cool back then.\n\nAnd there are tournament modes, only for friends. Single Elimination is usual tournament tree. AI fills empty slots. In Double Elimination losers get their own tournament tree. And Round-a-Bout: Two players, 9 characters on each side, elimination!\n\nThe high difficulty in main mode make it hard to recommend it to casuals. No idea of competitive. I hated it at first but I got to like this game after few days. It tried some original things. And one of fighting games with impossible final boss. A careful recommendation."}]}
