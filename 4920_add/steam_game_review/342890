It's true that I'm not exactly english for a start, so playing an english-based word game is tricky, but it doesn't matter, really. That game fails to do what it claims to do in the first place.\n\nThe rules are simple : you're given a target word (say \"Silence\"), and given a starting word (say \"Crash\"), and a cloud of synonyms you can pick from. The goal is to get closer and closer to the target word by picking the right words from the words cloud. The thing is, there's not only synonyms in the cloud, but also antonyms, sometimes just analog terms (otherwise you wouldn't get very far)... but not always.\n\nSo for example starting with \"Crash\", goind towards \"Silence\" you could expect to go through \"Crack\", then \"Noise\" or \"Sound\", and then choose the antonym \"Silence\"... but only IF the game knows that \"Silence\" is an antonym of \"Noise\". but when you get, for exempale, to the word \"Real\" you can choose \"Lawful\"... and also \"Unlawful\", but can't pick \"Silence\" out of \"Noise\".\n\nAnd there you have it : this game is not about knowing your english, it's about guessing what words are linked with what other words in the game's database. And without knowing what dictionary it was built onto, there's NO WAY you could play this game properly.\n\nThis is more a data mesh exploration game than a word game. Therefore it is pretty bad.
