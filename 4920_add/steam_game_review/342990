I would have liked to enjoy this game as well, but this game [15 days], is far too frustrating to play with all of the inevitable game crashes. I think I crashed like 5 times in the first 15 minutes.. I could tell I wasn't getting anywhere with this game at the rate of the crashes popping up, so I chose to abandon playing it.\n\nThis game crashes a lot, constantly. There's a crash report window that opens when the game crashes, however, its been 7 years since this games initial release and I don't think the developers have worked on fixing anything at all, nor do I feel they are committed to this project any longer.\n\nIf you are up to the challenge of completing the game against the bombardment of crash screens, then by all means go for it. But I wouldn't recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505592384, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505592384, "recommendationid": "35006025", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502017", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 16}}
