I love adventure games. I love story exploration, I love puzzles and growing up playing older games in this genre, I do not expect much on either graphics or even logic department in these games. I've played my fair share of obscure adventure games from old to new, shiny to buggy, and from \"masterful\" to \"lame\". So, don't take my word lightly when I say that [i]The Mystery of the Druids[/i] was one of my worst experiences so far.\n\nHere in this obscure little adventure, our protagonist is Brent Halligan, a Scotland Yard detective and a mischievous, good for nothing trouble maker with a disdain for anything orderly. It's the year 2000 - a period when people were completely engulfed by conspiracy theories and hypothetical occult sub-meanings for everything with the shadow of a word called \"millennium\" attached - and London's been haunted by gruesome serial killings called Skeleton Murders. Due to some drastic errors the last detective handling the case caused, it becomes our case over a night. Halligan's adventure starting up with a trip to Anthropology Museum, progresses to involve rituals of ancient times and an age old sect in Britannia: Druids. Alongside Dr. Melanie Turner - a stereotypical maiden with a sharp tongue, Brent starts his gruesome and somewhat mindless quest to solve the mystery behind this whole shabby picture.\n\nOkay, first and foremost: the lore presented within the game is speculative, corrupted and elongated to extremes. The term \"Druid\" is completely ill-advertised, displayed a long cultural heritage and spiritual practice of 5000 years simply as \"power hungry elemental wizards\". This is kinda infuriating for someone who is actually familiar with the topic, and it\u2019s both cultural and spiritual indications. It is understandable that any mythical or mystical practice would be interesting enough theme for a \"bad guy\" in any story, but one would at least expect them to present the concept with some authenticity. Please don't take your basic information on druidism from this game only! You'd end up learning some beautiful concept completely wrong!\n\nNow, back to the game itself: as a game made in 2001, graphics are ridiculously bad! I mean, we are talking about \"first [i]Tomb Raider[/i] quality\" bad. I know, it was charming in 1996, but in 2001, one would expect slightly better. Character animations are almost cubical, movement animations are painfully solid and background artwork lacks any animation altogether. Everything seems plastic and even funny in a bad way. Remember; [i]The Longest Journey[/i] was developed 2 years before this game! So the lack of technology is not an excuse at all! No one decided to put either any skill or labor in this game, that's all.\n\nThe game's Steam integration is also non-existent. It's ridden with animation bugs, constant game crashes and cyclical dialogue errors. After my 14th crash at the very same point in the middle of the game; I gave up, shut it down and watched a youtube playthrough made with an original copy of the game just to learn the rest of the story. Aside game breaking constant bugs; there is no observable logic behind puzzle dynamics and dialogue options force you to take completely linear progression paths. It doesn't matter whether you know what to do next or not: the game makes sure you should try what you cannot achieve first, then force you back to the actual solution. You should keep guessing the specific way of thinking in developer's mind to be able to accomplish your next task. Either you get lucky, or give up and get yourself a walkthrough.\n\nFor the last verdict: even with a ridiculously cheap price, [i]The Mystery of the Druids[/i] won't bring you either excitement, or accomplishment; or even enjoyment. You'll get yourself a cheap story with no causal logic, plain ugly environment, a series of constant restarts due to crashes and a headache. This game is an annoying little trap in hopes of milking a nickel or two from an adventure lover.

Being that this is a point-and-click adventure game, a genre well-known for having ridiculous puzzles and, at times, even more ridiculous characters...
