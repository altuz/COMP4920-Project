Well rest assured Cars: Radiator Springs doesn't come close to even trying to resemble a good or even a half way decent game.  This was a time when THQ was trying to find a way to stop the bleeding of money, so they went head long into licensing any and every movie tie in they could get.... err well they could get before activision swooped them up..\n\nI went into the game looking at it as a young child would, after all this is Cars, one of the ever popular Pixar movies.   My expectations were low but I trudged onward.  Upon starting up the game I noticed it didn't fit in my resolution which is 1920 x 1080.  I said ok, and went searching for the option menu..  awesome no way to change the resolution.  Not a problem I just sucked it up and continued on.\n\nThe game presents you with 3 options as far as the main menu goes. Activites (which are just mini games), Legends race and Lighting McQueen's Racing Headquarters (awesome name for the options menu, but that sums up this game in a nutshell) which is pretty much just the options and a few little benefits, like unlocked movies (don't get excited it's just cut scenes from the game) car customization (which isn't really anything more than some color swaps) and some photos you can unlock..\n\nStarting with.. Mini games, it's a real hodgepodge of stuff, I can admire the attempt at trying to teach kids memorization and puzzle solving skills.  Even a little eye hand coordination thrown into the mix.  I had no real issues with the mini games except a few very glaring glitches and poor explanation on a few of them.   A few of them were set up like that old Simon game (the circle with 4 buttons that light up in a pattern)  much like the Simon game the concept seems fun for about 10 minutes, then you're left saying, man this is kind of boring..\n\nAnother mini game see's you guiding a nut through  McQueen's tailpipe... (Woah there Pilgrim this is a Disney game, it's an actual nut.. get your mind out of the gutter), Yet another finds you catching tires, while another has you rearranging cars so McQueen can leave the drive in movies.. \n\nEnough with the activities, onto the meat of the game..   It's Drag Racing !!!!  Wait what? This is a game for children (i'll assume young children) and it's about drag racing?  With that moral dilemma aside lets talk about Legends racing... or Drag racing a cheating AI as I like to call it..  The AI cheats, even on the easist race, winning in a lesson in futility, in fact the racing is little more than holding the drive button, while at the same time watching a meter (not the awesome tow truck) fill then pressing the mouse button at the right time to switch gears.  It's boring, even for my 9 year old, he played the game for little more than 2 minutes before he was rushing off to do something else.\n\nPro's  -  \n\nseems as though the voice actors also contributed to the game\nCheech!!!\nFamiliar characters from the cars series.\n\nCon's -\nBugs + Glitches,\nNo Fun\nNo Screen resolution option\nLittle more than a cash grab\n\nI'd avoid this game at all cost, I'd say possibly take the plunge when the game is under a buck, but this is Disney, the game won't drop below 10 dollars.. Don't be a fool like I was and pay over 10 for this lump of refuge.. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456595229, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456595229, "recommendationid": "21504096", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539722", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469278173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 546, "playtime_forever": 32, "steamid": "76561198071144444", "num_games_owned": 606}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Bad game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469278203, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1469278203, "recommendationid": "24478828", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485187", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495283632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 71, "steamid": "76561198152530617", "num_games_owned": 189}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this game fun little bit childis but great if you bored", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501785349, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501785349, "recommendationid": "33999024", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504062666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198263318410", "num_games_owned": 36}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I hate giving this game a positive review, but honestly this just feels like and early Nintendo DS title ported to a PC, I just got the most out it of using files in the game for modding purposes... also I basically received it for $1 considering I bought the disney cars classics collection...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504123898, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504123898, "recommendationid": "34617225", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
