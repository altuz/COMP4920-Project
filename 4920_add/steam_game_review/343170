Like when i'm standing there and getting my hp back enemies are just flying and going away, so why can't it be just a pickup like the upgrade material and shield recharge?\nGame is kinda fun tough, but for me it seems to be lacking stuff that could make it way better than it is now.\n\nRight now would not recommend, but opinions can change.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427228809, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427228889, "recommendationid": "15038561", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509615", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427469649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 41, "steamid": "76561198027305877", "num_games_owned": 150}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This side-scrolling shooter by Peter Hann is a good way to pass the time.

I have a few issues, and while I can probably think of more later, this is what I thought of off the top of my head.\n\n1) The random guy mumbling random sayings.\n2) Constantly flashing lights for no real reason. That makes it a problem when you're trying to see what you're supposed to shoot or avoid.\n3) Constantly floating backwards when not controlling your ship at all. It's so annoying when you have to stay in a spot to heal you have to keep going right to keep up. In other games, you stay where you're at.\n4) Maybe this is just me, but I don't remember many side-scrolling shoot em ups to have enemies come from both the top and bottom of the screen when there isn't a ground or ceiling. This means staying to the left of the screen is the only real \"safe\" place, but it's near impossible to stay there when the screen is almost filled with enemies and bullets. It feels cheap staying to the top middle of the screen only to die because an enemy popped up off screen and hit your ship.\n5) Regular weapons can overheat. To some degree I can kind of see why they went this route, but considering the amount of enemies on a screen at certain points, it takes too many stat points to properly upgrade that stat and other games that don't have that mechanic, I found it frustrating not being able to defend myself while the screen is filled with enemies. Have you ever wanted to play a shoot 'em up where your weapons can overheat? If so, then this is the game for you.\n\nI'm sure the creator put in some effort to make a competent shoot 'em up, but it seems like it really didn't bother seeing other quality games in the genre (i.e. Gradius) and using similar mechanics, and it made me feel like the creators were okay putting something out that was average at best, and I'm being really generous about that statement. I had this on my wishlist for a while, and while I'm glad I got it on sale for 3 bucks, I can't recommend buying it at any price. If you're wanting a good shoot 'em up, check out Revolution Ace. Sure it's an overhead view and not a side view, but the mechanics are much better, a 2 player mode is available, there are RPG elements, and if you catch it on sale, you can find it for 16 cents, which I wouldn't spend that much on this game.\n\nBottom line: Save your time and money for better games in the genre.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446614939, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446731416, "recommendationid": "18869106", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502468", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437776252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 301, "steamid": "76561198031485735", "num_games_owned": 123}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Classic sidescroller with nice but 'not enough details' graphics. Upgrade system is 'farm based' but IT LACKS visual impact; when i buy upgrades i'm expecting my ship to change in some way. Sound and music are average. There are bosses that show little but at least some kind of damage as you destroy them. Very bland in appearance but this type of alien uses that visual style for their ship so i guess i can't complain. They do look polished though. The lightning/glowing effects are also very well made.\n\nCyberpunk... don't really know why but at least it fits the depressing 'ambiance' of the game. Your character is a junkie on drugs that keeps having the same 'destroyed building' purplish/pinkish psychedellic hallucination throught the game... EXTREMELY annoying. As a lone survivor of the human race you are fighting while hearing him talk in his head in a monotone and totally negative and lifeless way. His speech isn't credible and tries to include some kind of teaching... this being backed by the level names who stands between the Bible's capital sins and the last thoughs of a man ready to shoot himself.\n\nAlthough it is clear from the start that mankind was destroyed by some aliens there's no explanations, no flesh on this skeleton-of-a-story, just a monotone druggie painfully expressing how he's gonna fight and eventually die because shit hit the fan. I don't think a pilot could actually think like that in the middle of a fight with the aliens that vaporized his kind. Ending is predictable but still enjoyable at some point. \n\nIs this release original? No. It does feature the toughts of a depressive pill riding junkie but the game itself is standard, even disapointing since you like to think that devs can do better in these modern times.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438911268, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438911268, "recommendationid": "17422633", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492208", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
