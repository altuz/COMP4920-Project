Frustrating? Yes. Difficult. YES. In space? YES!\n\nThe only thing I don't understand is the optimization of the particle effects. My CPU and GPU (i5 and the highest radeon series) are equipped to handle that stuff, yet I get severe lag when too many particles are on the screen, with a density of 20 parts/cm^2 or greater. I know, one can turn the particles down, or even off, but I don't need to. My computer can handle what the game is doing, but for some reason the game is way, way too taxing in terms of particle effects.\n\nOne UI thing that bothered me was the fact that you can go to the resource trade menu from the equipment store menu, but not the other way around. It's nit-picky, but that's what critiques are about. \n\nThe graphics are amazing, so I have no issues there.\n\nThe music is one of my favorite parts of this game. I would list the artists here, but there is a metric ton of people behind the music design, relative to how small the game is. There are also sound bars that are present in the main menu and the starting screen. Each level begins with a (usually) different-than-the-last-one-heard soundtrack, with the title of said soundtrack appearing on the screen. Obviously this game had a big focus on sound quality.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much what this genre is all about; you fly a colorful collection of pixels around a black and white background, shooting squares at other collections of squares as they shoot squares back at you. The game features newtonian mechanics. For example, there is a pushback effect from shooting, which is actually pretty unique in 2D space shooters. The ship, however, just kind of stops. This is counter-intuitive, unless the ship has some kind of RCS that the player can't see, which is what I'm guessing.\n\nThe innovation here is that it's a 2D space shooter with resource trading and upgrading. It's not a roguelike, like FTL. It isn't as huge and encouraging of exploration as in EVE online. It also isn't just some boring Galaga clone. It's some hybrid of those games.\n\nIf you want to play a casual space shooter and feel an actual feeling of accomplishment after beating a level without ejecting out of your ship, play this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437923687, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437923687, "recommendationid": "17237102", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526056", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1461648396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 109, "steamid": "76561198059477912", "num_games_owned": 730}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "1", "review": "The current state of the game does not support Xbox controllers well. For strange reasons the game requires a lengthy gamepad calibration the first time you activate the Xbox controller in game. The calibration stage is cumbersome yet producing bad calibration results, and it is impossible to steer and aim in the game in any meaningful way.\n\nBad impression regarding the gamepad controls, as I have yet to see a gamepad compatible game on steam that requires calibrations. Most games just work with gamepad right off the bat.\n\nMaybe the developer try to ensure precise aiming, by mapping the range of the twin sticks to the corners of the screen of the current frame size? Anyway, stay away from using gamepad for the moment before a fix is available.\n\nHowever, the graphics and sounds in game is pretty superb, albeit the in game dialogues can not be fast forwarded/skipped.

I love top-down arcade shooters, and resource trading/management, and upgrade loops. Zotrix has all of these things, and it does them all in a very mediocre way.\n\nThe shooting, where you'll spend most of your time, is incredibly boring and easy. Enemies will slowly march onto the screen, single file, where you will immediately wipe them all out by firing in a straight line - even without any upgrades. As the game grows in difficulty (at a glacier pace), occasionally two lines of enemies will come out simultaneously, which means you might miss a few, so you'll get fewer credits at the end of the level. \n\nYou're never really in danger, and you easily become disinterested. This is not how you should feel when you're alone in space against thousands of aliens. \n\nResource trading is also devoid of complexity or meaningful choices. Different stations sell different resources at different prices - but you can preview the price of any resource of every station before making the trip, meaning that there is no decision making, no research, and no risk at all. You can expect a small (5-10%) profit every single time you make a jump. This adds absolutely nothing to the game.\n\nUpgrades are weird and usually trivial. It's hard to know what things do or why you'd need them. Nothing that I found changes the game at all; it's simply bigger numbers (more damage to a primary blaster cannon, etc).\n\nOn top of all this, you'll find numerous quality-of-life annoyances throughout the entire game. There's no Sell All button in the resource trading, so you have to type in all the numbers by hand (also, no numpad support). Sound effects for shooting are obnoxiously loud, completely obscuring the music. English is likely not the developer's first language - you'll see numerous grammatical oddities. Et cetera. \n\nZotrix is an unpolished, uninteresting game that does not even come close to its potential.

It could be because I have an extreme bias for this genre, or any game that reminds me of a misspent (debatable) youth in Arcade/Pizza joints when the quarter was king.

The action is pretty fast-paced, but never seems to skew too far out of reach in it's difficult moments, even as you level up. It stays challenging, but never frustrating to the point of rage-quit.

It is very easy to get overpowered gear very early in the game. This makes completing the game tedious and boring. The trading aspect of the game can be completely ignored. After finishing the first 10 to 15 missions there is not much more to upgrade and you'll basically have an endless supply of resources and money. Some of the upgrade items (the different missiles i.e.) and all the lower tier gear is completely obsolete. The story doesn't matter at all. It's just escort mission after escort mission. The enemy types and attack patterns repeat over and over again. When you are in the upgrade shop it is not possible to directly compare the items in the shop to the ones you have already installed. There are also still a few bugs in the game. Often when the last wave of a level is finished it takes one or two minutes of flying through empty space until the level finally ends. The basic idea of the game is very cool. It makes me sad to see so much wasted potential.

Overall, it's a very fun game.  It's a retro style bullet hell arcade twin stick shooter with really catchy music.  The game play is fun and addicting.  The levels aren't long, but there appear to be plenty of them.  You can choose which route you take, which alters which levels you do and adds to the replay value.

So, it can probably run on most anything.\n\nThere are only a couple minor issues right now, but its Eary Access and you have to expect these things.  One issue is that the Upgrades feature doesn't work in Linux.  Pushing that on either my laptop or my gaming desktop causes the game to crash.  This makes the game considerably more difficult as the levels progress and the enemies become tougher.  The second issue is that the controller support is a bit lacking.  The left (movement) stick is fine, but the right (aiming) stick has limited range and stays on the left side of the screen, making it about impossible to switch directions of fire.  But, that's not a deal breaker as the keyboard and mouse controls work fine.  Plus, the dev team on this game seems really friendly and they're active on the discussions boards.
