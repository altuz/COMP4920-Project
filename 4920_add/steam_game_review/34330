Interesting to play, challenging and fun. Maybe it's nostalgia talking, but it was truly my childhood dream, to play Shogun together with a friend, and it came true. Unfortunately, I can not give it tumbs up because of how angry I am right now.\n\nIf you look into steam forums of this game, you'll find that it's infested with various bugs, such us your units dying without reason, and many others. I'm not gonna collect them here, just describe the ones I encountered in coop with my friend. I've split them into two categories.\n\nFucking annoying:\n[list]\n[*]Coop group binding - so imagine you starting a battle, say you take right flank and your buddy is on the left. You set the formations, bind the groups. Now, if you use same keys as your coop partner (ex \"1\") your units will highlight when you press it, but they won't listen for your command, they'll listen to your partner commands. And wise-versa, creating literal chaos on the battlefield.\n[*]Dialogue windows (aka pre battle info, diplomacy) randomly opening up for wrong player.\n[*]Minor coop restrictions - you can not choose weather when attacking, you can not pursue routing enemy forces, battle just instantly ends. It may sound like something pretty neglectable, but imagine situation where you need to destroy a fleet composed of 1 (ONE) ship. You attack, take casualties and sustain damage, shoot the fucker, he craps his pants, and run. Battle instantly ends, fucker retreats with full health, but you lost some crew and guns. WHAT THE FUCK. Then repeat it 3-4 times till RNG gives you one-shot-kill on him. And prepare to do this A LOT, since AI thinks it's a good strategy to spam 1-ship-fleets all day long.\n[/list]\nFucking game-breaking:\n[list]\n[*]De-synch - so basically expect that at some point your game will warp into parallel universe, where you only think that you play beside your friend, but in fact you play with AI imposing your friend, and same on the other side. Units on global map will be in different spots for you two, composition of armies and fleet will differ, result of auto-resolve battles and so on. At some point your game will stuck, for instance if your buddy attacks an army, and in your \"universe\" that army is out of reach. In this case game will freeze, non of you will be able to do anything apart from forced quit via ALT+F4. Why this even a thing, why in all heavens it was implemented... Fucked if I know. To fix this, you need to take save file from host, and send it to client to override existing one.\n[*]Campaign camera movement bug - another random \"surprise\". In short, at some random point your camera will basically stuck. No WASD movement, no screen edges with mouse, nothing. Well, to be fair you still can click on the minimap, but it's... Inconvenient to say the least. And you can not fix it via in-game means. Reload, restart, nothing will help. In order to fix this, I was forsed to use cheat engine to unpack save file and modify it.\n[/list]\n\nI don't know what else I could say. This bullshit is fucking horrendous. I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this game at any circumstances. It's fun to play. But be prepared to encounter shitload of annoying and game breaking bugs.\n\nFix your shit CA, you are selling a broken game for more than 5 years for fucks sake.\n\nP.S.: Oh, and BTW, buying SHOGUN 2 - Fall of the Samurai will NOT grant you SHOGUN 2. Steam will say that you own it, but in fact you're not, you still have to buy it separately. Not complaining, just pointing out strange glitch in steam store.\n"}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506938616, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413167", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 6, "recommendationid": "35410613", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055684649", "num_reviews": 63, "last_played": 1506948282, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "playtime_forever": 161}, "timestamp_updated": 1506938616, "received_for_free": false, "review": "You can't naruto run"}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505108575, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495544", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34877268", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198072441461", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505106436, "num_games_owned": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 14}, "timestamp_updated": 1505108575, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Honestly, I thought this would be a wonderful experience for me.
