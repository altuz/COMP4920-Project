For $1.79 it's a great steam addition fun little game for the price, just so long as you go into it expecting a R-Type clone. Clearily this is still in a WIP, so hopefully the Ship speed will be increased, some enemies made more agressive, the overall pace of the game speedup a bit, some deserving non-generic back ground music added, a few more powerups, a more forgiving continue system, and more graphic options become availiable later - and perhaps the keyboard controls could use a remapping option.
