The story is written with heart and charm and genuine love of wrestling. With a brilliant little cheat on the part of the author (Matches are sometimes real and sometimes scripted), you have a game where everything can be on the line in a fight, and in another situation you might meet the aging veteran who never had the push he deserved or the tacky, unprofessional wrestler who takes issue with the booking. This could have ended up being a disastrous attempt to merge both the magic of kayfabe and the grit behind the curtain, but the writer pulls it off wonderfully.\n\nEven better, there aren't just several endings, there are at least three different whole final scenarios depending on your choices, a few secret endings here and there, multiple romances to pursue, there is some replayability here.\n\nI only have a couple of complaints about the game and they both stem from it being a standard Choice of Games game. First, there are no save slots. Pure auto-save. There are good branching scenarios throughout the whole game so replaying is not a pain, but several ending variants are determined entirely by your actions in the last three or so chapters. There are not many dead ends but you can lose the big matches and have to replay the whole story for a less unsatisfying ending. (Fairly quick if you have read it all before, thankfully.)\n\nSecond, Choice of Games shoehorns in their pet device where you can be any sex and pursue any sex, but these games are not Mass Effect in which you can lard up the game with a dozen cheesy romances of every orientation. The result is characters get gender bent and FEEL gender bent if you pick an unnatural (respective to the writing) orientation. Slammed does pull this off better than other Choice of Games games. The womens league wrestlers all get their own descriptions so even the ones that perform the same role as they would for a male player character still feel like their own characters and there is a really cute story path that is appropriately open only to female characters. But there's one specific love interest in Slammed who is either a charming feminine woman or a kinda weird feminine man.
