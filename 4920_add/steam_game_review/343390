The storyline was sort of cute, though bizarre. The HOG scenes were either really easy, challenging, or nigh on impossible. Some things simply were not visible, no matter how I adjusted the view and zoomed in. The puzzles were a mix of too easy, perfect, and... well, pointless. I'm not big on randomly clicking to determine the correct order for multiple games. Overall, the frustration factor tips the scale on the downside for me. It is aggravating to be forced to use a hint for a HOG scene, then STILL not be able to see the item with a beam of light shining on it. Plus, after looking at two of the sets of directions for mini-games, I was unable to close them and acutally play. The only thing that worked was using the skip button, which meant I couldn't play them and got stuck with silver trophies. While I think the idea of a 3D HOG is cool, and the bright colors were a welcome change, there are way too many issues that make it seem like the items were just sort of thrown in there. *My hours are so high because I left the game running while running an errand. About two-three hours would be more accurate.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457664246, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457664246, "recommendationid": "21758434", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500993", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460159877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 174, "steamid": "76561198071670775", "num_games_owned": 291}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I got stuck for ages at the level with the cage because the hint was telling me it was in the wagon. It's not. I found the controls clunky and difficult to use. The story was great. I was looking forward to seeing how we manage to rescue the princess and it's funny... but when you don't realise some of the objects are hidden *behind* things so if you don't mouse over the area you'll never know it gets frustrating. The hint is a horizontal beam of light rather than the traditional hidden object sparkling around the area. If you don't click right on the object (and some of them are really thin) then you have to keep clicking until you get it exactly right. I also didn't realise that you needed to turn the map in some areas to see the other side. \n\nSo, I'd say save your money and bang your head on the desk instead. 2/5 for playability 4/5 for storyline.

Camera control is lackluster and done through an on-screen camera rotation hud that must be manually clicked. Objects are often obscured by scenery. Game is mostly divided between object hunt, as well as physics object routing games with some simple mechanical aspects to it. Usually involving using levers to move cranes and cannons about.
