The story starts with simple mystery, and then cannonballs into an intergalactic psych romp full of cartoonish twists and turns. I am still trying to figure out whether the game is intentionally funny, or unintentionally so, but either way, just like Ed Wood's B-Movie Classic, Plan-9 From Outer Space, this game features all your favourite celebrities (without their permission) and allows you to DIVE INTO THEIR DREAMS through the POWER OF HYPNOSISSSSSS. [note: therefore it is nothing really much like that movie I mentioned at all] \n\nSeriously, Grace Jones, Einstein, Richard Branson, That Dude From The Big Bang Theory...the gang's all here and they're just begging for your cleavage-aided psychiatric assistance. \n\nSOME may say that the puzzles are too simple and easily solved, but to them I say NAY. My main grievance with Point & Click games is that they always feature that one frustrating puzzle, which you can never solve so you cannot continue playing. And that makes me feel kind of stupid. Hypnosis features puzzles which are as easily solved as an 8 year old's homework, so they're great for your self esteem. And, just like your favourite elementary school teacher, the game gives you GOLD STARS for completing puzzle battles (also good for the self esteem). But the real prize is watching this weird, weird story unfold.\n\nAfter completing the game and witnessing that truly epic ending, I can only recommend it as the best, terrible game I've ever played and would highly recommend it for anyone with a good sense of humour and a spare 5 bucks.\n\n\nNow for my few critiques:\n\n1. Unsure of why the main character needs to be randomly sexy and have a standby boob-adjusting animation. I would like to point out, that as a psychiatric professional, I would consider her low-cut outfit inappropriate for the workplace. Don't even get me started on those ones from the store O_O\n\n2. Continuing the above theme - Do Maya and Dr Blanche understand the concept of patient-doctor boundaries? *spoiler alert* Hiring your patients, hypnotising them against their will, getting all up in their brain and then telling them how to live their lives - pretty sure that's a breach of like all of the psychiatric rules.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460523004, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460523004, "recommendationid": "22388820", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498046", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1424851491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 988, "steamid": "76561198208486868", "num_games_owned": 18}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This game has a lot of replay value.
