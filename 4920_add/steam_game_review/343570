[b]Rainbow Hero[/b] Its a simple block-pushing puzzle game with every 20 levels introducing a new element.

I completed every puzzle, earning every achievement, in around 9 hours.  Be aware that no guides are available for this game.\n\nSCORE:\n8/10\n\nAt the time of this review, the game was $2 at full price and on sale for $0.66.  I wasn't expecting much for that price, but I found myself impressed.  This is an excellent puzzler.\n\nThe gameplay here consists of tile-based movement with movable blocks, rolling balls, buttons that stay active only when constantly pressed, reflecting light beams, ridable tiles that can also be moved remotely, switches that rotate the level, two characters who move at the same time, two characters between whom the player can switch at any time, cloud tiles that disappear after being tread, locked blocks and keys, turn or time limitations, and more.  The puzzles are spread out across 5 areas with 20 puzzles each.  Every world introduces new mechanics to keep the game fresh.\n\nFor the player's convenience, there is a rewind feature that can be activated at any time by holding down the R key.  Furthermore, completing any level usually unlocks a couple more at a time, so the player can skip puzzles that are too difficult.  I found myself stumped for about an hour on one or two puzzles, but they generally only take a few minutes to complete.  Even so, I found great satisfaction in figuring out most levels' \"trick.\"\n\nMy primary complaint with the game is that the difficulty is inconsistent.  I was surprised at the difficulty of some of the first world's puzzles and worried that I would be unable to complete later levels (there was no guide at the time of this review), but it turned out that the difficulty remains the same for most of the game.  There are usually one or two easy levels when a new mechanic is introduced, but otherwise there was no correlation between difficulty and one's progress through an area.  The only exception for me was the final world, which I completed very quickly.\n\n(On the other hand, this could be a positive for players who don't want to waste time on easy puzzles leading up to the good ones.)\n\nThe second biggest problem with the game is that some of the mechanics aren't explored to their full potential because they are so many and the levels are comparatively few.  The time limitations on a handful of levels also feel a bit out of place in a game that is generally relaxing.  Given the player's rewind ability, it's not clear that they add much difficulty anyway.\n\nStill, the variety of mechanics as well as the puzzle design suggest skill and creativity on the developer's part.  I would very much like to see a sequel, though I am concerned that the price, number of reviews, and inactive forum indicate poor sales.\n\nFor the excellence of puzzle design, variety of mechanics, rewind feature, price, and puzzle unlocking system, but also for the absence of difficulty scaling and some poorly explored mechanics, I give this game an 8 out of 10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455055812, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1455490219, "recommendationid": "21087241", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507483", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453395838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 762, "steamid": "76561198007479208", "num_games_owned": 1133}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is an absolute steal for $2.

The music is somewhat repetitive, but I found it tolerable at lower sound settings. The game doesn't require you to beat all the levels to finish it, so if you have difficulty with some of them, you can still continue.

Nothing is ever trying to kill you, so you can take all the time you want to solve the puzzles in peace. Except for the two or three puzzles that are, for some reason, timed. But thanks to the ability to rewind time (not as a puzzle mechanic, just to fix your mistakes) even those don't feel frustrating.\n\nThe game has a 100 puzzles but it feels a bit on the short side, I managed to 100% the game in six hours without using any help. There were a few puzzles that initially look very difficult, but then they ended up not being that.

I've got to say that some of the levels are downright diabolical (I wonder how the developer came up with them).  I do have a few minor issues, though:\n\n- Some of the levels have a wind noise in the background.  Unfortunately, that noise cuts in and out.  It's a bit irritating.\n- Some of the levels have some kind of distortion sphere \"dripping\" down the screen (perhaps like rain on a window).  I found that to be distracting.\n- A few of the levels are timed.  My personal preference is to NOT have any timed levels.  But, that's my problem.\n- And finally, the ending could use another scene where the people say \"Yay!\" or something.
