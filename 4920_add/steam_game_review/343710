However this? This is lolzy.\n\nSo you hunt pages, not really exciting activity, but ok.

But more often than not, they turn out to be not very good. This one is not great but I enjoyed it enough to play it through to the end. The big draw for me with this game is that the story is based on the mysterious, real life Dyatlov Pass Incident.\n\nFirst of all, here's what it did right:\n\nThis game has great atmosphere. As an investigator researching what happened to  a bunch of Russian young people who were on an expedition out in the Siberian wilderness, you really feel like you are alone (or are you?) out there in the freezing cold. The visuals and the sounds effects really convey the environment to you in a believable way. Your sight is at times limited by the snow and the sound of the howling wind rises and falls as the weather conditions change. Just crank up the A/C in your house when you play to complete the immersion. The creepy music and the voice acting are good enough to ramp up the eerie factor.\n\nNow here are the problems with the game:\n\nThe story has some great source material to start with, but I'll admit that I really don't get what was going on. Kholat fell into the same, non-linear read pages you find and try to piece together what happened approach to narrative. In the end, I am only sure of a few story points. There were so many things going on it was like the movies Devil's Path and Event Horizon  mixed together. Was it aliens? Demons? Government experimentation? Insanity? Who knows? There were so many things left unexplained. I really didn't want to spend more time searching for every last note or journal entry, because I don't think it would help much. Well that and the navigation in the game was at times tedious.\n\nSo this is where the balance between realism and fun comes in to play. You have a map and a compass you use to get around. But I had to read the forums to find out that the red half of the needle is what points north. Also the design on the dial made it look to me like north on the dial might be to your left. Like your character was holding the compass 90 degrees rotated to the left. Once I figured out what was what, it got a little easier to find my way around. I still ended up getting lost a lot and having to backtrack.\n\nThe game itself had few scares and was mostly just creepy. You soon learned that when you were out on the trail for the most part, you were safe. Only when you got to designated areas were you at risk from the wandering monsters.\n\nThere was at least one part of the game where I got physically stuck with no recourse but to road. And there were two times where I fell through the ground and fell into eternity. Speaking of reloading, the game Auto saved when you got to a campsite, or you picked up a new note. At least the devs gave a fast travel feature, but only between campsites. I was also glad that they didn't do the whole, batteries in your flashlight run out cliche, but since there is a full moon out in the game, there was almost no need for a flashlight. \n\nOK, I think I have exhausted all I want to say about this game so I will leave you with this:\n\nIt was way better than 35 MM.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505180134, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505180134, "recommendationid": "34893319", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509890", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493854912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561197975567214", "num_games_owned": 223}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Walk to wrong invisible enemy spawning wall, punished by having to walk more and try not to walk into invisible wall.
