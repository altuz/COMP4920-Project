Keep in mind that this game is a bit different from the NES version.  This is the original version on Mac (either the original release or the enhanced release a couple years after).  The game launches in a window reminiscent of the original mac OS it was released on, using almost identical controls, graphics, and audio from its respective release.  If you know your way, the game can be ran through in just twenty minutes, but if this is your first time traversing Shadowgate be ready for many hours of trial and error to figure out how to make your way through the castle.  \n\nShadowgate is a classic adventure title, and this port is 100 percent faithful to the original release.  If you like old school text adventures, or older point and click games, you need this in your game library (along with Uninvited, Deja Vu, and Deja Vu 2).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499814900, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499814900, "recommendationid": "33467547", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 18, "total_reviews": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
