As you go through the game you collect different weapons which can be used to solve different puzzles. It's surreal watching a sentient television blast the crap out of things with SMGs and C4. You can choose the order in which you will complete the levels, which are connected by a central hub area, and you may find another way to complete a puzzle depending on which weapons you are carrying. I liked the sound and visual style, and although some choices were a bit questionable to me (pixel art with varying sizes of pixels combined with non-pixel-art), the game looks nice overall. For stylistic reasons the game is in 4:3. I kind of wish there were more enemies in the game, considering how many great weapons you get. It takes about 2 hours to complete.

Why? Two reasons (The last one is a huge spoiler so be advised):\n\nA) The game is only 2 hours long at a base price of 8 dollars. This is too high for a video game of this length. This is how long good free games on newgrounds are, or how long games like 140 are (which is 5 dollars). Even when edmund mcmillen bundled all his flash games into a bundle and sold it on steam the price was only 4 dollars. It is unacceptable for this game to cost as much as it does. However, this game does have a great potential for a multiplayer deathmatch mode and if that is added then this will definetely get a recommendation and be worth the money. This game cost almost as much and knytt underground and that is 24 hours long (and has better controls)\n\nB)[spoiler]When you reach the end, all that happens is that the TV dies for no reason and the pixels that reaminated it dissappear. To make matters worse, the game fails to remove the background noise from the final area and so any emotion that could have been invested in the ending is just erased by that noise.
