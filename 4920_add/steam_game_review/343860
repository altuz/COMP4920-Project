There's no time for any investment in any of the characters: Nowhere near a big enough picture of any of them to make me care very much. There's a bit of a twist, like in many other games of the genre, but it's telegraphed: Where Gone Home reaches a point where I wasn't sure what I was going to find next, where I dreaded going into the next room, We can see more or less what's going to happen here way earlier.\n\nSo while I don't hate the game by any stretch, there's plenty of better games in the genre, so I'd only recommend it for people that just want to play everything, or thought the people that made gone home need a donation.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505605591, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505605591, "recommendationid": "35009867", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563622", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506169087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 188, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 188, "steamid": "76561197970168870", "num_games_owned": 109}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I liked the AR concept, the characters, the voice acting, the art style.

Ill try to keep my gripes short but heres some of the problems i had with this title, and they all have to do with the story\n\n1)if you like reading then youll love this. In gone home you would find a note or page to read every so often but in this game a huge chunk and i do mean HUGE chunk of the game is told in emails and chat logs ECT. in gone home i felt like i was activly discovering things about the people in the story. in this game i just feel like im reading a book\n\n2)Part of the charm of gone home was that it had a small handfull of people to learn about and get atached to. In this game not only are ther to many people to learn about you never spend enough time with them before you move on to the next section. its a classic case of more dosent equal better. \n\n3)while i diddnt finish the game from what ive read and watched it only takes between 1-2 hours to finish. And im not against a naritve driven \"game\" being this short, but if your going to charge 20 bucks for a game when other devs give not only a better story but a much longer one for the same price i just cant justify spending that much. \n\n4)Another big part of Gone Homes charm was its setting. It was a huge nostalga trip to enter a 90s home full of nintendos and VHS tapes, Cassete players and so on. The station (while nice looking) dosent have the draw or charm Gone home had\n\nThe game isnt all bad, The station dose feel lived in and the places you walk around do feel belivable. The voice acting is fantastic and is the best part of the whole thing. \n\n\nThis game even with the 33% that they are offering to alot of people i just cant recomend it. if you can get it for 5-10 bucks and you like story driven \"games\" then go for it but for right now at this price its not worth it.\n\n\nPS: it says you can rebind your keys but you can only rebind the keys within the keys that  are default.

An interesting aspect of the game is that you find a lot of pre-recorded messages, recorded in the environment around you, that you can interact with and manipulate the playback of. It gives the environment a very believable atmosphere, and really lets you connect with the characters on-board the station.\n\nWhile the game is very story focused, it has quite a few interactive elements strewn about that you can occupy your time with. Most of them are to get a few extra details in on the story, but others are simply there for fun and to add depth to the world around you. Opening up a dart-board, for example, reveals a picture of the CEO of the company the crew works for, and you are even able to toss darts at it yourself at your leisure.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy the interactive narrative genre, call it a walking simulator if you will, this is another powerhouse experience by the people that helped get it started in the first place.
