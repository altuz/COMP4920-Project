Personally I do and I find them quite fun to play. So its you against loads of enemies that their sole mission is to destroy your fortress. Your task in this game to set up a good defense strategy to ward off the enemy that becomes more difficult as you progress through the game. Upon defeating enemies and winning levels, you can earn barrels and treasure from the enemies you kill in this game. The treasure is spent on buying and/or upgrading units. But the barrels can be used to buy upgrades at the upgrade shop and also can be used to open up platforms to mount units in a better position on some levels too.\n\nBe warned. You will need to think carefully on the harder levels because if you choose the wrong units and/or wrong upgrades. It could mean losing the round, but the good news if that you get to keep the barrels and you can retry if you lose. There are no limits to how many times you can restart a level and you can keep any earned barrels as well.\n\nIts a good game and a fun one to play if you like these type of games.\n\nOverall Rating: 8/10", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1502481788, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502481788, "recommendationid": "34175896", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510443", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 13}}
