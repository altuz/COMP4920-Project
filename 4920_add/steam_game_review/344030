As a big fan of the Monkey Island series I can't really say it belongs in the same group. Ghost Pirates has the exact same controls as Curse of Monkey Island, the same art style and it's about pirates. But it lacks a bit in the humour department. Some puzzles aren't really logical and after much trial and error I just looked up the answers. Most of the time the order of things was incorrect or some small thing just popped up in a place where I just looked before.\n\nEncountered numerous problems starting the game, looking at the discussions I'm not the only one. Eventually I got it running by forcing it to use my onboard graphics. Using a video card just wouldn't work.\n\nHowever problems left asside I did enjoy the game and would recommend it when it's on sale. Looking at my play time I've finished it in about 10 to 12 hours.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422921123, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1422921123, "recommendationid": "14303856", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523837", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444780771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 521, "steamid": "76561198113805058", "num_games_owned": 2325}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Played it on Windows 8.1 x64 (latest nvidia drivers) and I had no problems starting the game, played it in the 16:10 setting with 4x antialiasing (there were sometimes graphical glitches during the game (like characters walking through the backgroundplate or animations playing at the wrong position), and it did quit once when I tried to go to another location, so be sure to save your game every now and then)..\n\nThe game itself is quite fun if you like these point and click adventures (at least I thought it was quite fun).. There are 3 acts and every act has you playing as the 3 main characters on their own mission. \nBut there are some stuff I find not well done, like not explaining you could use objects on the characters in your inventory (I was stuck on papa when I just switched characters and there it was said you should ask another character about the object (or something like that), only then I knew I needed to use the character icons sometimes).\nThere are 2 'puzzles' which are extremely annoying as it kinda needs you to just guess the correct images in a specific order.. and especially with the second 'image' puzzle it seems if you don't get it right the first time you can't seem to finish it, so be sure to save when you're jane and entering the temple to defeat greenbeard..\nMost of the puzzles are straight forward if you look around and just use object together or ask the other characters about it.\nI bought it in a pack of more games with the pack costing about 3 euro's, so I definitly think it's worth the price, but the regular 10 euro it is on steam in the glitchie state it is, I would not recommend it, anything below 5 euro's I can..", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444781638, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444781638, "recommendationid": "18462956", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506174", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462864479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 564, "steamid": "76561197965463874", "num_games_owned": 349}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": "11", "review": "Can't play it.
