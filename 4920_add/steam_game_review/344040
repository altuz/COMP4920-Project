This is the story of how you, a Tall Knight, patiently wander outside, waiting for your opportunity to strike.[/i]\n\n\n\nHilariously awful. I don't know when i aquired this game, I just noticed it in my inventory. Hopefully it was free. Even if I did, I want my money back.\n\nI read the other reviews as it was installing, which took about 30 seconds. I believed them, but I had to see for myself.\n\nThere is indeed nothing in this game. You play as a knight in armor, who other than hunching over slightly as he breathes, is just a T-Posed character in a generic medieval looking town that seems just a little bit too small considering the size of the player, who scrapes his head on every ceiling you walk up to, if he can fit under them at all. \n\nThere is a 40 foot wall with no doors or indows surrounding the town, filled with one house model copied and pasted all over. To add some variety, there is another single copied model of a stone staircase wth a doorframe that the character can't fit through randomly placed throughout the town. The staircase doesnt lead anywhere, and even if it did, you couldnt go there anyway because the stairs are all half clipped into buildings so that you get blocked halfway up.\n\nThere is no audio. There are no NPCs. There is nothing to do but run and jump, and you can hardly even jump [i]onto[/i] anything. All in all, it puts a hilarious new meaning to the term \"walking simulator.\"", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504572800, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504573314, "recommendationid": "34747092", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504039", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505320871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 317, "steamid": "76561198158236502", "num_games_owned": 39}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Octopuses are considered to be very strong for a creature of their size.
