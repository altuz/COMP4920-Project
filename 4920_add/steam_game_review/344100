This game's physics are a little off. You can't walk up stairs or hills you have to jump to get up them. Needs a UI. Can't see health or anything like shown in screen shot unless it's unlocked later. Also needs the ability to click a button for hints. Despite these faults- because this game is still in the early stages- They have invented a great game. As far as I know It's still playable to the end.

I was trying to do a Playthrough of this game and post it on youtube.\n\nI Put 5 videos on youtube and I had issue with Screen Resolution not showing everything and having to restart to fix the issue. Events not happening,music cutting out, etc.\n\nI think the game looks ok. the controls are kind of clunky but ok, the story is good the dialog is good but the jokes get annoying a bit but its still good.\n\nI just wish the game worked so I could Recommend it. IDK if its because of Windows 10 or my elgato software or what but it just doesnt work.\n\n\n10-09-2015 Edit: I'm Changing my Recommend to yes because I don't want this game to die.
