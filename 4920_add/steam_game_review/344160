The game breaks entirely by day 31, and even though I had only made one film by that point, I really was not totally upset by not having to play any more. The game lacks any real feedback on what makes good combinations for the most part and the lack of customisation is extremely disappointing. For example, I decide to make a film set in the Stone Age, but there are no Stone Age themed characters. Then at day 31, the game shows a pop-up that regenerates infinitely. It is quite incredible how disappointing this turned out to be. Then there is the fact that the game required me to install an additional application just to run which I was not expecting and it is extremely poorly translated in places. These issues and the droning music barely seem worth mentioning in comparison to the abject awfulness of the main game.

It does not work properly and not one patch since his release. Single german developer who we talked with when the game released, has apparently decided to take the money he made and ran or take a permanent shit on society and fans.  Either way, the only safe assumption since it sold very well, and since... critckets or farts in the wind... is all we know.... he had a great thing, and kind of as it stands now in 11/14/2015 total garbage now. So this guy is in need of a good fonging!\nNever even completed the English translations either. Sad again.
