Well worth the $2.50 I got on sale.\n\nFor $5, I think I'd like to see a little bit more, maybe at least 1-2 more modes?\n\nEven still, lots of fun and I am keen to see how it develops further. \n - Hot Tip: Set the water level to rise in 10 - seconds, and it becomes a king-of-the-hill panic for higher ground.
