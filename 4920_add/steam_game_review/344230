Don't believe me? Go out, buy yourself a jigsaw and set it up on the dinner table and watch as your family start to drop their iphones and begin to tinker with the puzzle. Watch as invited dinner guests quickly gravitate to the open puzzle domain. These people are now vulnerable to being spoken too and often conversation follows. \n\nOn the other hand jigsaws to me are also a source of frustration as you shake the sofa violently for that missing piece, the dog looks guilty and you know he has eaten the damn thing as it fell from the table thinking it\u2019s a foreign food scrap since your wife's cooking most of time tastes like paper, or your examining the front cover of the jigsaw box like you\u2019re a doctor examining a x-ray about to perform a complicated heart transplant and have convinced yourself that the piece your holding needs to go into the place it\u2019s not going, but just needs a bit of gentle persuasion with a closed pounding fist.\n\nUnfortunately you will get none of those experiences with this game. The objective is to complete 25 jigsaw puzzles as the pieces float randomly around the edges. Annoyingly you have to collect crabs too and put them in a basket so you can earn points that give you three cheat options, which will reveal the picture for a few secs, correctly rotate the piece you are holding, or show you where the piece goes. Once you have used your cheat option, you have to collect crabs again to renew that ability.\n\nUI isn't exactly friendly, backgrounds of the pictures are often blurred, and the crabs are just annoying gimmick that get in the way, thankfully you can turn them off. Other than that, it's exactly what it claims to be, a jigsaw game featuring bird pictures. What did you expect it to have? Boss fights?\n\nStill in this day and age there are now animated jigsaw puzzles, puzzles with murder mysteries or intricate stories to them, and my favourite puzzle, find waldo. This offers none of that than 25 useless pictures about birds with no additional info about the picture or the bird.\n\nHowever, since it is what it says it is and if your a bit of a jigsaw cuckoo then this may be one for you when it goes on sale.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/D2RqyIeb1Co", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499133375, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499133711, "recommendationid": "33210686", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509133", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498600947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 362, "playtime_forever": 99, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 440}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So... Birds. Not the worst subject for puzzles. The mechanics of this edition are... different. You have to complete a puzzle to unlock other puzzles, arranged in a pattern of unlocking.
