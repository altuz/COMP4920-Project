The 3D models are serviceable (although overused, making each race appear to be made up of a minimal handful of lifeless clones), but the world looks like a muddy, blocky mess. The animations appear to be in slow motion. Boarding combat is a boring clickfest, and NPCs tend to clip through things frequently. There are interesting systems in the background (radiant content generation, individualized crew members with small, interesting differences, special crewmember classes that can be manually controlled, weather), but they don't make up for the game's flaws or price tag. I love the background of the game (Warhammer), but a few racial-themed ship and NPC models don't fix core gameplay issues.\n\nMan O' War: Corsair doesn't appear to be a finished product, yet it has been \"released\". I might repurchase it sometime in the future, if it receives some major polishing (and perhaps a fully-fledged sandbox mode, instead of \"campaigns\" for only three races and a custom battle mode I have almost no interest in), but it's not worth getting your hopes up or wallet out for in its current state, in my opinion.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506038352, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506038352, "recommendationid": "35116427", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519749", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506108314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 508, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1134, "steamid": "76561198012838998", "num_games_owned": 168}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game has some pretty nice aspirations. It offers a grand world and many interesting factions, as well as a couple of interesting quests. But it does have some major issues lying in it's foundation.\n\nThe best parts of this game is the incredible music, the naval battles as well as the advanced trading system. But these (central) parts of the game does not fix the underlying issues with the engines, glitching and AI. The developers are adding new content and playable races which is really sick, but the game suffers from the looming presence of glitches and clunky controls.\n\nThe worst part is made apparent when you get boarded. That's when the horrible animations get apparent, and enemies start getting pushed into walls and glitch up on top of barrels that are inaccessible to you. The graphics of this game is actually pretty nice. Textures as well as character models are slightly cartoony. But the animations are just really bad. \n\nIf you walk diagonally forward you have the same animation as if you were walking straight forward giving you a strange shuffle, you walk extremely slow in combat which is really annoying when you board a grand ship that you have yet to master the layout of, and glitches will pester you. When I did my chaos playthrough I was often crippled by being unable to move when getting boarded, so i had to resort to spamming light attacks to propel me forward slightly. \n\nThe chaos progression is extremely linear and does not offer you any sense of choice, just straight up upgrades that are made available progressively. The Human campaign is where it's at. The trading is really hard to get into, but ultimately offers some nice gameplay. During the start of the game you don't know what the average price of things is, so you just have to learn by making misstakes. This could be considered a flaw in the UI, but it does follow some logic, such as iron being cheaper up in kislev than in bretonnia, and Wine being generally cheaper in bretonnia.\n\nAnother Issue I'd like to delve into is the AI. If you join into a battle between pirates and a fleet of imperials you can bet your ass that the pirate ship is going to ignore everythign else and engage you into combat. The imperial fleet will also often times not be bothered to help you. I got chased throughout Estalia by two dark elf seadragon things. There were a multitude of defensive fleets around the ahrbours I visited, but none of them so much as batted an eye. The dark elf ships followed me relentlessly even though they were surrounded by enemies, and none of my allies helped me at all!\n\nThat was just frustrating and immersion breaking. I would not recommend this game at this point in time. It is actually pretty promising, but the issues lie in it's foundations, and are not easily reversed at this point. I hope to get surprised, since the game is still getting worked on. I will revisit this game as it gets more patches to see if I'll be able to change this review into a recommendation.

Because if you look there are other pirate games with no people on deck and no third person element at all, because that's like making a whole other game on top of the sailing one. Of if they do have melee, that and the ship combat is all they do, with no single player campaign.\n\nThat's why all the ports are essentially the same too, because they made this massive sea map as per the tabletop to sail around, but not a whole other world on land too, as that once again would be another game on top of the sailing. But at least the intention is there, it can be played and, in time, improved.\n\nDifference here is, with EC there are other 40K games that can scratch that itch, so you needn't stick with it. But there's no other Man O' War.\n\nSo yes, those other pirate games are much tighter, but less ambitious. And the slickest big budget title that does land and sea beautifully, does not have the Warhammer universe of fantasy creatures or the basis on a tabletop game. None of the others do.\n\nSo it's down to if you care enough about that to look past the flaws to get to the good stuff. It's also worth noting that being a niche interest title won't harm your game, as it's all single player, so long as *you* are interested, that's all you need.\n\nIf you're just casually looking for a game, walk on, this is way too flawed. But if you're reading this because you love this stuff and have had this on your watchlist for months and now it's 33% off you think you might go for it, then do.\n\nA game does not have to be perfect to be fun.

I know retrogaming is all the rage these days, what with youngsters trying to discover what exactly it was that made us of the [i]Golden Age[/i] gaming generation tick as it were. But I didn't realise that we had got way past this and had got to recycling the [b]PS2/XBox[/b] era so soon.... Well, OK so it's not [i]that[/i] bad to look at. But it's not far off.\n\nBefore sitting down to write this one, I have had to have a bit of a semi-serious think about what it is that appeals to me about MoW:C. As I'm not at all sure if my nonsensical addiction for anything [b]Warhammer[/b] may be blinding my judgement here. I'm enjoying it even if the graphics look like they're of a PC game from over a decade ago. The sea is about the only thing that really holds any water (pun totally intended lol). And even that looks a bit shifty when compared against the water effects used in much older titles. The likes of AC Black Flag or Far Cry 3 for example. The character animations aren't much better either, combat (on land and on deck) are laughably amateurish for this day and age, with just [i]two[/i] options in battle (three if you count your fire arm); Hit and block. Not so different from many other games, you might think. Except the animations are about as wooden as the ships that you're supposed to be floating on. And the running animations aren't that much better either. Making your Cap'n look like they've had one heck of a trouser accident. Not something you should be having to deal with far from shore. Or with that said, near shore ! As you never really have any need to go way out to sea. The whole world map, although sizable and plenty huge, does string along a singular coastline. This could very well change in whatever plans the makers have for this in terms of updates and DLC. But for now there is just the one solitary and oh so very very long coastline (Which upon further investigation, turns out it's the map from the actual Table Top rulebook. Duh Me !). \n\nWhich isn't a bad thing. As further out away from the shallows of the shipping lanes, huge beasts lay in wait to gobble you, your crew and your ship. So far I have only encountered one such creature, well one [i]type[/i] of these creatures rather and on a couple of occasions too. Probably something to do with the region I'm in, not sure. But judging by certain items that are available in the towns. There are more than a few hints that there are quite a few varieties of these Titanic sea monsters to contend with here and there.\n\nAnd yes, you can go on land (to a point). There are various towns and settlements dotted along the coastline that you can stop off at to trade your wares (both gotten and ill gotten), The markets have three basic stalls with which to buy your essentials, cargo, weapons and items of vanity tat for your Cap'n. You can take on work for your ship. Doing trade runs for local merchants, or take on more nefarious works. Like assassination and piracy missions. Visit the Shipwright for all your shipping upgrades (and to buy new ships as well). Or you can just take a quick visit to the local Tavern to hear the local gossip, Hire other Captains for convoy voyages or hire fresh crew for your ship. Something which you'll be doing a lot of, if you're the kind of Cap'n that enjoys biting off more than you can chew and inviting disaster at every opportunity. Which is more than likely to happen. You will also find special units for hire in these places too. Ones that will just give you that bit of extra protection out on the high seas. Such as Wizards (of varying skill and temperament), Winged horse riding knights and Griffons. If there are anymore of these specials to be hired, I have yet to encounter them. \n\nBut if you choose not to shop at these ports, you can always choose to sack the living bilio out of them. Which works sort of similar to boarding an enemy vessel. Except you enter the settlement and you and your crew wave your badly animated arms around until everyone is dead. Then you take what you want and set sail once again. There's not that much to it. But it breaks up the constant seafaring a bit.\n\nEither way, all towns look pretty much alike. At least the ones I have found myself at do and admittedly at the time of writing, I'm not that massively into it yet. But so far only their arrangement of features and size have differed. \n\nThe ingame menus are an absolute joke to navigate. To make your selection you have to look for the option that is the least highlighted ?? Whoever the **** thought that this was a good design idea is beyond me. But this is how it is for whatever reason. And if you're using a Gamepad for this, then [b][i]Har Har #SUX2BU[/i][/b]. Which is amazing considering the amount of effort they've put into configuring an official Steampad setup for this.\n\nOn the upside, MoW shines in it's representation of naval combat. Even more so when against the more alien looking of the worlds seafaring inhabitants (which ideally is what you're looking for anyway in a game with \"Naval Battles\" in it's subheading, right ?). You really have to watch the wind direction, as one wrong turn will leave you dead in the water and a sitting duck for enemy cannons and other various gameplay features make the game really come alive in ways you might not necessarily think possible when just judging it from it's cover. Like levelling up the crew and that. It's always a nice rare pleasure when you can get attached to NPCs in a game. As keeping your crew happy and in work, will ensure you keep various bonuses for your vessel. As well as keeping them from committing mutiny against you. Which can be a thing if you take no heed of their morale. \n\nAnd this is the thing. Despite it's looks and sub par presentation. There's actually not a bad game in here, somewhere. It may look like a dogs dinner and be atrociously executed in many of its features. But the background detail that comes out during gameplay is actually not that bad. Mechanically speaking, it's a great game. Graphically however, it all just seems to barely function. And the glitches and bugs seek to crimp its positives even further. It's almost an exact mirror image of the modern AAA experience. Where it looks more than pretty, but just sitting with it for more than an hour would put an ADHD (or PvP player lol :steammocking:), sufferer into a boredom induced coma. MoW has gone the opposite route. With some really nice gameplay and lovely, lovely mechanics...\n\nIt's just unfortunate that it looks like the crappiest cake at the crap cakes competition. \n\nThis came out of Early Access back in April (2017) and in more than a few ways looks like it should just go right back into it, as it remains severly unpolished for what should be considered a finished release. But despite it's many flaws, this open ended sail around the Warhammer universe, can be a fair bit of fun. And I do hope that the makers aren't quite finished with this just yet. A bit of spit and polish would do this game a good bit of justice.\n\nI'll give this a \"swinging from the highest Yardarm in [i]Norden[/i] Docks\" 7 / 10...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506155264, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506226558, "recommendationid": "35147409", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504463", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 204, "total_reviews": 282, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 78}}
