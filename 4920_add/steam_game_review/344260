There is no challenge or threat of death other than the story itself has. There are several diffrent endings depending on choices you make, I got four diffrent ones but it seems like there are more. At first there is a lot of walking to find the main areas where events take place and once you have found them all you can easly travel to each one. It may be hard to advance if you do not find all the events or items which are easy to miss. I was stuck on day two for a while because I was unable to notice an item on the floor near the clinic.
