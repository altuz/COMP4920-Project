Not a bullet hell unless you can't kill the enemies fast enough 8) Graphics and music are standard, action is constant, ship can be upgraded. A decent release. \n\nNow about the things that aren't mentioned:\n\nGame has 3 checkpoints and a \"continue\" system. At levels 11, 21 and 31 your progress is saved so if you use all your \"continues\" you'll restart at these checkpoints. Past level 31 you have to make it to the end with the \"continues\" you have. The game does save the level you're playing and the number of lives left so you can stop playing at anytime you want and resume later.\n\nThe very bad thing about this game is how you can gimp your ship by choosing the wrong upgrades. The game is linear; you can't just replay levels to make more money or try to get a better score on them so if you reach a checkpoint with the bad upgrades then well.... you can't repick them and chances are you won't be able to advance any further.\n\nAlso, once you quit the upgrade screen you are stuck to the secondary weapon you chose and the shield level you bought... meaning that you have to finish the level before changing anything to your ship. When i left the upgrade screen at level 45 i forgot to equip my satellites and was stuck with the beam laser and of course i had only 2 shields. Used up 12 \"continues\" before uninstalling the game.\n\nI though \"getting stuck with your choices\" was a 90's thing. When stuff can be upgraded we need to be able to either reverse it or farm for more cash, espescially if you can end up gimping you to the point you can't advance in the game.\n\nWas my 2 cents anyway.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434586884, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434586884, "recommendationid": "16485659", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580859", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460833701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 310, "steamid": "76561198058069187", "num_games_owned": 85}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I cannot give this game a good review even though i do like a good twin stick shooter which this sadly is not,the main problem is you cannot see what the hell is hitting you half the time,you can shoot a big asteroid from half a screen away and the bits that fly off come straight to the side of you every time its stupid and really annoying.\n\nThe levels which have planets you cant see enemy missles clearly enough or enemies for that matter,the side of the arena is hard to tell where it ends so you end up stuck sometimes and trapped.\n\nThe way the upgrades work is not really explained some are useless so a lot of trial and error will be needed ,buy the wrong one at the wrong time and you will get stuck unable to progress.\n\nIf you are patient and don't mind really hard games look for it in the sale you may get a few hours out of it there are some good things about it like the nusic and for the money you get a lot of levels and they do vary.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451470844, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460834657, "recommendationid": "20109287", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520658", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1425219425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 107, "steamid": "76561197969158018", "num_games_owned": 8941}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I love these action games.\n\nHeckabomb is a twin stick shooter - xbox360 controller is best\n\nThe game alternates between a score stage, where you have to collect salvage from destroying asteroids, to a survival like stage where you are required to 'move' (fly around) a certain distance.

I\u2019m ok that there are no cutscenes when you start the game but I would have liked to see the controls before being shoved in to the game.\n\n\nThis is one of my smaller gripes though.\n\nHere are the other reasons why I don\u2019t like the game.\n\n\n#1 The controls feel a bit unresponsive. It\u2019s  just a little, but this is the type of game were you need to be super accurate to survive the enemy waves it throws at you. \n\nI was using a controller by the way, but I have been as accurate in other games while using as much skill in them as I did in Heckabomb.\n\n#2 The screen gets horribly cluttered at times.  This is not good, as some enemies shoot blue tipped missiles at you. \n\n\nThese are extremely hard to see as they blend into the background.\n\nMany times I didn\u2019t see the missile until I crashed into it while I was dodging the harmless asteroid chunks that where left over. \n\n#3 Asteroids are OP. The bigger asteroids are way too fast, have more health than they need to and spawn way too much.\n\n\nOne of them tanked enough bullets that it smashed into me and taken off 2 and a half of my shields.  \nI only had 3 shields at the time.\n\n\nThe enemy ships in this game can only take half a shield off at the very most, whereas asteroids can kill you in two hits.\nShields aren\u2019t just shields in this game by the way, they are your health.\n\n\nSo once you run out of them, instead of being shield-less you die.\n\n\n\n#4 The super bomb is underwhelming. In games like Beat Hazard and Waves the bombs will blow up the entire screen, whereas  this one will explode like it\u2019s afraid of being too big and loud for its own good.\n\nI regret spending my in game money on the Super Bomb at all when I could have purchased fire rate upgrades instead.\n\n\n#5 Unfair enemies. \nOn one of the levels there are these space landmines that cannot be harmed until they activate and  come after you. \n\n\nAnd when they do they are far too accurate, can take way too much damage and also take 2 and a half shields off.\nWhich makes them the second thing that can kill you in 2 hits.\n\n\nAnd lastly reason #6. Unexplained game mechanics.\n\nBoth the mines and a big gold asteroid I found would reflect your bullets back if you shot them.\n\nI had no way of knowing this, other than by finding out first hand. I am ok that the asteroid reflects bullets, but I\u2019m not ok that the mines reflect bullets, as they are already too deadly. \n\n\nSomething I can give the game praise for is its soundtrack.\nIt\u2019s quite unique and sounds great. But a great soundtrack does not make up for poor or lacking gameplay as it is the case here.\n\n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say. \nSo now you can decide if you want to get this game or not. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457153275, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457153275, "recommendationid": "21633841", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444988549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 481, "steamid": "76561197971300886", "num_games_owned": 430}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A very solid twin-stick shooter.
