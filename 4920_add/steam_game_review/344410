Yes, this game is very similar to Portal.  It may even be a Portal \"clone\" but what the heck is wrong with that???  I dont understand why so many people give this game bad reviews simply because its \"too much like Portal\".  I liked Portal.  Im glad to have another Portal like game available.  Is this as good as Portal?  Not quite but in its own way its still pretty darn good!  Please do yourself a favor and dont listen to all the goobers who give this game a bad review simply because its \"too much like Portal\".  Yes, this game IS very similar to Portal but thats why I like it!  After finishing the \"real\" Portal games, I wanted more of that kind of challenge.  Magnetic offers more of a Portal kind of challenge.  As a benefit, Magnetic even mixes it up a bit by using a magnet gun instead of an interdimensional portal hole gun.  And you have the option of dying much more often in Magnetic so theres that as well!  Anyway, I really have no idea why anyone would give this game bad reviews because its too much like another game.  Especially another game that they clearly enjoyed!  I think some folk just like to complain...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506035047, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506035047, "recommendationid": "35115674", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501897", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 68, "total_reviews": 92, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 24}}
