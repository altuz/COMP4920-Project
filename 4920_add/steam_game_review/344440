Like most such games, the story was a bit more simplistic than I usually prefer. Nevertheless, the artwork was engaging and the puzzles amusing enough to provide a good distraction. I did have some technical issues, such as my computer freezing up when I tried to access the Steam Overlay (I was playing in fullscreen), but since I didn't lose any progress when I restarted and relaunched, it wasn't really a huge issue. Overall, if you like hidden object games and the supernatural, this game is worth spending a few bucks and a few hours on.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505220861, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505220861, "recommendationid": "34900499", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 33, "total_reviews": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
