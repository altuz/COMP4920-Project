Mechanics-wise, it's easy to do:  move a raindrop left, right, up or down, find a hidden jewel and cross over some number of pearls in the level.  Broadly speaking, most of the maps are interesting, fun, and satisfying.  Unfortunately, some of the maps (and these tend to be in the last era of them) get so complex that it gets frustrating (and I had to resort to walk-throughs).  Of course, this is a puzzle game and, I suppose, puzzles might involve frustration at some point.  More specific issues are:\n\n- The goal of finding the hidden jewels isn't mentioned in the tutorial.  It doesn't even show up as a bulletin at the top of the screen until you've finished several levels (no problem going back and finding them, though).\n- There's a secret level that's so secret there's no Achievement for it or even any indication that it might exist.\n- Because the jewel could be hidden anywhere, finding it is usually much harder than solving the puzzle (i.e., picking up the pearls) and basically involves trying to break every block or activate every green dot you can get to.\n- Those green dots are a pain.  When you traverse them, they expand into a blockage.  That means the puzzle changes shape every time you go over one and could change shape differently depending on which direction you traverse it (because of multiple green dots in a line).  Usually, that's not too bad.  But, there are several puzzles where there are just oodles of green dots and there's just no way to keep it all straight.\n- And, most confusing of all are the walls.  Unless they're blocked, you translate to the opposite wall if you hit one.  The problem is when there are multiple sets of walls:  you're uncertain as to which set of walls you'll translate to.  Again, this is especially bothersome in the final era of maps.\n\nAgain, I am recommending the game.  I got 10.9 hours of usually fun game play out of it and it lists for about $4.  So, it's definitely worth it.  I just wish a couple of the maps hadn't been so frustrating.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501017192, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501017373, "recommendationid": "33795160", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504908", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 50, "total_reviews": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
