I love it, whenever whatever I'm reading is well written. Fortunately, that's the case with this piece of literature (not always I have this luck with \"visual novels\"). \n\nYeah, this is not a game. It's barely audiovisual. There's no voice acting and there's only music if you remember to turn the radio on (I did it only after a while; the other controls are inconsequential). The scenery is monotonous [spoiler](maybe it's like that in Nebraska; I've met a guy from Nebraska once when I was studying in California and he was surprised that a foreigner knew about its existence: he told me that was not the case with a lot of Americans; I didn't tell him I only knew the word because of a Bruce Springsteen record, but I digress)[/spoiler] and you don't need to look at it anyway, because nothing unusual happens and your eyes will be busy reading. \n\nI'm not going to summarize the plot, but it's very well conveyed through dialogue only, without hand holding; even with a few things open for interpretation, there's really no mystery here. Character development is also great. Although there are branches of dialogue, there's no choice and consequence, no multiple endings, no replayability (you'll only need to play the epilogue again if you want the 2 last achievements; it's a very easy one to 100%). It's very short (2 hours tops), but it doesn't feel lacking. The extras are a nice addition: the music is very good, as the short stories. \n\nThe only annoying things are the need to keep a button pressed for the main game to go forward (the epilogue corrects that) and the general slowness, including the menus . But they're only a small nuisance, what matters here is the story. \n\nHave a good reading!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499974419, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503526735, "recommendationid": "33510287", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499498", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 32, "total_reviews": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
