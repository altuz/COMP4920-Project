It doesn't feel like a romantic story or dating sim, it feels like a tedious journey of happenstance situations with too many nonrealistic people where everyone ends up liking you no matter what happens (to a degree). I know it's not a popular opinion but I needed to voice my opinion so at least others are aware before buying it like I did. (Also, \"All Ages\" is definitely not the case, there's plenty of suggestive and out right sexual dialogue at times, this is not a purely innocent game, as I learned later...)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499577660, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499577660, "recommendationid": "33394589", "language": "english", "votes_down": 38, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447309", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 74, "total_reviews": 78, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
