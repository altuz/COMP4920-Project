It\u2019s a game about routing and picking your fights in a battle of attrition. \n\nThe challenge of the game [i]might[/i] be a bit light generally, with a conspicuous absence of boss battles or difficulty settings. In campaign mode you can start each map a good amount health and healing items, and the rogue mode seems to be pretty generous with health drops. Granted players can always artificially make the game harder by restricting load outs, playing with a controller, turning off the monitor, etc, but that\u2019s all a bit contrived. Kind of like some of the challenges in the Campaign mode. I can see why my employer wouldn\u2019t want me to destroy a certain system, or even avoid using grenades I guess, but why would they give a damn about how much hull I equip or whether I use fix kits? The timer threw me for a bit for the same reason, then I realized it only gives a bonus for finishing early, and doesn\u2019t penalize or forfeit the mission when it runs out. For all that, I do like the risk-reward aspect to the campaign mode, but the extra rewards basically just amounted to lives I didn\u2019t need, or the run quickly became unsalvageable. After awhile I never really felt like I needed more money for any particular reason. Whereas in a typical rogue(lite) game you generally don\u2019t have enough money for everything and have to make decisions. If it was necessary to take more risks just for financial stability it would add a greater layer of tension, at least till you get to the cryptark and just unload everything you have. The setting certainly could\u2019ve been explored a bit more in the campaign also, it seems like a missed opportunity, but I suppose that\u2019s just a minor gripe.\n\nSpeaking of minor gripes, I really wish there was mouse support in map navigation and the ability to set multiple waypoints, say by hitting shift+click or something. Enemies sometimes clip through walls unexpectedly. I like Jammer levels, but I find the way they work to be a bit silly, why can\u2019t I see the outside of the ship (presumably that could\u2019ve been mapped on approach)? Why can I see all the subsystems without mapping them (maybe just seeing the jammer would be enough)? When I destroy the Jammer and see the entire map, why do I lose the unexplored bits again when it gets repaired? Online Multiplayer would also be cool, but it\u2019s nice that local is included.\n\nCutting to it, I enjoyed Cryptark a lot. The sound and visuals were on point, the different types of ships and suits manage to vary the gameplay a decent amount, even though ultimately you\u2019re mostly doing the same things each time. It may not be the first twin stick shooter you should play, but it\u2019s very good.\n\nA couple ships from my playthrough, no commentary:\nhttps://youtu.be/3NnglKxBMn8", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505703345, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505703345, "recommendationid": "35037656", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514728", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505810238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 252, "steamid": "76561198066117282", "num_games_owned": 546}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Visually stunning and great: gamplay, soundtrack, sound effects, game mechanics, awesome story, very fast gameplay.\n\nI had to pratice a bit with the controls, but not hard and loved every bit of getting use to the game.\n \nOverall, I am loving the experince and nothing to complain about.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505626907, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505788802, "recommendationid": "35014961", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504758", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506182192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1005, "steamid": "76561197971808009", "num_games_owned": 410}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "One of the best made rogue-light twinstick shooters I've ever tried.

The game supports 21:9 which delighted me. The characters are well voiced and the mechanics are familiar twinstick shooter. But initially trying to do anything made me feel old and terrible at games. I wanted my money back, this wasn't fair!\n\nHowever, something about CRYPTARK made me want to keep at it, despite my initial failures. The systems demand investigation and adaptation. Learning to plan your approach to each ship and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of you equipment adds a tactical layer to the game that needs time to appreciate.\n\nYou are tasked with entering derelict spaceships and destroying the Core in order that the ship can be salvaged. Between you and the core are security systems and drones which make your mission far from easy. All of this and a time limit which varies depending on the ship. However, paying attention to the nature and function of the security systems and using the map, which helpfully pauses the game, allows you to take a breath, take stock and most importantly plan your insertion and prorities the systems you need to destroy before tackling the Core. \n\nThe Security systems include Alarms, Drone Factories, Shufflers (a system which periodically shuffles the location of all the Security Systems) and others. It's up to you to decide which to destroy and in what order. You can ignore them all and head straight for the Core if you want but you wont put a dent in it if there is a Shield System protecting it. \n\nAnd while the clock is ticking and you're fighting off varieties of turrets and drones you'll also be tempted by the tech blueprints dotted around the Derelict which unlock weapons and equipment you can use if you manage to finish your mission with money in the bank. Bonuses are awarded for finishing with certain paramaters achieved, destroy (or don't) specific systems, don't use certain weapons, etc. Occasionally this will reward you with an artifact which can be used to permanantly unlock new Exosuits with different abilities than your default. \n\nNot an easy game but a game that does reward patience and learning. I'm enjoying it immensely.\n\ntldr; An excellent tactical twinstick shooter for those with the patience to see past the initial difficulty and learn it's mechanics.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506436385, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506436590, "recommendationid": "35222995", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507031933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 799, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 911, "steamid": "76561197960557837", "num_games_owned": 203}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "2", "review": "So I finally picked up Cryptark while it was on sale. I'm liking it! (I really shouldn't have waited, but my BACKLOG though!)\nIt's superficially like Galak-Z, a top down Neo-Roguelike exploring huge randomly generated Space Hulk style spaceships (also asteroids in Galak-Z), killing enemies and picking up new equipment and earning money.\nShip Layouts:\nhttps://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/867363717186110151/A50785744D3936F239058069A925EA28AACDE49A/\nhttps://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/867363717186110870/E3AECAAEEED01D7A4D780397E8BBD9B90C19165A/\nhttps://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/867364059419289047/762FB33939F40A7B7DEE7F007FA3974050EAB103/\n\nWhere Galak-Z has one ship-type equipped with a main laser and guided missiles (also transforms into a mech with sword), with pickups being modifications to those weapons, Cryptark has 7 Mechs (1 to start, the rest are unlockable with Artifacts) and a wide variety of weapons under various categories: MGs, Cannon, Shotguns, Grenades, Rockets, Energy, etc. There is enough difference between the weapons in a given category to make it worth making even slight changes like Medium Machine Gun vs Burst Med MG vs Heavy MG vs Pierce Hvy MG, much less trading out a Shotgun for Grenades or Grenades for Rockets or Rockets for a Shield.\nLoadout Screen with Ark info:\nhttps://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/867363717199172595/E32AE2740B198E972766DE0E03D5DD680CFDFCD6/\n\nEach Mech has a different Active Ability to use, as well as different Passives, Max HP, Loadout Slots, and Speeds. Each mech has a different default loadout of weapons to start a run, but you can unlock all the weapons during your run and change them as you see fit. (You cannot swap Mechs during a single run however)\nMech Selection:\nhttps://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/867363717186109477/BBA5E259ECD077B541F3B3DD2F5E73E10718CE12/\n\nIt's super unforgiving, but once you learn how to balance your loadout cost (weapons, equipment, ammo) vs your earnings and bonus requirements, and learn what systems you need to take out in what order according to proximity to you and other Systems and doors (and bonus requirements), things become much more manageable. Also you can choose 1 of 4 ships to engage in each system you go to, each with different layouts, enemies, and Payouts & Bonus requirements.\nMission Debriefs:\nhttps://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/867363717198527827/66E569C8B6064EFCF17EFDDB7D5876EF59001291/\nhttps://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/867364059419288671/15F88ED6AAE48AF8694FF49DAAFAAF635AD681D1/\n\nAnd the core combat loop is very satisfying! Galak-Z is more of an Asteroids/Space Duel/Gravitar control scheme (I keep expecting gravity to pull me close to surfaces, but it never does), while Cryptark is a Twin Stick shooter but the 2nd stick aims and your weapons are mapped to the Triggers/Shoulder buttons.

You'll need to overcome shield and alarm systems, disable drone factories and sentry controllers, bypass locked doors and dismantle repair systems that threaten to undo your hard work.\n\nThere are actually two gamemodes in this - campaign and rogue. (There is also a local 'coop campaign' which I can't comment on because I've only played solo, as well as a final Cryptark Excavation mode I won't go into because spoilers. It's neat, though.)\n\nCampaign allows you to carefully plan your moves, overviewing different missions and deciding which one looks most doable. Though you're stuck with the same pioneer suit you choose at the beginning, you get to swap out your weapons before each mission if you so desire - you're on a tight budget, though, so be careful. Overdoing it and/or having to evac on a mission will lose you precious funds, and if you go into the red you'll have to scrap the entire campaign. \n\nBut this mode allows for some rediculously fun and interesting suit combinations, from balanced rigs to literally just strapping four machine guns on your arms and going nuts (probably my favorite).\n\nRogue mode has no budget, and you can't pre-select which mission you want. You go in under the radar and have to get by on salvaging weapon systems that are already on the derelicts, often throwing away weapons you'd rather keep simply because there isn't any ammo left in the magazine.\n\nAs for the pioneer suits, there's a wide variety of them with inbuilt special abilities that allow for widely different playstyles - dakka-dakka Gunhead, Rook or Jenner; fast running and gunning with the Weevil which can do short range teleports, even through walls; you can aggro enemies into your destructive flame aftertrail with the Salamander; or play covert with the Ghost using cloaks.

You have to carefully strategise you plan of attack, focusing more dangerous or annoying systems first. If you fail to do this or get caught off-guard you'll be required to improvise and sometimes it feels exhilarating though other times it can feel tedious.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nThe combat is excellent with a large variety of weaponry which leads to some interesting situations when facing up against more dangerous foes.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[b]Procedural Generation[/b]\nI find that the procedural generation adds nothing exciting to the game. So much so that I feel the game would've been better served if the levels were focused and hand made in its design. In the beginning it's not much of an issue as the derelicts are tight, have few systems and feel like its design matters but the problems arise in the latter levels where you're given enormous derelicts with multiple annoying systems on either ends of the entity making the initial strategy in the planning stages worthless before tedium ensues. The last level is a prime example of this. Instead of feeling some level of excitement from reaching it, I saw that it had multiple of the annoying systems and scrolled to view its size and sighed when I was developing my plan of attack. This is a fundamental problem.\n\n[b]Collision Bugs[/b]\nThere appears to be collision bugs present in the game. I once had a collision bug force me to abort a mission because I'd become stuck in the game's geometry while trying to avoid a nuclear explosion. Having the game force you abandon and restart your mission and ultimately wasting funds in a game where it's game over if you run out of money truly sucks.\n\n[b]Inconsistent UI/Poor UX[/b]\nThe UI/UX is extremely poor. You can use the mouse on the main menu but once in game you're forced to use the keyboard on the menus rather than the mouse as it useless. The steps required when equipping your armaments are more numerous than if you were given the choice of using your mouse. The same issue is present when viewing the map, you're once again forced to use the WASD keys to move the map reticle rather than the mouse and it takes longer than the mouse. This is strange as you can control the map reticle on controller with the thumbstick. Why it's not the same for the mouse simply amazes me.\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\nThe performance on a laptop is abysmal. Even though there's an option to turn off the effects in the options it still runs poorly with input lag and frame dips to skips. Although I eventually played this on my main rig where there are no performance issues the laptop performance is unacceptable for those who don't have a secondary option.\n\n[b]Hectic Nature Plus Visual Effects[/b]\nThough I like the hectic nature of the game things can get out of hand visually resulting from too many visual effects. The numerous effects can lead you to being temporarily blinded and getting unavoidable damage.\n\n[h1]Irritations[/h1]\n[b]Enemies break the game's rules[/b]\nIf there's one thing I hate, it's a game where the enemies break the games' collision rules. There are a few enemies which can ignore door collisions altogether and this leads to you getting attacked when attempting to open doors. Also be prepared to get hit from off-screen enemies as all enemies always take pre-emptive shots at you even though you're unaware of them unless you're constantly looking at the map.\n\n[b]Inaccurate Waypoint System[/b]\nWhen viewing the map, you're given the ability of placing a waypoint to a specific system or general location. However the path between your placed waypoint and you is generally inefficient when it's a long distance. Sometimes it flat out fails as it gives you paths through locked doors which you cannot open as you lack the sufficient key. Other times it creates absurd paths altogether, oftentimes ignoring the path which you previously took because the space is small when shown on the map even though the said space is wide enough to pass through.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nSo with all that said. Can I recommend this game? No, not really. I really wanted to but there's not much here for me to enjoy to be honest. What's here either simply frustrates or bores me from the game's design.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506456441, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506872204, "recommendationid": "35229371", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502487", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506296943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 477, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 477, "steamid": "76561198061706758", "num_games_owned": 179}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I want to like this game, I really do. But it is too unfair and buggy.\n\nFor example, there are several things that can happen ingame that can put you in an unwinnable state due to no fault of your own. (level generation for example, some systems interacting in a way that locks doors again (this is not mentioned in the game, levels can be generated with multiple systems that you cannot defeat ever. The distance between the systems is too large).\n\nSeveral things in the game make no sense in-universe wise, but are clearly intended only to make the game harder. \n- Enemies can move through walls and closed doors at times. \n- Certain big explosions only hurt you, not the enemies (one of those things you can only know if you read the forums, no ingame warning). Other explosions do hurt enemies. Both look the same on the map, and why stuff isn't hurt is unclear and feels very unfair.\n- The game over state is not having negative money, but dying if you have less than 100k left. For some strange reason you get fined for death (this is in addition to the cost of your loadout) which makes no sense in universe wise. Otherwise, going into negative money is no problem. You simply don't need to die. Which is unexpected and stupid.\n- You pick your loadout before going in, and you cannot go back to change it while the game is running nor can you reload. While your main supply ship is still there. This makes no sense. And is annoyingly 'game hard'. Pick a wrong loadout? The only way to try again is to die, ow wait. Then you can't try at the same level again, no the game randomly generates a new level. So you have learned nothing. (makes no sense in universe wise, and bad gameplay).\n\nThe game has bugs. Many bugs.\nExamples I encountered:\n- Only get the option of skipping the tutorial after having played the tutorial 3 times.\n- Game crashes a lot. Esp when alt tabbing.\n- Saving in rogue mode doesn't always work. (Yes, after the dev said it was fixed).\n- All kinds of various small gameplay bugs, javelin bolts dissapearing in certain cases, enemies who normally can project a shield around themsleves can suddenly project a shield in a random spot. Levels generated unwinnable. Corridors marked as passable on the map unpassable. Etc.\n\nAnd the biggest problem imho, why I think you shouldn't buy this game. I had a problem where the game relocked some doors, and that caused a gameover. (this was unexpected, and basically ended my run). Somebody had posted about this problem on the forum. Reaction from the dev: \"I'll look into this and see if I can reproduce (and also decide if it's something I wanna fix or not)\".\n\nBuy Starward rogue instead.
