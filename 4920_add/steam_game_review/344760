For one, I really enjoy the persistence of it, how you can keep working and making progress day after day. Another is the freedom to make your base however you want, with many different building materials and furniture to choose from. You can spend so many hours working on getting your base just the way you want it, one of the things I enjoy most. I don't mind the time consuming farming either, I usually put on some music or an audio book on while I'm out swinging the pickaxe. It feels pretty good once your base is built up to the point that any attacker would have a very hard time making much progress inside. If you happen to be in-game while being sieged, it's an intense experience being on the defensive fighting back, doing things like using your ballista or trebuchet to take out attackers and their siege gear. Unfortunately, you will most likely be offline while being raided. \n\nThere are plenty of toxic people that play, but also some great people who you will become close allies with. Playing with friends is a much better experince than going solo.\n\nThere are some huge problems with Reign of Kings that are bad enough to ruin the game for most people. Almost everyone will agree the worst problem is the duping/exploits/cheating, whatever you want to call it. After people realized that Codehatch won't be fixing problems or adding content, most of the player-base left the game for good.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506063870, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506064136, "recommendationid": "35122022", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512264", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499356551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 437, "steamid": "76561198060648879", "num_games_owned": 76}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Played it once and forgot about it wish i saved my $3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504999784, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504999784, "recommendationid": "34849093", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496705", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505123981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1217, "steamid": "76561198122302742", "num_games_owned": 129}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "pretty trash aye", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505123184, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505123184, "recommendationid": "34879672", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500354", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484855086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 578, "steamid": "76561198063319869", "num_games_owned": 27}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Its boring and glitchy", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505488123, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505488123, "recommendationid": "34974236", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427925104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2118, "steamid": "76561197993593194", "num_games_owned": 237}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Garbage", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505064713, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505064713, "recommendationid": "34867218", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497092", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505679077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3907, "steamid": "76561198083245940", "num_games_owned": 128}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very glitchy, hackers everywhere.
