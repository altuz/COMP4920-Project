Get it when it drops under $10. \n\nFor what it is, it does present a pretty decent WMMA booking experience. It's entirely text-based, which is fine for me but might not be for some players. As a text-based sim it's not at the level of OOTP or Football manager, so don't expect the same level of polish. \n\nI don't know how the people on Steam are, but the website forum community isn't especially friendly to non-regulars, so you might have to figure out some nooks and crannies of the game on your own.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a pretty old game at this point. The dev only sells their old games on Steam. You have to buy newer releases off their website, but when you do that you'll have to deal with E-license and all of the problems that arise from it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505745198, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505745714, "recommendationid": "35046412", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500044", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 32, "total_reviews": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
