Not a game where you get to control a wrestler in an actual match.\n\nThis isn't the company's current offering in the series, but the software sold from their website is evil - meaning it's tied to ELicense. So even if you aren't a fan of Steam - be thankful you haven't messed with ELicense.\n\nThat aside - this version has well established mods and is plenty of fun if simulations and wrestling are interests of yours.\n\n----\nMy original review on why I'd recommend it.\n\nTotal Extreme Wrestling (TEW) is a fun game if you always wanted to delve into the management side of wrestling.\n\nManagement side of wrestling? Yes, the side of the industry where we all know it's story based entertainment, with athletes portraying the roles of actors, all with varying degrees of success. In this game you play the role of the person who runs the company, building the stable of your wrestlers through contracts, defining which talent you'll be aligning to which story line, and who they'll be facing in order to make it all entertaining for the people who come to watch the show. \n\nThis is where the challenge comes in, as the best long running plot can fail utterly if you use the wrong kind of talent in pulling it off. For example, you may create a grudge war which pits two of your wrestlers against each other for the fans viewing pleasure. The individual steps of that grudge war can include actions such as one wrestler taunting the other in a pre-match interview. Well, if the wrestler you have give the interview isn't skilled in speaking well, then the fans might not find the taunting interesting enough, and as a result, they'll be cold towards the next event as they begin to loose interest.\n\nThe end result you find is it's a management / business sim where you need to hire athletic actors to manipulate the masses by entertaining them and playing with their emotions, which then nets you the money you need to keep the business going.\n\nAlso, while some folks enjoy the wrestling universe that comes with the game, I myself find it hard to relate to, so I usually find one of the fine \"Real-world\" mods that the TEW community has created, so that way I can hire / fire / ruin the career of wrestlers I actually am familiar with.\n\nWhile this isn't the current version of the game (TEW 2013 is), the current version is only sold on the company website. I've owned both, and found that I put more hours into TEW 2010.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426852181, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1426886074, "recommendationid": "14971284", "language": "english", "votes_down": 41, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578033", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489504065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7388, "steamid": "76561198068481655", "num_games_owned": 146}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 26, "comment_count": 0, "review": "EDIT: We need to nominate this game for a Steam Award! Preferably the \"5 more minutes\" Award! If this game is even nominated, it could open the doors to TEW 2016 coming to Steam, and I would sell a limb for that to happen!\n\nHonestly couldn't recommend this game enough. It may look a little rough around the edges, it might not have the best design or graphics but at it's core is a great wrestling sim that is very different, and very time consuming. In this game, you are not a wrestler, but instead you are the booker of either a ficticious wrestling company or your own. I may also add that this game is very mod friendly, you can easily import logos for your own company, or find mods that allow you to play as WWE, TNA, ROH, Shimmer, NJPW and many others from all around the globe.\n\nIf you choose to start your own company (which I recommend the most), you can assemble an all-star roster, compete with the big guys and get TV and PPV deals. If you find slight interest in backstage wrestling politics, you'll love this game. You can have fights in the locker room, maybe you gave someone creative control and they excercise the option frequently. It's not bare bones, it is in depth and I'm still finding new elements to the game! My biggest star got into an accident while holding the title. I conducted drug tests and found a lot of my locker room had taken substances, so it was my job to decide how I was going to punish them. It's a game about choice, and you can shape your own company.\n\nWhen you get onto the front page of the fictional wrestling news site when your title has changed hands, you know you've made it big. As your popularity rises and you become more of a staple in the wrestling industry, you are covered more by the media and are targeted by the bigger promotions, for example they can start chants in your arena, bring signs promoting other wrestling shows. Think like the Monday Night Wars. You can decide how women's wrestling is conducted in your company. Women may not be on your shows as competitors, they can have a small division or be fully intergrated into the roster, with them competing for the same titles as men. You can establish your own arenas, more like the Impact Zone and the Lucha Underground set. More importantly you can set up wrestling dojos and developmental branches (Note: Dojos and Developmental Companies aren't the same).\n\nThe game is pretty much one of my favorite PC games right now. It takes up a lot of my time, and I feel like I've just scratched the surface. It has no sound, and it's only in windowed mode. For me these aren't drawbacks but I thought it was worth mentioning. I find it helpful, if you have a duel monitor set-up, you can play the game and also have something like WWE Network play in the background (I recommend the Monday Night Wars show, as it illustrates the backstage antics and gives you a good idea of what talent to sign).\n\nThe game has it's own universe with characters and promotions already installed. Mods are easy to find on the TEW Warehouse website, they have Attitude Era mods, and current day mods. I've even seen some fantasy mods with characters from TV Shows, Movies and other Video Games.\n\nThis is a 10/10 game, even though it doesn't look like it at face value. I honestly belive that the asking price is still a steal, you're getting so much for what really is so little.\n\nI hope the developers of the game see this review and know that there is a lot of interest in a sequel and we also hope that you choose to release TEW 2013 on Steam, as it would bring a new audience to the game, as this entry on Steam has brought me towards the series after hearing so much about it.
