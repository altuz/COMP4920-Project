The only thing they really did properly was improve the look.\n\nWhat I was hoping and expecting from the game was a similar experience - and a similar spirit - to the first title, but this game made the mistake of taking itself too seriously. Combine that with the now-confusing ship building process and the feeling of confusion while watching or trying to command the battles, and it really breaks my enjoyment of the game. It just doesn't feel worth the money I put into it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500685424, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500685424, "recommendationid": "33709570", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507100", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504300977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2030, "steamid": "76561197996349463", "num_games_owned": 142}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": "4", "review": "Firstly, IGNORE THAT NEGATIVE RATING it is completely dishonest and put there by a bunch of butthurt morons, but I will go into that shortly.\n\nThis game is epic - first though I will address the allegations of bugginess which are complete BS. Yes, the game has one serious bug - about every 5-10 games the game will stop on launch. It does no damage [all games including multiplayer challenges] are fought in single player mode. Franlkly it causes 20 seconds of inconveience which is nothing considering what an amazing game this is. There are one or two other minor issues that you will hardly ever see.\n\nThis game deserves 90%+ rating on steam, it got about 35% for 2 reasons I will get into now -\n\n\n1. The second game is actually vastly, vastly superior to the first. It looks better, plays better and is utterly more tactical. However, it is MORE COMPLEX than the first, and that was a major source of butthurt to the fanbois of the first game.\n\n2. It has the above mentioned MINOR bug issue, which said fanbois have used to dishonestly wreck the game's ratings.\n\n  Frankly, the rating for this game is one of the most dishonest and unfair things I've ever seen the steam community do. It is COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIED and unwarranted to rate it so low, and I'm going to be honest - there is a race of zombies among us in the PC gaming community who just need to f*** off to consoles where they belong. Downvoting a game so much because of one little bug that any PC gamer worth their salt can take in their stride is a sign of a console-zombie. \n\n  Also, downvoting a game because it is more complex, and not compatible with the usual dumbed-down tards, is another sign of people who shouldn't be in PC gaming.\n\n  If you are a real PC gamer you will love this game. But you know how it is - if you put a fine wine and a can of cheap lager on a table, the peasants will take the lager every time.\n\n\n  This game has so much to offer - it really does look and play amazingly, and you can constantly evolve and test new tactics and designs. If you are an intelligent person, interested in design, tactics, military evolution or anything that actually requires some braincells, I HEARTILY recommend you get this game and please upvote it when you do it deserves so much more than to die under a barrage of console-tards who shouldn't be anywhere near PC gaming.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502203042, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502203042, "recommendationid": "34104740", "language": "english", "votes_down": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490576", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 53, "total_reviews": 137, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 84}}
