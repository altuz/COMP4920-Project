Some of the level objectives are really tough, and there's a good ramp up of difficulty between levels. It's the sort of game I come back to when I get the urge, play a few levels, rage quit and ignore for a month or two.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505561880, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505561880, "recommendationid": "34994641", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504562767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 55, "steamid": "76561198284426452", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I think this game is well made but theres little incentive or reward for making more money other than the ability to make more money.......just feels lonely staring at the factory screen......", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505277758, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505277758, "recommendationid": "34913285", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 413, "total_reviews": 546, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 133}}
