One of the reasons I'm reviewing it is that unlike a lot of games in my library, I bothered to play it through to the end.  For someone like me who bores easily, that's saying something good.\n\nOn some levels In Exilium doesn't begin to compete with ARPGs like Diablo 2, Titan Quest, etc.  But that's okay with me because it doesn't really try to.  It takes a different approach.  It focuses more on exploration and puzzle solving than smooth, fast paced combat and tons of awesome loot.  And even though I love those latter things, I found In Exilium to be a refreshing change.\n\nThe puzzles were just the right difficulty for me to not get too hung up on but still have to think about a little.  You have just enough freedom in regards to what areas to take on first to make your first playthrough more interesting.  The combat, while perhaps clunky compared to bigger budget titles, was still adequate.  You have a variety of skills to choose from whatever type of character you choose to play.  The atmosphere is cool enough.  There's some replay value if you want to build a character for each of the 3 main playstyles.  The drops, while plentiful enough at least in the latest version, weren't all that interesting to me and are an area that could maybe be improved on a bit.\n\nAll in all I just found this game enjoyable.

I'm impressed!  I didn't hear anything about this game, so I wasn't expecting much at all.  I like it a lot!  It is very reminiscent of Diablo 1 and a little of Diablo 2, but much better graphics and animations, but short on story.\n\nYou start off by creating a character.  You get to choose from 3 classes.  Warrior, Mage & Archer.  Starting stat points are static and cannot be changed.  You also don't get any points to distribute in the beginning, but you get 3 points each level gained.  You also get to name your character, but you cannot change their appearance, although, your character does show the weapons and armor they are wearing.\n\nYou have 5 main stats to pump your points into.  They are Strength (melee), Dexterity (ranged), Focus (mana), Intelligence (magic) & Vitality (health).  There are many skills as well.  It is a basic buy the book RPG dungeon crawling game, with some forgiving features.  This is a great game for newcomers to the genre!  It's becoming one of my favorite dungeon crawling games!\n\nYou start the game at your base camp with a shared storage chest for all your characters, an anvil for crafting, a fast travel campfire, a training area with infinitely spawning target dummies, plus a forest and dungeon entrance.  There are other places to go once inside these areas as well.  The game looks huge.  Not sure just yet, but looking at the trailer, it seems to be a large game.  You also start off with a camp teleport skill.\n\nThe sound, music, graphics, lighting and textures are very well done.  There is a great selection of enemies to annihilate! lol  Character and creature models are animated well.  Nice level layouts.  Mini-map, camp teleport, shrines and gems for enchanting weapons.  It pretty much has it all.  I'm very impressed and very happy with my purchase!\n\nThe one thing I love about this game, is you level up so fast!  I'm already level 30+ after a couple of hours!  You can level up sooner if you want in your camp by killing target dummies in your training area!   I am not sure there is a level cap, but I doubt it seeing how fast I'm leveling up and haven't gotten very far into the game yet.\n\nThis game is for people that like to level up fast, but still have to fight for your goodies.  Beware though, the monsters are pretty tough!  This game requires some grinding as there are not a ton of weapons and armor like the Diablo series.  Yes, there are some good items, but you have to fight for them and they come very slow, until you find a store.\n\nYour health and mana regenerate automatically, but you can still die easily so beware!  I don't think there is a penalty for dying.  I died and was just sent back to camp with all my belongings and currency.   Currency is weird.  Not sure what it is, but the monsters give it to you when they die.  Kind of like souls floating to you.  It's a cool effect.  It is the only means of purchasing items that I have found, so you must kill monsters to get currency.  Luckily monsters respawn and pretty fast too, so don't get cornered!\n\nYou move your character and melee attack with the left mouse button and use the right mouse for ranged attacks, including magic and skills.  You can set traps also.  I haven't checked out skills too much as my Archer it pretty strong and I am on a leveling up spree. lol I have laid traps though and they sure help out!  I also use a dagger with my Archer and an axe.  He's pretty powerful considering my stats point placement.  You can also buy a scroll to reset your stat points.  Cool game so far!\n\nI fully recommend this game to anyone looking for a light RPG game done very well!  Not a huge story, but lot's of dungeon crawling! :-)\n\nI am currently running this game at full graphics settings on my 6 y/o laptop!  Awesome game!
