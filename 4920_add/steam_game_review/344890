Almost any other dev group would have scrapped/abandoned the entire game, leaving it unfinished. I really think that if they had more exposure to the gaming community, things would have progressed a lot further! These devs have kept working on this game despite all of the negative reviews. I approve of these devoted devs and I think that the steam community should give them a chance. I think that this game could eventually be as good as Subnautica, P.A.M.E.L.A, and space engineers. This game has major promise and the devs are committed to making this an awesome game. These devs can use all of the support possible.....
