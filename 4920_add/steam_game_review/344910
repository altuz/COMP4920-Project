Rail Shooter\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR:  Runner/Rail shooter schmup experience. Would not detect Xbox360 pad. Poor gameplay, badly designed. \n\nThis is basically an odd tablet-grade shmup. Your ship, the foes, are all 3D models that are way too large for the play area and constantly obscure your FOV by ramming straight in the camera. Very early in the game foes with very small hitboxes start appearing. Lining up shots is a tedious affair of having to navigate both X and Y axis, lining up with a foe, and hoping it does not ram you before you shoot it down. The visuals were disappointing with zoomed in view but still little particle effects representing galactic travel... while you hover on top of a planet that does not move. None of it makes any sense...
