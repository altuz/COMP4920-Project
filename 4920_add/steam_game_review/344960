Most important thing to note- The main focus of the game is the puzzles, not action or adventure or the storyline. \n\nIt is definitely repetitive and some of the puzzles are very easy, but sometimes collecting everything can be quite challenging. The blocks that can only be moved once add to the difficulty levels, sometimes you need to restart the level several times in order to move just those blocks into the right places.\n\nEach individual level is very short. I play a couple when I have some time, while drinking coffee or waiting for something to cook. It is not a game that should be played every day or for hours on end.  Playing a couple levels a couple times a week also stretches out the gameplay. Steam says I've played 4.2 hours over 2 months or so, and I've only just completed the first world.\n\nThe controls are extremely simple- I use both the keyboard and the mouse depending on which blocks I need to move.  Because I often have long time periods away from the game, the simplicity helps when I return to playing.  I spelling errors don't really bother me because there's very few messages during gameplay,\n\nIf you like puzzles, this is a cute, quick game to fill some free time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450583454, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1450583454, "recommendationid": "19796012", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497770", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1428175711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 325, "playtime_forever": 148, "steamid": "76561198016432675", "num_games_owned": 834}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Jaques Roque just doesn't stand out in the end. The puzzles aren't hard enough or clever enough to really stand out on their own, and the games lacking aesthic doesn't help the fact that you think you're playing a game that was really designed for the IOS. Several of the puzzles lack real good design which is critical for a puzzle game, and I was bored to sleep by the time I made it to the second set of levels. I'd pass on it. \n\n+:\n-Multiple levels of success is available so those who are OCD about collecting everything will have to think a bit more. \n-Won't frustrate to the point of keyboard smashing, controller throwing.\n-Every now again, a puzzle does something interesting and unique with the elements it has.\n\n-:\n-Doesn't introduce new mechanics in a timely manner: gets boring rather quickly.\n-Some puzzle elements serve no purpose, as in, there's only one thing you can do with them and that's it, you can't use them to fail, and the only move it to succeed. Gives a false feeling of doing something important, when it fact, you made no real choice.\n-Lack of useful controls such as a button to restart are present. \n-Visuals don't help the experience, stand out like a sore thumb and certain points. Controls and options make the game seem like it was a mobile game (really only relies on the mouse). But no mobile game to be found from what I can see. \n-Not unique in any way, and given the tons of puzzle games out there that are, it's hard to justify to get this game over a series of cheap ones on sale. \n-Obvious Misspellings that stand out. Seems like it might have been translated. \n-Generic Music\n\nFor more first Impressions and Gameplay Footage: http://youtu.be/1K_N_samACs", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427913796, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427913796, "recommendationid": "15158658", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506872", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500169577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 409, "steamid": "76561198033107016", "num_games_owned": 349}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "1", "review": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466814723, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1479660679, "recommendationid": "23774347", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480732", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499097077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10134, "steamid": "76561198088988695", "num_games_owned": 107}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "try to collect all the gems, treasures, etc. on each level then find the exit. to get gold on each level requires obtaining all the collectibles. to go back to a level that you want to repeat you have to choose quick game from the main menu. i suggest using a mouse & keyboard together to play this game. \n\ni finished all 100 levels. there are 5 worlds with 20 levels each. give it a chance because when i started out i didn't think much, but it's definitely a fun game. the main complaint i would expect being a puzzle game is too easy. just depends on the player probably. many levels were challenging to me. i got gold on every level except about 10 of them. i don't think being easy at times is necessarily a bad thing either. \n\nin conclusion, if you like puzzle games you will enjoy this game because of the simple game play that involves sliding blocks. it may be somewhat similar to other games you have played but also adds other elements. importantly, it is well done as far as the graphics & level design in addition to providing very many hours to finish.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498990997, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498990997, "recommendationid": "33124650", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
