Light of Altair can give you hours of fun on end, and is so addicting that even if/when you get stuck and want to stop, it keeps bringing you back. It's a really enjoyable space strategy game. (the review before this parenthesis was made before i finished it) now upon finishing it, i can still agree to what i said before, but with one caveat: limited replayability. There is only the story missions to it, with no sandbox/freeplay or challenge mode, thus limiting replayability.
