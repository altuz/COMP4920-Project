This game is no longer in active development. There are serious bugs and quality-of-play issues that are not being addressed. No updates have been made in the last 10 months.\n\nThe whole point of this game is to build and run colonies and space-stations. There are dozens of building/module types that all have to be present and in balanced quantities. You will need to track several dozen resources used in construction and operation of your colonies/space-stations. Be prepared to spend more time building your spreadsheets and working your project-planner than playing. If you fail to account for everything, precisely, you risk causing a cascade of failures that is very difficult/time-consuming/costly to correct.\n\nColonies can have over million buildings, each one placed by hand, by you, from a spaceship that only turns and goes forward, while being thwarted by the effected of local gravity and having your ship block the view of where you want to build. The process of laying out your colonies/stations is very and unnecessarily, tedious and frustrating.\n\nYou are also responsible for moving resources between producing colonies/stations and where they are needed for building, consuming, finishing, or sale. This becomes your \u2018chores\u2019 that need to be done everyday, or it will mess-up your production. The amount of time needed increases as you build more colonies and they get larger. The process includes manually loading/unloading the cargo and flying thru multiple \u2018gates\u2019. There are the same cut-scenes to watch between having to pick what gate to fly to next. I am at a loss as to explain how boring this is. \n\nThere are some resources you will need that can only be found if you mine asteroids. It is the usual; find the right rock, chase it down while your both moving, a long wait while maintaining aim and distance, watch the cut-scene. If you do it right, you are rewarded. Failure gets you nothing. This quickly turns into a tedious and boring \u2018have-to\u2019.\n\nThe game lacks many quality-of-life features. The type-face and its small size makes reading prone to mistakes. Most of the UI is not movable or sizable. The chat-box is extra difficult to use. There is no mail system for players. Field boxes for typing quantities are not big enough to hold the numbers. Information you need while flying is in the far corners of the screen. While traveling, you can\u2019t select a destination, just the next way-point. There is no compass. You have to visit the actual module/building to see its status or manage it, there is no central facility. The game crashes. And more, a lot more.\n\nThe final fail for me was realizing the resource map does not actually tell you where the resources are. The colony map grid, the resource map, and the actual resources placement are not the same grid. I used several days worth of resources to build hundreds of buildings only to find I failed to build my colony the way I expected/wanted.\n\nI did get out an explore with a mid-size ship and only for a few light-years. All the stars I saw except three were already \u2018discovered\u2019. The ones with my name on it was hidden behind a larger star in the corner of the sector. It is my understanding that you have to get many jumps out before finding anything new and the needed ship is very expensive. Note that exploring requires a lot of time scooping Hydrogen and there is a limit on how far you can go before your jump-drive wears out. If you are searching for a colony site, you must take the time to manually land on the planet/moon. With hundreds of \u2018test\u2019 I found none that were suitable.  \n\nThe one positive thing I must say about the game is the other established players. There were only a few people on the server with me, but everyone in chat was friendly and helpful. They quickly filled in any information missing from the wiki. Some even make their extra resources available to new players and it helped move the game along for me.\n\nSomeday, someone will write a space game that does not require spread-sheets, slay you with time wasters, or club you to death with the \u2018space is really big\u2019 thing.
