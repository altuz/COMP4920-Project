It has a steep learning curve and the controls are very clunky but once you take some time with it, it's surprisingly fun. I was expecting broken phyics but so far failure feels deserved with my own terrible engineering skills. I especially enjoy being able to drive the truck in the full 3d environment instead of simply pushing \"play\" like in other bridge builders.\n\nI'm still scratching the surface of it, slowly getting through the 3D Bridges content before tackling the more advanced 3D Engineers stuff but I have to say I'm enjoying it all way more than I thought I would. I put a video up where I go over things in more detail: https://youtu.be/W17rZ4FFS90\n\nEdit 11/23/16 It's still fun but I'm getting concerned this is abandoned...

So far I have went through the tutorial in the bridge part. Tutorals are good and once you get through them you have a good grasp of the controls and the game. I played a few missions after the tutorials and they are very good as well. I think this is definetly a buy. Do not listen to the people talking about how bad the graphics are, they have little to no impact on the game and they are not that bad. The controls are a little off but you get use to them quickly.  I love how you actually drive the vehicle.\n  This game so far is way better than all the other bridge contruction games I have played and I havent even tried the engineer part of it.

With that said im sorry to say that this game is just not upto par with  more modern games. The graphics are just god awful with only one setting for shadows. the controls are very un-intuitive. dont expect to be blown away by the level details (the levels are small squares). I can see they are still releasing updates for this game, idk why. The develeper (im guessing there is only one) should honestly start from scratch or make some major graphics and UI overhauls. In the end i could probably spend an hour or two learning the controls, but i dont have time for that.

The graphics aren't ultra-real pixar animated but the physics are in fact what count here as you build your way through the scenarios. You learn real quick when thicker beams/ropes are necessary vs when a lighter object will work, and the truck literally couldn't be easier to drive around unless they did it for you (which wouldn't work because some of what you have to do is pretty interesting). The only issue I've encountered is laying down road tiles, sometimes they'll snap to full shape properly and sometimes they'll tell you it's too much. Scrap it and try again. All around a solid 8/10 if you like a bit of challenge while you build stuff, higher if you don't care how good it looks while you do it.
