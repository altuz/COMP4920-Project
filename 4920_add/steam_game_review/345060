The dudes with lightbulbs for heads look pretty neat and there's a nice splashing of colour, it made a great first impression.\n\nThe mechanics involve aiming your character (a dude with a lightbulb for a head) to throw an object to kill some little green monsters.  So it's all about power and trajectory.  Excellent!!  I really like these type of games.  I used to love playing that tank game where you try to kill your buddy/cpu by aiming your turret over a mountain and taking chunks out the landscape!!\n\nSadly, the mechanic is broken...  I think what is happening is when the mouse pointer moves off from the screen it doesn't allow you to change power or trajectory, fixing you on the last angle before you left the screen.  If you need to increase your angle or power at this point, you can't.  Or if you can it's gonna be fiddly.\n\nThe other thing, the fps drop and I had big lag spikes.  I'm using 970/i5 and this is a static screen with a couple of moving sprites.  Obviously some bad code.\n\nMakes me cry a little inside when I see something like this.  Good concept and nice looking graphics destroyed by game breaking bugs.  If the dev/s ever fix these issues, I'd come back and recommend this in an instant.  As it stands I'd advise to avoid it unless you think you can put up with these poor issues.\n\nChecking through the forums I notice this from the Dev :-\n\n[quote=Wyse Games;618463738401543592]Hi there! We think that we figured out the issue. The patch is coming soon, stay tuned. [/quote]\n\nThis was 10 weeks ago.  Maybe there is hope that the game will get a patch to fix the issues.  If so, I'll happily come back and I'm sure recommend the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/345060/discussions/0/617329505855689819/?tscn=1447451684#p1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439973983, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447455881, "recommendationid": "17611502", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.431152", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1425337499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561198024487361", "num_games_owned": 356}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you liked Angry Birds or Crush the Castle,  this might be the game for you.

The game reminds me somewhat from \"angry birds\". You have limited light bullets in order to take down those slimes. In some levels you are even able to find  piece of puzzles.  There are alot of levels and The light bullets are able to bounce from the walls and ground. Whenever you are launching a light bullet, you will see the angle of your last shot which is really handy. Whenever you are trying to launch a shot, you will see an angle which helps you for firing. You can also get Stars 1-3 but i mainly think its for highscore purposes. Some enemies can walk behind the structure or teleport away to a different location.\n\nMusic is somewhat disruptive but okay.
