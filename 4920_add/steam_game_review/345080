What I got was a flaming turd that's so poorly made I can't even quit the game without encountering some kind of reset-inducing system fault. Why is the tutorial so hard? Why are there people who refuse to leave burning rooms? Why do some rooms continually burst into flame even after you've extinguished all fires and are dousing the shit out of everything with water? Why does this garbage exist? Running into an actual burning building is simultaneously more fun and subject to physical laws that actually make a scrap of sense.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496573734, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496573734, "recommendationid": "32173416", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505848", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 51, "total_reviews": 75, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 24}}
