Absolutely none. No leveling up, no inventory.\nThe only power increase you are getting as you progress through the game are \nthe sword power-ups which gives you a ranged attack and makes it more effective \nagainst certain enemy types. That's it.\n\nYou can collect skulls and statues, and replenish lost lives \nwith red vials (1) or bottles(fills life counter).\nYou also collect gems and keys to open doors.\n\nThe enemies are the usual unimaginative generic skellingtons and stuff, \nso nothing new there. Graphically the game is okay if you can put up with the \nlow-polycount enemies and simple, repetitive wall-textures. \nHowever it still performs well in its task of creating an atmospheric dungeon.\n\nThe puzzles are typical for a grid-based dungeon crawler. \nPulling levels, shooting projectiles and pushing buttons, \nand some timed gauntlets/tasks with risk of getting a fireball in the face and such.\n\nThe biggest letdown I got across is the health-system, or lack thereof.\nBasically you have \"hearts\", which are same as your lives.\nIf you get hit by an enemy or fall off into a trap the screen INSTANTLY fades into black\nand the game plays an \"Aaaahh!\"-sound with an animation of one of the hearts falling apart.\nYou never even get to see what happened.\nThen you are teleported a few steps back to the entrance of the room.\nEnemies do not reset so they have same amount of health when you come back to them.\nNot exactly immersive. I would have preferred seeing a heart disappear from my HUD when I am hit and carry on playing instead of having my gameplay interrupted.\n\nBut despite of these shortcomings it is a fairly solid little game.\nIt really could use some extra polish but it has a lot of potential.\n\nI'd probably recommend this to an older player who is new to VR and isn't into a frantic \ngameplay and enjoys an atmospheric game.\n\nI'd give this game a 7.5/10.\n\nI bought this game on 75% sale for \u20ac2,.49, so it was worth my money. \nI suggest getting it when it is on sale.\n\nI didn't encounter many bugs, but I managed to get myself stuck into a room when I was backtracking to look for hidden areas .\n[spoiler]The rooms with mummies before stairs down.[/spoiler]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504005371, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504006028, "recommendationid": "34574702", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508081", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 35, "total_reviews": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 21}}
