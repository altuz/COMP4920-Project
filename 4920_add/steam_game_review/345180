I'd call it a Diablolike, as that is its ancestry, but unlike most games of the type I've played in the last several years it has a drastically different control scheme and design sensibility. The game controls more similarly to a twin-stick shooter then anything else, using WASD for movement and mouse-based aiming, as well as a dodge button, which you will need to mash until your pinky finger goes numb- at least initally. After a while you just do it to get around faster.\n\nYou are the title character, a hunter of all things evil and undead and notably voiced by Doug Cockle of The Witcher fame, come to the Eastern city of Zagoravia at the behest of another hunter friend of his. The city is under seige by a demonic invasion such as has never been seen, and hunters from all over are being wiped out. If the premise, gameplay, and fact that you only have one character sound at all similar to that of The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, that's because it is, though there is less emphasis on weird science and more on straight gothic horror, albiet with shotguns. \n\nRather then classes or hotbar-based skills, you can equip two weapons and your selected weapon determines a set of three attacks, one for your left mouse and two bound to Q and E, by default, while the 1-4 number keys use potions and equipped demonic powers, which are fueled by a resource called Overdrive, typically earned by damaging enemies. You have only one armor slot that determines Victor's entire costume, and changes how you earn Overdrive. One outfit removes overdrive gains from damaging enemies and makes it simply regenerate, making you more of a mage-type character, for example. \n\nThe game uses a hub-based layout, basing you in Castle Zagore. From here, you can interact with vendors, an item stash, a few plot NPCs and a map that lets you warp to any previously discovered stage. The game is very convenient this way, as you can enter and leave any stage at any time. \n\nStarting out, the game was quite fun to play, having a more brisk and action-oriented pace then its contempoaries. However, around the halfway mark, the game begins to drag. In part this is due to the game's wanton abuse of \"challenges\". Every stage has five such sub-objectives, and five MORE after you've beaten the game, which basically means that two thirds of the game is just replaying the same levels over again- but rather then progressing through such linerally and with better abilities and loot as in Diablo, Path of Exile or Titan Quest, they tease you with the first of these challenges the first time you access any stage. Some are a breeze and can be done your first time through, but many require you to use the \"Hexes\", gameplay modifiers that make your life harder a la the Skulls of Halo or the God Totems of Bastion, sometimes multiple at once, and later on, many of the challenges conflict with one another, making it all but impossible to complete in a single run, requiring you to retry them multiple times. If there's one thing I can't stand in games, its trying to milk more hours out of the same content while making it more of a pain in the ass each time- The Just Cause series comes to mind. Towards the end of Victor Vran i got fed up with these wastes of my time and patience and decided to press on to the end. \n\nI should also mention that the combat flow kind of careens away from the action style and more towards a traditional ARPG emphasis on having a lot of damage mitigation, through armor, max health, life steal or what have you. It's kind of messily designed that way. It also has a few too many dated memes and references, some of which feel jarringly out of place.\n\nI liked Victor Vran, though I have to admit it was more due to its aesthetic then its mechanics. Like any game that uses annoyance as a feature, It left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.

I've spent 30 hours on it and got more than my money's worth. The value is not really the problem here, rather as I've mentioned already: the game is way too simplistic. I regret spending time on it, not money and as I am quite a busy individual: my time is worth to me more than money.\n\nProgression is very linear. You don't really choose a build per se, you choose a loadout, which should work in theory. In practice the game lacks variety, unfortunately. There's a card system, but most cards are useless and the ones that are interesting only really work well with certain weapon types of which there are but a handful no less. Special abilities are there too, but each weapon only has two of those next to its basic attack.\n\nVV fails even in what should be its endgame: loot hunts. What's the point in having so much variety with golden weapons? The legendary weapons all have fixed stats yet being the most powerful weapons in the game giving even the best golden ones the run for their money. Once you find a good legendary weapon everything else just goes into a garbage bin. Was it so difficult to have legendaries get randomized traits, but behave like special weapons none the less? I really don't understand this at all: the devs killed their own game right there and then.\n\nOther than that: the combat is fun and it's a good time until you hit the endgame, which is where I suppose most games such as this one fail.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501089960, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501090088, "recommendationid": "33813512", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490175", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475574871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1026, "steamid": "76561198061050850", "num_games_owned": 147}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "8.2 out of 10\n\nMaybe I will write a detailed review later.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503291992, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503291992, "recommendationid": "34388266", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478898", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 876, "total_reviews": 969, "num_reviews": 7, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 93}}
