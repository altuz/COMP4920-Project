As such it is a bit... quaint. The features recognized as belonging to the Total War franchise are rough and unfinished... or still gleams in the developer's eyes. But one can see the gem that will shine in years to come. It just needed a little polish.\n\nI would suggest getting this title on sale, and you will have to contend with gameplay from the year 2000. Also, it seems the game adds a feature that allows you to launch some of your Total War titles...

There's no warning, no pattern.  The program just terminates and kicks me to the desktop.  I can't figure out why, but so as long as that happens this review will stay negative.\n\nAs for the actual game:  It's the very first Total War game, and it sure feels like it.  It's not a bad game, and there's some cool things here like the fantastic music, but it's aged a lot, and by now pretty much every aspect of this game has been done much better by later games.\n\nFor curiosity's sake, it's fun to play, but it just makes you wish you were playing Shogun 2 instead.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506318679, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506318679, "recommendationid": "35197071", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 80, "total_reviews": 96, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 16}}
