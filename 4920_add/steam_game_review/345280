Horror Walk Sim\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Trash\n\nThere is no intro. No plot. You are dumped in an absolutely massive area, full of barren empty land with ugly grass texture and the same dead tree asset spawned over and over. Visibility radius is low and there is a constant white filter in the middle of the screen, kind of like a flashlight being activated except it does not light anything up and is just a faint distracting white layer on top of the rendered images. Random assets are sprinkled about the forest. Cola cans, food, but also tires, pumpkins, toilet sinks... You collect them because they glow as pickable items. Ultimate goal is to find pages I think because its part of the on-screen information but I never saw one. The mouse sensitivity is very high and there are no options menu so using a hardware solution is mostly required. The game is very confusing to navigate because of the poor map design. I was following signs and what vaguely looked like a path because no trees grew on it. I sprinted whenever i recovered stamina and even after 12+ minutes I still had not reach the church which was one of the landmarks on the signs. Occasionally you get a jumpscare but they are very rare, I have seen two, one of which looked like it was unfinished and it lasted very briefly to kind of hide that. I am assuming that you would have to use collected items at landmarks to unlock a thing to do a thing to end the game but I started picking multiple copies of the same items and that kind of confused me. In any case there is no parody here, just really feels like someone seriously was going to make a horror walking sim, and early in the process gave up and just did the bare minimum to put what little work they had put in together in something that vaguely ressembles a game. And then could not keep a straight face and ask for money so decided to just declare it a parody.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502684664, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505085538, "recommendationid": "34228510", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500861", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 19, "total_reviews": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 25}}
