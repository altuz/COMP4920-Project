It does not even run smooth on my i5-4440.\n\nThere is no text output and for a non-english player it's somethimes hard to follow the dialoge.\n\nSince I've played only about half an hour I cannot recomment the game nor can i give you any advice to not try it.

Love the Dark Humour and the UK voice acting.  The save system involving Imps that are also needed object puzzles gives the first chapter a survival horror feel that does not exist in most point and click adventure games.  Very much reminiscent of the original Discworld, Discworld: Noir and Zack McKracken, and yet a style unto itself.  This game is wholey underated on Steam and steal for $4.  As one of the most challenging and enjoyable games Ive played recently, I heartily recomend this game to any serious fans of the genre.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443787655, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443787939, "recommendationid": "18289555", "language": "english", "votes_down": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467776", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1426541950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 258, "steamid": "76561198161797020", "num_games_owned": 23}, "votes_funny": 10, "votes_up": 36, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I honestly could not believe it when I randomly searched this classic game from my childhood today and it popped up as being able to be downloaded on Steam. This game is and always has been an absolute gem. Undoubtedly the games strength lies in the voice acting and sense of humor and irony and it's very well done and genuinely hilarious. There's an underlying British-type 'An American Werewolf in London' style of humor that everyone might not appreciate, but I honestly haven't found a game since that has made me laugh so much (The phantom of the opera is my favorite character). The story is a good length split across two parts and there's some very scary moments (The Fun House still haunts me to this day and I'm 21). It's PACKED full of references to classic horror films and the game-play is a point-and-click style typical of games of this age, and the graphics are too, don't expect a graphical phenomenon; saying that the cut-scenes (And there's a lot of them) still look pretty good. Lots of puzzles too, usually involving using items in conjunction with one another.   \n\nI had the pleasure of talking to one of the developers on the game a few years back and they had such a tiny development team and audience it's incredible that it's up here.
