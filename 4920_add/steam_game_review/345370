Well, guess what. It is not...\n\nI have been following their tutorials as best as I could. It is not easy, at all. Yes, it may be learned, but it may not be learned either. You are not going to be able to follow the tutorials and easily make Visual Novels if you are in the same boat as me. (Don't know programming, never did a VN, etc...). Plus, the software doesn't come with the characters, the backgrounds, the music... Yes, they shared a huge amount of them in the sticky but most of them are not really that good. This was a huge letdown for me. They should add it under the description. \n\nI bought this as someone who never ever did a VN and this means I have the right to expect the software to show me how to do everything I need to know. That is what it means to be ''the Easiest, the Fastest tool to make your own multiplatform visual novels''.\n\nTLDR: If you don't have any kind of experience regarding Programming or VN Making, do not expect this to be easy.
