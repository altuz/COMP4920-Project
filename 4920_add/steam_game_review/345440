Ever since the beginning, this game guides you with glitches which unfortunately decrease quality of the game. Let me give you a run down of some of them:\n\n- Sometimes when you're in water, you can walk (even breathe), sometimes you have to swim. I found nice bug how to get through one place which was flooded with water just using this glitch.\n\n- Monsters as they are introduced don't spawn regularly (Hell lord for instance). When you trigger the arm lever in the cave, sometimes he appears, sometimes he doesn't.\n\n- When you die and you want to load the previous save, it will always spawn you in a different one. Sometimes I was spawned at the church, sometimes I got spawned on the spawn point.\n\n- Hints (when you press tab) don't update with your progress. Sometimes you are left with very old hint from the early stages of the game so you either have to find solution on the internet or figure it out yourself.\n\nAnd more glitches other probably found...\n\nReally great game what it takes about effects, graphics, sounds and atmosphere but these unnecessary glitches just f-ed up...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496861135, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496861135, "recommendationid": "32244077", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579425", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498934085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 209, "steamid": "76561198004705689", "num_games_owned": 516}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The prologue is boring.
