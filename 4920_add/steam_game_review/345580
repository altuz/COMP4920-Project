Regardless, it plays essentially the same with only a few keystroke command changes, and in my view it is still a fantastic game. \n\nLet me start by stating the obvious: this game is not for everyone, not by a long shot. First off, you need to read the extensive manual. There are just no shortcuts here to be had as you have to invest the time to learn the commands and various interfaces, preferably while having the game running in front of you so you can try out what you learn. And even then you will likely frequently refer back to the manual for the more esoteric stuff. It is a complex game with a steep learning curve, but for a reason, which is that you get to control every facet of your ship and its assets, down to the location of each crew member and their various assignments. You are truly the captain of your ship, and the better you know her the more enjoyment you will get out of the game. On top of that, there are a lot of addtional things you can do like first person piloting of a fighter, shuttle, or rover, or even walk on the surface of a planet and engage in exploration or combat. You can  create concerted attacks on planetary bases by marines on the ground with close air support from fighters and tactical bombing from orbit. You can mine planets to collect valuable minerals for trading in space ports. Or you can just roam the galaxy on a 5 year mission to explore new worlds and new civilizations :) To put it another way, a vivid imagination is a pre-requisite as well as a willingness to immerse yourself in the experience. With time, you will develop a fondness for your crew and an attachment to your ship, the hallmark of a true captain...\n \nNow for the detractors out there, this game plays just as advertised. I have yet to experience a serious bug with it and it delivers what it promises. The impression I get from reading many of the negative reviews is that either the reviewers have not taken the time to really learn the game because of its apparent initial complexity or were more suited for different types of games such as Elite Dangerous or its ilk. \n\nUniversal Combat (and its predecessors) is a monumetal achievement that has no equal in its breadth and capabilities, and for under $10 it is a total steal. Nonetheless, if you prefer to try the game first, then Battlecruiser Millenium Gold is available as freeware and will run perfectly under Win 7 to Win 10 as long as it is set to Win 98 compatibility. \n\nAnd if you are still hesitant, consider reading the Starcarrier SF series from Ian Douglas, as it will give a real feel of what this game is all about.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489207032, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489207032, "recommendationid": "30439118", "language": "english", "votes_down": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502241", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447433262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 57, "steamid": "76561198186297447", "num_games_owned": 4}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's an overall great game, BUT, very complicated for people that are new to the game.", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1485885272, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485885272, "recommendationid": "29610754", "language": "english", "votes_down": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491214", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501374839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8267, "steamid": "76561198321103770", "num_games_owned": 29}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Hello, I am a french fellow passenger, I am a \"child\" of the first step of Neil Armstrong on the moon.
