I PLAYED 20-30 HOURS ON THIS GAME![/h1]\n\nOkay, now that wonderful experience is out of the way, let\u2019s get into the game, shall we?\n\n[h1]What is there to offer? What is the game content?[/h1]\n\nThe Labyrinth of Grisaia is the second installment of the Grisaia series right after the previous game, The Fruit of Grisaia, and definitely has some important/fun things to do in it. Not only do you get small, but interesting after stories to all the endings in the previous game, you also get Yuiji\u2019s entire past explained, which is the bulk of this game. Unfortunately, this game doesn\u2019t offer any choices or decisions like in the first game but gives you hours of cool content. You also get a Short Story section which is just 30 mini-stories that have no relevance to the plot whatsoever. And lastly, you get a, no joke here, a Masturbation Station which is just an erotic group of stories/fantasies that I\u2019m sure the fan base wanted in the game so Front Wing made it. But I\u2019m not joking; it\u2019s literally called a Masturbation Station! It\u2019s around 4 sex stories with random characters from the series.\n\n[h1]Is the game worth it?[/h1]\n\nWhen it actually comes to the game itself, I wouldn\u2019t mark it at a face value of $30.00, that\u2019s just too much for truly nothing text. I know the first game does have a lot of Slice of Life moments with no relevance to the actual plot whatsoever, but unlike The Fruit of Grisaia, Labyrinth doesn\u2019t seem to have that drive for you to actually read those little sections for the enjoyment of reading it. I just remember reading The Fruit of Grisaia for hours without getting bored but I just didn\u2019t get the same feeling for Labyrinth. Nevertheless, the game was very entertaining. But when it comes down to it, you have two choices: \n\n1)\tYOU EITHER WATCH THE ANIME AND MISS OUT ON THE EXTRA CONTENT WITH THE ENDING SCENES\n\n2)\tBUY THE GAME FOR FULL-PRICE OFF DENPASOFT.COM AND PLAY THE GAME\n\nNo matter what you\u2019re thinking of, it really comes down to this. I\u2019ve watched both the anime and the visual novel, and they are literally the exact same thing. You get some extra scenes that the anime didn\u2019t have in the visual novel, but for $30.00, it may seem better to spend it on other stuff. But if you\u2019re thinking about buying the game, PLEASE just buy the unrated version off Denpasoft. I can\u2019t stress this enough considering that a good portion of this game is literal H-scenes which Steam cuts in this version\n\n[h1]Overall\u2026[/h1]\n\nSo overall, I would recommend this game even though it may seem that I don\u2019t in the review. I really love this show/series, and I personally found this installation very enjoyable and worth the money after finishing it. And even though I spent closer to 50+ hours on The Fruit of Grisaia, this game was fun. Just don\u2019t expect to have choices or anything like the first and have alternate endings. This game is for Yuiji\u2019s past and that\u2019s all. The extra stuff is just filler so that the user doesn\u2019t feel entirely ripped off for spending that much money on this.

I probaby should cover this in three parts.\n\nFirst, the short stories are... well, they aren't that great as a whole. Just small vignettes that don't seem to tie in all that well. Three of them are unlocked by completing two \"After Story\" episodes. Michiru unlocks two, and Makina unlocks another.\n\nSecond, the after stories. They, as a whole, were not up to par with Fruit's routes, but they were still the gem in this title. I especially enjoyed Sachi's, as it ended on a very good note.\n\nThird... Cacoon of Caprice. While Yuuji's Past is an interesting thing, it was MUCH darker than I was expecting. And frankly, a bit disconcerting. See, I liked the individual paths/routes from Fruit, but in order for this \"main\" path to work, they had to discard them. In fact, I doubt he got intimate with any of the girls. (Though I'm sure Eden will show if my supposition is correct or not.) And the ending... was a pain. Well, clifffhangers tend to be, anyway.\n\nStill, I will have to recommend this to those who want to return to Mihama, and are Grisaia fans...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502898145, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502898145, "recommendationid": "34278629", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 33, "total_reviews": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
