Sekai Project continues to making impressive translations, with clear quality and work put into it. If your already at the point of looking at the third installment in a series you probably don't need much other than a statement that this isn't broken, but this is still a showing of what makes the Grisaia series great.

This one... well, I have a feeling it ends in a harem... and possibly includes a blood relative to boot.\n\nThe prologue is also wonderful, though you have to finish the main tale to unlock it.\n\nAlso...

Found it kinda annoying that you got forced into a somewhat unrealistic harem ending. kinda prefered the individual endings from fruit and labyrinth tbh.
