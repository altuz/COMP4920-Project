But for $5 (or $2 for the iOS version (minus a few features), you can have a fun experience with a game that is charming, and has more depth than you would think from the mechanics. It also has great music, very charming writing and humor, and a consistent and polished art style.\n\n\nThe Map/\"Story\" System:\nLet's get one thing out of the way; there is no story. Instead, you are controlling a hero who is progressing through a 2D land on a side-scrolling path. Each land has two towns, one boss at the end, and various enemies that pop up randomly based on the area. Each town has three randomly selected NPCs which offer various services. After you defeat the boss, you are taken to a randomly selected land (with the difficulty scaled up with each boss you defeat). More lands can be unlocked to explore for your first run as you earn and spend Starblocks. While there isn't any story, the various dialogues for the bosses and monsters are where the writing shines, and the goal is more arcade-style (\"get the best score\") than plot driven (\"save the world\").\n\nYour Hero:\nYour hero has a single equipment slot and a single consumable item slot, which start off empty, and you can buy or earn items and equipment as you go. The first two heroes have no bonuses, but as you earn Starblocks you can use them unlock more heroes that have different advantages and disadvantages, and require different gameplay strategies. As you unlock and use more characters, you have to learn how to utilize the right stats and blocks for each one, to suit their abilities. As you level up you can upgrade their stats to make them more powerful, of course, and upgrading certain stats benefits some heroes more than others. \n\nGameplay and Board Mechanics:\nYour board stays consistent throughout the game, from when you begin to when you eventually, inevitably, fail, including during and in-between battles. This is a large part of where the strategy lies, because some blocks change what they do when when in battle versus when out of battle, and you have to make various decisions based on that. For example, when not in battle, the sword (physical damage) blocks turn into experience point blocks. So do you use the time spent between battles to rack up experience and level up quicker, and leave yourself without much physical attack power when the next enemy appears, or to arrange your board to do the most damage? Or do you use the time in between battles to build up your defense, heal yourself, or to earn money and treasure? \n\nMatches are made by tapping two or more of the same adjacent blocks. Racking up combinations ups the benefits of the blocks. The blocks above the ones you cleared drop down and new ones appear at the top of the board. While it seems simple at first, you quickly learn that you need to carefully plan out how to get the largest combinations by chaining the same block groups, or arranging the board into massive groups you can clear with a single move. These strategies quickly becomes necessary if you want to survive past the first boss or go into the hardest dungeons.\n\nThere are two meters you fill as well; your defense meter and your treasure meter. The defense meter is raised by matching shield blocks, and reduces damage taken in exchange for defense points. (Example: You have 3/5 in your defense meter, and are attacked for 4 damage. You receive 1 damage and your defense meter is reduced to 0.) There also is a treasure meter, which is filled by matching treasure chest blocks, and gives you a random consumable item to use.\n\nStarblocks:\nStarblocks are the main \"bread and butter\u201d in the game: what you aim to get. They allow you to unlock new characters, lands, or start off with a previously used item or piece of equipment on your new run. Mostly, you get these by completing various tasks (such as not attacking for 30 turns, defeating an enemy in one hit, etc), and by defeating bosses.\n\nTowns, NPCs, and Dungeons:\nIn each town, there are three randomly selected NPCs which offer various benefits in exchange for coins, ranging from buying armor, weapons, and consumable items, to delving into dungeons or changing the land you are in. (Dungeons are essentially a gauntlet of several enemies in a row, without any time to arrange your board and clear tiles in between battles.) You can only use the services of one NPC per town, so you have to choose which one has the most benefit to you at the time (such as going into a dungeon to gain more experience before the boss fight, or buying armor to raise your defense, etc). \n\nAesthetic:\nI honestly find this game to be one of the most charming battle puzzle RPGs out there. The music is fantastic, reminiscent of older arcade RPGs. Each character is polished, with unique animations and skills. Each monster and NPC has a catchphrase, which is where the humorous writing comes into play. Overall, the game is consistently well rounded, with nothing standing out as being ill-fitting or poor quality.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424944527, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425783903, "recommendationid": "14659409", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502354", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1424904143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 29, "steamid": "76561197997527737", "num_games_owned": 266}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a decent port, but yes its a port.
