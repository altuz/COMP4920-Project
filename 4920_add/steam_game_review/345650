She's late on her rent and no one is buying her calligraphy. There are five decision points in the story; choose to be lazy or selfish at any one of them and you're quickly sent to a screen that says \"BAD END\". But, if she perseveres and holds true to herself ...\n\n... then the story abruptly ends anyway, about five minutes in.\n\nThere's just no point to this story, and nothing to recommend it. The artwork is bland. It could at least have wrapped up with a feel-good ending, something nice happening to inspire Vinty and help her find a new direction for her life; but instead I can't decide whether the ending is a joke that doesn't work or the developer just got tired of the story.\n\nThe funniest part of this is that there are prominent \"Q.Save\", \"Q.Load\", \"Save\", and \"Load\" buttons for a game that can be played through to the \"good\" end in less than five minutes and which can be clicked through to the end in less than fifteen seconds.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485699985, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485699985, "recommendationid": "29565404", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
