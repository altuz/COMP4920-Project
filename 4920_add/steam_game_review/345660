This game is best played on realistic difficulity with a pro setting, manuall gear and everything else is off. It's very easy and enjoyable game. The female Ai is fun to watch though. Many things may effect the game experience like changing the driver from male to female in the driver's profile (it causes file corruption), or unblock and block the controller during game play (makes the steering feel unrealistic).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500774529, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500774529, "recommendationid": "33733996", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 201, "total_reviews": 301, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 100}}
