I took the eye candy route first (Shizume)... very different compared to Keiji's route. Both worth the exploration. Voice acting i found unnecessary for the entirety of the text, but this is a personal opinion. When reading visual novels, I am not used to the character reading the general text on top of their own voice and actions, it felt a bit much. The voice acting itself however was not bad. That said, looking forward to the next installment and conintuation of this game as the stories end in a spot asking that annoying \"What happens next?\".", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492264029, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492264736, "recommendationid": "31156776", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506449", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "total_reviews": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 10}}
