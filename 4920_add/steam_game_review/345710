Everything from the controls, the options, the levels, the graphics and the ai is bad. But there is a sliver of hope. At first the game was utterly awful with no graphics options, building was completely broken, terrible sound design but this was improved right away with an update. Now, most developers would just leave a shitty game to rot, but maybe this one is different. Heres what you need to improve-\nGun Model size. Make it smaller.\nAdd footsteps, this would help the game out massively.\nAdd a tutorial, Or atleast controls menu. Its impossible to figure out otherwise.\nAnd finally, make the zombies more varied.\nFix building. Yeah it works now but it is still buggy as hell.\nThis game could also be fun in co-op, although I know thats not something you can just stick on there.\nAll these would make the game a 6/10, which is better than the 4,5/10 I'm giving it. Don't be discouraged, I was originally giving the game 3/10 but that little update you made bumped it up. Keep it up guys, there is potential here. \nBut unfortunately, until then I can not reccommend this game. i know it makes you look worse and all but I really cant reccommed something that just isn't good.

I also accept the uneven quality and inevitable ups and downs of developing games, responding to the criticisms and suggestions of players, and working to make fixes and patches that improve an Early Access game.  I don't expect miracles or perfection, and I am willing to be patient with an Early Access game.\n\nBased on my experience with various other Early Access games, I think this game still needs a lot of work, and the pace of its fixes and improvements has been a bit slow.  I wish the developers luck and success, but suggest that any potential buyers seriously consider waiting for more improvements before buying this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434806079, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1434806079, "recommendationid": "16552652", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522560", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440380328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 32, "steamid": "76561198053857395", "num_games_owned": 534}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 27, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Let me start off my saying, I am no stranger to Early Access games. I know what im buying and I know what to expect. \n\nNow, there are some games that are in early access and pretty nice. They might have some graphical issues or multiplayer issues. And you can usually get the point of the game. Im having a hard time trying to figure out what im supposed to be doing in Damned Nation. Im supposed to build this \"Home Hub\" which takes materials that you need to gather. But the only thing you can harvest is wood and stone. You need to loot the metal and fuel. And the only loot that spawns is in garbage cans and broken vehicles. There are houses that you can enter, but they are really really dark and there is never anything in them. Once the Home Hub was placed (finally) this huge blue aura appears. Then you can start building turrets within it. So I place one (after running all around looting every car in sight) and it doesn't work. I lured 3 zeds in  front of it and it did nothing. The zeds just beat the shit out of it. There is a power counter that appears in the top left corner, but you are never told how you are supposed to turn on the turrets. So at this point, I was lost. So I stopped.   The lack of direction is probably the biggest downfall this game currently.\n\nAnd when it comes to killing things..im not sure where im supposed to be hitting the zeds. The hit boxes appear to be completely random. I could be standing right in front of one gettin my face chewed off while I swing my axe at it, but 95% of the time you do no damage. So I just ran and jumped around them. Even tho there is a leveling system, I felt no desire to stand around and try to kill zombies. \n\nSO, at the games current state I can't recommend it. I love my survival games but the survival mode in this just isn't there. And there is too much lack of direction or information to keep it from being frustrating. \n\nAnd once again, I know this is early access, and I know what I was getting into when I bought this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440381434, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1440381434, "recommendationid": "17687006", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533660", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440864697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 81, "steamid": "76561198086034207", "num_games_owned": 284}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Not werf.
