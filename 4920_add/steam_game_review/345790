After getting a black screen (of my 39 Steam games, this is the only game I have issues with), I contacted the developer and left a message on the forum.  He responded that my computer didn't meet minimum qualifications and I should have checked before purchasing.\n\nMy computer: AMD A8 3.4 ghz x4, 11gb RAM, Win 7, AMD 7700 HD 1gb\n\nThis far exceeds the listed minimum and recommended specifications.  \n\nI would be very careful purchasing this game.  You should avoid the headache.  Apparently, the game itself isn't very good as well.  Not that I can play it.  \n\nSo I could leave this review, I had to let the black screen run for a total of five minutes.  Lol.\n\nI see the idiot developer left a response.  It's different from his original response which lied and said he never supported AMD.  Apparrently, shortly thereafter, he included support for it.  \n\nMK Lab, you are one shady SOB.\n\nFirst comment from the devleoper:\n\nMK-Lab  [developer] Jan 27, 2015 @ 2:18pm  \nYour graphics card (AMD) is not supported like I said several times before.
