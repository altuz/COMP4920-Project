That's what's on the sign. In its own way, it's really trying to warn you. Not about ghosts; there aren't any here, just enormous skinless women, but that this entire game is about as original and well thought out as calling your setting 'Ghost Town'. \nThere's nothing to do here. The biggest challenge you'll face is collecting the notes that are nailed to the walls, in spite of the Skinless Sisters' ability to murder you through them. Deciphering the notes is also a fun distraction. \"It seems more and then look in the hopper\" reads one. Such poetry.\nIt's not worth money in any currency I can think of.
