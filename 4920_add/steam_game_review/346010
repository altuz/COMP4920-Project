Upon purchase of this game, you will lose all sense of time and may die of thirst. This game is absolutely worth it if you love sandbox games, derpy physics, cool sh*t, and blowing things up. On the surface and the original intent was a medieval siege weapon sandbox builder. The mods are what help to make this game a 420/69. If you plan to build, get mods, or take up the challenge of competing with modded creations by building your own vanilla cars and weapons and toys and stupid stuff. I'll make this a little more eye pleasing in a bit. There are three main things you can do in this game, build things, download and play with things, and both. There are some utterly fantastic builders such as Fnom3 and Shade (Sha-day. The e is meant to be accented). Find some cars or planes or tanks or stupid things, which there are an abundance of, and have fun.\n\nPros:\n-Easy to get into, but challenging to master\n-Graphics aren't realistic, but the art style is nice and simple\n-As with any physics-based game, derpiness is abundant, but not stupidly overwhelming\n-So much to see, so much to do, so much to kill\n-Killing things\n-Blowing chickens up\n-Blowing your self up\n-TANKS!!!\n-Great for learning about mechanical engineering\n-Did I mention there was Waifus? No? Well, people have made waifus for you to download and \"enjoy\"\n-Flying things, like Stoves, fridges, pizza, etc.\n-Cars and planes and cool things\n-Steam workshop support, duh\n-Tiny Darth Vader\n-Great, low toxicity, community\n-Multiplayer is coming soon, and it will be glorious\n-Sex robots made of wood (when the game first came out, this happened. Not as common today, but you can still download 'em)\n-YouTubers are awesome, Draegast, The Bearded Beast, MattShea, etc.\n-Discord\nCons:\n-A bit difficult to learn how to make anything worth uploading to the Steam Workshop\n-You either have to make something unique or overwhelmingly fun/cool to get noticed\n-Mods and hitboxes get annoying sometimes.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507005864, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507005864, "recommendationid": "35435551", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505051438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 419, "steamid": "76561198241046920", "num_games_owned": 25}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It be fun, if there only was a multiplayer option.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504870043, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504870043, "recommendationid": "34812474", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506175492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5578, "steamid": "76561198186377618", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game to mess around with, Sometimes hilarious, like sticking a grabber to a rotor and spinning a knight around until the arm literally snaps off.
