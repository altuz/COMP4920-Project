It is definitely interesting, and has potential to become better, but right now the horror is somewhat lacking. First of all, for the first 12 nights, if you get the hang of the game fast enough, you won't die a single time, or even be in danger of dying. The sense of danger disappears, and the feeling of dread gets replaced by irritation, because of repetitive gameplay. The actual ghost that kills you is just a photoshopped picture that pops up on your screen for a second, and then gets replaced with game over. The death scene seems much too rushed, and could be improved. That being said, I am only on night 12. There is always the possibility that this game really picks up. But still, it should've picked up in pace on around night 6 or so. But all things considered, the game is still enjoyable, and even at times funny. Why the hell are you even working at a diner for a minimum wage, that has absolutely no customers, and that can literally kill you if you don't do your job well enough?
