With space trading games I generally dislike the combat systems and would prefer to travel around and explore, perform missions, upgrade my ship, etc. But most of the space trading games I've found force combat upon you. Astro Emporia has no combat, it is purely a trading game, but it is too random and simplistic to be enjoyable. The game was designed for getting the highest score you can in a set number of turns. You have a choice of 15, 30, or 60 turns or a Buyout mode where you attempt to buy all the planets in the solar system. Every game starts you with $4000 credits and a loan payment of $4000 credits. The loan just seems like an artificial difficulty to soak up some of your early profits. Assuming you can find decent trades you can pay the loan off quite quickly. After that there are no costs outside of buying goods. Your ship apparently has infinite fuel and all routes between planets are open from the beginning of the game.\n\nAfter my first couple plays, feeling the game was very random, I began tracking high and low prices for goods in a spreadsheet. Across three games I found the highs and lows quite similar. At that point it was easy to determine which prices were the best at a planet and buy accordingly. Each planet has two icons, one that indicates the type of goods the planet produces and the other to indicate the type of goods the planet wants on the next turn. For the most part you can ignore these. There are 4 main groups of goods: natural, mineral, gemstone, and technology. Each of those groups has 3 possible goods. For example, natural is comprised of wood, food, and oxygen. Each of the groups has a low-end good, a medium good, and a high-end good. For example, technology has scrap at the low-end, nano bots at the medium level, and ship engines at the high-end. As the game progresses you'll need to focus on higher level goods to maximize profit from your limited cargo area. What I've found on numerous occassions is that planets which indicate they specialize in a good will have terrible prices for those goods. And the indicator about what goods the planet wants on the next turn as often as not ends up with you bringing a good they just don't want at all. You will have turns where you are unable to sell and just need to go to a different planet. Once you complete the number of turns in the game you will be insulted for your score, even if it is quite good.\n\nThe buyout mode doesn't change the game in a major way. Your goal is to buy every planet in the system. The starting price is a bit over 39k and it doubles each time you buy a planet meaning the final planet will cost around 50 million. You score is basically the number of turns it takes for you to buy all the planets. I found the prices did not line up as well with the timed modes in my spreadsheet in that prices were often lower than I'd seen in previous games.\n\nThe port is fine. It is built on the Unity engine and you can select your resolution and graphics quality as well as fullscreen or windowed mode. The game looks nice, though it definitely has a mobile game feel to it. The artwork is fairly generic but there is no confusion between the various goods. Although the solar system is randomly generated it doesn't matter. You can get to all planets from turn one and each planet's goods change from turn to turn.\n\nI picked this up for $0.89 on a Steam sale and I've gotten my money's worth out of it, but it wasn't due to enjoyment. It was much more because I stubbornly wanted to see what the economic system was like.

Thats it, thats the game.\nAt the left side of the planet you see what resource it produce, at the right side, what resource its needs next turn.\nYou can play with or without a timelimit. If you have enough money you can buy a larger spaceship that can carry more resouces. Finally you can play with the posibility also to buy the planets.\n\nPros and cons:\nThe problem is that you cannot trust the resources it needs \"next turn\". Countless times I have tried to buy the resource a planet needs \"next turn\", just to realize that they don't want to buy the resource. So knowing that, the game is down to just buy some resources, travel to a random other planet and sell the stuff if you're lucky. In my opinion thats an unfinished game. Its not really much of a game I think. You can buy and sell stuff randomly. Thats no fun.\n\nCons:\nThe resource \"next turn\" does not work correctly\nThe game has no fun. Its all just random\n\nPros:\nNice graphics\nMusic is fine\nThe pricetag is fine\n\nImproments suggestions:\nMake the resouce \"next turn\" work properly. Its essential\nMake some reason to play the game, some goals to reach\nThe buildings blocks are there. The developer just needs to connect them better\nI miss a guidance to where to buy cheepest and sell for most, maybe some kind of stock exchange or list of prices\n\nConclusion:\nAs for now, I cannot play this. It is as fun as rolling a dice. You can do it a couple of times and then you just stop. I really hope the developer will improve this game, because iI want to play it when its finished.
