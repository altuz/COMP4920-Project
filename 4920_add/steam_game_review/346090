Trapped in an ancient ruin and guided by a mysterious force, you must find the keys to your escape while avoiding the evil spirit known as the darkness.\n\nGameplay in ICE:D resembles one of those old school first person dungeon crawlers where you can rotate to one of four cardinal directions or move in the same. There is a bit of combat but it mostly boils down to getting the first hit in, a task that becomes easier with each improved weapon you discover. \n\nPrimarily, you will be more concerned with staying in lit areas once you reach the 3rd floor and below, where the darkness mechanic first comes into play. On any floor the darkness is active, staying in the dark long enough for it to reach you will result in an immediate game over. Reserving enough flashlight power or lighter fluid is absolutely crucial to avoiding an untimely end. Thankfully the game gives a few puzzle-like devices to recharge energy and a spare battery at one point and finding all of these will very likely give you more than enough light to easily complete the game. \n\nIf there\u2019s one drawback to this game, it\u2019s the fairly short length. A successful run through the ruins can take you anywhere from 1-2 hours once you figure everything out and besides playing the game without saves, there\u2019s not much to do outside of new game+, which is essentially the same game but harder and with an additional ending. If however you do choose to chase that additional content or challenge the leaderboards, you might see this game worth grabbing (at least on sale!)\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506999052, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506999052, "recommendationid": "35433589", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 21, "total_reviews": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
