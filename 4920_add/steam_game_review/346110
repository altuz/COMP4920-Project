However, it is THE MOST TIME CONSUMING game you will ever play. This is due to the system of the game which offers no balance to new players or fresh players that have just come to a new server. The aim of the game has become to oppress the newcomers and to never trust a single outsider, sometimes even the members of your own tribe who may seek to overthrow you.\n\nAs the leader of an official server, despite having achieved all I needed to achieve to be at the top, I soon realised it was taking me 3-4 hours of daily maintenance in order to ensure my base was up to date and secure. To spend that much time just to be on a game NOT TO PLAY, but to complete \"Chores\" in order to survive in a game before being able to play in it is much too ridiculous if I may say so.\n\nThe bugs and glitches are many and yet the devs continue to implement and add new things and creatures to the game without improving the gameplay or optimization one bit.\nEXAMPLES INDLUDE: You can easily get stuck in rocks and die of a glitch anytime. You can sit down on a chair you made and try to fish and suddenly you die due to some completely unexpected glitch is just fkn unacceptable.\n\nWith all of this being said, there are still quite a few things that aren't quite right with Ark. Whilst many of us have supported Ark's Developers and invested much of our hard earned money in hopes of seeing this game come to fruition. None of this has come true for us. To add a final bitter aftertaste for all of us loyal supporters who helped support this game for years, we are then forced to an Ultimatum to either purchase the game for the full price or not be able to play this game even after paying $30 USD for a poor Early Access which required financial aid from a then non-existent player base.\n\nHaving given a piece of mind, I bid this game farewell. AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE.\nJUST PLAY A BETTER GAME AND SUPPORT BETTER DEVELOPERS.\nHave a good one. Thanks for reading.\nP.S - Thank you to the Ark Developers who created something that had some great features in it and for enabling me to make some great moments and memories through the game.

Partly due to the fact I have no patience that can match this game and it's demands of time, or because of simple restrictions imposed by the games design and the people who use the games design.\n\nSo to get a few things out of the way:\n[list]\n    [*]I have never been part of an \"Alpha Tribe\".\n    [*]I HAVE been part of a \"Zerg Tribe\".\n    [*]I have NEVER tamed a titanosaur, be it on custom servers with VERY high taming rates, or an official server with base x1 rates - I never even tried.\n    [*]My experience in Combat is a disaster, I will explain this later.\n    [*]I don't have the time to experience everything there is in the game. However, when I DO have the time I do not have the patience the game requires.\n    [*]I have played both; vanilla ark clusters and scorched earth ark clusters.\n    [*]Many of my friends are the same exact way.\n    [*]Most of my experience comes from custom servers, and a few bit from official\n    [*]I have equal experience when it comes to the pre-nerf dino leveling stats and post-nerf dino leveling stats\n[/list]\n\nSo what happened? Well, me and my friends started off by finding eachother with spawn points that aren't exactly precise to everyone as you are actually spawned in multiple different areas within the spawn regions you select. (I personally liked this as it prevented immediate zerg rushing on a single individual with no consequence.) After we all found eachother we began to run around and see what was possible for us at the time - which was absolutely nothing! Shocked, we all decide to go around and level up to level 15 (so we could get wooden building materials) after we achieved level 15 it was time to get the resources to build the base.\n\n[h1] Building [/h1]\n\nFirst we decided to start small, 3x3x2 would be fine to start with as it would allow us to expand upon it quite easily. Upon first getting the engrams needed, we would need a lot of wood more than the trees around us would give. After dying around 20 times between the 6-7 of us, we finally have our crowded 3x3x2 wooden house and we went to sleep.\n\nUpon waking up and getting on the ARK server, there was a giant hole in our base along with everyone but me dead. \"Fair enough\" I thought to myself, I've dealt with this before in other survival games, its just how people can safely play. With that being said, I was very VERY angry about what just happened, as all of the time we spent (about 40 min-1hr) was just invalidated.\n\nWe got to level 25-30 amoung the group, and prepared to make a stone hut instead. After spending what felt like an hour and a half of pressing E we finally got a 3x3x2 stone hut prepared, went to sleep after doing some taming, and woke up to an even bigger hole in the wall.\n\n[h1] Taming and AI [/h1]\n\nlmao taming\n\nTaming takes forever, we tried taming a level 32 trike only for it to take well over an hour of waiting and spamming narco berries to have a mediocre dinosaur whos intended purpose (gathering berries) is far outshined by any other herbivore that comes after it with barely any more effort put in to taming them.\n\nNow when you're taming higher level creatures? Thats where it [i]can[/i] be fun to tame. Taming titanosaurs have completely different mechanics - you need cannonballs or rockets to hit their head to get them to be knocked out. But when you tame things like Giganotosaurus'? it's just flat out painful and tedious, you have to get well over 200 narcotics worth of tranq darts, and keep the shots up quickly because its torpidity drains extremely fast! The worst part is that if it knows its gonna go down soon it'll get a speed and damage boost on top of its already extremely high speed and damage!\n\nNow the AI itself can only be described as a \"dumpsterfire fueled with gasoline soaked pinecones that's about to fall into a pit of lava, de-stabilizing the volcano and causing an erruption\"-esque catastrophe, it's that bad. Tamed dino's are EXTREMELY stupid and don't do what you intend them to do with the commands you're given. Wild dino's are EXTREMELY stupid and get themselves stuck because they dont ever jump over obstacles that causes the problems.\n\nAfter we tamed many creatures on land, we decided to tame a few water mounts, this is where things got real fun;\n\n[h1] Optimization [/h1]\n\nOptimization in this game is terrible, and if you go deep enough into the ocean you'll see why I say that.\n\nIf you move - you freeze for a second - if you dont move - you freeze for a second - if you do anything - you freeze for a second. There's no winning strategy here, the game has no compression of files, no optimization of graphic detail, and the folder size in your hard drive is 92.5gb. (to be fair, that is with scorched earth) Downloading even basic patches will take forever due to their size (once again - lack of compression) yet this is not the worst of its optimization. \n\nIf you thought the FPS lagging behind was a problem, what if I told you that ARK can let you DoS yourself? I have a 150 mb/s connection, and my modem/router combo can handle up to a gigabit per second of data if set up for it. (set for 450 mb/s at the time this happened) Do you know what happened? I refreshed the server browser, and my entire internet crashed, LAN, WAN, you name it - it crashed and stayed down for a good 5-10 minutes.\n\n[url=https://imgur.com/6HdVxwP]My build is a VERY POWERFUL build[/url], and i can barely muster a consistent 60 FPS at even medium settings and will occasionally struggle to go above 30 fps at high settings.\n\n\n[h1] Combat [/h1]\n\nBOY HERE WE GO\n\nCombat in ARK survival evolve is done with many different weapons that range from spears and swords to rocket launchers and laser helmets on dinosaurs, providing a very diverse set of options for combat.\n\nWell thats what Wildcard and the community would have you believe. Actual combat goes one of two ways:\n\n[olist]\n    [*]Wait for victim to go offline\n    [*]Blow open base\n    [*]Take everything and kill everything, salt the earth if you have to but make sure that everything is gone and dead.\n[/olist]\n\nOR\n\n[olist]\n    [*]Have a giganotosaurus or T-rex that was tamed at 150 then leveled to the max with melee damage and health with a small amount of speed\n    [*]Find victim (anyone at that point)\n    [*]Kill them with no fear of consequence because you are part of Alpha Tribe\n[/olist]\n\nGunfighting is a laughable statement, as it never actually happens because guns are too weak to deal with the dinosaurs/creatures because the damage to them is pitiful, or someone dies in one shot because longnecks deal incredible damage (a longneck headshot deals over 170 damage on a person with full chitin armor) and all other guns are useless except for maybe the fabricated pistol.\n\nCombat with dinosaurs is just a statcheck between the two combatants, theres no actual strategy or thought put into the fights just a ton of mindless LMB spamming and maybe the occasional RMB tap if your dino has a different function.\n\n[h1] Power Problem [/h1]\n\nThe biggest thing you will notice in ARK is the power difference of a level 15 character and a level 80 character, and I am not talking about stats. The options available to the two characters are on a difference by an order of magnitude; level 80s can have plesiosaur and giganoto saddles, guns of all kinds, c4, pikes, swords, metal shields and turrets while level 15s can get screwed with only a trike or parasaur saddle, spears and bows.\n\n\nTheres more I'd want to talk about, but I'm at the word limit.\n\nThumbs down, not full release worthy at all.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504833376, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504833376, "recommendationid": "34805754", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524410", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505529809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5799, "steamid": "76561198042142106", "num_games_owned": 198}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": "4", "review": "This is a finished game?

Do it. You'll have lots of fun if you play on a somewhat low populated pvp server that is unofficial, or on a pve server.\nIf you do not have a job or school.\nIf you plan to quit your job to be able to keep up with Ark.\nIf you plan to disown your kids so you have more time to grind in the game. For real. I spent a good 100 hours in the first 3 weeks of playing the game with my friend and all we had to show for it was going through one cave and grabbing the artifact. It takes 6 i think to summon a boss. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI got the game on sale for $15.\nWas it worth the $15? No. Wait for it to get chea- WAIT WHAT? DID THEY JUST FUCKING INCREASE THE PRICE OF THEIR GAME? YOU DON'T DO THAT. ESPECIALLY NOT TO AN UNPOLISHED GAME THAT WENT IN DIRECTIONS NOBODY SUPPORTED. THE FUCKING DLC IS HALF THE PRICE OF THE BASE GAME? THE DLC WAS MADE IN EARLY ACCESS? THEY'RE ADDING MICROTRANSACTIONS? WHAT THE HELL! WHAT KIND OF GREED COULD POSSIBLY DRIVE YOU TO DO THIS TO A SURVIVAL GAME?\nWell, here's my review of the game's features. I haven't played in ages but I've followed the updates closely. Hoping they might change direction. Maybe make playing in small groups possible. Maybe make the game less of a chore.\n\nThey didn't.\n\nIs it worth playing alone? Absolutely not. You won't be able to kill bosses alone. Have fun babysitting a taming dinosaur for 18 hours as well. Oh did I mention tribes? Yeah this is why you can't play on official servers unless you're in a group of at least eight people. You simply can't survive long enough on the server without everything be taken from you if you have less. Unofficial servers aren't nearly that bad but they're still pretty fucking bad. At least in Rust you have a chance against clans if you play smart. In Ark you can't even hide your base well enough to escape their flying dinosaurs or their marine animals. And when they do find you, it's like the Roman Empire at its peak deciding to go to war on a country like present day Cuba. They would be wiped out before they could say \"please don't hurt me.\" Even a group of five people have a formiddable army of dinosaurs to kill you with, while you at best would have the equivilent of a couple of farmers with pitchforks.\n\nWhat about survival? How good is that? When I first got it it was great. Much better than Rust in terms of the struggle to find food, water, and shelter. And it had PVE content! Sadly it quickly evolves into a tedious chore of waiting for dinosaurs to tame for several hours. Then grinding for several more hours to level up. The early game is, like many other survival games, the best part.\n\nPVP any good? Yeah PVP is great. I've got 10 rexes with lazer eyes, an indestrctable iron man suit, and dozens upon dozens of other dinosaurs at my disposal. Well the clans do I mean. And they can transfer that stuff across servers. Again, good luck playing solo. Hell even a group of 5 would stand no chance against tribes. I guess if you can't beat them, join them. Then just play the game for the pvp and ignore literally every other element of the game and become slaves to the tribes. Yes. They are run like that. They treat you like a diamond miner in Africa.\n\nHow does the combat feel? Weird. Melee is atrocious. The gunplay is OK I guess. Haven't had much experience in gunplay in pvp as I usually rage quit pvp servers when I died within the first 10 minutes of every single one because I was \"messing with someone's territory\" or \"becoming too powerful.\" This was on unofficial servers too, even ones that didn't have server transfer on. \nSingleplayer? Boring. Same grindy chore. Co-op multiplayer is the same thing. I mentioned pvp previously. I'm sure you know how well it would go alone.\n\nIs there anything about this game that's good? The initial starting up portion. This lasts around three hours. Then you're just lost and there's nothing much left to do besides punch trees and babysit dinosaurs for several hours while they tame.\n\nYou mentioned bosses before, what are they like? I've fought them exactly once. When an entire pve server joined together to fight it. When I say an entire pve server, I mean elitists who put in 500 hours of time into that very server to tame dinosaurs, grind, and otherwise become powerful. They were anything remarkable. Your dinosaurs charge in, the boss hits them for a while, and you either get unlucky and get killed by a stray attack, or you can't kill the boss fast enough and you die.\n\nWell... how about exploration? The high point of the game. I loved walking through the jungles not knowing where a predator might appear. I've had memorable moments in swamps in the dead of night, freezing and starving trying to make it back to my home without being killed by the countless predators swarming around me. This of course was in singleplayer. Caves are pretty cool. They're like dungeons with interesting enemies and parkour stuff. They're very fun to go into.\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505434762, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505434762, "recommendationid": "34960508", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508863", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505320014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5827, "steamid": "76561198308264474", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This was supposed to be the game for all dinosaur-lovers, a dream come true... it became a disappointment instead.\n\nIt started as an interesting project.

Much less now when it costs the outrageous price of 60 eur.\n\n60 eur for WHAT exactly? \nFor a game that only rich people with the best computers can play? \nFull of creatures that aren't even remotely decently modelled, which animations are so bad and clunky?\nFar from any realistic concepts?\nA game that isn't even finished yet?\n\nYeah it's literally the only game that lets you tame like 200 different creatures more or less, so? that's the only positive thing about it, that and that it's a sandbox and you can build a fort.

And I mean -incredibly- lucky. You may even find better luck on public servers if you have a friend who's got 5,000+ hours in game and can supply you with everything to get started. I've tried no less than 24 times to start fresh on public servers, and here's just a sampling of the things that've happened to me:\n\n- Chased down by a three men riding Tyrannosaurs because I tried harvesting fiber on \"their beach\"\n- Tranquilized with a scoped rifle, handcuffed, siphoned for my blood and left on a raft floating in the middle of the ocean\n- Tamed my first dinosaur, logged off for a grand total of an hour and logged back in to find both my beloved parasaur and everything I'd made from cloth and wood stolen, burned to the ground, etc.\n- Tranq'd (again) after I logged on, regained consciousness only to find my inventory stuffed with dinosaur poop.\n- Had my entire box of berries and (albeit stolen) eggs raided and replaced with large dinosaur poop.\n- Finally, and I mean FINALLY got to the point where I'd made a friend and we'd built a small base together near a waterfall off of the tundra. Left for maybe 10 minutes to tame some pterosaurs so we could fly, and returned to find the server admin astride a massive bronto smashing everything we owned because \"it was his waterfall\"\n\nThe community is toxic, the game actively punishes you for logging off, and no matter how much progress you make you'll NEVER be guaranteed anything besides a swift and unjust end. Think you can lock your base's door and log off inside to be safe? Wrong again. Someone will just bust down the wall and drag your ass outside to execute you for the crime of not playing the game 24 hours a day. \n\nI had fun ONLY when I was on a private server with friends and we took the time solely to have fun and build massive cities in the wildnerness. The game HAS potential, but even now it's just sadistic garbage that punishes people for trying to play the game without some kind of helping hand on their side long before they start playing.\n\nEither get a friend who's lost his job because of all his ARK hours, or get your own server and never deal with the community at large.

The concept itself is great and I love this style of game, however this game is among the grindiest I have ever played. I'm not against resource gathering, but you spend a disproportionate ammount of time grinding vs building/playing. Let's not even get into some of the tame times/breeding. You need someone babysitting what you want to tame for hours and hours. I have no idea how people play this on official servers. I had to play on a private server with gather rates increased and taming time reduced just to make it bearable. \n\nOn top of this, the game is an unoptimized buggy mess. You'll need a beat of a rig to play this with decent graphics and a stable framerate, but that doesn't matter anyways, as you'll need to set your graphics as low as possible to not give others an advantage in PVP. Also the only game I've seen eat up over 26GB of RAM on a regular basis. \n\nIt has potential, but it feels like it's entire time in early access never addressed any of the performance or balance issues.
