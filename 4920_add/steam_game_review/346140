Since there isn't, I'm giving this game bundle a 'yes,' but only barely. Unlike the poster before me, I was able to download and run the games with no trouble (I'm using a laptop with Windows 7). I have different opinions on each game in the bundle, so I'm going to break my review into a section for each game.\n_________________________________\nMountain Crime Requital. Overall Rating: 3/5\n\nPlot: 2/5. You play a doctor who has been summoned to a secluded mountain resort, under the pretense that the owner has suffered a heart attack. Once there, you realize that the owner is nowhere to be found, and the other guests start turning up dead.\n\nVoice Acting: 0/5. The voice acting in this game is horrid to the point of being remarkable.\n\nArtwork: 3/5. The characters look awful, but if you can ignore them, the overall scenery is decent.\n\nPuzzles and HOS: 4/5. The puzzles aren't bad (some may find them too easy). The hidden object scenes are set up so that you have to locate objects in order to assemble an item you need.The scenes are drawn nicely and are not too dark or full of unnecessary clutter. Occasionally there is an item that has been named strangely due to mistranslation.\n\nGetting Around: 3/5. You are provided with a map of the resort, and when you open it, it will indicate areas in which there are actions to be performed. Unfortunately you cannot click on the areas and be instantly transported, so there is a great deal of backtracking.\n_______________________\nWeird Park: Broken Tune. Overall Rating: 4/5\n\nPlot: 2/5. You play a journalist who is sent to investigate the disappearance of a fellow journalist at an abandoned circus. Once there, you begin having random sightings of a ghost clown and a midget dressed as a harlequin. As for the midget, he is supposed to be more than he seems, and is linked to a broken music record, which you find shards of throughout the game. Although he is supposed to be a major factor in the disappearances, the only interaction you ever have with him is seeing him darting around walls.\n\nVoice Acting: N/A. Your character doesn't have any conversations with anyone.\n\nArtwork: 3/5. The characters leave much to be desired. The overall scenery looks nice though. \n\nPuzzles and HOS: 4/5. The puzzles are pretty good (some may find them too easy). As for the HOS, some are typical HOS, in which you locate various items, while others require you to find broken parts in order to assemble a useful item. The HOS are nicely done.\n\nGetting Around: 1/5. There is no map provided, and there is a great deal of backtracking in order to figure out what you are supposed to do next.\n________________________________________\nBehind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge. Overall Rating: 0/5. I was unable to complete this game due being unable to find items that are needed in order to progress.\n\nPlot: ?/5. This game is a sequel, so why wasn't the first game in the series included in the bundle? You play a mother who defeated a wicked witch in the first game, and now the witch has used her magic to escape jail, and has absconded with your son\u2019s soul by using mirrors as portals.\n\nVoice Acting: N/A. From what little I did play, there seems to be no voice acting.\n\nArtwork: 3/5. The characters and their animations are poorly done. The scenery itself is nice though.\n\nPuzzles and HOS: 0/5. Unfortunately the niceness of the art is trumped by the issues I (and other players whose comments I found on various forums) have with being able to find items we need to continue playing. The items are often hidden to the point of being too difficult to locate amidst clutter and things of the same color. To make the matters worse, is the hint feature in the game proved useless for me. I got stuck and clicked for a hint. It directed me to go in the church. I went in the church and clicked the hint again. Instead of showing me what to do in the church, it directed me to go back outside, over and over. On top of it all, I could not find a strategy guide anywhere online either.\n\nGetting Around: 1/5. There is no map provided. Plus there is a great deal of backtracking to find items (or parts of items) you need.\n_______________________________________\nVampire Saga: Pandora's Box. Overall Rating: 4/5\n\nPlot: 3/5. In this game you bounce between playing a young man and his grandfather. You start in the 1950s as the young man getting a bizarre phone call from grandpa, in which he sounds distressed, and is claiming to have just killed a woman. You rush over to his house, and once you make it upstairs, you find grandpa has barricaded the bedroom door with furniture. He is outside the door, still insisting that he has shot a woman. He goes on to indicate that he knows this woman from years ago, and that she has tracked him down. It is then that the gameplay switches, and you are playing grandpa as a young man during the Spanish-American War. He is a deserter, who has stowed away on a ship. Unfortunately this ship is carrying dangerous cargo.\n\nVoice Acting: N/A. The dialogue between characters is all text.\n\nArtwork. 2/5. The characters are expressionless, rigid mannequins. Scenery is okay.\n\nPuzzles and HOS: 2/5. Puzzles are okay (some may find them too easy). The HOS vary in enjoyability. I found myself having to use the hint feature an awful lot because some of the HOS were dark, so items were hard to see. In others the items were hidden behind things to the point only a tiny sliver of the items were visible. In others the items were placed on the very edges of the frame, so they were barely visible. Additionally, there are some items that are incorrectly translated to English.\n\nGetting Around: 2/5. There is no map, and there is a huge amount of back and forth between areas. You will find yourself too often wandering between areas trying to figure out what to do next. In these instances, the hint feature will simply tell you \"There is nothing to do here right now,\" instead of directing you to the area you need to be. Sometimes reading your journal will tell you what you need to do, but not often enough.\n______________________________________\nTwisted Lands: Shadow Town. Overall Rating: 2/5\n\nPlot: 1/5. You play a man who is washed ashore after a boating accident involving him and his girlfriend. The town he discovers is within a dense fog, and is strangely deserted. The man believes his girlfriend must be somewhere on this island, so he embarks on a mission to find her. During his explorations, he finds evidence of a serpent cult, yet journals of missing residents and other shipwrecked people describe victims being transformed into fish folk with gills. I\u2019m trying to see the connection.\n\nVoice Acting: N/A. In this game, the only dialogue is between the protagonist and his girlfriend at the beginning, and it is all done via text.\n\nArtwork: 4/5. Of all the games, I think this one had the best artwork. Though the characters still looked like mannequins. The scenery was very nice.\n\nPuzzles and HOS: 4/5. Puzzles were okay. The HOS were well done- items were detailed, and some cunningly hidden, but still able to be found.\n\nGetting Around: 1/5. There is no map, and there are a lot of different areas to visit, multiple times. So you will spend an enormous amount of time backtracking. The hint feature is helpful in that it will light up an arrow and direct you where to go. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425322132, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425322132, "recommendationid": "14727645", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598372", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432386284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 352, "playtime_forever": 851, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "num_games_owned": 2214}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Hidden Object Bundle 5 in 1 is a collection of five hidden object games. In chronological order, it was the first appearance of each game on Steam. However, Weird Park Trilogy was released (containing Weird Park: Broken Tune), Mountain Crime: Requital followed as a stand-alone before Twisted Land Trilogy finally arrives.\n\n[b]Weird Park: Broken Tune[/b]\n\nYou're investigating the disappearance of a journalist in an abandoned fair park. However, a little gnome seems to prevent you to discover what happened... because everything seems tied to the death of Louis Gauche, a clown that lost his life during a representation... Besides, you'll find scattered around parts of a music disk, what is it meaning?\n\nHere's what I wrote about the game in my Weird Park Trilogy review:  I enjoyed the dark settings and the soundtrack. But I had an hard time to find my way sometimes, relaying on the hint buttons. Besides, the ending was promising a real good sequel.\n\nIndeed, Weird Park: Broken Tune is my favorite game from the bundle because of its unique atmosphere. The graphics were reflecting the fact that something bad happened and that paranormal activity was perhaps also involved. The gameplay was well-balanced too.\n\nFor more information about Weird Park Trilogy, I suggest you to read my review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/372260\n\n[b]Mountain Crime: Requital[/b]\n\nYou're called by a patient of yours to an hotel build on the ashes of a children hospice that suffered a tragedy. However, customers began dying... and they're all tied to that tragedy...\n\nThe game was my second favorite from the bundle, though I found a little longer and though the gameplay is different from the others, as you're gathering items in a scene that you need to build an object for an action.\n\nAs I've already reviewed the game and that I fear that copying/pasting it here will make me reach a characters limit for the review, I prefer to give you the link to it: http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/394680\n\n[b]Twisted Lands: Shadow Town[/b]\n\nAfter a problem in the middle of the sea, you end up in a strange town, with your wife being dragged by an unknown man. What terrible secret will you uncover?\n\nI must admit that while I enjoyed another somber story (the game is during the night, in a foggy town, with many mysteries around), I was quite confused about it. Given the twist at the end, I thought that it was a second opus in a series. In reality, it is really the first in the trilogy.\n\nHere's an extract of my Twisted Land Trilogy review: The plot of the first game is perhaps basic but with all the questions arising during your quest and the fact you're seeing ghosts, you bet that there is a dark cult under it. Though the end tells you how Mark came on the Island, which is a shocking twist, playing it a second time had made more understanding of the story than the first time. The graphics are correct, the soundtrack is also too, but the problem is that you're doing a lot of backtracking for an object.\n\nFor more information about the trilogy, read my review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/398630\n\n[b]Behind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge[/b]\n\nAfter defeating a witch, she's ready to take revenge on you through your innocent son. Will you manage to save his soul?\n\nI was quickly bored with this game. Given the fact that it was a direct sequel to another game, I felt like I was missing something. Based on the same gameplay of Mountain Crime, I didn't really enjoy it - I played Behind the Reflection 2 before Mountain Crime. The items weren't easy to find, though the puzzles were well-balanced.\n\nThe graphics were correct, though the soundtrack didn't let me a memory.\n\n[b]Vampire Saga: Pandora's Box[/b]\n\nWhy is your grandfather hiding a young girl and seems scared of her? What happened in his past? Did he really meet vampires?\n\nThe plot is alternating between the present and the past of your grandpa. It means that you're alternating between a cosy house and an old boat. And that game, while not being a total disaster, is the worst in the bundle. I found it very ridiculous, some dialogues are coming from uninspired minds and it becomes a parody of some sorts. It wasn't always easy to find your way around. The graphics were correct, that's true, but it does not save the game in my eyes. I really wondered why this joke was put in a bundle\n\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nI really enjoyed that bundle, well, at least for 3 games. I can't say that the two other games weren't appreciated but I was quickly bored with them, even if I got an hard time with Twisted Land. The question is: should you buy the bundle when three of them are on Steam, with Twisted Land and Weird Park being in their trilogy and with Mountain Crime being a stand-alone? If I had written the review earlier, I would have say that you had to buy it. However, now, the bundle could be seen as not worthy.\n\nIn reality, for the price, it's worthy to buy it and to try at least Twisted Land and Weird Park. Indeed, their trilogy are nearly 20 euros while the bundle is half the price. I will admit something: it's because I've played them in the bundle that I bought the two trilogies nearly at their release.  Else I would have activated them from a bundle or would have waited for a discount. As for Mountain Crime in my library, the reason is called \"trading cards\" and \"badge\". The two other games are only on Steam in this bundle.\n\nI will not change my mind: Hidden Object Bundle 5 in 1 is still a bundle of five games and is still worthy of any purchase. True, for those already owning the three games through the trilogies and the stand-alone game, the bundle isn't at all interesting. For the others, it's still a good bargain, at least, you will know if you like Twisted Land and Weird Park and if buying the trilogies could be a future action.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458243618, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1458243618, "recommendationid": "21891714", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484955", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433204252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 659, "steamid": "76561198035785835", "num_games_owned": 987}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Averaging out at $2 per game, this is a nice little bundle for HO players.

Gameplay was good. I'm giving it a recommend. At the time of this review, this game is available on Steam as a stand-alone/non-bundled game.\n\n[b]Behind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge[/b]\n\nThis is an old game that doesn't hold up at all to it's contemporaries. Played about an hour, somewhat dull/painful gameplay, lost interest, didn't finish. Don't recommend. At the time of this review, this game is only available on Steam as a bundled game.\n\n[b]Vampire Saga: Pandora's Box[/b]\n\nCouldn't get past menu screen. Cursor moved but clicking on menu options did nothing. Displayed off-center in fullscreen, 800x600 (or maybe less) with rest of the screen as black border. Looks like this is a known issue with a possible fix (see links in intro to this review). In any case, it didn't play for me, so I can't recommend. At the time of this review, this game is only available on Steam as a bundled game.\n\n[b]Weird Park: Broken Tune[/b]\n\nI liked this one. Somewhat of a unique story and good length. The hidden object puzzles were a little too easy, the mini games were typical, but otherwise the gameplay was good. I'm giving it a recommend. At the time of this review, this game is only available on Steam as a bundled game.\n\n[b]Twisted Lands: Shadow Town[/b]\n\nSure, why not. This is an 'okay' P&C/HOG. You can tell it's an older game, and it took me a second to figure out what had happened at the end, but I enjoyed it enough to give it a mild recommend. At the time of this review, this game is only available on Steam as a bundled game.\n\nPS I almost exclusively play offline.
