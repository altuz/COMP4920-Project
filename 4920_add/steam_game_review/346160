If you need to use several items at the bottom of a list you have to open the item menu each time and scroll down to the bottom.  The mouse also interferes with scrolling.\n-Game ballance is very poor.  Early on, before you get a full party the battles can be challanging.  Once you have a full party then as long as you use a potion when your health gets low then every battle is pretty much the same. \n-Battle mechanics  seem to be poorly designed and ballanced.  There are several skills that I have never used as the battles do not last long enough for me to build up enough vengence.  \n-Enemies level with you - Both good and Bad - See above.  \n-OP damage on both sides.  This makes battles go  quickly but almost all battles can be won just by using the basic fight command as long as your party is healed up before it starts.  \n-Too easy to break the difficulty of the game.  There are many items in the game that become quickly availible early on that mean your game is very easy.  [spoiler] The gambler at the first pub typically looses about 2/3 of the time so as long as you are not betting everything you should easily be able to get all the cash you need for the game as a whole within less than an hour.[/spoiler]\n-The minigames such as owning a farm have been made to require to much micromanagement.  The shop has not put out any cash for me after the initial 103 gold. \n-The crafting mini-game is basically the same for all the different crafting types as well as being very repetitive.  \n-several bugs found, Items not named.  Getting stuck when an NPC's pathing stops in your only path out.\n-Fishing and hunting seems to be totally random without any real use for them.\n\nOverall if you are looking for a cheap game to entertain you for several hours when you are bored then this one is fairly ok.  If you are looking for something well constructed and ballanced then avoid this one.  The story seems to be fairly ok, but the bad overall gameplay makes it difficult to really find value.  I am certain that I am forgetting several points that I should also be placing in the Bad catagory, but I really do not have any intention of going back through and figuring them out.\n\nSide Note:  On the issue of the Tiny screen press F1 to open up the menu, then highlight 'launch in full screen' and then press space bar to select it.  Restart your game and you have full screen mode.\nAlternatively you can play this windowed in 800 X 600 resolution and it looks quite good without the full screen stretching.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423419560, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423419934, "recommendationid": "14391484", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564673", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423526488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 478, "steamid": "76561198082121877", "num_games_owned": 321}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 31, "comment_count": 0, "review": "DO NOT BUY THIS\n\nShort - I can't recommend this game to anyone who values grammar or has any taste in art when it comes to character portrait design.\n\nLong \n\nBarter Empire is a pretty grand idea for a game company I've never heard of. Crafting, Farming, Economy, Adventuring, Marriage, Adoption, Open-World, etc. are a few of the things this game tries to tackle and in my opinion doesn't do very well.\n\nLet's begin with Crafting. Crafting is partially wonderful, partially. In order to craft new items you must level your crafting ability. That is something you see in a lot of games and is not an issue. The problem is that some levels take a ridiculous amount of items to get enough experience to level, and you must craft every item individually. No mass-production here, if you need to craft 40 of X to level, you have to sit there for 5 - 10 minutes playing the crafting minigame to craft each one. Mainly this is monotonous and gets old really fast.\n\nFarming is SUPER EASY. If you imagined any form of difficulty with it then go back to Harvest Moon. In this, you plant a seed and just wait. No watering for multiple days cultivating your plant, just wait. Approx. 2 minutes after planting your seed it is harvestable. I swear I got a free farming game app for my smartphone instead of an $8 game.\n\nGraphically (Not talking about the RPGMaker stuff) the game is garbage. The NPC potraits (while some a little creepy) are leaps and bounds above the player potraits. Player portraits remind me of someone taking a picture of their friend with a smartphone and then using a free app to cartoonify (is that a word?) them. The portaits in no way match the art-style of NPC portraits so it just looks poorly made. One or the other would have been fine (NPC Style is better IMO), consistency in art is way better than whatever they were trying. Landscapes use the typical RPGMaker textures, which is not bad at all.... UNTIL.... You find an area that tries to mix two VERY different ecosystems together. The game maker does not even attempt to create some sort of beffer between areas or redraw the texture to fit better. They simply put the textures side by side, creating a very obvious line down the center of the map (It looks horrible)\n\nPlease do not buy this... Unless you are punishing yourself for something... \n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423527994, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423527994, "recommendationid": "14410293", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542878", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1424327570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 81, "steamid": "76561198012221863", "num_games_owned": 793}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'd like to say beforehand that I do think the game has potential, yet Barter Empire has several major flaws that impact game enjoyment quite negatively.\n\nFirstly, the story starts off rather generically: you are a girl dropped off by blue people, recued by an old man and his dog and awake to find you've lost your memories. He sends you off to a nearby town to meet up with Maxie and the pooch comes along to help. Lets skip the rest of the story for now.\n\nAlong the way you'll run into several characters  with a ! mark over their heads, these generally have something to say that is relevant to main- or subquests, or to one of the various 'foraging and crafting' spots. The latter essentially boils down to getting a tool, going to a spot and then pressing a button that will let a little script run its course to determine if you get goodies or not.\n\nThere are many scripts in the game and some of them might be considered the good points of it. Sadly there is a lot more in terms of bad points: character portraits vary between (bizarre) GCH made portraits and handdrawn ones in a different style that 9/10 times do not match the sprite they nominally represent. Generic RM graphics are mixed with some selfcrafted ones on small maps, titanic enemy sprites are effortlessly slain by tiny character sprites and so on.\n\nWorse though are the graphic mistakes concerning event sprites, if you activate a chest, button, sparkle or whatever there's a chance it will morph into a different part of the spriteset from which it came. Music is a bit bland, and drowned out almost by the looping sound-effects. And dialogue... For crying out loud, what dialogue is in the game is not just corny enough to provide popcorn for three movie theaters for a year, but contains so many typo's and grammar mistakes its painful to watch. \n\nIn conclusion, do not buy this game unless its discounted heavily. It has some potential, but the current build (from 2013!) is so unpolished as to be a concept rather than a pre-alpha release and should not have been released on Steam as such.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424156266, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424156266, "recommendationid": "14510712", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520474", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427231534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 746, "steamid": "76561198003215331", "num_games_owned": 92}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty good game, however, be prepared for some monster fights that are just.. misery to get through- wolves and ghosts for example.\n\nWolves have this goddawful tendency to spam \"Roar\" Which will stun party members for 1-2 turns... at around 45-50% rate\n\nGhosts spam sleep and debuffs.

It has nice mapping, a large range of equipable items and a robust gathering/mining and crafting system. Unfortunately, the game is let down by some questionable design decisions that make it unplayable.\n\nThe first and by far the most detrimental would be the enemy battlers. They are google images of animals that are three times the size of the heroes and come as quite a shock after seeing the level of detail in the mapping. If you were to change them to the RTP battlers I would immediately recommend the title. It is that bad and interestingly there are no screenshots of them on the store page. I wonder why?\n\nThe next would be the style of the portraits. The realistic facesets clash with the rest of the assests and just look unprofessional. I want to focus on the story and dialogue, but I'm just distracted by these ugly pictures. The RTP facesets are far better. \n\nThe last would be the gathering animations. In general all of the resource gathering wastes your time. The huge \"Ore Mined\" picture is nice, the first time. When collecting a resource takes 10 seconds it becomes tiring. I would recommend three sound effects followed by a dialogue box. That's all the player wants and expects. By all means put the fancy pictures up for the first time the player performs them, but they add nothing to the game after that.\n\nI want to play more as I enjoy resource gathering and crafting. I can look past the early combat being boring (standard attack to win) and some of the dialogue falling flat. There are also some troll moves by the developer (sword guy) that annoyed me but they add character and charm. The enemy battlers are terrible and are the weirdest design choice I have ever seen in an RPGMaker game. I just don't understand...\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456047875, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456047875, "recommendationid": "21359951", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504412", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469305372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 405, "steamid": "76561197975101001", "num_games_owned": 2128}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun RPG Maker RPG with lots of crafting, exploration, thieving, land ownership, and stupid jokes.

It appears to me to be an attempt by some Satanic cult to gain access to me and mine.  \n I do not recommend this game, in fact I would stay away from it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424086520, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424086520, "recommendationid": "14497124", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484587", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486955954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 797, "steamid": "76561197990367702", "num_games_owned": 651}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "5", "review": "!!!Awesome Game!!!\n\nIf you ever played Harvest Moon and liked or loved it, then you will like and love this game too. \n\nThere is just so much stuff to do in this game... \n\nPros: For its price this game can easily be worth more for what you can do. Not even the $25's, 30's, 45's & 50's dollar price games can be this good sometimes at there prices - What are you waiting on, get the damn game now!!!\n\nCons: Only thing I see wrong with the game is that your reading my review and not playing this freaking good game - get off your high horse and pay up!!
