That was uncalled for.  Actually, Drew and the Floating Labyrinth does a few things well, but not enough to recommend it to most people and certainly not for anything approaching the eight dollar asking price.  \n\nFloating Labyrinth is a puzzle game in which you attempt to navigate a path of floating cubes obscured by various visual tricks.  The puzzles are largely well designed with each unique trick having 10 short levels dedicated to it, which - with the exception of a few outliars - increase in difficulty from a tutorial level to a fairly complex challenge that will take your average adult player a few goes to get right.  It all comes together in the last approximately 20 levels where all the various visual conundrums are combined to good effect.  For the most part, Floating Labyrinth never feels too easy or controller-snappingly difficult, though there were a fair amount that I ended up solving by tricky jumps rather than actually using logic and a few that are less puzzles than they are exercises in patience.  \n\nOne could argue the biggest drawback of the puzzling in Drew is its small offering of gameplay.  Now, 80 levels sounds like a good deal on paper, but when you ignore levels that are purely vehicles for the story and effortless tutorial levels, it feels short.  I finished the game completely in less than two hours of casual play.  If the quality of the game is dragged down by its length, perhaps it could bring a strong story and visual style to the table.  If it did, 60 or so competently designed levels might even be a perfect length; ending before the game overstays its welcome.  Unfortunately, while the minimalist sketch-like visuals and use of color are pleasing to the eye, the narrative framework is weak.  \n\nYou play as a young girl seeking a way home, guided only by a soothing voice revealed to belong to a bird that offers periodic (and just a bit too repetitive) advice.  Already we have the indie formula of \"small child navigates a bleak, frightening world,\" so it's fair to say there will be a loss of innocence and possibly some kind of twist or pseudo-philosophical pretensions.  Yes, Floating Labyrinth did indeed hit evey branch on its fall out of the indie tree, and basic awareness of \"artsy\" games will leave you feeling a bit blas\u00e9 at the end; exactly the opposite of the emotional impact the game is fishing for.  Ultimately, though, I believe the narrative fails because it lacks the dialogue-free story open to interpretation of something like Limbo, nor does it offer enough to characterize Drew, her guide, and their relationship as done right by, say, Portal.  The dialogue between them consists of only a handful of vague sentences for the entire first half of the game and I just never felt invested.\n\nTechnically, Drew is okay.  It does noticably lack polish that quickly identifies it as being largely the work of one man; I assume a student showing off the culmination of all their hard work.  You can tell by minor things like the inability to rebind keys after launching the game and an entirely royalty-free soundtrack (which is very samey between levels).  That said, it played fine, I encountered no bugs, and it looks genuinely good.\n\nSo by now you might be thinking, \"if the game has some good puzzles and a unique visual style, surely it's still worth my time?\"  Well, no.  I can't really recommend it on that alone.  Sure, some puzzle aficionados or lovers of good art design might enjoy Drew, but at the end of the day it's a middling experience.  And it's a middling experience being offered for more money than better indie puzzlers, as well as some free ones.  I'd place Floating Labyrinth above something you get for free to play on your phone, but sadly, only just.  I'd get this game for maybe one or two dollars tops to enjoy the bite of artsy puzzling goodness it offers, but I'd suggest you leave off otherwise.\n\nI do hope we see more from Dust Scratch Games in the future, though.  With more amibitous writing, a little more polish, and a willingness to keep trying new ideas, the result could be a great game.\n\nGosh, this was a dull review.

If you think you would enjoy a puzzle game in which you are trying to use clues to traverse a path of blocks, I do recommend it.  I enjoyed it, with the exception of one of the levels which had absolutely no way to \"solve\" it without simply doing trial-and-error and falling again and again.\n\nThat brings me to the first complaint I had.  The companion Drew has helping her through this puzzle space is very willing to tell you the advice for the current sequence of stages.  The first time he says \"shadows can tell you something about your surroundings\" [slightly paraphrased], it's helpful... the eighth time he says the same thing, I started having flashbacks to Zelda OOT's Navi \"Hey Listen!\".  This could be solved by putting an option to turn off the random \"help\" in the options, but the option screen is somewhat bare, with no option to turn off the repetitive comments.\n\nMy second issue: Its length.  This game is very short.  I completed the whole game blind [no previous information] in 90 minutes, which is actually much shorter than how long it took to download the game (how is this game so big and so short?).  Anyway, that's really just a minor issue in my book, but I figure I should mention it just in case it's important to you.\n\nMy third issue: Every time you finish a level, which in some cases can be <15 seconds, it sends you back to the level selection screen.  This seems fairly redundant, as unless you want to skip levels (and make the game even shorter!), you'll just be going to the next level.  It makes the game feel less like a contiguous story and more like a free flash game you would play online.\n\nAgain, I do recommend it, as long as you're in the target audience.  The first and third issues above could theoretically be fixed by a small patch.  The second could make-or-break-it for you, but I find length less important than other issues.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423340278, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423419042, "recommendationid": "14375000", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515033", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423249351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 126, "steamid": "76561198055435657", "num_games_owned": 65}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is very minimal but also very clever.
