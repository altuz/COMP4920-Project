Cute graphics, music, and pretty entertaining overall. This is not by any means a super in depth TD game, but for the price there is fun to be had. Currently at 2 1/2 hours and only about halfway through so probably over 5-6 hours of gameplay for $3.

The achievements are easy to unlock and it doesn't have any bullshit moments. I could see this as a social network game that people get hooked on, even kids if they didn't have guns and cigars (which seems is only on the logo)  Straight forward, cute and really good for the low price. ~The first time i played i beat 50% and it then crashed. I launched it once again and my profile/progress had been erased. It wasnt a HUGE deal.. but when i spent about 2 getting where i was back to nothing was a bit annoying.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423531845, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423532302, "recommendationid": "14410943", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518886", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471132891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 100, "steamid": "76561197999730961", "num_games_owned": 3961}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's definitely not the best in its genre, nor is it really memorable, but if you're itching for a tower defense and catch this game on sale, I'd probably give this a try.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502981205, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502981205, "recommendationid": "34308669", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505207539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 322, "steamid": "76561198056588360", "num_games_owned": 419}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a very simplistic tower defense game with some significant design flaws. Enemies carry the plants that you are protecting back to the beginning of the path, dropping them wherever they die. This means that if any enemies get past your towers, it becomes easier for all future enemies to get to your plants, and many of the towers you've built may become useless. Also, the towers will sometimes target the closest enemy, rather than the enemy farthest along the path, needlessly allowing enemies to get past them. There is no way to adjust the towers targeting.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505209014, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505209014, "recommendationid": "34897800", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
