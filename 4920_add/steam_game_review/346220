I wish that there was a way that I could help. This game had so much potential and the only bad thing about the game was a certain group of KOS (Kill On Sight) people. If they had not of come and litterally killed the entire game, I don't think the game would've been in the state it is now. If there is anyway too get this game back up, someone out there has got to try. I think the clever idea would be to ban the IP of the toxic players like Tornappart and his gang, and other people who say they're \"Playing the game\" I mean sure, I could understand it if there was no food anywhere, but food respawns litterally everywhere. Another simple soulution for food problems, be something that eats grass then turn back into whatever you were before. I swear if I had the access to this games coding and stuff, I would try too keep it going. This game was good, in fact I'll go as far as to say it was and AWESOME game, there was just that big group of people that wanted refunds because a certain group will just Kill on sight and spawnkill etc. If there was a way to save this game it would be to make it so you can kick certain people or ban them from the server, you know, sorta like gmod, make it so you can be the host of the server, or have moderators. Like I said, loads of potential and I'm just upset it had to end this way. I wish there was a way to save this game, maybe there is, but only time will tell. Thanks for reading this, and if your the devloper of the game, I wish you good luck, and I hope that this helped you even just a tiny bit. :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504872166, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504872166, "recommendationid": "34813037", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 62, "total_reviews": 116, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 54}}
