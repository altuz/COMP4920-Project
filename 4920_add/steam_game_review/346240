I really been looking forward to seeing a tycoon in this area for some time and for a short time the game is a neat idea. But thats the theory. This game has quite a few problems that is unknown if they will get fixed. \n\nOnce a day every day (It's hard to know if its by day, basicially its whenever the daily quarter is over) you will have stacks of skiers go to the top of your staging area, only to go all the way back down to the bottom and exit the park through any terrain imaginable. Plus there is not very many things  to build (Why no hotels? Bus or airports? Taxi service? Multiple kinds of vehicles for each building type?)\n\n At first you are confused, and if you like me start off in sandbox, you will probably (maybe not all will) need to go to campaign and try a few missions to understand the basics. You won't learn much, the tutorials are rushed. Each map designed is poor, no random generating maps so you will have to pick the same maps over and over if you play the game for some time (low replayability), skiers look bugged (If you place a lift wrong the skiers will take the lift downhill and attempt to slide down the hill upwards which makes them stuck), and you make little income from the skiers. Charge too much, less will come. \n\nIn some games this might just be the challenge, but after some time you realize you can't afford what you need to run the park in the first place. So you constantly restart in the hopes you attract more customers. But then you realize all of you skiers are stuck in one spot so you let them stack up hoping they will die only for the next day they magically decide they can go through four mountain passes on skis and snowboards through forests and nothing but dry land and pulling out your hair wanting to grab your screen and throw it across the room while yelling \"Stop SCAMMING ME\". Yea, sorry,  pro and cons.\n\nPro\n\nPotential\n\nQuite a few maps and some hidden bonus ones apparently\n\nCons\n\nSmall maps (Lower graphics requirements should mean bigger map capability in todays age)\n\nBugged Skiers\n\nBugged lifts\n\nNot many building options\n\nMust spam same buildings (What, I need fifty small 10 car garages in the same spot)\n\nNeed more ways to make income and attract tourists (HOTELS)\n\nSlope creation mechanics look barbaric (Looks like something a child would draw.)\n\nNot enough information sometimes to determine why you are not getting or losing customers.\n\nLow graphics (This can be turned into a pro but at this time and stage the game is just so limited that it should have been put on better graphics. Now if the game is really expanded than I would accept the game in this condition but really, it does not deserve to be placed higher.)\n\nRandom bugs (I think the game has issues running on more powerful machines but so far no crashes for me, just random error messages every once in awhile.) \n\nMap scrolling issues (sometimes in tutorial or when starting a new map the game prevents you from zooming out very far so you see a very small stretch of map that you have a hard time doing anything with. Trying a different map fixes the problem.\n\nThe game has a few issues that are difficult to reproduce so the bugs are not really a problem the developers will have a easy time fixing. But it should be run a little bit more before releasing.  Also I played this game for a couple of hours. The game personally should be played in small doses. I would not recommond this game unless you love tycoon games and want to catch them all (oops wrong game).  And for those who want to bash me for not playing more for the review, well, I'm sorry but the game is just too simple. It's not like dragon age, in this game you see all your options in the beginning of the game, not halfway through it. You don't research new things. You don't craft. You just build a few buildings and hope for success. Simple\n\nAlso, how come there is no town interaction?

I would definetely recommend to anybody that has a love for skiing or just designing a resort.\n\nPros\n1. Unlimited Mode is very fun\n2. All around great game that has no severe bugs that stand out\n3. Free Ride is an excellent feature that allows you to enjoy the resort\n\nCons\n1. Campaign too hard\n2. Skiers get stuck in some situations and all go into a huge clump\n3. Lifts don't have realistic range and they can't go over blocked terrain, in most cases\n\nThings to Add (In order of importance)\n\n1. Ski Patrol needs to be improved\n2. Unlimited mode unlocked from start\n3. Map Editor would be very helpful, or just a tutorial on how to make your own and put it into the files yourself\n4. Add more lifts such as a Triple Chair, High Speed Quad, and High Speed Six. Also add mid-stations and down-loading for gondolas and such\n5. In unlimited mode, skiers cannot fall and get injured\n6. Can choose whether terrain is blocked or not\n7. An option to make the run colors Green for beginner, Blue for intermediate, and Black for advanced/expert\n8. Make unlimited mode available on the addon maps\n9. More run types (Double Green, Double Blue, Double Black)\n10. More buildings such as a lodge, a sit-down restaraunt, hotels, cabins, stores, and walkways\n11. Make bridges to allow runs to go over or under a road\n12. Terrain Parks\n13. Exposed rocks to make realistic chutes and an option to make a bowl (A zoning tool to drag and area that is a bowl)\n14. In free ride, you should be able to actually be on the lift, not just zipping to the top of it\n15. Ability to create more roads\n16. An option before starting a game to have the map full with trees, some trees, or no trees (I love trees and I have to fill the whole map with them so I can have the trees :)\n\nOverall, awesome game.

I've played several of the ski resort games and this one has been my favorite one so far.

That's kind of a silly restriction.  I can't imagine why my huge aerial tram can't cross over that tiny round red spot that is on the side of hill.  Just make it so crossing unpassable terrain adds a little to the cost.\nRethink the \"no objects under ski lift thing.  Especially for snow cannons.  That really doesn't make sense.  I've been to many resorts that have had buildings under ski lifts.  Especially cable cars and aerial trams.\n\nThe above things shouldn't take too much coding to implement.
