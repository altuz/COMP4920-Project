Gameplay is neither interesting nor difficult: it consists of solving simple puzzles by clicking on the right things, sometimes at the right time, in an environment that is occasionally too dark to distinguish some of the things that should be clicked on. Be prepared to spend some time clicking aimlessly/randomly, as the the game offers no indication as to the way forward.\n\nThat said, The Old Tree recommends itself with its beautiful visual style, and a curious, strange and otherworldly environment.
