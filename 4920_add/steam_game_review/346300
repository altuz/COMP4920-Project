The aesthetic and gameplay work really well together for the right feel. I enjoyed the little touches like scan resolution being tied directly to the battery power. The radial scanning view is a neat concept that forces you to tap into that ever shrinking memory system that we as a society have been trying so hard to phase out. \n\nThe limitations of the drone view add to the tension in a good way. The game reminds you that it is important to pay attention instead of just forcing your face into the dirt like these type of games can.\n\nPaying for this game is an investment into a solid game concept that I believe will mature into a great game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444622087, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1444622087, "recommendationid": "18438055", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509547", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467999367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 116, "steamid": "76561198063950281", "num_games_owned": 29}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is a lot of fun to play sadly only having one level it really is fun, the cenpet of it is different from a lot of games i play where you can shoot your way through of something whilst this game takes a more inercent approach to it all where your are controling a drone to save people, the game's first level felt a bit more like a find and collect game then action adventure game whilst yes you do have to be a tad intrude it felt too straight forward except with the the way to defuse the bomb, overall i think it has a lot of potenional but dont make levels that just find the key to find another key and to find... you get the point.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469113787, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1469113787, "recommendationid": "24443256", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
