There arent any weapons you have to rent to use, there isnt any insane pay to win aspect, there isnt any annoying ads or pop ups saying \"buy this game\", it is truly a \"free to play\" game. It isnt like the games that have the \"free to play, but pay to win\" kind of bull shit. This game here is simply one that you can download, for free, and enjoy for a few hours or a few minutes at a time. That being said, this game is not the best, as it only has a few maps to play the game modes on. Grinding the same three maps in the survival game mode is not very fun to do for a long period of time. It does definitely need new maps and maybe a few new weapons would be nice too.
