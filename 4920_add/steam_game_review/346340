Gameplay is pretty straightforward : Kill or be killed. At the moment you can pick one of the two modes to play : Campaign and Endless. \n\n[b] Campaign [/b]\n\nThere isnt much of a story in the campaign: your goal is to destroy Gran Vitreous, the mother shape that creates the ships that attack the galaxy. In order to find Gran Vitreous you need to find its coordinates so you go on an adventure to collect 3 segments from the meaniest ships created by Gran Vitreous . \nSo the campaign is separated into 4 zones and each one of them got a level range(0-30,30-60,60-95,95-125) . Though the level number seems to be high you wont need to reach the suggest level in order to complete the zone( I was able to finish the game as level 83) . \nEach zone contains a lot of arenas to fight in . The fun part is that each arena gets random \"perks\" like increased enemy,drop, player's damage and the likes but also you may encounter and specific arena perks like asteroid field, debris, gravity wells, solar flares . When comes to encountering enemies you may end up against a mothership, station or a boss monster( once you beat the zone boss,you can find it as an encounter in next zones) . Other bonuses you may find are infinite secondary or super ammo ... or why not ... disabled weapon systems! Every arena got only 1 way to be completed : kill everything, kill the \"elite\" , wait for the timer to finish the countdown, repair the ship.\nDepending on the arena you pick you will get an additional objective that you can try to complete for bonus experience.\nOverall a good RNG system that may frustrate you if you are down on your luck.\n\n[b] RPG elements [/b]\n\nGame features 6 gear slots(main/secondary/super weapon, hull,shield and utility) and 3 skill trees(offensive,defensive and utility).  Hull and shield are simple , the higher the number the better . \nAt the time of the review there are 6 utilities, each one of them with their own pros and cons. During playing I tried only half of them but overall they enchant the gameplay and are able to save your ship quite often.\nSame goes for guns, not big variety of guns at the moment in my opinion but gonna be added some new weapons later on with updates.\nThe general stat for your weapons is damage/ damage per second  , the higher the better ... if you like the gun of course. \nDepending on the rarity of the gear you can get bonus stats : higher numbers mainly with some utility like bonus items/higher chance for better gear and the likes. You can upgrade your gear in the dock hub(aka before you go on adventure) with credits.\nSkill trees provide only passive bonuses and cost skill points and credits to unlock them. You can unlock higher ammo capacity, more lives at the start , higher chance to find items, get more experience, deal more dmg and so on.\n\nOverall  Campaign offers quite good content if you have only 10-15 minutes to play .\n\n[b] Endless [/b]\n\nEndless mode is completly different compared to Campaign . In Endless you pick utility and then RNG picks your weapon and put you in an arena in which you have to survive for as much as you can . You can upgrade your weapons when the clock hits 0(its time-gated upgrade system) and upgrade your hull/shield/utility from collection dropped items.\nIn Endless you will encounter everything that you saw in Campaign apart from boss monsters(thats if you played Campaign first) . That includes both mobs and galaxy events(asteroids,debris and so on) The goal of endless mode is to survive as much as possible and compare your result with other players thanks to steam leaderboards .\n\n[b] Art/Graphics [/b]\n\nThe graphics are simple but flashy ... at times WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too flashy ... so flashy that you may end up confused for a split second ... in which you got hit by an asteroid. But graphics are doing their job just fine.\n\n[b] Sound [/b]\n\nThe background sound of the game is fitting, it doesnt break immersion but the sound effects at times are bad. To be more precise : you can hear a boss to charge its gun ... that you just destroyed.\n\nNow I need to say that the first time you play you may encounter 2 crashes : once when you reach your first store on the galaxy map , and the 2nd crash is when you try to load the game after the 1st crash but after them I had no issues with the game\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\n\nThe price tag is fair for the content that the game offers and its a steal if you are fan of the genre. The game is fun and offers enough genuine content and playtime to make the purchase worth it .", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432706113, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432706113, "recommendationid": "16021293", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528386", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466280243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 618, "playtime_forever": 304, "steamid": "76561198040884867", "num_games_owned": 1196}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[b][i]Gran Vitreous[/i] is a wonderful shmup, well worth the asking price.[/b] There is [i]alot[/i] of game here, as long as you are ok with the graphics (I personally love them, as someone who loves the indie retro style). \n\n[i]Essentially, you fight your way through level-after-level of bullet hell, collecting stuff along the way in order to perma-upgrade your ship for future runs.[/i] It's as simple as that.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Hours of fun for a too-small asking price\n+Great retro visuals and graphics - explosions and pickups are epic!\n+Controller support works really well for a great couch experience\n+All the upgrades are complex enough to keep me coming back, yet simple enough to dive into without too much trouble\n+Upgrades really make you feel more powerful - and they are quite diverse, which changes your playstyle substantially\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Definately only for those fond of bullet hell with retro-ish graphics\n\n[b]Totally worth the five bucks.[/b] You will get well worth your money if this is your jam.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463504771, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463504771, "recommendationid": "23040603", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522594", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500006959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1113, "steamid": "76561197963981805", "num_games_owned": 1214}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "My thumbs hurt\n\n--------------\nGET THIS GAME\n\nThe paper napkin pitch? Twinstick shooter roguelite. Geometry Wars mashed with Rogue Legacy, with a dash of FTL.\n\n-Geometry Wars: You are a shape, shooting other shapes for points.\n-Rogue Legacy: There is an item progression and a skill progression. You retain these when you die, which allows you to push further. \n-FTL: The game is comprised of 4 sectors that you must progress through and defeat the boss at the end. \n\nBeing a roguelite there is also a healthy amount of randomization throughout. Each sector has dozens of levels. Each level is randomly generated with a subset of the enemy shapes, and various buffs and debuffs. For example, 50% smaller playfield, 200% Enemy health, 75% increased item rarity, and an ASTEROID FIELD. Beat one level and unlock paths to 2-5 others which are similarly randomized. The classic FTL conundrum of pushing forward to simply survive to see the final encounter, versus moving laterally for more loot/XP is in full effect here (though there is no pressure of an enemy fleet encroaching). \n\nThere are at least a half dozen primary weapons, probably as many secondary and super weapons, and likewise about as many items for the Utility slot, which have various effects like a repulsor field, 'phase shift' which grants a moment of invulnerability, or simple speed boosts. Rounding out the equippable items are hull and shield items, which aren't really as exciting. All these things have their own iLevels and stats. Your Level 15 Rare quality hull is probably better than the level 20 Common hull that just dropped. \n\nStandard roguelite stuff. But it works so, so well. \n\nFTL, Rogue Legacy, and Geometry Wars are heavyweights with devoted fanbases, and deservedly so. Gran Vitreous is the result of putting those games in a blender. It's $5 USD (!!!) and well worth it. After 6 hours I've just beat the first sector, and I want to do nothing more than dive back in right now.\n\nYou know if you're the type of player interested in this game.

You have a primary weapon, two secondary weapons and a utility slot. There is also some weapon charge mechanic which I haven't bothered exploring at all.

Trying to line up a shot on a single enemy is frustratingly difficult. Thankfully, that level of precision is not often required.\n[*]Programmer art in abundance.
