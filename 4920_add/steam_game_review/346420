Normally in a game like this it takes 15+ hours to reach the idle point, where a base or city or whatever is self-sufficient and can exist forever without player input. I hit that point in The Spatials after 3. \n\nNothing costs credits to maintain, not the infinite sources of resources, nor anything on the station, nor your Spatials themselves. All of these are one-time costs, and then cost nothing for the rest of the game. Spatial needs are unlocked at levels, so the entire base can be crewed by level 1 Spatials and they'll be free labor. Spatials stationed in embassies are free as well. Spatials can't die on missions either, so the away team will be the ones to have any upkeep at all. But that upkeep only comes in the form of consumed resources, resources you're already creating for your visitors.\n\nI built up a base to 2 star ports, with enough amenities to keep my visitors and away team, and that's end of the game. There's no impetus to expand beyond that. I was making consistent money. Everyone's needs were met. I had no grand goal to achieve. The missions aren't interesting enough to engage in for their own sake. There's no increasing flow of mouths to feed and heads to shelter, there's no increasing demand for resources, no long term goal to dump resources into achieving. There's a long tech tree to go through, but no reason to down it. There's nothing. \n\nIt's a game that's interesting for a short while, but peters out very quickly.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504914392, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504914392, "recommendationid": "34825419", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521155", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504181189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 161, "steamid": "76561197971724802", "num_games_owned": 326}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "3", "review": "[b][i]The Spatials[/i][/b] is a nice game to pass the time.
