Add a little bit of point & click style puzzle solving and place it all in an alternate film-noir universe, where mobsters fight with katana instead of guns. In the hands of a great developer, this could've been an indie classic. Instead we ended up with samurai_jazz.\n\nThe game takes place over five acts, where you need to collect items and press switches to unlock more sections of the level until you eventually find the key item you need to progress to the next act, fighting any thugs along the way. Enemies die in one hit, but so do you, so combat places emphasis on blocking and countering. All of this sounds fine on paper, problem is, it completely fails in its execution.\n\nThe game is frustratingly difficult. Enemy placement is done in such a sloppy manner. There were many instances where you'll enter a room and be completely surrounded by enemies making for plenty of cheap deaths. What makes this worse is enemies respawn anytime you re-enter a room you just cleared, making levels where you're forced to backtrack a chore to play through. Even worse, there are puzzle rooms where you have to press switches in the correct order or else you die. So, if you make a wrong choice, you\u2019ll have to start all over again, killing the same enemies, and hoping the next switch you press is the correct one. As if the frustratingly tedious gameplay weren't bad enough on its own, the game also suffers from unresponsive controls. There were way too many times I was moving right and when I tried moving left, my character would just stand there and I end up getting killed.\n\nEven bad games are capable of immersing you in their story and setting if they\u2019re interesting enough. Problem is, what little story that\u2019s here is completely nonsensical. It starts with a guy committing seppuku before having you play as your character, who I assume is a detective. What exactly is the mystery here? The NPCs you interact with don't tell you anything other than \"get me [key item] and I'll let you pass\". The ending doesn't explain anything either. The Jazz soundtrack is decent but the slow tempo doesn't fit with the action on screen at all. Plus the tracks are way too short and get annoying very quickly. Graphically speaking, the character sprites look decent enough, but the backgrounds all look very samey. This is especially bad in the fifth act of the game where it's very easy to get lost in, oh and did I mention enemies respawn every time you re-enter a room?\n\nSamurai_jazz is a game full of great ideas, and not a single one of them works. It fails to take advantage of its unique setting, the gameplay (when it works) is frustrating, but above all else, it's just a bore to sit through.

It came cheap, so that much is a plus. But I often found myself dying when I shouldn't have simply because the game didn't respond to my desired actions (such as not turning left when I wished to do so). While the fast pace of the game was nice, it felt very similar screen to screen. At times you had little time to even react before getting attacked. Leading to a \"die 10 times to get the timing just right\" type of gameplay. There was also the fact that there seems to be an odd bug in the game. Where when you enter a new zone at times the enemies will \"slide\" to just outside of the map or to a section of the map they shouldn't be able to get to. Which makes dealing with them that much more difficult.\n\nPersonally, there is stuff I like about the game but it's mostly negative for me.

But the setting doesn't actually figure into the game, other than...the clothing? When you start a new game, there are a couple of sentences of vague story that I can't even remember. Then you leave the starting room, and each room after that has half a dozen blade-wielding thugs or rokurokubi that attack you. Why do they attack? Who knows! How does the protagonist get away with slicing down dozens of people in broad daylight? Is the city (whatever city this is) [i]that[/i] far gone?\n\nThe real problem, though, is the gameplay. You go into a room and try to cut down all the enemies before they cut YOU down. This requires finicky timing and control. When you die (not if, when) you start over from the beginning of the room. This is a good thing, as it means you lose very little time in your attempts to clear the room. It only takes a couple minutes to die 50 times in the same room. Of course, that really just means you rage quit sooner.\n\nI wanted to like this game, but...it's just not [i]fun[/i].\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438307546, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438307546, "recommendationid": "17308711", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.996480", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444022908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 246, "steamid": "76561197992881329", "num_games_owned": 1374}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I can't  help but feel disappointed in samurai_jazz. The game starts out strong with an 8-bit film noir meets samurai art style and jazzy soundtrack that work well together to create an atmospheric vibe few games manage to pull off. The game's \"tutorial\" is comprised of a few of short messages graphitied on the walls and sides of buildings, and after learning the basic moveset I felt as though the combat system, which depends on proper positioning and timing, was both complex and deep.\n\nUnfortunately, player mobility is poorly implemented in this game. Getting the player character into the right position and facing the right direction is no easy task, and since combat relys so heavily on player position and facing - you can only attack or block in the direction you are facing - the hampered mobility lead to a number of deaths that felt more like the game's fault than my own.\n\nTo add insult to injury, not only are samurai_jazz's enemies more mobile than the player, easily able to flank the player when engaging with multiple enemies, but the game's enemy placement seems to be designed around the player's hampered movement. I lost count of the number of times I entered a room only to be immediately ambushed by 3 or more enemies moving in from different directions, often with my character facing away from all of them and open to attack. If I moved to block or attack one of them, the other two would attack from the sides and kill me. More often than not, the solution to one of these ambushes was to run around avoiding the enemies until I could get into a more favorable position.\n\nMany of the reviews here speak of the game's \"challenge,\" but since the game's challenge depends on enemy placement and the player's hampered mobility, samurai_jazz feels less like a skill based game than a luck based one. The afforementioned entryway ambushes comprize most of the game's difficulty, but after they are taken care of, clearing out the remaining enemies in a room is fairly trivial as most of them attack one or two at a time, coming from the same direction, which makes them easy to block or kill.\n\nThe game's story is also lacking. The opening scene shows a samurai comitting harakiri (ritual suicide), after which the player character awakens from sleep. Given the film noir atmosphere, I expected to learn why this samurai decided to kill himself through the course of the game. Instead I was treated to a series of MacGuffin hunts straight out of a point and click adventure game, where I fetched cigarettes and bubble gum for strangers so they could let me pass through to the next alleyway. Why I wanted to get to the next allyway, I don't know. The game never bothers telling you why you're doing what you're doing.\n\nThe \"story\" culminates in an ending that has me thinking that this entire game was a troll. The ending felt as though the developer was brandishing a middle finger squarly in the face of any players masochistic enough to make their way through to the end of samurai_jazz. After all those BS deaths, hours spent wrestling with the controlls, and having to fetch cigarettes for the umpteenth time, the developers still manage to shout one last \"FU\" to the play at the very end.
