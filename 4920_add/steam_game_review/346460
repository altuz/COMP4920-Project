I have played many, many racing games and flight sims over the years - but quite honestly, this game has the best physics I have experienced. The takes a bit of getting used to and driving one of these rigs is like trying to tame a wild stallion at first - but it is this struggle that is a result of the excellent physics and gives the game it challenge - you really do feel immersed and in control of a difficult craft. At first you will just swim around watching all the other racers zoom past you - but when start to 'get' the physics system and it begins to click into place, I cannot tell you how satisfying and exhilarating it is.   \n\nUnder the hood. As well as the racing, there is a *very* complex garage set-up, where you can modify and even create new rigs from scratch. To be honest, this was way too complex for me - I think you need a degree in physics engineering to even make a start (or perhaps I am just too lazy). I am really glad it is there - as one day, I am going to figure this beast out! Fortunately, this deeper aspect can be totally bypassed and you can just buy (in game currency) working rigs. \n\nIt is clear that the devs put all of their thoughts into the physics aspect of the game, and this pays off in spades. The fact that the gameplay itself is so good is almost like a by-product of the physics. My one gripe with the game is that the landscapes themselves are dull and uninspiring. Sure, it is set on Mars, which by all accounts in not the most pretty of environments. But this seems like a short-cut idea so that not too much effort needed to be put into the design of the tracks. I would pay the same price as I did for the game itself to have a DLC set in a more visually rich environment. (rainforest? Yes please!)\n\nIf anything, this is why I am writing this review. Perhaps if enough people support this excellent game, it could be worth the Devs thinking about adding new environments. \n\nPros:\n\n*THE* best physics I have experienced in a game of this type. \n\nChallenging, deep gameplay that also manages to be a hell of a lot of fun too. \n\nEven though the environments are on the bland side, the tracks are well designed for a good racing experience and the particle and other effects give a real sense of 'being there' \n\nIn my view - in terms of immersion, handling and reward - *the* best racer in VR.\n\nA real deep 'under the hood' system for those who are up to it!\n\nMore than worth the full asking price. \n\nCons: \n\nThe only con for me is the somewhat bland environments. \n\nConclusion: I had never heard of this title - I almost accidentally missed an exceptional VR experience and a deep, satisfying racer. I want these guys to expand on this game, or future ones - it would be a tragedy if this went under peoples radar. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505820012, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505820012, "recommendationid": "35062411", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505780927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 244, "steamid": "76561197998096242", "num_games_owned": 529}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a fantastic hardcore VR racing game.

I love most racing games in VR;  Project Cars, Dirt Rally, Arsetto Corsa, Redout.  But I am just not feeling this game.  This game starts out slow.  It doesn't even feel like your'e going fast.  It feels like you're plodding along.  On quick racing, the best I could do is 2nd place, not because of any mistakes.  But because you're piece of trash vehicle just can't get anywhere fast without heating up and the lead vehicle just zooms by you at the start.  And tournament racing, the endurance race felt like pulling teeth.  (Please note that I played this on the Oculus Rift with Xbox Controller on i7 GTX 1060 rig)\n\nThe tutorial was boring.  The first tracks are nothing pretty to look at.  The UI is messy.  I get that this is supposed to be a sim, but it brings all boring parts of the sim with no payoff.  The races are more technical than adrenaline filled.  I can't think of one memorable moment so far in playing this game (no amazing passes or close finishes, etc.).  The closest to that was my vehicle going down in flames because some vehicle that I didn't think was that close to me clipped me on a turn where I was basically trying to stay my distance while still making a decent turn.  \n\nI paid 15.99 on sale and I can't even recommend it at that sale price.  Maybe if you love sims.  But this is nothing like that race scene from Star Wars Episode IV nor much less better.  It's a slow, plodding, burn.  Just spitballing on this, but maybe if I could have used my motion controllers, it would have made the racing seem less tedious (especially since you can see the controls in the cockpit).  Maybe add an arcade mode racing.  \n\nRate 4/10 buy if you really love plodding, racing sims that are more about management than speed (and I hate those negative reviews that mention nausea.. really?  I felt none, just sell your VR and gaming rig)", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1506929789, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506913141, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506913141, "recommendationid": "35403058", "developer_response": "Sorry the game isn't what you expected.  I don't make any claims that the game is similar to pod racer or an arcade styled racer, so I would be curious where you got that impression from.  Does it really warrant a bad review? I get if it isn't what you expected, but it is not the games fault for being a simulator and not pod racer.  The entire premise is methodical crafting systems and physics based play and it is evident in the reviews.  Some recent ones have even mentioned how methodical and patient you must be to get the most out of it.\n\nFor what its worth, Im glad you didnt get nausea playing it.
