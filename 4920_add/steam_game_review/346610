You are stuck using the arrow keys to navigate and the alt keys to select and go back. If these keys can be changed I would love to know how, because then I could change the controls on how to drive the cars. I don't have a gamepad or wheel (just a joystick) so I am left with using (for me atleast) strange driving controls to race which becomes a nuissance as time goes on. \nThe graphics are pretty good, but they are not well optimized. I can't hold that against them at all though because it is alpha. \nCurrently I can only find the default red racecraft car to use and I am not the biggest fan of its balancing (meaning its acceleration rate, top speed, downforce etc.) and am looking forward to increased customizability of the cars in the future.\n\nThe best part about this game and, to me at least, makes it stand out from other racing games is the track generation. The procederal engine works most of the time and creates tracks that have a similar flavor but have yet to seem repetetive. \n\nOverall I'd say this game has a lot of potential to become one of the greats and I would recomend keeping an eye on it as it develops.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457145654, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1457145654, "recommendationid": "21632291", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505769", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478220508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 118, "steamid": "76561198087732357", "num_games_owned": 84}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Yes, this game is a bit rough around the edges.\nYes, I don't particularly like Vae Victis.\nAnd, yes, if they do this game right, can change my opinion on this game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this game still needs a hell of a lot of work before it is deemed play-able by the public. So far now, now that I got it finally working on my computer, it isn't half bad.\n\nHowever, one gripe I have with this game is optimization. I'm running it on my 3 year old potato laptop, and I had to put all settings on low at 720p. Maybe I just need to get my gaming rig completed.\n\nTrack randomization is not bad at all. There was the occasional expirience where the track didn't load right, and left holes in the map and walls on the track itself blocking me from completing a lap. I would like to see options and sliders for track randomization, like complexity, length, height changes, and other variables.\n\nCar handling is not that bad, altough it does need some touch-ups before launch.\n\nAll in all, not bad in Early Development, it just needs a bit more work done to it to make it able to play it for the consumer. And for the love of everyone around here, add AI racing. I've delt with Victory and not being able to play with other racers.

It's done whilst you're on track by pressing left alt, then tapping right alt to select the option, then holding right alt until your tweaks are just right.

The game is still extremely laggy, there is still no mouse control in the menus, all menus are still locked behind the procedural track generator... none of these have improved whatsoever. In fact, playing the game from a fresh install on my new computer corrupted Steam and forced me to reinstall it and restart my computer to get everything working again.\n\nRacecraft is still nowhere near being a playable game worth anyone's time or money.\n\n---------\n\n[b]Original:[/b]\n\nWe need to start this off with a warning. The developers of Racecraft, Vae Victus, have only done one other Steam game, Victory: The Age of Racing. They abandoned the game for two years, then made it free-to-play and have still yet to update it in any way. This studio's track record is small but horrible, so please bear that in mind.\n\nRacecraft is designed to be a procedurally-generated driving game, its gameplay being based in simulation with some arcade modifications to it. It was a formula that worked fairly well in Victory, and it's been refined here in Racecraft. Driving feels tight yet fluid enough so that it doesn't feel stiff, and the sense of speed is there. When it comes down to the core gameplay, Racecraft has got many of the checkboxes marked. My biggest concern with one of the previous versions in the closed Alpha was that there were a lot of symbols and signs on the track that I couldn't identify. My racing history is mostly in Need for Speed - I'm not a racing sim gamer - so it would have been helpful to have some explanation on what the track signs meant.\n\nOutside of gameplay design, Racecraft falls short of being a stable game to play in. Again, keep in mind that this is still Early Access, so things are bound to be, well, Early Access. But there's a myriad of issues present in the current version. 1) The game [i]just[/i] crashed on me while I was preparing to write this review. 2) The menus are extremely slow to respond, slow to animate, and [b]do not have mouse control[/b] (as a game releasing on Steam in 2016, that last part shouldn't even be there). 3) The game's menus are locked behind the procedural track generator, so you'll be waiting a while before you can even change the game from fullscreen or turning off its effects or what have you. 4) Gameplay itself is incredibly sluggish, even when I turn off all effects, get out of fullscreen, and lower the resolution.\n\nThere also seems to be some sort of issue with controller support. Sometimes it recognizes my Logitech Wireless Gamepad F710, sometimes it doesn't. For the record, Racecraft will fully support wheels (if it doesn't already), so if you have one of those peripherals you're in luck here. It should also be stated that Racecraft requires DirectX 11 or newer, so if you're running DirectX 10 or older (which millions of Steam accounts still are), you won't be able to play Racecraft.\n\nBecause of the many issues with the game, I cannot recommend Racecraft in its current state. I look forward to future updates, and as I stated in my disclaimer I will update this review as such, but for now I advise staying away.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457109840, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1482614677, "recommendationid": "21622998", "language": "english", "votes_down": 28, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522326", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481420967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 34, "steamid": "76561198017382078", "num_games_owned": 644}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty cool racing game.\nObviously not complete, but when it is, that's gonna be pretty bitchin'.\n\nController calibration is sort of strange.
