I saw this game had achievements and even trading cards, so I mainly hoped for something decent or maybe even good. I didn't find what I was hoping for.\n\nPlazma Being is a puzzle platformer in which you control a flame thing from space that can change forms. That about sums up the whole depth of this game. I was REALLY hoping I would find more depth, but as I continued to level 10 and beat the game (yes the game is that short), I barely got any. The only depth you will find in this game is beginning with 2 forms and ending with 4(!) forms to change between as you progress through the game, 3 very lackluster bosses, which required only a slight bit of thinking and generally 1 ability (with a bit of luck) and some sort of collectibles in the form of energy bubbles which enable you to progress, depending on if you play on the teleporter charger mode (if I say this right). If you play on the other mode (on which I fully forgot the name, sorry!) you don't need to collect the energy bubbles.\n\nNow I can almost hear you thinking; 'Well what did you expect for 2 euro's (or in your case 50 eurocents)?' To be honest, I didn't expect a really unique indie game or anything like that, but I did expect a fun platformer to have a couple of hours of fun. Well, it would be fun if the above written (part about the depth of the game) was all I had to nag about. Instead I got steadily more frustrated as I played on. I am not gonna list every negative point, as my hands already hurt from playing this game with the controls it gave to me.\n\nPro's\n\n\n- Cheap, especially with coupon(s).\n\n- Easy to understand, although the game doesn't have a tutorial, it's clear in every level what you are supossed to do and even if you missed energy bulbs (which the game also makes clear at some point during the game).\n\n- Clear indicator when placing/freezing blocks midair, so that you can see when you can jump onto the block or not.\n\n- Your character sometimes make some slightly cute noise.\n\nCon's\n\n\n- Buggy. Sometimes you can't jump for some reason, sometimes you can't go under blocks you placed/freezed midair for no reason (unless your hitbox suddenly grows at that exact point *cough*), sometimes blocks shoot away when you are trying to displace them with your powerups, and so on. First this isn't that bad as you can reset via a nearby checkpoint, but it happened so many times (at the very least 2 times per level with me) it really ruins the game.\n\n- The controls. I picked up my xbox controller when booting up the game, didn't work. Ok, then with keyboard. A and D to move, W to jump, L to restart (from a checkpoint) and mouse for your powerups (scrolling alternates between powerups and clicking left or right mouse button uses them). The main character controls like a piece of rock tied to a persons leg. Very sluggish, but once you get moving stopping is a bit... wonky...\n\n- The bosses, which I mentioned earlier. Obvious spoiler alert: the bosses are very simple and require a slight bit of skill. Fighting the bosses consist of doing one action, sometimes multiple times. Reflecting a laser, bouncing a bomb back and sitting on top of the boss describe all the 3 bosses and how to beat them in one sentence.\n\n- The game mechanics and \"puzzles\". When trying to use your powers to displace objects with your mouse in this game, you get a clear circle of the extend to which you can displace objects. Problem is, when you move objects, the circle gets smaller the faster you move them to prevent you from throwing objects farther away then you should be able to. If you try to move an object just a little bit to the sides of your circle, good luck, because your object will fall into a void (which means restarting!~). There are some more minor issues with mechanics, but I will leave it for you (the reader) to discover. The puzzles however, are godawful sometimes. The puzzles that require you to think are sometimes challenging, but other times just downright annoying. Luckily you can skip entire puzzles whilst asking yourself; '...Was I supossed to do that...?'. Eventually I got stuck at one puzzle, looked it up on youtube and the guy who \"solved\" the puzzle literally said the same thing I thought; 'Was that the solution or did I do this wrong?'.\n\n- Lastly, the feel of this game. I simply feel the developer just lost interest halfway through the game and finished it in a hurry, which explain the bugs and the ways you can cheat yourself through puzzles.\n\nI wouldn't even mind if this game was released in an even slightly worse state, but it just almost sickens me that the developer even asked money for this, when it doesn't even feel full effort (again, MAINLY in terms of bugs and puzzles) was put into this game. I can search on kongregate for more fun platformers which will entertain me more and longer for free, which also give me the feeling more effort was put into it.\n\nTL:DR\nYou would be better of playing a fun platformer on kongregate for free, I really think the developer of this game shouldn't have even asked for money for this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505242342, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505245746, "recommendationid": "34906570", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 36, "total_reviews": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 18}}
