There's no way to re-map the keys to a more sensible setting. I can't get used to it, and the game itself is not worth the effort: of course all I have seen is part of the first level (the controls are still so bad I can't get any further), but based on that -- I've played Sega Genesis games that were far more well-made and interesting, even today, than this.  Deleting. Again. This time forever. Please don't waste your time or money on this drivel.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nI was really looking forward to this and am terribly disappointed. The controls are INSANELY BAD, to the point where the game is unplayable. Forget mouse control entirely -- useless. Keyboard controls almost as bad. Up sends your plane down. Down sends your plane up. Movement is so out of whack that the slightest touch of the key sends you careering wildly in a direction that you never wanted to go in the first place. \n\nReally terribly disappointing, the game looked really cute and fun. Instead it is an excercise in frustration as you repeatedly plunge into the sea for no good reason. Wish I had not bought this, even on sale. Don't be taken in by the price, it's NOT worth it.\n-------------------------\nOK, I went back and tried it again. SO VERY MUCH CRAP.
