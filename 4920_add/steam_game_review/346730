So let me just start with a couple stuff... pointless and trivial stuff that you may or may not find yourself asking.\n\n** Skip to the bottom for TL:DR summary.\n\nFirst, why is it called \"GOCCO OF WAR\" when the game's actual title, \"Global Online Chibi Combat Offensive\", while more of a mouthful, sounds less stupid than GOCCO OF WAR?\nSecond, why is the game purely co-operative, when it has the assets to create a pvp option as well? The game even has you shooting at other \"children\" during many of the 20... well, 23 stages. \nThird, why is this game so grindy? For a casual, non-pvp game, getting badges and creating weapons requires a large investment of time, moreso than games like Monster Hunter do. It's not even fun half the time, especially when you, as the player, realize that every enemy is in a fixed location, and the only variation between runs is the pattern in which the AI moves.\nFourth, Enemy AI can be cheated out if you stand on a lower ledge of thin platforms.\nFifth, If a gun has a long barrel(such a gatling gun), the player can clip the gun through thin walls and shoot enemies through them.\nSixth, Despite the game's many costumes, most of them are just recolors-- why not just make 100+ costumes that are unique and can be colored any way the player wishes, instead of having 300 costumes, 5 of which are recolors of the same costume, totalling less than the 100 individual ones overall?\n\nThe game is only as fun for as long as you are playing with friends or other people. GOCCO of war quickly becomes stale if you are playing it alone, unless you like grinding for costumes. Quests can be done solo or in a group, with enemies scaling to the amount of players present. Let's face it, though, will you really replay all the stages again without friends, unless you're grinding out specific mats? Highly unlikely.\n\nGOCCO has little replayability, which is why it has to be masked with endless grinding for S rank badges, materials, and money. Having played it for at least 35 hours, I feel it's fair enough for me to say something along those lines. Peakvox played it safe and made the game PVE only, which isn't a bad thing, but they had little updates. For a game centralized around PVE to have no meaningful updates, its death was sealed to be far earlier than most.\n\nHad there been a PVP option to GOCCO OF WAR, I assume that would have extended its lifespan by about a year or two, maybe more if it was secretly a hardcore game, but there is none. With the addition of PVP, the game would become a lot more toxic with infestations of upstuck memers and other unsavory personalities. That's a risk most companies must take if they wish for longevity for their game. Also, speaking from experience, the game can be pretty balanced pvp-wise, as there are solutions for everything-- every weapon type has its strengths and weaknesses. With minor balancing, GOCCO OF WAR could be very successful as a PVP game.\n\nAs it stands, GOCCO OF WAR is a ghost town-- much like the hidden lore to the game. As far as I remember, GOCCO OF WAR's setting takes place in [spoiler] a post-apocalyptic world, where there are many similar airtight structures that what's left of humanity reside in. Children are allowed to play to avert them of the harsh truth, as the game's many stages are virtual reality re-creations of many areas within the world's pre-catastrophic state[/spoiler]. Of course, I feel like I was reading too deeply into the things various NPCs have said, and it might not be that bleak, but hey... would be pretty cool, right?\n\nI'm giving this game a thumbs down, simply because the game's pricetag in comparison to its content and replayability just don't agree. The game's only about 10 hours tops if you take the time to grind a little for better equipment, but aside from that, it's incredibly short. For me, $1 means 1 hour of play, and asking me to play for 20 hours is really quite demanding. Fortunately, I had friends to play it with, and the game was pretty active when I was playing. Usually about 100 people on at any given time, even the late hours of night. Fortunately, I got this game on sale, so I definitely got my money's worth out of it... while it lasted.\n\nAnyway, TL:DR - The game's a literal ghost town, both in lore and in community. Don't play it unless you have a group of friends (1-3), or if you like mindless grinding for materials to make costumes and weapons that no one but yourself will admire anymore due to how empty the server(s) are.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503391966, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503391966, "recommendationid": "34411373", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499954", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507189721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19760, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 152686, "steamid": "76561198013515731", "num_games_owned": 569}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Gocco of war, not much to say about it. It's simple, Childish, Easy to learn, but takes time to get good at.\nThe game is based in a chibi universe where a corrupt company pit children to fight demon lords and other dangerous creatures.
