Figuring out just how to manipulate all of those boulders and such in order to get to where you want to go is a huge part of the game.  Most of the time, you can approach this at your own pace, and stop and think if you need to.  You dont need to rush.  And there are some gizmos you can buy that'll allow you to further manipulate the level in order to dig deeper, as sometimes the rocks will be piled up in such a way that you cant get by them by just pushing them or digging.  Learning to use these is an important part of the game, and it surprised me as to just how much they add to it.  Though I havent tried all of them yet.\n\nThere are though also some areas that will contain monsters... as you can probably guess, you dont want to touch these.  In those situations, you might have to be ready to move quickly, so you cant ALWAYS proceed at a slow pace.  You can take these guys out by dropping rocks on them, or use the laser gun, or you can try to block them into secluded areas.   Whatever you do, they are definitely a threat, so you need to be careful around them.\n\nWhich brings me to the other bit:  The game is PUNISHING.  This is a permadeath game.  You die, that's it, you lose.... no saving and reloading or any of that nonsense.  There IS a way to buy extra lives (called \"drones\" in-game), but they're very expensive, and you dont start out with any of them.  Most of the time, you get crushed by a boulder or something like that, and BAM, that's it, you're gone.  One hit KO!    And you will die.... over and over and over.  It's not uncommon to have a run that lasts like, 30 seconds.  Or to have one where you're deep in there, you've been going at it for an hour, going for the big points/money and then.... BAM, made a mistake, and rocks happened, and.... yeah, that's it.  There IS an \"easy\" mode, which I think does things a bit differently (havent tried it myself) but the game is really designed to be played in the normal way.   It definitely seems targeted towards the sort of player that enjoys things like roguelikes, or games like Spelunky with brutal difficulty, quick deaths, and having to start from the very beginning if you lose.\n\nAnd what really makes things interesting is that there's a definite \"greed\" aspect to the game.  This one really seems to be designed to be played for a high score... get as much money as you can before finishing (and of course there's a scoreboard to record your best scores, and there are \"daily\" runs to do as well).  ALL THE TIME, the game will be taunting you with shiny things that you definitely want, but that are in dangerous places, or areas that are hard to get to, or that appear downright inaccessible.  And so you'll go after these things (possibly with some equipment in hand), and you'll take the risk because you want the shiny things, and.... BAM!  Oops, you're dead.  But it's very satisfying to successfully get tons of things out of a dangerous area, particularly as you go deeper and deeper into the quarries.  \n\nThe screenshots in the store show what looks like just a single room/screen/board/whatever, but there's actually alot of them, and you'll have access to a bunch of them right from the start (by running off to the left or right at the top).  And there'll be passages that can then lead downwards into even more areas, provided you find a way to get there while not being dead.  So there's a ton of places to explore, and it's all randomly generated.\n\n\nAll in all, I'm so far very much enjoying this one.  I'm probably going to be playing this one pretty frequently... it's definitely my sort of game.  It wont be for everyone, as the difficulty will definitely turn some people away... but if you like the sorts of games that I do, if you like a challenge, and so on.... then definitely buy this one.
