Gameplay hasn't changed much in comparison (except the new bond abilities which are basically a more fleshed out special form of twincast) and it boils down to mostly more of the same. In the case of Final Fantasy IV, more of the same is actually quite good. Again, as with the base game, I would personally have preferred a HD upgrade to the original game instead of a port of the DS remake, as FF IV now stands out massively (and not necessarily in a good way) from all the other Final Fantasy titles.\n\nOn the plain technical side, the port is a good one, although it is very noticeably a mobile port due to the complete lack of any mouse support whatsoever.\n\nNot the best port, not the best version but still a great game deserving far more praise than the mixed reviews it is currently sitting at the the time of writing this review would suggest.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503143215, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503143215, "recommendationid": "34348737", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511514", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504139195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 479, "steamid": "76561198011848901", "num_games_owned": 226}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The worst Final Fantasy game on Steam.
