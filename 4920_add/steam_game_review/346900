Not even if I had gone out and bought a wilderbeast and kept it in my apartment; I love this game, and its reds in the bed successor.\n\nThe beauty and fun of a well made clicker is what makes it seem so wrong, namely the simplicity. Click here, see a number incrementally rise over there. Work towards buying another of that item or, if the time's right, buying your first of the next, more lucrative item.\n\nNow I'm sure most of you already know that - it's not your first clickeo, right?\n\nWhere I think AdCap really stands out from the massive clicker herd is the fact that it's grounded in a kind of semi-reality setting. All you're doing is scratching that dirty capitalist itch, that desire to ACQUIRE; those fellas from Star Trek with the ears and the libido would LOVE AdCap.\n\nI played the game for a while before I realised I was rubbish at it. Seriously, I was clicking in all the wrong places at all the wrong times. I only really found this out when I took part in one of the \"events\".\n\nEvents take place every few weeks or so and are a way to turn your enjoyment of the game into something else altogether. Before my first event I had the game running in the background as I did something else on the PC, dipping in and out of the game to spend my earnings acquired whilst I was away, having a mad couple of minutes clicking away if I was close to being able to afford a large purchase.\n\nOnce I joined my first event, this little now and then distraction turned into a full blown obsession....for a little while anyway. I quickly realised that I was falling so far behind so many players in the massively multiplayer clickfest and became disheartened(aw, poor me). \n\nI already knew that you could buy your way to faster success with items purchased from the in-game shop that would boost your earning, substantially in some instances. \n\nSo, I stopped bothering with the event and put my abject failure down to the fact that others were shelling out REAL money(that'll be the narcissism kicking in) to aid in their quest for AdCap Cap, if you know what I mean. Now there was no way I was going to pay to increase the speed numbers tick up on a page....OK, that's a lie; truth be known, I nearly did put my hand in my pocket. So I stopped bothering about the event and carried on with the other parts of the game, the solo, neverending parts.\n\nA few weeks later and another event rolled around. This time there was an added part to the event that wasn't in the solo game(each event is constructed so that it modifies in some way the route to success, it's pretty clever) and I wasn't quite sure how it worked, so I took a look at the discussions and what I saw nearly blew my red braces off(Wall St, anyone?).\n\nContained within were discussions centred around mathematical theories and strategies for the fastest growth rate. I had honestly never considered AdCap in any kind of intellectually advanced way; I just clicked, bought, clicked, bought, got to where I could earn whilst AFK and repeated in the main. WHAT A DUMMY!\n\nWhilst the main solo games are less focused on a need to maximise growth rate, and thus don't NEED an in-depth analysis of the best route to success, the beauty of the events lies in both their time-limited and competitive nature. Couple this with the fact that each one modifies the game's economic mechanics in a different way and you have a wonderful platform for planning and refining your strategy as you go. This is further added to by the fact that you don't know exactly how the game has been modified when you start an event and there's an early part where you are clicking and observing the effect, noting it for further enhancement of your strategy. It's great fun.....even if you lose, which I did....always!\n\nSo, I haven't explained how the game works and what the features are, the different things you can buy etc...and I'm not going to. I wanted to explain to you how the game sucks you in, rewards you for smart play and punishes you for being an economic dummy. I want you to discover the features that combine to create a game that will make you think and plan ahead, mostly in the events.\n\nTry it out....after all, it is free.....which is odd when you consider it's all about boshing for dosh or being keen for the green. And don't be put off by the fact that you can purchase ways to enhance your progress; you can do just fine without, so long as you think about it and don't dismiss it as a pay to win game alone.\n\nOh, and have fun.......go on, have a click or three.\n\n* See, THAT'S how much I enjoyed playing this game....I didn't really have to admit anything, yet here I am spilling all my shameful secrets(well, some) in public just to give AdCap its fair dues.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486242570, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486242944, "recommendationid": "29703205", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563465", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487731541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10679, "steamid": "76561198042138832", "num_games_owned": 175}, "votes_funny": 26, "votes_up": 29, "comment_count": "2", "review": "It only took me 177 hours over the course of a year to complete........\n\n\n\n\n[i] I Feel Empty Inside \t[/i]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487731928, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487731928, "recommendationid": "30091605", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554060", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486583347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 210, "steamid": "76561198030469825", "num_games_owned": 77}, "votes_funny": 15, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Hire managers, come back next year, you're rich", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485683622, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485683622, "recommendationid": "29560367", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515869", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496887787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 8157, "steamid": "76561198208293628", "num_games_owned": 221}, "votes_funny": 11, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is like crack", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487926282, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487926282, "recommendationid": "30136696", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526503", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500406128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3587, "steamid": "76561197993068582", "num_games_owned": 606}, "votes_funny": 8, "votes_up": 33, "comment_count": "4", "review": "I have played so many hours and spent so many dollars in AdVenture Capitalist. It is, frankly, ridiculous. And, yet, before today... I have always [i] loved it[/i]. I opened it up with excitement and I would [i]throw[/i] my energy at clicking those lemon stands and newspaper routes, getting to the point where I could afford managers and upgrades... Later, strategizing for the holiday events and admiring the art of my character's trophy room, expanding onto the different planets, and on and on. It's an idle game, a time sink, a clicker, an incremental whatever-you-want-to-call-it. But, it was pure. AdVenture Capitalist was fun. Would I have recommended that game? Absolutely! Take a shot, try it out, enjoy the intermittent hits of dopamine. \n\nNot anymore...\n\nNow? Now, it seems to be devolving, developing down to the despicable industry standard for mobile game apps. Innovativeness, gameplay, creativity all take a backseat to psychological manipulation. So, the in-app purchases have been there for a while, and, yes, I have spent a pretty dollar. Those made me uneasy, at first, but I grew accustomed, I became habituated to the shop and I got over it. What I cannot stand is the blatantly addictive features. Features such as 'daily gifts' that get better the more days of the week you check in, the brand new wheel spins to collect a prize for purchasing an upgrade, in-app purchases that unlock the next level of spending (Oh, you're wiling to put down $1 on a 3x multiplier? Well, once you've bought that, we'll offer you a great deal on a 9x multiplier, then a 27x, then a 100x!!!), card drops that expand with approximately every $9 spent on the game, all act to increase your playtime, your investment into it. Seeing as such addiction-promoting changes continue to be implemented in this game, I see it as moving in the wrong direction and can no longer recommend it.\n\nIt's a shame. From what I've seen in the art and the writing for this game, it's evidence of a knack for humor. The developers seem to truly enjoy what they're making. \n\nWhen I play a game, I want to simply enjoy it. I want to game to gently romance me into playing often and being thorough with my examination of its features and mechanics. I do not want it to hit me over the head with features that demand I play more often, that remove the challenge of the game, forcing upon my brain a dump of dopamine that leaves me feeling spent, my brain chemistry abused by the reward mechanics. Even the steam achievements available, they are not rewards when it comes to this game. They are not signals of success nor badges of accomplishment. They are bandages covered in pretty pictures, bandages given by the game developers to cover the unreal amounts of time and/or money spent by players, the victims of AdVenture Capitalism.\n\n\nOh, hold up, lemme see what this new event looks like...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487887216, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487887844, "recommendationid": "30128262", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528628", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506792428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 2008, "steamid": "76561198121992725", "num_games_owned": 33}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Earn money, click buttons..... literally being a sell out.\n\n\nSo, apparently this game is owned by everyone and their mother, it's not bad, not bad at all but the achievements for this game are quite difficult to achieve if you know what I mean.
