Since it's only 5 bucks, the screenshots look cool, I had some money to spare, and I happen to be a zombie fan, I couldn't resist. All I can say is, don't waste your money. Don't be fooled by the screenshots. This is one of those games that exists solely to prove that appearances can be deceiving. \n\nFirst off, the optimization is atrocious. I have a decent, mid-range pc that can run games like crysis and far cry 3 at a nice framerate at high-very high settings. With this game, I cranked up all the settings and was unpleasantly surprised to be met by a choppy, unstable, and nausia-inducing framerate that never manages to go past 35 frames per second. The game isn't exactly a looker either (despite what the screenshots may suggest) so performance this terrible is simply inexcusable. Flat textures everywhere, horrifically stiff animations, a terrible draw distance, you get the idea.The only thing that looks mildly good is the guns. Now, I understand this is just a small indie game, but that doesn't excuse quality this poor. The graphics don't bother me as much as the horrendous performance (even on low settings). \n\nBut as bad as the performance and graphics are, the gameplay could be solid enough to save the game right? Wrong! Combat is split up in melee and gunplay. You start off with a melee weapon and must kill zombies to get money and find spots where you can buy guns. The problem here is that the combat (both melee and guns) is flatter than a pancake. There is no sense of impact to the melee combat and the enemy ai is easily exploited. You can just run backwards and swat mindlessly at the zombies (one by one) to kill them with one blow to the head. Even the Walking Dead Survival Instinct had better melee combat and ai. The gunplay is arguably better, but that doesn't make it good. That's like saying a gunshot wound to the stomach hurts less than a gunshot wound to the crotch. To make matters worse, every single time you fire the gun, the framerate goes to the single digits. This means that if you have a small group of zombies attacking and you're just wildly firing an assault rifle, the framerate might just force you into a vomit fit. \n\nSound wise, it's... average. The zombie sounds are all right, but the melee and gunfire sounds are unsatisying.\n\nPros:\nA few decent sound effects.\nGuns have a nice look to them due to shading.\n\nCons:\nTerrible combat\nNo tension\nTedious weapon system\nInsanely bad optimization \nPoor visuals\nCosts money\nTerrible combat\nIt'll waste a few of your hard-earned dollars\nYou'll hate yourself after playing it.\nTerrible combat\nSound design is mostly lacking\nDid I mention the terrible combat?\n\nBottom line: STAY AWAY. If you want good zombie survival games check out left 4 dead 2, dead island, and dying light. Don't waste money on this game until the dev gives it a major overhaul (if that day ever comes).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429396264, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429410731, "recommendationid": "15439123", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491592287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 39, "steamid": "76561198018231784", "num_games_owned": 575}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Not good game, it has awkward controls and other glitches, but I play it once in a new moon.
