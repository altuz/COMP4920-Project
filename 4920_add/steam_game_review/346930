There's no base-building here, instead, points are allocated pre-mission to spend on units.  For people who have only played the Total War games, battle tactics here are similar, though instead of large squads, units are singular.  The way units support and counter each other, places heavy emphasis on formations/spacing, facing, and micro - through the use of well-timed tactics, a small force can take down armies, or just as easily destroy itself in an instant with friendly fire. Every casualty is felt through buckets of blood and gibs. \n\nOn top of its Myth core, Deadhold has integrated a levelling/loot/customization/unlock layer to coop PVE.  So now it's an RTT/RPG.  Finding new loot to try new builds with makes replaying missions and challenge modes more fun, where more risk=more reward.  Don't worry though, PVP remains a \"pure\" Myth experience with an even playing field.\n\nUpdates are slow, glacially slow, though this could be attributed to the fact that the devs have day jobs.  Apparently the game's already been in development for several years prior to early-access; they're in this for the long haul.\n\nTotal War, World in Conflict, Ground Control - all these games share similarities as they exist in the RTT genre, but Myth's combat remains a unique, bloody, visceral experience, and nothing's come as close to matching it as Deadhold.\n\nSolid investment.\n\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505239794, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505239794, "recommendationid": "34905939", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 19, "total_reviews": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
