It's the last of the three current games I played, and by far my favourite of the bunch. But it still has some serious problems.\n\nThe story: Your foster father sends you a message begging you to return to Hong Kong to help him in some undisclosed way. The intro makes it clear that he's in serious danger of some sort, and no matter how you choose your character to be disposed towards the man, you do return to Hong Kong. Your adoptive brother and his girlfriend await you, and at the designated meeting point, you are met with a group of Shadowrunners. Then a sniper shoots half of you and you have to escape to the sewers. From then, it's a long story of getting in the good books of a local triad boss named Kindly Cheng (who is about as pleasant as a devil rat down the trousers), doing a lot of runs, recruiting new, very curious party members and finding out where your father is and what the big looming plot behind it all is.\nWhile the actual intro is a bit weaker than those of the other games, the story from then on is the most well executed in my opinion. The biggest two factors? Cast of characters, and mission variety. Hong Kong continues the trend from Dragonfall to have a small group of dedicated characters under your management, with the other runners you can hire in being entirely optional. Though the casts in the other two games were already very good, this one is the most intriguing to me. I won't give away their stories here, but suffice it to say that it's colourful. \nAs for mission variety - I am happy to say that not every single mission involves a shootout with the police now! My dislike of the combat structure in the other games has gone well documented in my other reviews, and there was a point late in the game where the combat became grueling to me once more, but it was much later and to a much smaller extent than in Dragonfall. The runs you can go on now stretch from crime scene investaigations with entirely avoidable combat to fighting ghouls and goblins in a museum cellar, like in that one movie, just with more violence. It's refreshing, and it never gets as stale and repetitive as it did in Dragonfall. The second-to-last mission was especially great, but saying any more would be spoilery, so I shan't.\n\nSadly, though, there is one big negative I have to mention - I encountered a couple of bugs that forced me to replay certain sections. In one particular instance, meeting a group of NPCs under the wrong circumstances made it impossible to complete the mission because they wouldn't hand you a necessary item. It was frustrating to say the least. A little bit more playtesting wouldn't have gone amiss.\n\nAll in all though, despite the bug problem, Shadowrun: Hong Kong is easily the best of the Shadowrun Returns franchise. With this level of quality, I sincerely hope that it won't be the last.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506639544, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506639544, "recommendationid": "35275579", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505013139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 658, "steamid": "76561197980323443", "num_games_owned": 82}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "OK this game is a strange one for me, I recently completed the Shadowrun: Dragonfall (SR:DF) game and cant help but compare it to Hong Kong.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the start of this game with the moody music and beautiful scenery and artwork. The game-play felt a little different from SR:DF, but I can't quite put my finger on it. However, very quickly the walls of text are often encroaching on the game-play, and sometimes repeatedly interrupting a run several times. I didn't feel this happened in SR:DF, which had a tighter story and mission structure.\n\nThe engine feels more 'laggy' and takes longer to load than SR:DF, which was disappointing. The combat engine also takes longer to complete actions and sometimes stutters after making moves or shooting, again disappointing (this game came out 1 year after right?).\n\nCombat in this game is a downgrade to SR:DF, with respects to difficulty and challenge \u2013 it is very easy and almost completes itself. The only slight challenge for me was maybe one matrix fight, other than that I didn't fail any mission or battle. Not sure why this is a thing, SR:DF seemed to have a pretty good handle on the balance.\n\nThe matrix system got a few changes, but I can't really say it was an improvement. The hacking mini-game was interesting enough. Also, shopping in this game felt a little bit more convoluted, perhaps having always upgraded equipment made the game easier, not sure.\n\nThe writing quality is poorer than the previous game, and there is just more dialogue. The shame is that I had almost no interest in any of it. I didn't really like many of the characters in this game, apart from 'Aunty' (an NPC). The side-missions were interesting and well put together, but the main story was just a flop in my view.\n\nCompleted the game in 9 hours, don't really see replay value here at all other than achievement hunting. Recommend only for the same reason as SR:DF, there aren't enough isometric RPG games, this isn't perfect but also far from a disaster. However not recommend because it lags, takes ages to load maps, is too easy and has poorer writing, story and characters than Dragonfall.
