The designers had a great idea but the visual style really turned me off; I couldn't ignore that every asset in the game looks like bad clipart from a free Windows 95 MS Paint clone. I only played a dozen levels before my eyes couldn't take it anymore, too bad it might have been a fun game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498681552, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498681552, "recommendationid": "32956538", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501993", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
