There's the ability to design your own plays, run specific ones, or just say \"Hey, PG, shoot a 3 this time.\" However, just like coaches have to deal with, the players won't always react how you want.

It has times where it is fun and an enjoyable challenge but those are too few for me to recommend this game. The devil is in the details they say and the details is what kills this game (besides the repeated crashes and bad game engine). Let me give some examples...\n\nThe satisfaction of fans and the directors is ridiculously maddening with its nonsense. Fan satisfaction is changed by either win/loss streaks of 5+ games or winning/losing by 15+ points. So if you win 5 straight games then lose 4 straight games and rinse and repeat the fans will be more pleased by this than if you take a bad team and win 4 games and lose 1 (but not getting you that 5 game win streak) and get a much better record at the end of the season. \n\nThe directors are even worse. They will usually give you a goal at the start of a season and there have been times where I have far exceeded the goal and won playoffs series and even won a title with an awful team (example: I just beat the Cavaliers who had three 5 star players with a mediocre 76ers team in an epic series and I got fired after the series halfway through the playoffs. No organization would fire a coach midplayoffs especially one that just had a massive David vs Goliath victory).\n\nAnother example of the details killing this gme is when my star NBA player on my team would miss 3 out of every 4 layups on a fast break. This is just so unrealistic that it hurts to watch. These are the best players in the world doing the most basic basketball move and just clunking it. How? How is this possible? How do Blake Griffin and Lebron James not know how to do something that a JV benchwarmer who spends the entire season polishing the pine with his bottom can with regularity.\n\nMany people have gone into how bad the game engine is and how often the game crashes (I just stopped playing the games at one point and simmed the seasons because I was sick of it crashing) so I will not go into that part.\n\nI wish I could give this game a more favorable review and be ready for this game to make you want to tear your hair out if you purchase it.
