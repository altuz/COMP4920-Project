Getting PAW sound to work in DOSBox could be a real bear.\n\nSo, for the game itself:\n\nThis is a an old classic for Microprose game collectors, old flight-sim grogs (like myself), and the like.  As with all of these retro releases, there is very little here that modern gamers or folks not fond of this genre will find interesting.  (Truth be told, however, I'd rather fly this old sim than, say, later efforts such as MSCFS 2 or Pacific Fighters!)  But for the graphics -- which are that lovely mid-90's smear of big textured pixels -- PAW's flight model is surprisingly good (if actually a little too punishing), the enemy AI is challenging, and there are many scenarios to choose from.\n\nHighly recommended with the caveats I've mentioned above.\n\n(Note: use CTRL-F12 to increase the DOSBox cycles -- 3000 isn't nearly enough!)\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427993741, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427993741, "recommendationid": "15171747", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645517", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437425248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 86, "steamid": "76561198047597918", "num_games_owned": 563}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This can be conciderd a hidden gem(?)\n\nFor the age of this simulator i am going to have to say it is actually quite realistic.\nYou can change the difficulty from limmited ammo to your pilot getting blinded by the sun.\nAlso the A.I are suburb. enemy pilots are quite a challenge and difficult to shoot. ships also try to avoid you when you are getting close to them!

I bought this one for .94 cents.  Which means, I can't complain.  When this game came out I was in my mid 20's.  And, I loved it.  For that time, it was cutting edge WWII fun.  I don't know why more sims aren't covering this genre and theater of war.  The Yorktown, Enterprise and Hornet...against Akagi, Kaga, Hiyru and Soryu.  Sorry if I tore those spellings up Japan.  But I loved this game.  So, when I downloaded I thought that I would get the same buzz I did off it in 94-95.  And......drum roll.....well, I didn't.  Its fun to poke around in the game.  But you have to realize this is a 55mb game.  They did allot back then, but you have to remember we were still loading with 1.33mb floppies.  Compressed this was a 5 disk load!  Graphics set u back, thats the main thing, its just not fun because of it.  It's like looking through a fish bowl.  So buy the game for a buck and tool around for nostalgia's sake, but don't get it if your expecting IL-2 pacific wars graphics...but the campaign is better than IL2!!
