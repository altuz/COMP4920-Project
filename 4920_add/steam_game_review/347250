Plus we were both generally nerds in every sense of the word. He used to come over to my house and I'd load this up on my old 386. He wasn't very good at flying with a joystick, and since this game has so many keyboard commands (seriously, download and print out a keyboard guide off the net if you want to play this), he'd run tactical/nav with the keyboard and I'd pilot.\n\nWe got fairly good, where we were playing on Veteren difficulty. We'd racked up a few medals, earned some ranks, and since we thought we were superheroes, we decided to go for the highest score possible. We loaded up with the best missiles we could find and set out. Our goal was to not only destroy the primary and secondary objectives, but take out any targets of opportunity we came across.\n\nWe did, we spent every single missile and every single bullet, taking out tanks, convoys, bridges, SAM sites, enemy fighters, airports, you name it. By the time we were done we were completely out of fuel and ammo. We had to coast in for a landing, but we made it! Then the debriefing screen, then the ranks and medals. We got at least 4 or 5 medals on that mission, including the Congressional Medal of Honor! We were screaming, we thought that was the coolest thing ever. And still, 25 years later, we talk about that epic mission.\n\nWell, I'm happy to report that this game still works perfectly. I have a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, it got picked up and works fine. I downloaded a keyboard shortcut sheet off the internet and sent my friend a picture of it, said \"Hey, I have a working copy of this, wanna play?\" 10 minutes later he's at the house with a few beers, we fired the game up, and, well... it wasn't quite just like riding a bike. But a few missions later and we were stomping heads just like old times, it was great!\n\nThis game has a full damage model, with various info screens you can switch to. You can get a camera view of your target, or you can look at your fuel/waypoints, you can check damage, look at mission objectives, and that's all on the right screen. The left screen lets you switch between a nav map and a radar. In the middle is your radar signature. The filled area at the bottom is how much signature you're giving off, then you can see radar pings coming down from the top. Red bars are ground radar and blue bars are air radar.\n\nThe goal is to stay low and slow enough to keep your signature down, sneak in, take out the targets, and sneak out. It's very tense and satisfying. Maybe there's a SAM site pinging hard, and it's causing a lot of problems for you. There's nothing quite like taking out that monster with a sneak attack before it sees you. If someone does get a ping on you, you'll start getting notifications like \"F-5 taking off from such and such airbase\" as they scramble jets to look for you. Watch out for the F-4's, they have mean radar capabilities.\n\nSo yeah, pick this up. They don't make games like this any more. Horrific graphics aside, this is still one of the best flight sims ever made!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496593740, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496593740, "recommendationid": "32180039", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
