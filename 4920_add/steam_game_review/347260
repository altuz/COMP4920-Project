For me, the immersion of the game is very good and I can get hooked playing it for long periods of time.  Before playing the game, make sure that you learn all of the keyboard controls, this is not a game that can be played entirely with the mouse.  Also, you will need to use the game's manual, which can be found on steam, to get past the copy protection screen when you load the game.  If you skip this step the copy protection will freeze the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494085803, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494085920, "recommendationid": "31583894", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501744", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
