While as a retro-gamer you might be thrilled to see this again, be warned that it's EXACTLY the original game stuck in a DOSbox shell. So no changes or extra's. That means you STILL get the configuration screen each time you start the game AND the squadron selection screen that requires you to look up the correct answer in the original manual, which obviously is not provided with this Steam release. Luckily it can be found online (here for instance: http://www.scribd.com/doc/39494458/Knights-of-the-Sky#scribd). If you didn't know that you'd be stuck with just playing the demo version, even though you paid full price for it. You will also need the manual to look up the controls and be reminded of the fact that you CAN actually skip a lot of tedious flying time by pressing alt-A. \n\nWhile the game was brilliant in its time and still fun to play if you look past the outdated graphics, you might want to wait for a steam sale to buy this at a more reasonable price or maybe dig up your old floppies and manual of this game from the attic instead.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456305299, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456305299, "recommendationid": "21421299", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547011", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444173169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 41, "steamid": "76561198047597918", "num_games_owned": 563}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Okay, this is a funny, simple flying simulator game.\nIt's not a 10/10 simulator but it is a good way to spend the time, no engine sounds, but a accordeon sound whenever you increase trottle. \nAlso a killcam!

Its not a smooth game and flying using the keyboard is better than using the mouse, also your plane and enemy planes will get shot down with the barest of shots. To make up for this though, there are a good number of enemy planes in missions and also they are pretty relentless in maneuvring to get on your tail .\n\nThe game has a campaign which is kind of dynamic in that the missions vary and you seem to be competing with other pilots for becoming the most renown.
