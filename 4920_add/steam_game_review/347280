The art in this game is astoundingly well developed.  It wordlessly creates a lot of ambience as you fly your way through abandoned playgrounds and discarded remnants of civilization as a new dawn approaches a terrible day...\n\nYou play a freaking bird with laser weapons.  If you're still reading this, you want this game.  It's hard.  Quite hard, but it can be enjoyed in bursts of 10 minutes or a whole rage inducing hour.  The controls are extremely tight, and the weapons and enemies are all interesting.  My favorite are the basic enemies, which I call the \"Dental Association\" as they chomp me to bits.\n\nIf you're still deciding, don't mistake the vehemence of angry gamers for the markings of a genuinely bad product.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499060262, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499060670, "recommendationid": "33168866", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502633", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
