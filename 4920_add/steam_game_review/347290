Sadly it isn't. For all the things[b][i]\"Rise & Shine\"[/i][/b] gets right, it bungles it all away with repetitive and frustrating gameplay that eventually starts to border on pure sadism except that here there is no gratification waiting at the end of it. [b][i]\"Rise & Shine\"[/i][/b] is a short game (probably around 3 hours of content) artificially inflated by its frustrating difficulty. Try and play this one with a mouse and keyboard and not want to rape and pillage a small village by the end of it all.  By the time I had reached the end of [b][i]\"Rise & Shine\"[/i][/b] I was hating it with every fiber of my being.
