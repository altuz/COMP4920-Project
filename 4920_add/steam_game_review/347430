It appears to tick all the boxes for a decent HOG so it's not a bad game per se, but it lacks heart and originality in order to become more than 'just okay'. The story is thin and clich\u00e9d, there's no character depth and puzzles are often too easy or not much fun. I would only recommend [i]Frankenstein: Master of Death[/i] to people who are HOG or puzzle game afficionados and don't mind playing a title that will offer a quick fix but nothing more.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\n[i]Frankenstein: Master of Death[/i] is a HOG, so there's your typical 'point and click adventure game'-style gameplay where you collect items and use them on objects in the game world in order to advance. And then there's a lot of puzzle-solving, including the genre's typical 'hidden objects puzzles' (HOP) that show you a scene cluttered with objects and require you to spot specific items in that scene.\n \nThe HOPs of [i]Frankenstein: Master of Death[/i] are of average quality. On the one hand, the HOPs are a bit more challenging than they were in [i]Dracula's Legacy[/i], another HOG by Jetdogs Studios I played recently. On the other hand, again you're shown a list of only four objects at a time to look for and again the 'hidden' objects are huge, making the HOPs mostly very easy.\n\nThe same goes for the other puzzles, actually: they are a bit more challenging than the puzzles of [i]Dracula's Legacy[/i] but most of them are still very easy. \n\nAnother thing that influences gameplay in a bad way is that the game's English is rather bad. Sometimes you're not sure what the game wants you to look for because it's described inaccurately e.g. a pocket watch is called 'clocks' and a deer is called 'cow'.\n\nUnlike most other HOGs, the tools and multi-purpose items that you pick up in [i]Frankenstein: Master of Death[/i] stay in your inventory for a long time because they're needed again much later on in the game. This seems like a good thing at first but soon it's clear this often makes the game completely illogical and it causes you to try every tool on every object that you clearly need to use 'something' on to advance. A few examples to clarify what I mean:\n[list]\n[*] You need to remove an item from behind a broken mirror. You have all sorts of items that could shatter the mirror (crowbar, saw, screwdriver, garden shears) but you need to find an iron glove to do the job instead.\n[*] You need to get into an 'iron cabinet' and a metal box. You have a crowbar, a metal cutting saw and a pickaxe but to no avail. Turns out you need a blowtorch.\n[*] You need to get items from a locked cabinet\u2026 that has glass windows! You have a crowbar and a pickaxe that could easily shatter the glass but no, you need to find the handle to open the cabinet and take the items.\n[*] You need to get to an item but a bat is in the way so you need to scare it away. Crowbar, knife, iron glove, pickaxe, hatchet, \u2026 all of these are of no use to get rid of one single bat. Come on! No, you need to find a camera and use its flashlight to scare off the bat.\n[*] You need to remove a thin layer of plaster from a safe. Crowbar, knife, pickaxe won't do, of course. You need a spatula.\n[/list]\n\nThere are a few strange design choices worth mentioning, too:\n[list]\n[*] Before starting the game, you need to decide whether you'll play on Easy Mode or Hard Mode, but you don't get any explanation at all what the difference between the two modes is. \n[*] While playing, there's a toggle button that allows you to fix the UI. I played with this option switched on for a while. During that time, each of the HOPs and each of the other puzzles had an essential piece of the puzzle tucked away behind the buttons of the UI, so in practice playing with this 'fix UI' option switched on isn't an option after all.\n[/list]\n\nI also encountered three bugs while playing [i]Frankenstein: Master of Death[/i]:\n[list]\n[*] Five minutes into the game, I couldn't close any of the pop-up windows anymore. Restarting the game fixed the issue. \n[*] There's one spot in the game where the mouse pointer doesn't change like it always does when you hover over an interactable object. I had to find this spot by using the Hint button. Maybe people who play on Easy Mode won't encounter this problem, as interactable objects will most likely have sparkles. \n[*] Something is wrong with the game's mouse pointer as both picking up pieces of a puzzle and putting them down is hard to accomplish.\n[/list]\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n \nYou're a friend of Victor Frankenstein and his wife Elizabeth. When you arrive at the Frankenstein estate, you find out that Baron Igor has been abusing Frankenstein's experiments for his own twisted goals. You need to find Victor and Elizabeth to make sure they're okay, and you need to stop Igor at all cost.\n\nThis is the story of [i]Frankenstein: Master of Death[/i]. There's no more. And yet this entire story is found in the game's description, so it's not like I spoiled it here.\n\nSo the story of [i]Frankenstein: Master of Death[/i] is paper-thin. Also, all the characters have very few lines of dialogue, so there is no character depth at all. \n\n[h1]Graphics and sound[/h1]\n \n[i]Frankenstein: Master of Death[/i]'s static graphics look fine. The character models don't look very impressive, though. They're reminiscent of how characters looked in late 1990s to early 2000s games. \n \nThe music is a bit bombastic but it's atmospheric and it fits the B-movie setting of the game. The sound effects are decent. The voice acting varies from mediocre to bad.\n \n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n \n[i]Frankenstein: Master of Death[/i] has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.\n \nOf the 20 Steam Achievements, 14 are story-related and unmissable. The remaining 6 achievements are awarded for various optional tasks like completing the game on hard difficulty mode, not skipping puzzles, and so on. Be warned that one achievement, called [i]Expert[/i] is only awarded after the end credits have rolled. If you skip the end credits, you won't get the achievement and you can only get to the end credits again by playing through the whole game all over.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504368785, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504368876, "recommendationid": "34689188", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516347", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502197160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 811, "steamid": "76561197970566223", "num_games_owned": 702}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Hoarders: The game\n\nIf something is not nailed down, pick it up, you WILL need it.
