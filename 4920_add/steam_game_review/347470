Buy it.\nEspecially good party game.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nMayan Death Robots takes the Artillery genre of video games and gives it some much appreciated innovation.  Like other artillery games, the basic structure of Mayan Death Robots centers around a turn of selecting a weapon, and then aiming it, relying on the players sense of trajectory to land hits on the opponent's side to accomplish a goal.\n\nWorms is perhaps the series best known for popularizing the artillery genre, but Mayan Death Robots is a distinctly different kind of game from Worms, and it's important to know that in advance.  I'll briefly explain the differences, and why they're important.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nAction Artillery Games vs Strategic Artillery Games\n\n\nIn worms and other artillery games, combat is far more Strategic rather than Action based.  In those games, turns last longer, involve a combination of moving, weapon selection, and shooting.  Players take alternating turns, and a game might last upwards of half-an-hour or more.\n\nMayan Death Robots is more of an Action Artillery game instead of a Strategic Artillery game.  The goal isn't to blow up the opponent, but rather the opponent's core.  Losing your robot essentially equates to a one turn penalty.  This prevents games from being too short, and is more forgiving to players whom make mistakes when learning their robot.\n\nIn MDR, players take their turns at the same time, and turns are fast.  Players get six seconds to make their weapon (or jump, or blocks) selection, and then six seconds to aim it.  Weapons fire automatically at the end of those six seconds.  The fast pace of turns can be slightly daunting to new players at first, but it's easy to adjust to because Weapon selection is very streamlined.\n\nAlthough there are a lot of weapons in the game, each robot is essentially limited to two signature attacks, so you're rarely pressed to make a tough decision during those first six seconds.  That design decision means that the individual matches can be fast but not stressful.  A match usually only lasts between five and ten minutes, so it's really easy for casual players to get in to, yet rewarding for more hardcore players whom want to practice and master each robot's unique combat style.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nMultiplayer Friendly\n\n\nThe single biggest issue facing MDR has to do with the lack of online multiplayer.  One has to keep in mind that Sileni Studios is a tiny team, and simply put it'd be grossly unfair to hold them to the same standards as Team 17 which has a ton of corporate backing to fund a plethora of features.  But still, it is an issue because obviously if you buy a game like this, you're going to want to play it with friends.\n\nThat being said, the game has robust support for local Multiplayer, allowing for two players to use the same keyboard, a keyboard and gamepad, or two gamepads.\n\nAnd it's seriously fun.\nSeriously.\n\nThis would hands down be a terrific College Dorm game for whenever friends are hanging out.  The fast pace of the game makes it easy for two players to play a match, and then have the loser hand the controller or keyboard off to the next person waiting in line.  And the sheer hilarity of the visuals and action in game make it ridiculously fun for spectators to watch.\n\nFor the last few weeks I've played this game with my friends and their kids, switching out the players every match, and it felt like the beautiful nostalgia of video gaming from back when I was in college, passing a controller around whenever typical two-player games were played with an audience of three or more.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nSingle Player Friendly\n\n\nIn addition, the solo player campaign is bonkers cool.  There's a great over-the-top storyline about the Death Robots galactic TV show, and all the insanity that ensues.  There are soooo many different scenarios in the game to be unlocked, from maps where Conquistadors constantly attempt to steal your cores, to Elder Gods that dramatically reshape the map, to man-eating plants.  Combined with the ten different playstyles of the robots, the game packs a ton of replayability.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nIn Closing\n\n\nHands down, for the price, there is a ton of entertainment one can get out of this game.  It's my hope that online multiplayer will be added in the future, but in the meantime there's no real reason to short change yourself by passing over such a well-developed and designed game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452614975, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452614975, "recommendationid": "20489201", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502653", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448311022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 94, "steamid": "76561198072029025", "num_games_owned": 12}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Love this game.
