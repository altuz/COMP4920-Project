A few level design hangups, but otherwise it's a fun distraction. Format is very similar to the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/342580/]12 Labours of Hercules[/url] or [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/338980/]MOAI[/url] series, with a difficulty somewhere between the two. Requires more strategy than 12 Labours, but not edge-of-your-seat frantic like MOAI. Easy to 100%.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThere are two difficulties - Relaxed (zen) and Challenge (timed), but they may as well be separate games. Despite the maps being identical, cleared levels don't carry over between them, so even if you beat Challenge you will have to start from the beginning on Relaxed. Achievements [i]only[/i] unlock in Challenge mode.\n\nGameplay is smooth, but level design is messy. The maps look great at first, but it becomes tough to plan out routes. What you think is a path may not be a path at all, or is blocked by an obstacle halfway across the map. You'll also need to queue smartly if you want to get Expert times. Fortunately there are multiple ways to reach objectives, especially if you make good use of bonus items. \n\nBonus item pickups are randomly chosen from a list that you unlock through a handful of rather bland hidden object scenes. If you don't see the bonus(es) you want at the start of a level, just restart it for a new random pick. The RNG factor is kind of a neat idea though, because it can push you to come up with entirely different strategies.\n\nAside from the HOs, Legends also incorporates a simple ball-drop match-3 minigame. It's only a few levels though (one per 'world' like the HOs), and an acceptable way to change up the pace.\n\n[h1]Other Stuff[/h1]\nThe music is a terribly repetitive pan flute tune. I had to play with it turned off.\n\nAchievements are super easy, and you'll probably end up with most or all of them before you even beat the game (there isn't one for beating the game, surprisingly).\n\nThe only bug I encountered was a small one in a single level (the one with the portal) where one worker was stuck idling even though there were actions queued. Restarting the level fixed it.\n\nAs far as replay value, unless you're going back to get top scores on everything, I suppose you can count the completely separate-but-identical Zen and Challenge modes. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nDespite a hiccup or two, Legends of Atlantis is still a fun time management game that can hold its own next to the bigger titles, especially when it comes to difficulty. If you found 12 Labours too easy and MOAI too hard, this should be just right for you. Definitely worth a play if you're a fan of the genre.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1470710143, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1470805087, "recommendationid": "24786893", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501160", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484092007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 417, "steamid": "76561198303271437", "num_games_owned": 200}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A really nice game that I enjoyed playing!
