This one kinda reminds me of 4 Elements because you match by clicking, holding down the mouse button, and dragging it through all the gems of the same color that are by each other.  There are occasional hidden object puzzles where you have to find little pieces of an object that are scattered throughout a scene.  \n\nThere is also some town building.  You get gold after each match 3 level and use it to buy buildings.  There is a choice of 3 different types of buildings with increasing cost.  I don't know what that's all about yet.  So far I've just been choosing the cheapest buildings.  For instance, first you build a house and they give you 3 options of housing.  The more expensive ones have more decoration.  I don't know if they do anything else.\n\nAnd of course there are power ups in the match 3 levels.  There's a lightning icon that will destroy all the gems and things in a line, sometimes a straight line and sometimes diagonal.  There's rope and stone blocks that need to be destroyed before more gems can fall.  There's a wing icon that reveals hidden parts of the board.  Gems and treasure chests that give you more gold!\n\nI will update as I play more.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426335857, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1426335857, "recommendationid": "14881521", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557467", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501167705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3069, "steamid": "76561198065576382", "num_games_owned": 180}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Do you love Greek mythology?
