The stories are fun and the graphics are done well with no glitching. The only thing that urked me a bit was that 2 of them (Stray Souls and Dark Strokes) don't have interactive maps that give you some guidance as far as where to go next. I have found with HOG that this little feature is extremely helpful, especially with storylines that have you bouncing all over the place.\n\nAll in all, pretty good games for the price.

Even at full price, these games are still only around $2.00 a piece, giving you plenty of value for your money. If you are a Hidden Object game aficionado, then this bundle is a MUST HAVE for your collection. \n\nAs with all bundles some games were better than others, however; all of the titles in this bundle are worthy of owning, in my opinion. I will say that my favorite game in this bundle was [b] Eternal Journey: New Atlantis [/b] since it had quite a different plot than most hidden object games. The graphics were beautiful, the story made me feel as if I were in a science fiction movie, and there was a lot of thought put into the information that was given to you within the game. Overall, a very well thought out and executed game.\n\nDo understand that most of these games are older HOG's, so 3 of them I was forced to play with the black bars at the side of the screen, but it really did not affect me in any way to be honest. \n\nThe only other slightly negative thing I can say for this bundle, is that it DOES include a game which is available on Steam as a Collector's Edition copy, so if you already have [b] House of 1000 Doors: The Palm of Zoroaster [/b], then you are better off playing it in the individual copy, since this bundle does NOT contain the collector's edition. I had already played this game myself, so I bought the bundle strictly for the other 3 games.\n\nSo, to sum this up:  BUY THIS BUNDLE! If you are hesitant, or just not obsessed with HOG's, then buy it on sale; just make sure you buy it, you really can't go wrong.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500248182, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500248182, "recommendationid": "33596660", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506538", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 31, "total_reviews": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
