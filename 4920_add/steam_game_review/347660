IS ART !!!!\"\n\nFor Christmas, 1973 I was fortunate enough to receive the very first console game system available in America\u2026.Odyssey by Magnavox. Though it advertised as having about a dozen games, in reality it was just a dozen forms of PONG with plastic overlays for your TV set to create slightly differing game effects. (Not a criticism\u2026PONG was a great game!) Who would have imagined that over FORTY years later, the most exciting new game I\u2019m playing currently is actually just an unbelievably amazing new version of the original master, PONG\u2026..Caromble!.\n\nThroughout the years, the concept behind every similar type of \u201chit a moving object with a paddle; rinse & repeat\u201d game has been the same, brilliant in its simlicity. But now we have that same simple concept, but added to it some genuinely remarkable newer concepts to bring this great concept well into the 21st century:\n\nGRAPHICS \u2013 Caromble!\u2019s \u201cphoto-real\u201d type of animation (with enough \u201ctrue\u201d animation aspects so as to not seem commonplace) is some of the most intriguing I\u2019ve ever seen in any computer game. Because of the nature of this game, being able to know \u201cwhat, where and when\u201d is very critical, but still needs to have an amusing aspect. Caromble! succeeds wonderfully, and beautifully. I hope to see more of this style in other games.\n\nLEVELS \u2013 Caromble! is NEVER easy, but the learning curve works well. The game starts with a multi-step intro to prepare players for both the \u201cProtect the Earth\u201d story, and the necessary aspects of the game in a very simple format. From there, each level is composed of three(?) separate (and unique) but connected game areas, each (seemingly) ending with the same Big Red Boss. Each new area must be unlocked by defeating the boss on the last stage of the previous level.\n\nCONTROL \u2013 Unlike some similar games, control over the ball is a critical aspect of Caromble!. But it\u2019s also fairly easy to learn. I\u2019m certain I\u2019ve played well over 1,000 hours of computer pinball, and have to say that CAROMBLE! FEELS MORE LIKE PINBALL than any other similar type game . I find myself enjoying it in quite the same way that I love playing pinball for hours on end. Over fifty of my Stream friends are serious pinball players. I suggest that each of you consider taking a look at Caromble! to see if you feel the same sort of control, Zen and heart-pounding excitement that pinball offers, and that I\u2019m happy to say I feel from Caromble!.\n\nPHYSICS - So natural, I originally forgot to include it in this review, and had to edit this in.\n\nAWARDS \u2013 Currently, the Early Access form of Caromble! lacks both achievements and cards, but it does have AWARDS. For each three-stage level there are three awards available; completion, score and time. Completion is adequate to unlock the next level. In the event you are SO CLOSE to winning, there\u2019s a MERCY selection upon losing. MERCY allows a single extra life/ball. (How that effects awards or high scores isn\u2019t known to me at this point.)\n\nPOWERUPS \u2013 As is typical with Breakout type games, powerups can be obtained for immediate use. Some make the game easier, some make the game harder. (But it\u2019s easy to tell them apart by color.) Extra Ball powerups can be stacked to the point that it\u2019s possible to have as many as five balls on the field at once (and maybe more. Understand I\u2019m still on early levels of this game.)\n\nAdmittedly, Caromble! seems to be a bit pricier than similar type games, and that\u2019s why I waited this long. I see now that waiting was a mistake. This game is everything I hoped it might be, and more. The thrill of taking down whole BUILDINGS (as well as hitting a well-aimed shot perfectly) is hard to describe. And while the music may leave something to be desired, it wasn\u2019t until I played with headphones, and heard each and every single THUD and THUMP, that I really began to feel myself to be a part of the game. And that\u2019s a place I am VERY happy to be. (My time on Caromble! is currently 6 hours. I bought it about 12 hours ago.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503102524, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504049930, "recommendationid": "34339509", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523901", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
