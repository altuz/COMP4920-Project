I beat the game, and there is only one acheivement left to get, but sadly I will never have it because it is an entirely missable event and you won't even know you missed it (Oboro). The training was fun and the fighting played great, but make no joke - this game is just a series of mini games and some stat building. \n\nThat said, this game is heavvvilllyyy flawed. Some training is quicker than others, sometimes you get injured on your first hit, there are spelling errors, bad engrish, goals not clearly defined (I still don't know what some of the menu items do), and I even beat the game on accident. Thats right, I beat the game on ACCIDENT. You can save up 1500 for your own dojo and I thought, \"cool, maybe I'll be able to train quicker/for free\" but nope, you can beat the game without fighting at all if you just go to work. As a matter of fact, working pays off more quickly to get that dojo you always wanted.\n\nHeavily flawed, no replay value, you may have to search for how to do things, devs have abandoned the game, but for $4 I can recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505917724, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505917752, "recommendationid": "35085049", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505156793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 344, "playtime_forever": 624, "steamid": "76561197970078168", "num_games_owned": 844}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Correct fighting game based on Karate.\nThere is a lot of love to such a discipline behind this game.\nThe approach remembers me to Holyfield's boxing game (released by sega megadrive, long time ago). \nYou have to develop your carrier in Karate's world, until you can fund your own gim.\nThis means: training, fighting and earning money to assist to more fights and earn more money and reputation.\nBefore you can go to the big game, you need to beat all other gims there.\nGame's characters are a tad odd and look like 90's sprites but, movements are very correct.\nThe game keeps adictive until you achieve everything, then... there is nothing else to do.\nIn Holyfield's game you lost some points after few matches on the top so, you had to constantly train your character and, it was loosing more points that you could recover with training so, at the end, you had to finish your career and start a new one. Here, once you get your skills to top, you don't loose them.\nOverall, good fighting game but, after 10h everything is done.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505157351, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505157351, "recommendationid": "34888720", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505836499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 406, "steamid": "76561198001264436", "num_games_owned": 310}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a nice little game without any of the bullshit that Punch Club has.
