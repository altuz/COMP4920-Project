Before the update, i was not on the fence as to weather it was a good game or not.  It still is and was a good game, with amazing support from the developer, who actually gives a damn about his product and the people who purchase it.  \n\nHowever, the game felt a little lacking.  I felt less control than i would have liked.  I dont mind hard games and challenges, but i also dont want to feel cheated by the limitations of the simplicity of the game.\n\nThat is where the beauty is in this one.  You can tweak the settings to suit your gameplay style. The developer gives you the option to make this game your own.  With each update, he doesnt remove options for the player, he just adds more and more.\n\nspeaking of this most recent update, that is what got me to write the review.  I saw the update note and thought it was going to be the much anticipated player editor. While that will be an amazing addition when it eventually comes, this update was a welcome surprise for me.  Adding the sprint option to speed up gameplay and really let me use the open pitch and give me the ability to get around defenders was wonderful.  Then also adding the \"easy\" dribbling control to go along with it, so that it was really my doing when i lost the ball to the defense by being sloppy with turbo or passing was the icing on the cake.  I feel like i lose or win now based on my actions on the pitch.  The first touch is noticeable, i dont feel as though the defense is stripping me of the ball nearly as often as before, because i can turn and run.\n\nNotes:\n \n-This is a hard game, easy to pick up and play (especially with friends) but difficult to master\n-This game almost requires a controller to play, but the controls are tight and responsive\n-There are still some improvements to be made, but the arrow is always pointing up as this is clearly a passion project that deserves the support of anyone who is interested.\n\nIf you are a fan of the classic soccer/futbol games of years past, this is a title you must pick up. With a developer that gives great support and is always updating and improving the game based on suggestions from players like you and I, This game feels fresh and like its improving on a successful formula.

It is also very playable, if you set the game speed to 75 %. This is adjustable from 75 (which feels the most like real life to me) to 125 %, for those who enjoy football at the speed of light (the game lacks any breaking-the-sound-barrier-effects).\n\nAs far as the realistic physics go, I can agree as long as the speed setting is set at the aforementioned level. AI is decent, with defenders doing a very good job in getting in the way of your shot. It will take some passing and/or dribbling skills to find space. When playing with a keyboard, this is where the game has serious issues (spoiler alert: all the cons in this review are related to playing this game with a keyboard).\n\nThe sprint button is <Esc>! (what the actual...) with the remaining control buttons being the logical A, S, D, and Q, I wonder what grudge the developers have against the W key. There is no way to change these controls. However, it is possible to play without sprinting (just disable it in the settings). This obviously takes the fun of taking on an opponent or even chase a long ball out of the game.\n\nWhich brings me to the next issue: there is no way to control the pace and distance of long balls. With short passing, the game will roughly aim the pass at a player that is positioned in the direction your aiming at, making short passing tiki-taka play very managable if you keep an eye on where your opponents are. This aiming feature is not there for long balls: the direction is exactly the one in which the player is running and using the arrows to control the curve of the ball only makes up for so much. Meanwhile this also makes your player move about. As far as power and distance goes, holding the button down seems to work every now and then, but with the ball being released at random moments (and sometimes instantly) when you press the key, this remains guesswork. \n\nThis lack of aiming also affects the shooting: while shots will always be powerfull enough to hit the target and holding the button never does anything (this one is actually consistant!), the direction of the shot will again be the same as the direction of running. Playing on a keyboard, this means aiming comes with 45 degree intervals, so there are many positions in and around the box from which it is impossible to get your shot on target. Like with the long passes, controlling the curve of the ball can only make up for so much. All goals I have scored were close range rebounds after the goalkeeper couldn't hold on to the ball.\n\nWhile there is clearly a lot of effort in this game, it looks good and the physics are very realistic, I cannot recommend this game for those who play with a keyboard. The controls are just too limited and this makes it annoying and boring very quickly.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505574181, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505574181, "recommendationid": "34999231", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 13, "num_reviews": 13, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 6}}
