I especially like the graded scoring system. If you just want to spend a few minutes, you can look at the hint and complete the puzzle fairly quickly. More challenging is to get the gold bonus (usually a different method to the hint so you can work it out for yourself). Finally, for the ultimate challenge, try to beat or equal the online rating, which really tests your knowledge of the subtle nuances of the game, especially since the original game has been around for a year on a different platform than the PC version which was my first encounter with Terraform, so people have had time to come up with good ideas for high-scoring solutions. Some planets are so well designed, they have a great number of different solution methods, with some red herrings (like tools you don't need which mislead you and some obvious methods suggested by terrain which end up failing for a subtle reason). Okay, not EVERY planet is a work of art (some of the planets introducing asteroids are a bit perfunctory in comparison to the great depth of most levels) but a pretty large number are. I have not managed (yet!) to equal the online rating on quite a few of the puzzles, but any time I equal or beat it gives a real glow of satisfaction. Lateral thinking is needed for some of the best scores, and you need to keep an open mind and avoid making too many assumptions, so it's a real brain workout. \n\nThe only quibble I have is that the online ratings don't seem to be completely stable (the game allows me to upload a lower online rating than the original sometimes, which I now try to avoid doing) but hopefully that will be fixed soon.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432682571, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432682571, "recommendationid": "16018246", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510471", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447860901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 370, "steamid": "76561198079381919", "num_games_owned": 568}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Do you like puzzles?
