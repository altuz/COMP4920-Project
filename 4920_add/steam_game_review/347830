The main character has absolutely no depth whatsoever, he's a totally cliche \"let's save everyone / reluctant hero\" type of guy without any backstory and real motivations (half of the game is about the main character wanting to get good food to eat - seriously?). Out of the main cast, probably only Tiara has some real backstory going for her and even that isn't too well fleshed out. \n\nSecond of all, all the story is presented in a Visual Novel, \"talking heads\" style. There are no cutscenes, even ones rendered with the in-game engine, so basically every scene, even the most dramatic / important ones, are just talking heads.\n\nThird of all, the combat is simply repetitive and boring. The locations are totally empty, there's nothing in them besides monsters and the occasional treasure. No story, no setting nothing. Plus, they all look and feel more or less the same. The ratio of fun fights to dreary fights is strongly in favor of the second - especially since there are not that many  monster types and the later variants do not really add a new mechanic - just more firepower. \n\nThe leveling system, based on a typical double resource XP (autolevel) / WP (invest in skills) is somewhat fun, but the fact that you need to grind the boring and repetitive fights to get any real number of WP makes it a chore.\n\nOverall, I've had much more fun with the Legends' series, with the Tales' series, hell, even with The Last Remnant and Final Fantasy XIII. If you want quality jRPG entertainment, I'd suggest you start with those.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506115953, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506115953, "recommendationid": "35138146", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1019, "total_reviews": 1103, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 84}}
