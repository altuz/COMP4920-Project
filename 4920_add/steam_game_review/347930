Everything is super cheap 2D Flash game grade assets with next to no animation. There is a double jump feature that works with a twin-stickish aimed dash but it is clunky to use, you will probably just set it and forget about changing the orientation. If it is set to anything vertical you will constantly jump way above the height limit of the game. Game is insanely repetitive, mind numbingly boring and you will soon zone out and start trying to speedrun it the way runners should be. But you wont be able to because of the trash controls. Otherwise you could potentially take it very slowly as the screen does not auto scroll but it feels like the most pointless thing you could be doing with your time, even doing dishes or staring out the window would be better than this", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496872948, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505087576, "recommendationid": "32246996", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 6}}
