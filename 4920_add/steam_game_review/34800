No need to hunt for pixels.\n+ raiders of the lost ark type story is intriguing\n+ background music is good\n\n\ncons\n\n- sometimes voiceover suddenly cuts and there are lip sync problems\n- game is too dark and there is no gamma option in menu.\n- game could have been longer. \n\nOverall this is an decent and typical old school point and click adventure game."}]}
