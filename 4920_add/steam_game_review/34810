The default for tilt left is W and tilt right is S. Makes no sense. Also there is one speed, no coasting, no stopping, but eventually boosting. Flight control is spot on with mouse aiming. For $0.50 cents its worth it(you have 37 hours before it goes back to full price). Its almost up there with Descent in quality.\nNo achievements, no multiplayer. So its like Skyrim... in space."}]}
