I'm surprised to see how little I missed.  Of all of the FF gamebooks I've read, this is by FAR the worst one.  You visit many planets in this book, but only two matter; You can literally finish the book in 5 minutes flat (without a single combat) if you know which planets to skip.  The graphics and sound effects aren't the worst in the world in so far as gamebooks are judged, but the story here is extremely weak and unsatisfying.  Recommended only if they bundle these books together again (the method in which I purchased them several years ago).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503994718, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503994718, "recommendationid": "34571597", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502768167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 32, "steamid": "76561198130948719", "num_games_owned": 1480}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The Fighting Fantasy series are Choose your own Adventure books, with some random elements (you roll dice for several stats at the start of each game, which affects many choices that depend on skill checks), as well as nicer graphics and some sound effects. Most have a pulp Sci-Fi / Fantasy feel to them. They generally have good production values. I prefer them to the Choice of Games series, which seem more hit-or-miss based on the skill of the author.\n\nThis one was of the same quality as the others I've played, with a distinct Star Trek feel to it. You travel about in your ship, beam down to planets with your choice of 2 to 3 man away teams, and the things you can do as well as your sucess chances are based on who comes with you and your aforementioned stats.\n\nIf the price seems a bit steep, know that you can get these on mobile platforms for less. There's also a much wider selection on iOS.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502768696, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506899794, "recommendationid": "34248500", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 12}}
