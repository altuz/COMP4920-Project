You choose a character who represents a certain color and you are able to absorb bullets of the same color, while bullets of other colors will kill you. The usual bombs/attack/alt-attack systems are all here. You also get a good amount of continues, if you're not very good at shmups, which is nice for beginners. It also has multiple difficulty modes which is great. My only big complaint is that there is a horrible lack of OPTIONS. No options menu even exists, so no graphics, sound or control adjustments. The game kind of throws 2 control scheme options at you when you start playing and tells you what keys can increase/decrease volume but that's it. It's an odd design choice, given that it's a vertical shooter with no options to rotate the screen to a profile-mode of any sort. Again, that's my only real complaint. The game itself is pretty solid and straight forward. It's got an easy mode for those who are new to shooters and more advanced difficulty settings for more experienced players. Overall it's good.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503426128, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503426128, "recommendationid": "34421354", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 29, "total_reviews": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
