I thought she would love to try this. Within five minutes she was back at the place she grew up, giggling and squeeling with delight. Then she went up \"Tandle Hill\" and suddenly I noticed she wasn't laughing anymore.\n\nI asked her if she was ok, and I noticed she was quietly crying and shaking. \"What's the MATTER\"?, I asked.\n\n\"I haven't been here since I was a little girl; this is so wonderful - thank you so much, I never thought I would ever come here ever again\".\n\nTHAT, my friends, is worth the cost of the Vive itself.\n\n\nPro's: Become Superman/Supergirl and go where you like; visit your own house; go to that place you always wanted to; sit on cliffs and scare yourself to death; \"Leap\" from tall buildings; Take off and go into space then land on the other side of the planet; go to that holiday place again (without the traffic jams); play a game of \"can I find it again from space without getting lost on the way down\"; save your own favourites and jump straight there next time. Change the time of day or night by dragging the Sun across the sky. All for FREE !!!!\n\nIN MY OPINION - the best and most enduring VR experience ever, and probably for a long time to come.\n\nCons:\n\nWell, not really any, but I would like to see the following features added as this gem is polished:\n\nTo be able to leave human scale on ALL THE TIME. I know it is great to feel like Gulliver, walking between the mountains or skyscrapers, but for immersion I'd like to be able to leave my eyes 70mm apart and view the Earth in normal scale (at least have the option).\n\nAbility to reverse the \"BRAKE\" option so that you are slow by default and you pull the trigger to accellerate; I, personally, want to take it all in, not rush off.\n\nI am not bothered about the comfort mode and prefer not to use it, but for those that get motion sickness, an option to change the size of the \"tunnel\" view to suit.\n\nI for one, don't mind that you can't text-search for places to \"teleport\" to; searching adds to the enjoyment, but I'll expect a lot of people would prefer the option.\n\nI know there's mirror mode, which you can modify to show just left/right eye as a circle on the screen, but for your friends to be able to view the experience full screen. I appreciate this could affect FPS etc, so just the option would be nice. \n\nGraphics settings, perhaps.\n\nOh, I don't know, fly to and around the Moon next maybe?  ;-D\n\nThese are not complaints, just hopes for the future.
