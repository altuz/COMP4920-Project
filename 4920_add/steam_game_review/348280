And it really was! I had a blast playing this with a lot of friends.\n\nBut after playing a few hours, we noticed that some very small changes and options would greatly improve the game. I left a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/348280/discussions/0/487870763304206199/]thread [/url] about it in the hub back in October of last year, 8 months ago. No a single sign of the devs there or on any other threads, not a single update since release. That's a shame because I think some tweaks could greatly benefit this game.\n\nThey don't have any obligation to fix the game but they don't even seem to be willing to fix the simple mistakes they've made. (One of the upgrade in the game has the description of an other upgrade.) They're not willing either to help peoples and answer questions in the community hub. It's sad that they'd leave this game so close to be amazing but so far at the same time.\n\nI'd be happy to change my review if they ever prove me wrong.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466927724, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1466928085, "recommendationid": "23819244", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.981743", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488054542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 44, "steamid": "76561198020857933", "num_games_owned": 231}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "chaos, anoying soundtrack. \njust buy crawl if you want a good 4 player local game. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489812829, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489812829, "recommendationid": "30583645", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496681", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506307670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1380, "steamid": "76561198199919428", "num_games_owned": 51}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "grate game :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469227643, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1469227643, "recommendationid": "24468591", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496806", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1479933189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 65, "steamid": "76561198337515957", "num_games_owned": 3}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "no its multiplayer noooo\n", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1477546049, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1477546049, "recommendationid": "26241125", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491493", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498224224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 369, "steamid": "76561198135833570", "num_games_owned": 9}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It got bored when started to won every single game we did with friends but its still really good game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1473437480, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1473437480, "recommendationid": "25428065", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505507883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 159, "steamid": "76561198257868709", "num_games_owned": 12}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A fun party game for a few people however it could have been so much more with more features.
