The game has decent graphics for a 2010 game but the physics are terrible. snipeers have a MASSIVE bullet drop physic which is terrible and snipers, pistals, shotguns and other weapons have no recoil but as soon as you pick up a AR the recoil is almost uncontrolable. as for the AI, its trash. at times enemies wont see you when youre right at there feet and at other times theyll see you across the map in a bush which can be very enaging. when it comes to the story, it seems so rushed and i wasnt emersed at all. in the end i was given my stats and it took me 3h and 9m of play time to finish the game. if you ant to have a fun game to play, dont get this but if you wanna look like an absolute baller and fill up your library then go for it."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506942718, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35412115", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198130717868", "num_reviews": 50, "last_played": 1492065225, "num_games_owned": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 44}, "timestamp_updated": 1506942718, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Buggy as hell, unmemorable characters and uninspiring gameplay, but it makes me laugh through the plain dumb shit that happens when you play it.
