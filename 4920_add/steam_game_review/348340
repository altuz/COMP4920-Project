The game itself ran smoothly for me and with the low asking price, it wasn't a bad investment for a few hours of fun.  \n\nMost of the achievements are easy enough to get, with the 3 STAR on all levels likely being the most difficult.  However, the upgrade achievements are a bit of a grind.\n\nOverall, nothing really to complain about with this one, its simple in design and offers exactly what you think it would based off it's Steam page.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504224421, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504224421, "recommendationid": "34647369", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505139", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503946887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 377, "steamid": "76561198117124319", "num_games_owned": 579}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1] Siege Wars\t[/h1]\nAngry Birds Catapult Version.\n- I've played many of these catapult games on Kongregate. - \n\nYou have 1-3 catapults and different ammo with which you need to kill different mages with by hitting them directly or destroying the castle around them; strategicaly let it fall on them. \n\n[h1] Thumbs Up [/h1]\nChallenging to figure out the shot, weakpoint of the castle and which mage to kill first. \n\nCheap price - But not cheap enough. \n\nInitially fun, but go to my Thumbs Down List\n\n[h1] Thumbs Down\t[/h1]\nBuggy - This game was one of the buggiest games I've bought on steam. \n- The catapult fires, but the shot is not registrered, or hangs in the air. Costing a round. \n- A direct hit on the mages might not kill them.\n- Achievements might not unlock.\n\nWindowed mode \n- Problems with scrolling to the levels - the resolution doesn't fit. Switching from full screen to window mode to start a level, because you want to watch por...Popular series meanwhile. \n\nLeveling system is bad\nYou upgrade your different catapults as you earn coins from completing levels - However, some upgrades are required to get to some levels, but you can't reset upgrades. \nMeaning: If you upgrade wrong, you have to start the game all over. - I did this 5 times. \n\nThe mages attack your catapults at random, meaning some levels are pure luck based. Contradicts the whole strategy concept, you have to retry if you loose the wrong catapult first for instance. \n\nThe Score system is wierd \n- You can kill every mage with 1 shot, but you might not get enough points for 3 stars because you didn't damage enough of the castle. Especially applies to levels with 1 try. \nThis is fucked up if you go for the achievement completion. - I really couldn't figure out how to get most points. - Even after getting all stars for 50 levels. \n\n[h1] Closing Comments\t[/h1]\nYou can kill some time with this game, and it is fun for an hour. - Then the frustration sets in like a bad hangover, or when you realize you got pregnant by mistake. You regret. \n\nIf you go for 100% completion, it's not worth it because of all the bugs and restarting. \nPerhaps played this divided over 1 year, and it only got more bugged. - The developer abandoned the game; like I should do with my addiction to Cola - Just admit it's fucked up and stay away -\n\nPs. I don't know if it's better on Android.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503951328, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503951460, "recommendationid": "34561244", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503143", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 18, "total_reviews": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 11}}
