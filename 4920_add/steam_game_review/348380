I bet your average porn video would take longer to download... and would be way more exciting.\n\nAnyways, I wasn't a fan of this game. Here's why:\n\nWhen you launch the game, the settings screen appears, giving you options for the game. It's basic graphic stuff and keybindings, nothing special. The graphic settings range (and I'm not making this up) from Good, to Beautiful, all the way to Fantastic! And, of course, you can change the resolution too and which display you want the game on as well as if you want the game to be windowed or not.\n\nAt the start of this game (if you can even call it that... probably finished it in less than 15 minutes) you are greeted by a somewhat nice looking starting screen. You'll probably be thinking \"Golly! The other reviews might just be wrong! Looks like a thrilling indie game ahead!\" If this is what you think, then you might as well not play and save whatever is left of your hopes and dreams. \n\nHowever, if you do decide to continue, you'll be greeted by a computer generated voice. But this isn't just any voice, this is that one british voice (Daniel... I think...?). And honestly, throughout the entire game I was expecting him to say \"And this is the pro as heck guide to Master Yi\". Unfortunately, he never does, and instead starts narrating something... as if it matters. He starts talking about how Adam (I assume this is your character) wants a job and he's going to an interview. After that little bit with him saying stuff, you finally end up in a hallway leading to an office and are given control of you player as well as a tiny black cursor.\n\nNow here's the biggest part of the gameplay right here. What? The interview? No, silly! Battling the shittiest mouse/control scheme in the history of shitty mouse/control scheming! They decided to say \"Hey! Fuck the sensitivity or having individual conrtols for anything! Lets just combine everything and hope it works! The main camera (this is first person, if it wasn't already apparent) and the cursor are both controlled with the mouse, and to make it even better, they're both at different sensitivities. Like... extremely different. The main sensitivity on a scale from 1 to 10 would be somewhere far beyond 10, as to where the sensitivity for the cursor wouldn't even reach 1. It's great, too, because you're gonna be needing that cursor a whole bunch for when you actually start getting interviewed. Oh wait, there's more! If you cared the least bit about anything in the game you would soon realize that there is no menu! So good luck with that!\n\nAs for the actual gameplay: As I was stating earlier, you're in a hallway and then you go into an office where you are told by our Pro as Heck guy to sit in a red chair. Then, right from the get-go they're trying to push for some mystery in the game by presenting you choices, such as \"Where are you? \" (As the interviewer isn't in the room) and \"Why the red chair?\" It's as if this game doesn't know what subtlety is, or that it doesn't care about it, which would be alright, if this game was supposed to be ironic.\n\nAfter some dumb answer to your question that makes it obvious that there's more to their answer than what they just said, you begin answering pointless questions. Over time, though, they slowly porgress from stupid questions to... slightly less stupid ones. And whenever you answer a question, usually, you'll hallucinate for a few seconds. By hallucinate, I mean you teleport to some weird lcd looking vision in a jump scare-esque fashion and return after some creepy music and sounds play. The interviewer will urge you to calm down and whatnot, further pushing the mystery that was never there.\n\n After a bit of questioning and struggling with the damn controls, the next phase of the interview begins. And this is where some people probably would perfer a warning or a caution... or anything, really.The next part of the interview basically just rolls a video where you can see a person get assassinated, another person getting hit by a car, and animal cruelty. It didn't really bother me as much as it would other people, but regardless, the game should probably have some type of warning about that, whether it be ingame or in the description.\n\nOnce the video stops, you are then asked even more questions, and this time, nothing even happens for the most part. You are just simply asked questions for a while. That don't mean anyhting. At all. The story doesn't change depending on what you choose. They're really only asked so that that the questions can progress into more serious and \"disturbing\" ones.\n\nNot wanting to spoil the \"wondeful\" mystery the game has to offer, I won't tell of what else happens, but I will give you an idea:\n\nAfter the questioning ends, you get to have fun with the walking feature that the game never really let you have fun with until now. That means you get access to super slow walking! And super useful jumping! I hope you can feel the sarcasm, because it's there. However, the greatest part of this game has to be the ending.\n\nAfter all of this mystery and bullshit they tried to throw your way they really get you with the ending. I might have been able to at least be somewhat remotely okay with this game if they could have done this ending right (but, of course, that could never take away from what a travesty this game is.), but no. They really fucked it up.\n\nWhen you finally reach the end, after spending half of the playthrough walking, you are greeted with a black screen and some text.\n\nImagine you were reading a detective novel or some shit, and you were so into it, and on the last chapter you finally get to find out what's really going on and you read this:\n\nJones was the culprit. He stole the stuff. The detective found out because he stole something. He became a famous criminal because he stole that important thing. He was taken to jail. The end.\n\nWell, that's not too far from the ending of this game. I mean, the fact that it's so hilariously blunt that you'll fucking laugh your face off, not that he stole something. I mean really, I think I read another review talking about this game's lack of subtlety, but damn, this took it to a whole new low. \n\nI bought this game expecting a horrible product, and what I got in return was something to occupy at least an hour or so of my time (this review :D). I got a game that wanted to be an eerie indie horror(?) game, but instead ended up being clunky waste of data. It gave me a good laugh, though, and now I can tell all my friends that I've possibly encountered the biggest pile of shit in my entire life. That, or I can tell them it's a masterpiece and get them to waste 2 bucks on it. \n\nSo the bottom line? Where do I stand? Should you buy it? \n\nHell, buy it if you want. If anything, it'll give you a laugh. Just make sure you have a PC that can run it. \n*(settings sarcasm)*\n\nEdit: Fixed some typos. Well... a lot of typos.\nEdit 2: Game is still as bad as you think it is...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423104842, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1480189746, "recommendationid": "14333400", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577298", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1423956665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561198178885001", "num_games_owned": 88}, "votes_funny": 8, "votes_up": 40, "comment_count": 0, "review": "worst game ive ever paid for, not worth the money.
