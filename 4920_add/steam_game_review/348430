Unfortunately, they also seemed to have made many more of the puzzles hard.  It took me 9.6 hours to complete the game with 100% Achievements.  BUT, I had to use a LOT of walkthroughs.  Very frustrating.  I'd have preferred easier puzzles, so I'm right on the border with the game.  If you liked \"Quell,\" and don't mind tough puzzles, then I have no problem recommending the game to you.  If you don't care about Achievements (so finding that hidden gem and getting the puzzles done in the minimum number of moves doesn't matter to you), I again recommend the game whole-heartedly.  But, if you're a perfectionist, a completionist, and get frustrated with tough puzzles, you might think twice about \"Quell Reflect.\"  Still, two out of those three groups should be happy with the game, so I'm sticking with my Recommended rating even though I wasn't overjoyed with the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501350167, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501350167, "recommendationid": "33886116", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "total_reviews": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
