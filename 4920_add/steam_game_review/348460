I think the game should be offline with LAN / Dedicated servers instead of trying to do the same online model. Since we've gotten rid of the offline bit and the game is made with Unreal, it could easily support modding and let people make their own classes / abilities / skins and such, and these mods could run on the dedicated servers. The mods could be distributed through steam workshop.\n\nThat's what I would have done if I had to build a project like this from scratch.  I'm not sure if the devs for this game will stick with this game or maybe just try again with a better plan in mind, but the team has potential and I think they managed to learn a great deal from the mistakes made in this game.
