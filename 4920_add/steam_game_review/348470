I did so because I had heard interesting things about the Warriors serieses, and since I like Samurai, I picked this one to try first (it was also the cheapest of the three overall on my wishlist). After figuring out how to actually play using my limited resources (keyboard), it turned out to be quite fun. Some of the storylines in Story mode are quite engaging, even when based around a rather annoying character (one of the stories centers around a guy who wants to prove how evil he is, but he is rather inept... until the end, and even then...). The ability to annihilate hundreds with one blow is fun, too.\n\nIt is a fun experience. But I would have to recommend getting it on sale. As I said, this was the cheapest of the three on my wishlist, and still cost nearly $200 during that sale...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499742009, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499742009, "recommendationid": "33446422", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508841", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498207323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 997, "steamid": "76561198078290507", "num_games_owned": 302}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I got this games both on my ps4 and PC and i enjoyed replaying it on my pc.\n\nGOOD THING:\n-Story was pretty ok\n-High replay value\n-Character progression \n-unlockble stuff \n-Good character design \n\nBAD THING: \n-PS3 port graphic \n-all normal enemy looks alike \n-Unfixed BUGS/GLITCH \n-Some Slow down Performence Issue \n\nFinal Score : 7/10\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501093579, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501093579, "recommendationid": "33814812", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506417", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501827864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 733, "steamid": "76561198047174659", "num_games_owned": 262}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This negative review is mostly about online Co-op experience.\n\nI just bought this game so that I could play co-op with my friend, since Dynasty Warriors 8 doesn't have multiplayer ported. It was quite good news to us that we were able to play co-op for the story mode and both players get to clear the story mode at the same time. However, this game has one serious bug in its co-op mode, which randomly freezes the guest player. The bug is killing almost all of our passion to keep playing the game because apparently this bug has been known since 2015 and it's still not fixed in August 2017! Something we found which seems to make the bug less likely to appear was that we suspect the bug was due to the map generation when both players are quite far away. We tried to keep our characters close to each other which seemed produced long lasting gaming experience. But anyone who plays this game in co-op mode knows that it's pretty much impossible to be sticking together throughout the gameplay, since several objectives require you to split and complete them seperately. It seems that Koei has kind of given up on patching this game, which is why I choose to give a negative review.\nDespite my negative review on its online co-op mode, the single player experience is very solid. I have played Dynasty Warriors 8 previously and I'd say this game has its unique elements compared to DW8. The custom character seems quite fun and the survival mode is good place to easily try out wepons (a little spoiler or tips, you can simply switch weapons on your custom characters for farming weapons since your custom characters will maintain its levels depite having different wepons). There is still one thing I really hate about the single player, which is its controller support, in particular steam controller. Apparently just setting controller to xbox360 mode will not work so your controller needs to be mapped to keyboard in order to function properly.\n\nOverall, it's a decent single player game, but a terrible multiplayer game.
