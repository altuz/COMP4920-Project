Nice combination of building your city and space sim. I'd ask for a better AI to create a more interesting and have more replay value. Finished the game in 12 hours, and pretty much seen all the game has to offer after 6. If the AI was tougher and there was more content to the game, I believe I would have gone for a few more rounds.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500781912, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500781912, "recommendationid": "33735561", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505515", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 88, "total_reviews": 110, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 22}}
