LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THEY ARE TRUE!\n\nI bought this game because I thought it would be a decent police simulator, but no, just no. Here are some reasons why you shouldn't buy it:\n\nNot detailed\nBad optimisation\nPoor graphics\nWorst controls in history\nPoor steering wheel and pedals support\nDriving is not realistic\nSirens sound nothing like real life\nIt is just straight line simulator \n\nDO NOT BUY! If you want a fire or police simulator, buy Emergency 112, it seems quite good and is CONFIRMED to be better that this heap of shit!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500205143, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500205143, "recommendationid": "33582927", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531340", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500395834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 12, "steamid": "76561198292268222", "num_games_owned": 9}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Unfortunately I am going to have to agree with all of the other comments, I DO NOT RECOMEND THOS GAME.
