What i wasn't aware of, is the games rediculously small and unfinished content. \n\n[h1] This game is not tagged as Early Access or Alpha. In all franklyness I have to say it is less than that, regarding the fact that steam puts this old (2009) unfinished game on sale instead of deleting it and thereby protecting steamusers from such a scam I am extremely pissed at steam[/h1]\n\nI really can't recommend this game in it's current state. It is prior to an alpha. The only reason I have full 5 hrs on my account is the rusty mechanics and the lack of guidance (I will come back to what i mean by this later). Well, tbh \"the lack og guidance\" might be slightly misleading. The whole game feels like a turorial or introduction into the game mechanics, teaching you the things you need to know to get started afterwards. But then, suddenly, the game ends and the credits are played.\nThroughout the whole storyline you basicly have no choice at all. Additionally I am arguing with myself whether to call this a storyline at all. Even \"Stanleys Parable\", a game which is I often describe as a work of art rather than a[i]game[/i], has more direct plot than this. \nChallenge and difficulty are abscent aswell. \nThis really seems to be a moneygrabber and nothing else. In the devs. description of the game they promise that you will be able to establish your own base on planets and mine minerals in order to upgrade your ship. This is simply not true. \n\n\n[h1]SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nA short guidance through the plot and how it evolves[/h1]\n\nAfter a short intro Episode, you play an \"Old  Man\" helping a powerfull, yet dying AI to repair and upgrade her ship with 3 upgrades. You have to do them in order and you have to do all of them. After this, you are shot and revived somewhere else. You are given a ship and you reestablish contact to the AI which tells you that you can further help her or do whatever you want. Nevertheless I really do not know what else you could do, I flew around a little from planet to planet but i could not find a way to upgrade my own ship at all. I could go down to planets, gathering minerals, but wherefor? The same randomness is encountered with merchants. You simply aren't shown how much money you have and I really do not know if you have any at all. You can just buy everything they have as if they wouldn't be merchants but simply chests which you loot. \n\nYou follow ONE strictly linear questline in order to restore the AI to full power. I have to admit that you can at some point decide to work agaisnt the AI, nevertheless I have not tested this yet and therefor can't say if this has any big impact. From experience I would guess that the AI will just react on your betrayel by killing you. The quests are primarily to get resources for the next upgrade or to meet with someone and fetch some power crystal. Especially the quests in which you have to meet someone or fetch a specific item can be frustrating. You do not have a questlog, but instead you have a minimalistic patcher in your inventory which tells you in a few words what you have to do. The problem with this is that you sometimes have to get to a specific location but your patcher doesn't tell you where if you should have forgotten it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427564109, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427564109, "recommendationid": "15095126", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583420", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435520024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 318, "steamid": "76561198055295994", "num_games_owned": 215}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Keep in mind i've only played the Prolougue thus far, so if anything major changes in gameplay I will edit review to reflect this.\n\nAlright let's start with the bad:\n-Voice Acting is sh*t; but honestly, I'd rather it be there than have just subtitles.\n-Gameplay has been lacklustre; but not really repetitive.\n-Graphics look like sh*t; but you'll get used to it.\n\nOk, so let's move on the the good\n-Price is amazingly cheap\n-Interesting genre combinations; I mean i've seen third-person/RTS before, but never before have I seen an FPS/RTS/Tanker/Spaceship sim/RPG done quite like this\n-Story seems interesting; I mean, it's pretty generic, but some elements are very creative and praiseworthy.\n-humor is a nice touch; the loading screens and some story elements are nice touches\n-Nostalgia is real; for some reason this reminds me of some older games of the varying genres this patches together, go figure.\n-Perhaps most importantly, it can be FUN.\n\nHonestly, if you want a nice game to spend some time playing for over a weekend, I could reccomend this game to you, It may look like the product of a MIT Game Design Major's final project, but then again, it looks as if this one could easily blow all the other Projects out of the water.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427162317, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427162445, "recommendationid": "15028403", "language": "english", "votes_down": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498381", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
