I just got the single achievement in the game, in which you have to get every ending. This achievement doesn't tell you how far you have progressed through it, nor is it satisfying when you do. \nThis game follows the reincarnation of Zeus, the greek god of gods, and you (playing as him) have to make your way though school life trying to decide who to marry. Athena, the goddess of intellegence, or the goddess of love and attraction. You can also fall for other girls, the girl next door, the crush, and the class president. Unfortunately, none of the aforementioned characters are interesting. While getting the achievement I used the skip button more than I have used in any other visual novel.\nThe character design is also mundane. Granted I couldn't draw any of them, it's just the colour pallet is really bland, making everything seem slightly washed out. And the lipsyncing is also terrible.\nAs others have said in their reviews for this game, the lines each character says has no relation to how the mouths of the character moves. Whether or not the characters are humming or confessing to you, it doesn't change.\nI picked up this game during a sale that brought it down to about \u00a34, and even then I feel as if I could have spent that money better. I will say to anyone thinking about buying this VN to look online for playthroughs of this game, (There are nine endings, so don't worry if you only see one of them), or to look through the other reviews that are shown here.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489423709, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489423709, "recommendationid": "30493410", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502922", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475573960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 105, "steamid": "76561198300297476", "num_games_owned": 272}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "First off, the positives: The artwork is nice and detailed, and the voice acting is pretty good. It looks really nice and professional.\n\nThen, the major issue: The writing. Looking at it on the store page I was expecting something cute and silly with a plot a bit like Shuffle!. The premise is like something straight out of an anime, so I was expecting an anime-esque romp. I was rather disappointed. It reads like a first draft. I don't want to be mean, as there is clearly a fair amount of work put into this game, but the writing really lets things down. The characters are barely formed at best, and actively unlikable at worst, and the plot logic is disorienting in its randomness (the bit with the parents walking in on the demi-god girls naked...it's not even funny, it's just weird). I feel that if the game had just gone all out in terms of sillyness and been a bit more self-aware, (maybe a bit more like Huniepop), it would be better for it. As it is, things are just kinda awkward. It's a shame because the starting premise is pretty decent and some of the plot elements (the one girl turning out to be a demon, or the protagonist getting one of the love interests pregnant and stuck on earth) are kinda cool - overall it just feels rushed though. And I'm not even going to start on the weird emotional manipulation and nasty relationship bull...I make allowances considering it's supposed to be a rom-com sort of thing and all but it really made me cringe.\n\nI got this on sale, but even then I don't feel it was wholly worth the price considering the state of the plot. There are far better romance visual novels out there in my opinion. Cute art though, and if you can put up with the cringey plot, fair play to you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1465692746, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1465692746, "recommendationid": "23512037", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503741", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465100547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 207, "steamid": "76561198087008702", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Loved that there was voice acting.

As for Divine Slice of Life, it was not the best Visual Novel I have ever played. Far from it, it still has it's problems but that doesn't change the fact that it was a major improvement from Beach Bounce.\n\nFirst off, having our main character as the reincarnation of Zeus was too funny, and having these two girls, Yui and Ryn fight over you because of your \"destiny\" to ascend to godhood and choose one of them adds a very interesting story instead of just having them fight over you because they want you.\n\nAs for Aaki himself, not a very interesting protagonist. He's very weak in terms of other VN protagonists, even though he's a reincarnation of Zeus.\n\nYui and Ryn are just too funny that you can't help but fall for them, as they continously refer to you as their \"king\" made me laugh a bunch. \n\nThen you have Sakura, the hottest girl in school who's dating the most popular guy in school and how you and he but heads over her. Then there is the typical childhood friend Taka who has loved you since you were kids. Not original I was rolling my eyes the whole time.\n\nOne thing Dharker does get right is the music and artwork. Music sets the mood in certain situations and the artwork is absolutely beautiful. \n\nAnd in this VN we actually have voice acting. Very cool as most VN's don't have voice acting. Unfortunately, the voice acting in this game is not good. Even if you turn the volume down, it's still hard to hear. But if anything, I'm glad they decided to include it rather than not have it at all.\n\n5/10: Average. It's not really the best but it's not bad either. I just wish the protagonist was more relatable and that some of the other girls besides Ryn and Yui were original. All of that and if the game was longer, I would've gotten a 6 or maybe a 7.\n \nIt's a step in the right direction from Beach Bounce and I recommend buying this after a price drop.
