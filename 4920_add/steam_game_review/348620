On the beach he encounters a remarkably cheerful girl, Maris, and despite his cold attitude toward her the girl decides that in the next seven days she is going to make him smile. The game then takes you through those seven days and even though you guess the end by the third day it doesn't take anything away from the moment when it comes.\n\nThe free VN is a short one as my playtime of it suggests, and this is understandably a turnoff for some people; I can enjoy shorter stories with ease so I found this to be enjoyable. The story is sweet and despite both of the characters being in danger of being highly annoying on their own, they manage to balance each other out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485893454, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485893454, "recommendationid": "29613333", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485812895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 92, "steamid": "76561198254995198", "num_games_owned": 29}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a visual novel about a solitary teenager who has problems dealing with people and social responsabilites (basically, he's discovering the horrors that come when you grow up).
