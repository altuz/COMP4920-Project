First of all, despite the steam store page claiming it has online co-op...It doesn't. Only local co-op is supported, which I can only imagine to be dreadful. There is no controller support for either X-Box 360 or Logitech F-Series controllers, which for a Beat'em Up is a deal breaker for me.  Putting those two factors aside and looking at the game itself. It is bad. Enemy AI is abysmal. Enemies just stand there and let you beat them occasionally punching back, if they are not running away in fear. The combos are generic and uninspired. Not many move sets or combos with any of the 3 playable characters. Even the original Double Dragon for NES started you out with more moves, and that game is nearly 3 decades old. One of the worst Beat'em Ups on Steam. I would recommend Double Dragon Neon over this. It has online co-op with a steam friend, and is superior in every aspect.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeLYemL6gnc&list=PLNCk-m24qgLkgLn0G_PjSKus4gRPcU69J&index=3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449333994, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449333994, "recommendationid": "19504799", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554390", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1424285949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 57, "steamid": "76561197978797255", "num_games_owned": 297}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 30, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I bought this game hoping for an old-school beat-em-up in the vein of Double Dragon, Battletoad, Streets of Rage and all the rest of their ilk. What I got instead was a SHODDY beat-em-up in the vein of... well, incompetently-made, poorly-thought-out games of any era you might care to name.\n\nThe controls are stiff and wooden, the fighting is booring - basically no combo variation - and the main 'special move' (forward, forward, attack) is simultaneously hard to pull off in the heat of battle, and easy to fire off accidentally... at least if you're using a controller, which would seem to be the obvious choice. The actual fighting boils down to 'stunlock them before they stunlock you', aided by enemies walking in random circles around you most of the time.\n\nSaid enemies are generally annoying and often use hit-and-run tactics which you are poorly-equipped to counter, since you can't move faster than a laid-back saunter - there's no run, dash or dodge-roll option. They also enjoy attacking from beyond the edges of the screen, where you can't see or reach them, or just positioning themselves INSIDE you to attack, taking advantage of the poorly-made hitboxes. Several of them also have far greater reach than their animations would suggest.\n\nThe bosses are, perhaps, the worst of the lot - they're invariably invulnerable, except for during a specific interval, for abso-bloody-lutely no apparent reason. Your punches just pass through them without doing anything, not because they're hiding behind a shield or using some kind of force-field, but because the game arbitrarily decided that they aren't vulnerable at that point.\n\nSure, it's funny - sort of, if you're into anarchic, rebellious humor - but the translation is as shoddy as the rest and the text is rife with poor spelling, messed-up grammar, and just plain old errors.\n\nBut hey - the GRAPHICS are very nice. Love the style. Looks great. Maybe they should've made a cartoon or a comic-book instead...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424284676, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424284676, "recommendationid": "14533155", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550299", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446349463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 126, "steamid": "76561198042580200", "num_games_owned": 174}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The Asskickers is a beat em up. I love beat em ups. Um, this one has a few problems.\n\n1.) You often clip through the environment, or your character and the enemy characters teleport\n\n2.) Dreadfully short, lacks the replay value of other games like it\n\n3.) One of the most important things in a beat em up is being able to quickly turn and deliver a blow to an enemy behind you. Instead of turning instantly, the character has a drawn out animation to turn, and if you press punch before he's turned fully, he performs a back attack. This might not be so bad, if the back attacks actually hit the enemies.\n\nOne and two may not sound so bad, depending on how starved you are for another beat em up to play.  Number 3 is the big killer, but if you can work past that, there are some positives. Namely, the design. Like a lot of older side-scrolling beat em ups, Asskickers likes to introduce new enemies and gimmicks each stage. In one stage you're on top of a train dodging signs and bars, on another you're hiding from searchlights, and so on. The bosses are also very gimmick focused, probably because the actual combat is not robust enough to support much more.\n\nThe enemy design is decent. The most basic goons walk into your punches, but later enemies require precise timing and frequent use of your special attacks. There's really nothing particularly special here, and beat em ups made over a decade prior have done much better.\n\nThe humor, which was probably a big draw, is just generic \"hurr durr corporations are evil\", to the point where one of the enemies is a teleporting yuppie.

You have three buttons to work with: attack, jump and use. Use is for picking up items and weapons. I played it with an Xbox360 pad and by default it maps the movement to the analog stick, which is not great when your supermove is tapping forward twice and then pressing attack. \n\nThe game seems to require you to use the mouse for all menus, including dialogue options. My hands should not have to leave the gamepad to navigate the game. Also in the menus the buttons are big but only the text inside the button counts as the active area for that button i.e. you have to click the text on the button i.e. clicking anywhere else does nothing. This is weird.\n\nThe combat is pretty basic. You have your one button combo, a jumping attack, a special attack that consumes non-regenerating stamina and a grab. Grabbing is usually bad, since it just makes you a sitting duck. Jumping attacks tend to be the answer to most problems.  You can pick up weapons, but since you cannot jump while holding a weapon, they are pretty useless. I wish more thought had gone into the fighting system.\n\nI don't like the art style, but YMMV.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430693600, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430693600, "recommendationid": "15677490", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499535", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475468917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 22, "steamid": "76561197990619440", "num_games_owned": 240}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is a very fun attempt at a modern beat 'em up game.  Beat 'em ups were always one of my favorite games to play as a kid so anything new is a welcome addition to that catagory.

The fighting and enemies can get a little stale pretty quickly.  But honeslty those are really my only gripes with the game.
