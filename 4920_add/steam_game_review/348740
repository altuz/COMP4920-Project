Listed below are certain features with issues and basic functions that hardly work.\n\nMovement\n- Character is prone to become unable to move or interact/fire weapon. Can jump, sprint and turn.\n- Android can become stuck in place and on other occasions will not fire or salvage materials. Have yet to see it actually repair anything even thou it is set to maintenance.\n- Enemies do not spawn or the paths force the enemies to walk off into the abyss\n\nAttacking\n- Weapon crosshairs not representing of where shots actually fire too, but eventually resets to proper line of fire\n\nResearch\n- Table refuses to accept queue for new research even with the right amount of points needed to start it\n\nDeath\n- Random deaths occurred for no potential reason\n\nFull screen\n- Even when toggled in the options, it reverts to none full screen, but then switches back if you open then close the options again.\n\nPlease watch the game footage if you are remotely interested in this game. It will show more of what the list above most likely missed.\n\nThis has been an EAW PSA.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468878230, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1468887964, "recommendationid": "24397477", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497264", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
