It's not perfect, but it's got it's own vibe, and it works well. \nand it's 6 bucks.\n\nSo ask yourself: Do I like the idea of a house that does what it pleases? Would I find it fascinating to roam around a building where the tension is based more on shifting geometry rather than lurking monsters? Am I tired of paying money for a \"horror\" \"game\" that is 'predictable' and 'broken'? \n\nIf you want a new freak out experience please check out Monstrum, it's fantastic. If you have a few bucks and want a weird little head trip that's fine being its own thing, pick this up and support a talented developer.\n\nAnd, PS, a note to the developer.

You're never quite sure whether you're bored because you've suffered the same jump scares, the same scenarios, the same possessed furniture flying around the room a hundred times before or because the game is genuinely dull, directionless and uninspired.\n\nIt's a little bit of both for [b]Wooden Floor[/b], although I'd have to say right from the start that an obvious effort has been made to stand clear of the worst cut-and-paste asset jobs on Steam. It's a nice looking game with a serviceable eerie score that earnestly attempts to build up a creepy atmosphere without jackhammerng your speakers with obnoxious jump-scares.\n\nWith that said, the game is far too repetitive to keep anybody but the most inexperienced horror fan on edge. You move from one room to the next, tracking down keys. The hook is that [b]Wooden Floor[/b] is supposed to be procedurally generated but you have to close the doors behind you to allow that to happen which completely shatters the fluid disorientation that the game wants to mine out of that mechanic and it's something that has been done far better in even the most mediocre of this platform's indie games. Even [b]Hektor[/b], as decidedly average as it was, managed a far better job of dizzying its player with its random room generation.\n\nThere's the occasional attempt to break things up with a chase sequence here and a boss fight there but they feel like late afterthoughts, as if [b]Wooden Floor[/b] itself knows that it's struggling to hold your attention and so procedurally generates you something else to play in a panic. \n\nNot terrible. Nowhere near interesting.

The developer was smart to not put that tag on this game but apparently some users couldn't resist. It's not scary. At all.\n\nThis game takes a leaf out of the books of such games as Dear Esther and Anna focusing more on trying to create an environment than to create gameplay. Not exactly my cup of tea but I'm fine with games that try to do this. Even if they do have an increasingly annoying unfiltered, nonrandomized creaking noise in the background every few seconds.\n\nSo I was still on board as I was getting lost due to the dodgy lighting not allowing me to see where a particular door is. I was with it, I was fine! But then, platforming section out of nowhere? And poorly done with weak timing and arbitrary waiting grinding away at my patience instead of testing my skill at 3D platforming. Starting to lose me.\n\nThen follow that up with an escape sequence... wait an escape sequence? I don't have a run key and if I did you didn't have the courtesy to tell me about it. How am I supposed to do an escape sequence in this game, walk out at the exact speed I walked into the room while avoiding arbitrarily placed and completely unchallenging obstacles to a soundtrack out of a free creator's pack with wooden planks chasing me?\n\n... oh... yes apparently.\n\nI was actually pleased when it bugged out and a key disappeared so that I could go play something else. This game is maybe worth $1.00 for the novelty and the few moments at the beginning that show some promise but I'm glad I didn't fork over any more than that.\n\n\nIf you want to see my oneshot let's play of this game, check below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwyv6hvj2Gw", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435949438, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435949438, "recommendationid": "16865325", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507023", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1424533421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 124, "steamid": "76561198040354836", "num_games_owned": 374}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is one solid horror indie game that definitely deserves more attention.

Put together the unpredictibility(thats a word right?), the eerie atmosphere, and the all around unsettling soundtrack, and you get a game that is worth every cent you put towards it. This game takes a different approach with horror. Instead of random pop-up jump scares, it'll try to creep you out by getting inside of your head with things such as floating books and evil eyes. The only issue (if it can even be called that) in my opinion is the lack of a save system, but when this game is as short as it is, there really isnt a point to a save system, so mabey its just me fussing about over nothing.
