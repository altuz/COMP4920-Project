These developers didn't take the only review so far ...my original review found below, being negative and basically saying this game is too early in its development status to charge $30 USD.  \n\n..These developers LISTENED to me... and to the other people in the community forums saying that this game is asking too much money for it's early state of development!\n\nI will leave my original review unchanged below just so that viewers can see my original first review based on this games original $29.99 USD price tag at it's early access launch.\n\nBut because of the developers listening to this only review so far... and the other posters on the forums here... I must say that I LOVE this kind of professional response so quick from them.\n\n..They didn't blame me for having an insufficient computer or blame the way I played their game.\n\n..They didn't make excuses of any kind.\n\n...They simply listened and dropped their price in half, and are offing refunds to anyone who purchased this game at it's original price tag for early access of $29.99 USD.\n\n....And for that reason, and because I do believe this game certainly shows a ton of potential... and also because I can see most users getting $15 USD worth of fun out of this game in its current state, then I am CHANGING my review from a negative to a positive review.  Obviously, changing the price doesn't fix the problems, bugs, or make the game itself any different.  But what it does do is shows me that this development team listens to feedback which is HUGE!  I do believe they will fix bugs and continue to give this game updates and make it better and better as well.\n\nIt is now worth it's asking price.  And it has developers who listen and react quickly to criticism rather then act like cocky jackazzes who make every excuse in the book (we've all seen too many developers like that, right?)  \n\nThank you developers for listening.  And reactiving professionally.  You have my support now, and I will in turn play your game more, upload more videos, and share why \"MyDream\" is worth it's new asking price!\n\n....If only more developers were like this!  Other developers can and should learn from this!  :-)\n\n******************************************************************************************************\n\n---- EVERYTHING BELOW SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WAS BASED ON THIS GAMES INITIAL ASKING PRICE OF $29.99 USD AND BEFORE THEY SHOWED THEY CARE ABOUT LISTENING TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND REACTING QUICKLY AND PROFESSIONALLY.   THIS ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW WILL REMAIN UN-ALTERED, HOWEVER  WHAT I STATE ABOVE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS MOST RECENT REACTIONS FROM MYSELF ON THE VALUE OF THIS GAME, THANK YOU. ---\n        -----------------------   ------------------------------   -------------------------\n\nWatch My Video Review At This Early Access Launch Here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92lNiAhKn28\n\nOkay, against my better judgement, I bought into this game.. another early access sandbox voxel world game at what seems like a hefty price.  \n\nAfter 3 days, not a single review has come in for this game, and I decided to be the first one to buy it, play it, and give all of you out there my 'honest' thoughts and opinion as to whether this game is worth it right now.  The key words being \"right now\" as of February 23, 2015.  Things can change over time, and this game could be completely different and much more evolved in two or three months then it is right now, just three days after it's Steam early access launch.\n\nSo... is MyDream worth it's asking price?\n\nIn my opinion, as much as I want to like this game... my answer is a firm NO.  I think that answer would apply to most people who might be looking at this game with interest or curiosity.  For most people, I think there are better options out there for your money.  \n\nMinecraft is cheaper right now and offers tons of player support, community add on, mods, texture packs and more available for free.  \n\nCreativerse right now is $10 cheaper, will be free-to-play sometime in the next 6-8 months likely and I believe is much further evolved and more playable then is this game.  \n\nIf creating quests and placing treasure and loot and monsters is what you are looking for, then please take a strong look at 'Fight The Dragon' at half the price of this games current asking price.  Fight The Dragon is much more complete and fun in my opinion then this game is currently.\n\nAll of the above options would be my recommended options for people looking at this game to consider first.  There of course are always exceptions to the rule.  I'm sure there are some people who love creating things that might easily get their moneys worth and be happy... but again.. I think that kinda person would be an exception rather then the typical onlooker curious about this game.  Most people will probably feel a little scorched for their dollar paying $30 for this game right NOW in the state it is in currently.\n\nRight now, there just isn't enough finished tools in the game, nor enough players actively playing or even on this game's own websites forums to support their asking price.  Again, this is only my opinion... and I really WANT to like this game and give it my thumbs up, but I just can't honestly do that now.  I will come back and re-review this game in four to six months and see how much has changed and if I feel differently at that time, but for now, I have to give this game a thumbs down.  (If it were half it's asking price now of $15 USD, then I would likely give it a pass, but $30 is just far too much for what you get now I believe)\n\nIf you are looking for specific reasons as to why I say \"NO BUY\" on this game now, please watch my video above, at the top of this review.  You should see many specific reasons in that video as to why I give this game a thumbs down review currently.\n\nI hope that my honest review here has helped save someone some money and more importantly saved them the disappointment I felt with this game at it's current early access state of development.\n\nSorry devs!  I DO see a ton of potential for this game... please keep up the hard work!  I'd love to be able to play this game in a few months and change my opinion around 180 degrees and become a supporter and lover of this game!\n\n\n- Zaxx", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424679944, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1424743568, "recommendationid": "14607621", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548693", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469930455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561198019395201", "num_games_owned": 272}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "1", "review": "It's not VR!!!

Do NOT buy this game. After playing Minecraft for quite some time, I thought to myself that I wanted to try something new. I found MyDream on Steam, and figured that I would give it a shot. When I start the game, I am being met with a title screen, having no sounds at all. On this title screen, there are two strange characters; waving their hands to you. Suddenly, one of the characters picks up a \"magic\" glove, and shoots the sh*t out of his other friend.\n\nPROS\n- Beautiful soundtrack playing (once you start the game).\n- Piano like sounds when you scroll through your inventory.\n- The skies are amazing.\n- A lot of content.\n\nCONS\n- The game spikes, no matter what resolution you put it to ( I have a beefy computer).\n- Mouse Sensitivity too high; no matter the settings.\n- Complex crafting system you don't even want to bother learn.\n- Not smooth at all. Almost like playing a Facebook game.\n- Graphics are basicly skyboxes, emitters and textured chunks.\n\nThe game is not cute or cozy. It looks more like a weird dream rather than anything enjoyable. Lack of understanding gives you a really painful chill down your spine. There were only three or four positive comments; no negative ones at all. That is also strange. Especially when the game has been stated to have been out for a full year, and it still looks like this? Its also stated that the developers are constantly working on bringing new content into it. Why would someone leave a game in this state for over a year, still working on it..?\n\nPlease.. Just. Go play Minecraft. Minecraft or Terraria.
