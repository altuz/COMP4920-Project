We are presented with a plot and characters that are both a mystery, and they will remain like that for most [spoiler](more like entirely)[/spoiler] of time. Meaning that the story and characters aren\u2019t so developed like in Narcissu, so if you don\u2019t like to have unanswered questions in stories, I recommend you to skip this title.\n\nI felt like I was on the place of the MC; things happened very fast, and there was just little explanations for them. Everything is surrounded by mystery, rain, sadness. I thought I was going to get bored/annoyed by that, but I didn\u2019t. And just like how it started, it ended: brusquely. It was a single situation that didn\u2019t branched out of it. It\u2019s a good kinetic VN, not a masterpiece, but it\u2019s interesting. Now, I must say that Ame no Marginal is very overpriced for such a short story. I recommend getting it only on sale or better, in a bundle.\n\n8/10.
