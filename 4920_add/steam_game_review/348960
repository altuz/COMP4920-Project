Thus, I have read and reread both [i]Iliad[/i] and [i]Odyssey[/i] more times than I can remember in my years. As being classical epics of Homer, they portray the Trojan War - a tremendously detailed bloody narration of never-ending epic carnages and its political attachments - and Odysseus' journey back home to Ithaca from the Trojan War: both a mythological and psychoanalytical journey of transcendence and growing up. This little HOG, coming from a small Russian developer basically butchers the epic of Odyssey.\n\nThe game starts up with a narration of the Trojan War and the presentation of the legendary product of Odysseus' famous wits and wisdom: the Trojan horse. We take on the joy of watching Odysseus and Agamemnon as best buddies. Then, we follow Odysseus through his many journeys, solving his famous adventures through HOGs and basic puzzle scenes. We see him becoming a chef for the cyclops, a friendly visitor for Helios, Poseidon and Circe; and finally, a returning hero who'd use a bee coven to get rid of the suitors of Penelope! Sorry for presenting spoilers on that part, but it really hit some nerve for me.\n\nAs you can see, the epic is HEAVILY watered down to be reimagined as child friendly - no violence, sexual encounter or political subtext - which I found to be greatly distasteful specifically for this tale. Any original tale, epic or story can be watered down to be kid friendly. I do not have any major problems with the idea, considering that Disney has been doing so for decades and pulling it off as marvelous work. Yet, the Odyssey is really a bad choice to be retold through a HOG for a new developer. It is an established tale that would create specific expectations - contrary to many other tales from Greek mythology - and picking such cumbersome work without much subtext or experience usually ends up as a disappointment. In my opinion, such was the case for this game. If this would be a completely new tale without the name of Odysseus, I'd probably be at least okay with it.\n\nAs a HOG, [i]Odysseus: Long Way Home[/i] isn't anything masterful either. It sure is buggy, works quite slowly and aside the beautiful artwork, animations act so clunky and unnatural that you'd be creeped out watching Odysseus move or Circe talk. There is no voice acting. Puzzles are ordinary - not hard, not easy. HOG scenes are a bit repetitive, using same 2 scenes per act over and over again. There is no map, because there is only 3-4 areas for each chapter and a lazily done audio song swirling in the background.\n\nOver all, I'll pass and give a down vote for the butchered storyline, pretty yet slow display, run-of-the-mill gameplay and distorted animations. There are many great HOGs out there for your enjoyment, hailing from A+ developers or small firms telling original stories. [i]Odysseus: Long Way Home[/i] is not one of them.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453742723, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1453745416, "recommendationid": "20750770", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594081", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427204959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 60, "steamid": "76561198065698858", "num_games_owned": 241}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A cute little point and click hidden object game BUT it is [u]buggy as hell[/u]!\nI have to go back to the main menu any time I click on an item to pick up (it doesnt put it straight in my inventory).\nAlso, I have to click back to the main menu every time I finish a hidden object puzzle as it doesnt show which items I've already found and it also doesn't give me the one item at the end of the hidden object scene. \nThis is very frustrating and makes playing the game quite a tedious task.

There are no voice-overs, so all the conversations have to be read, and the writing is awful. \"Thank you for your help. I would never have been able to do that on my own.\" And the main character, rather than the warrior and adventurer he should be, is instead, Mr. Goody Two Shoes. Ready to help anyone who asks.

Crew sink the ship through stupidity and greed .... he doesn't even lose his temper! ... oh well, you go over there while I look for food!)\n\nOverall, if you are bored of the typical supernatural settings that most HOGs are addicted to, Odysseus is a solid game and a nice departure for a few hours into a very different world.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467808016, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1467808016, "recommendationid": "24132899", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501424", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432320135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 655, "steamid": "76561198163802904", "num_games_owned": 151}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "good game but a little to short", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432322111, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432322111, "recommendationid": "15944580", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499437", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1426562624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 223, "steamid": "76561198063193728", "num_games_owned": 305}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun point and click.\nYou relive the jurney back home of Odysseus.\nLove it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426562799, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1426562799, "recommendationid": "14928773", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501986", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450218847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11, "steamid": "76561198018592948", "num_games_owned": 185}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "New mac it starts lagging 2 minutes into the game:(:(", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450218908, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1450218908, "recommendationid": "19720284", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496271", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442421347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 564, "steamid": "76561198202378905", "num_games_owned": 15}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If your huge fan of hidden objects it offers heaps ... i found it tad old but still enjoyed it\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442420674, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442420674, "recommendationid": "18059174", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447748297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 260, "steamid": "76561198159824306", "num_games_owned": 31}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It was so broken, I couldn't beat the game.
