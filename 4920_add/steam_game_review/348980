Think of it as the first person equivalent of a tablet game where you route objects from point A to point B. But do clumsy platforming on invisible platforms.\n\nGame starts off with a portal style facility intro and it the minimal aesthetic might get you but every loading screen talks about upgrading your HUD or using the prompt to sort of... hack into the level and whatnot but as far as I could tell none of these features are actually implemented. I have tried every level I could to use the prompt to no avail. As far as I can tell this is just a mouse and directional arrow and jump game with some occasional platforming. Most of the levels I went through felt like placeholders and were way too simple to even qualify as real content. As your eyes adjust you realize that the minimal aesthetic still looks rather cheap at least the ambiant audio is nice and relaxing. This game cannot do physics, it affects jumps but mostly it affects the darned ball routing, levels that a toddler could figure out take up to ten minutes to execute.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503011694, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503011857, "recommendationid": "34317048", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 8}}
