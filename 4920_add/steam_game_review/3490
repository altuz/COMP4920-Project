Outcompeted by better offers in the genre and even some free flash titles.\n\nReview: This is a lot like a bubble game, instead of having different colored bubbles you get one of four random objects with distinctive shapes. Instead of matching 3 you gotta fly in the object in the matching slot on rotating discs higher up on the screen. The discs bounce around and if you hit a higher disc it will fill lower discs on its own and there are silly powerups falling down. You cannot aim and just strage left and right and click. Hitboxes are pretty generous and if you fail you can catch what you threw away back to prevent losing a life. All in all its a pretty mundane experience, trapped in low resolution, no Xbox360 pad support and a rather uninspired setting."}]}
