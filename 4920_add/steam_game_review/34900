I dont mean I was just a bit sad every once in a while. Every day would come new reasons for me to hate myself. To dispise myself. When I looked in the mirror I was repulsed by what looked back. The kids at school made fun of me which led to me hating myself even more. I felt like I was slowing being dragged into a dark cold abyss. I tried sports, tv, video games, books, music, anything to get my mind off of my self hate. It got to the point I hated myself so much I would punish myself by cutting my wrists, calves, and stomach. The worst part was at night. Laying in bed alone with my thoughts. Oh my thoughts were the worst. While I tried to go to sleep my mind screamed at me how pathetic I was, how I would die a virgin, how I will never accomplish anything. I couldnt take it anymore. I found a rope in my garage and googled how to tie a noose. While tying the noose I saw a game reccomended to me on steam. That game was \"Bad Rats\". I decided I would kill myself after checking out this game that only costs a dollar. This game. Bad Rats. It saved my life. I loved the rats. I loved the cat. I loved everything about this game. For the first time in my life I felt joy. This game makes you feel emotions. When I would beat a level I would cry tears of joy that all my hours of hard work had paid off but I also cried out of sorrow for that poor cat who's life I had ended. His big sad eyes. This game completely changed my life. It saved me from myself. If you or a loved one suffers from depression I beg you. PLAY THIS GAME. It could be the difference between life and death"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504935737, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506566", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34829804", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198146432496", "num_reviews": 48, "last_played": 1504081398, "num_games_owned": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 120}, "timestamp_updated": 1504935737, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Enjoyable."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506086487, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505356", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35127666", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242548172", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1506219907, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "playtime_forever": 104}, "timestamp_updated": 1506086487, "received_for_free": false, "review": "evidently, this is the best game on steam"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505986242, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507166", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35100770", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198345163162", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506068857, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 307, "playtime_forever": 307}, "timestamp_updated": 1505986242, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I think this is the second coming of Christ."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506292447, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507974", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35192114", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128768992", "num_reviews": 22, "last_played": 1503096129, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 23}, "timestamp_updated": 1506292447, "received_for_free": false, "review": "its good\n\nmy wife left me to marry the terrorist rat"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504983277, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504165", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "34844252", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198043311890", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1418954177, "num_games_owned": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 115}, "timestamp_updated": 1504983277, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Shoutout to the guy who actually bought the trading cards from me, letting me get a slight profit from this game when it was $0.06.

Press people will tell you that there\u2019s a bottleneck of too many artists covered by too few media outlets who always want to talk about something new. Managers will tell you that there\u2019s too much money to be made on the road, so the album cycle goes on and on to support that. Artists may even feel pressured by reviewers and themselves to go into a deep stasis, only to emerge again when they\u2019ve reinvented themselves into a newly revamped and retooled model, as opposed to just capturing time in a bottle and offering more to their catalog. At times, even fans have adopted this rule as well and are almost shocked when their favorite artist is able to release an LP already after two and a half or three years of waiting (let\u2019s call this the MBV-effect). Lucky for us, Mac DeMarco is old school in his approach: when Mac wants to make a record and he has the songs ready, he makes it. \n\nLike the days of Steely Dan, Harry Nilsson or Prince releasing a classic every year (or less) comes Mac DeMarco\u2019s Another One, a Mini-LP announced almost one year to the date of the meteorically successful Salad Days. The album was conceived and recorded entirely by Mac in a short period of time between a relentless tour schedule. At his new place in Far Rockaway, Queens \u2014 a neighborhood as east as you can possibly be before hitting Long Island \u2014 you can live in relative isolation despite technically still being in New York City. This left Mac with nothing more to do with his down time than to make music. Another One is an eight track release of brand new songs, freshly written for this release and each of which expand the arsenal of Mac\u2019s already impressive catalog. \n\nCentered around a pump-organ riff and lilting vocal melody that is somehow both haunting and warm, \u201cA Heart Like Hers\u201d is a track that shows the maturity of Mac\u2019s progression as songwriter. It\u2019s a little bit more refined, a little bit more sophisticated, but nonetheless still retains the guts and soul of any classic Mac track. Opener \u201cThe Way You\u2019d Love Her\u201d has a playful swing to the chords and a guitar solo that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on a mid-period \u2018Dead\u2019 LP, Mac\u2019s new favored listening past time. The overall feeling of the LP is lost love, or perhaps love never found, a topic that the world never tires of and one Mac can move through without it being a dour and somber experience. Title track \u201cAnother One\u201d and stand out \u201cWithout Me\u201d exhibit this bittersweet sensibility in lyrical and musical context, both melancholic and romantic, blurring the line between happy or sad nostalgia. The record leaves you with the same satisfaction as an old Bogart movie: he\u2019s still the hero, but he doesn\u2019t quite get the girl. \n\nIt\u2019s odd that despite working at the same pace as artists like Creedence, The Byrds and The Rolling Stones, coupled with an equally unending schedule of touring, press and recording, Mac is still labeled as a slacker. With two full-lengths and two EPs released and hundreds of sold out shows performed in the last several years, a recent late night television debut on Conan following a special guest performance on The Eric Andre Show, it seems, as Mac DeMarco nears his 25th birthday, there\u2019s not a slack bone in the man\u2019s body, besides maybe his a penchant for wearing comfortable clothes. You need comfortable clothes to work this hard anyway. Great singer/songwriters (Elton, Joni, Neil) don\u2019t need to reinvent themselves; they just need to keep going and let the songs out in the world. If you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t think it\u2019s been too soon since Salad Days \u2013 and you\u2019re actually about to freak if you don\u2019t hear more \u2014 here\u2019s Another One."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506288790, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35191316", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198059916600", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1421366242, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 21}, "timestamp_updated": 1506288790, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Never played it 10/10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506388539, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35213599", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006052696", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506388499, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "playtime_forever": 28}, "timestamp_updated": 1506388539, "received_for_free": false, "review": "possibly the best game ive ever played"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506740253, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35320541", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198259481627", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506726042, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "playtime_forever": 247}, "timestamp_updated": 1506740253, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Quite a puzzling game"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505438004, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500830", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34961257", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198330565079", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505629400, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 446}, "timestamp_updated": 1505438004, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Very challenging puzzle game, took me 7 hours to beat first level."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506531317, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35245424", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198030569803", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1384744948, "num_games_owned": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 38}, "timestamp_updated": 1506531317, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Just me and my \ud83d\udc95daddy\ud83d\udc95, hanging out I got pretty hungry\ud83c\udf46 so I started to pout \ud83d\ude1e He asked if I was down \u2b07for something yummy \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udf46 and I asked what and he said he'd give me his \ud83d\udca6cummies!\ud83d\udca6 Yeah!
