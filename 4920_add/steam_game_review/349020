Avoid. Bad product\n\nReview: The concept is interesting: Instead of a bunch of little railways and hard to hit targets, there are energy cubes floating around the middle of the table. Hit those and a portal opens, and little ennemies start appearing, hitting them with the ball scores points, and makes the game trippier to look at. Sound effects and music were both pretty good, and the black and neon style was also fitting. But where it falls apart is the bad paddle hit detection, the oversided paddle and the tiny ball, a ball physics that is worse than the pinball thrill series (and that is quite something right here) and finally a key mapping for Xbox360 thats outright broken with no way to start ball spring, left stick for left paddle and A for the right paddle.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494682555, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505094286, "recommendationid": "31724307", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 6}}
