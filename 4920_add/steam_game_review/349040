It just seems the PC adaptation was made with only the gamepad in mind. Wether or not this is a smart approach to releasing a game on PC is debatable.\nJust saying don't buy without a gamepad or you will have a hard time and it will piss you off. A lot :/ .\nAnd also make sure your HARDDRIVE ALLOWS NTFS otherwise you won't be able to install.\nPLEAS LIKE THIS SO EVERYONE CAN SEE. \n\nI hope this helps.\nI still recommend the game if you like the naruto universe.But buy it only if you have a gamepad.\nGreetz Kevin", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505148959, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505149132, "recommendationid": "34886482", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538716", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505833529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 732, "steamid": "76561198163746913", "num_games_owned": 7}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is the best.
