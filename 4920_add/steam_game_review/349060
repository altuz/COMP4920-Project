A lot of the art had to be stretched to fit a normal screen so it was quite pixalated.\nIt's also unexpectedly laggy, you'd think it would run smoothly since it looked like it would run fine on a 10 year old computer, this would get a lot worse when you have something selected and you can move it around without holding the mouse botton down unlike a touch screen, at that point the game slows down below 2 FPS.\n\nThen i tried Fruits Inc. 1 and found it much better. Everything was much more responsive. I thought i could recommend it until i found out the game is broken and you can't buy resources which are needed past level 5.\n\nBoth games would actually be fun to play, both are short and not much in terms of story but interesting enough to play, the sequel is still playable although both would need to be fixed, but until then because of the reasons above i can't recommend them, not even on a sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443742007, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443742007, "recommendationid": "18282842", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513013", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432130716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 253, "steamid": "76561198027424772", "num_games_owned": 517}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fruits Inc. Deluxe Pack brought to you by Manifesto Game Studio. This deluxe pack contains Fruits Inc. 1 and Fruits Inc. 2 games. These two games can be accessed through their folders within the Steam client folder (specifically \"steamapps\" folder.) The game's shortcut from the installation process will launch the second game. Hench why I have mentioned that these two games can accessed from their folders within \"steamapps\" folder.\n\nThey are both time management games. Each of the levels has be completed within the time limit that is assigned. This is only if you want to earn either a gold/silver trophy. However, I think that the time that is given is generous enough. Most of the levels can be finish with a gold trophy. If you had plan ahead before hand.\n\nAsides from earning gold/sliver trophies for each levels. There are various achievements to be earned from these two games but they do come with certain requirements. And they require sometime to earn them.\n\nEach of the levels has different assigned tasks to complete. The tasks are rather straightforward: Building Food Manufacture Buildings, Planting, Food Making and keeping the pests away. This might get somewhat repetitive for some.\n\nThere is no save feature, if you so decided to quit, in the middle of the game level. All the levels must be done in one sitting. Quitting in the middle of the level will force you start the level from the very beginning. Time and patience is required.\n\nAs for story wise, there is somewhat a story, but nothing much going on with it.\n\nRepetitiveness might a turn off for some but nonetheless still good to play these two games.\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/349060", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431573149, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1477709551, "recommendationid": "15819896", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508413", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441687809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 142, "steamid": "76561198027196898", "num_games_owned": 221}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a pretty straight forward time management game.  You grow fruits, you turn them into fruit products in your factories, you buy upgrades, and you complete your timed objectives.  This game is very similar to the Farm Frenzy series, but with trees instead of animals.  It's not very difficult and sort of relaxing to play, if you like this sort of thing.\n\nIt seems buggy for some users, though I haven't had any serious issues.  I can save and return to a later level, unlike what another reviewer has reported.  I did have the factory sound get stuck in an annoying loop, but quitting out and comimg back fixed the issue.  I got it on sale for about a dollar and half, and it is well worth that price.
