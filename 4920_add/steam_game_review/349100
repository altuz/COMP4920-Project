Downsides are they lose energy constantly so you need constant supply(kinda like needing food) and they can't heal like other characters, you need repair units.\n[*] Alines can become really strong end game. Downsides are they have increased hunger and can't use tech. They differ from other races with their ability to evolve. Completing certain tasks evolves your alien so you get stuff like better night vision, different attacks etc.\n[*] Psionic has complete different play style from other races.

The game is a bit hard, based on your style and which character you picked. For human I.e it is not easy to go out in the dark with extreme cold at the night or extreme hot at desert area without preparations, sometimes your death will be swift if you start without finding good supply and wondered in wrong maps without knowing! Sometimes you will venture long till you discover your character is starving and die with hunger, but in general the game because easier with each run, u discover how to use things in better ways, what expected from each map u visited, and what's ur character weakness and strength, all in the hard way.\n\nas you can expected, i played the game when it was like version 1.2 or something and followed it till the dev. decided to focus more on his space starship game, he had like 3 models without textures at that time, so hopefully there is something new in this version, if it is small and insignificant i would still looking forward to see it.
