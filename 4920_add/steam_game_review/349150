''No scoping'' is made not much better by very heavy mouse smoothing with no option to turn it off. On top of that, the game breaks down into a horrible texturefuck\u2122 every time I try to change the video quality presets. The animations are unfortunately sub-par although not gamebreakingly so, and the zombie Ai seems to have a certain preference for well... let's just say ''back door fun''...\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\nOn the bright side, it's a unique idea where you are put into the shoes of the person providing the backup or ''killingstreak'' instead of the person directly in danger of getting there ass eaten out and getting turned into a festering piece of rotting flesh, where you have an almost sometimes isometric/top-down view of the battlefield, and have to make stratigic decisions based upon clearing a path for your little green shirted friend. The music while rather generic zombie shooterish, is pretty good and can at times provide a nice brooding sense of tension. Overall I apreciate the developers mixing it up a little although as a highly score based game it's not really for me.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1] [b]7.5/10 Would get my ass eaten out by constipated zombies again.[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452484443, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1452485320, "recommendationid": "20462467", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505677", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462865996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 233, "playtime_forever": 67, "steamid": "76561198037080732", "num_games_owned": 968}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "damn,,, i was thinking that it was just a killing zombie spree,,, buuut it turns out that's a funny shooter =/.
