In my work, I deal with a lot of intelligence, codes and ciphers, and whatnot to complete my assignments. This is not just a game, but a training tool that I use to expand and strengthen my knowledge.\n\nFor those who choose to purchase this excellent game, be prepared to put some intense brainpower into it. The puzzles require a lot of thinking outside of the box to solve, as well as knowledge gained from Google, Wikipedia, and even Pastebin!\n\nWhile this game is not for everyone, there are some disturbing images such as mutated dead babies (real pictures, I think) I appreciate that it is realistic. There are some very creepy elements to this game, but not so much to make that the actual focus of it.\n\nIf more games were like this, I would definitely play them more often!

Those who have played Overwatch will likely know where this story is going, because immideatley after her announcement, an ARG was launched which teased the SECOND new hero in Overwatch, namely Sombra. Dowm the rabbit hole I went when I discovered Game Detectives. I became obssessed with these online puzzle, or ARGs as they're commonly called and when Alice and Smith teamed up with Game Detectives to make ARGs, I discoverd The Black Watchmen.\n\n6 months after my discovery, I finally bought the game. Though I am only 9 missions into the actual game, I'm already more than excited to see what secrets this game holds for me as far as the IRL interactions go. I've spoken directly with game developers, and interacted with TBW community a bit, and I have to say that Alice and Smith as a company has a gold standard when it comes to community interactions.\n\nThat being said, I asked the question \"How does this game even have a negative review?\" and that's when it all made sense. This game is most definetly NOT for everyone, but if it is, it will satisfy you to the core of your puzzle solving experience. If you're not already playing TBW, and you love paranormal/puzzle games or ARGs, I highly suggest playing this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505759374, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505759374, "recommendationid": "35050617", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499630", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462335075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 148, "steamid": "76561197976175106", "num_games_owned": 249}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A game about what Alex Jones sees when he masturbates.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506065077, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506065077, "recommendationid": "35122267", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492465", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505507184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 95, "steamid": "76561198197873415", "num_games_owned": 200}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Hey, you like the game?
