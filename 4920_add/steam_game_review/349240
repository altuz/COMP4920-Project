(Especially if it's on sale!)\nI've played all of the games by this creator and this one in particular is one of my favorites. \n \nPros: \n+Replayability as it has multiple endings (they don't significantly add to the story, however). \n+Adequate length for it's price. \n+It's incredibly charming for an RPGmaker game, it doesn't have those chibi squashed character models which I personally hate. \n+It's a beautiful RPG in both story and pixelart. Granted, while it may not be original it doesn't use garrish colour schemes or ugly palettes. \n \nCons: \n-Strategy guide is overpriced, and you can find the answers to your problems through the Eridani forums anyway. \n-You can't re-visit locations once you've moved on to finish sidequests. Ever. \n-One character is introduced far too late in the game to have any sort of development.  \n \nOverall, I would buy this game again because I love these types of RPG's.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498485762, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498485762, "recommendationid": "32815968", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504251", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
