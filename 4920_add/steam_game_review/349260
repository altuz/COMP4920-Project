Your ship is way too big on the screen and the aliens fall in the \"we're ALL kamikaze\" category. There are bullets to avoid but the biggest threat is the ships themselves. Some areas have bosses... models are fine but they don't give you any satisfaction to take down, no visual on how damaged they are, no phases or transformations. The whole story mode is bland and it feels like all levels are the same except for the background. Sometimes enemies come from the background, ramming you from the depths of your screen as you're trying to figure out if you can even shoot them. I do love the ships firing FROM the background.. it kinda sets the climate for war although you won't know at which point their projectiles can actually hit you.\n\nOther modes of play include \"you shall not pass or i lose\" where you fire a thin one shot kill laser on enemies that eventually move faster horizontally than you can move vertically.\n\nThen comes the blitz modes where you must kill a fixed amount of enemies to go to the next wave. In this mode you soon find out that the screen is filled with ships that you can't kill with your strongest ship and your big arse get rammed by the swarm. Yes your hyper charges a little faster when not firing.... not firing, you're kidding right?\n\nI'm sure some people will like this game but i think it's missing A LOT to even start to be interesting.

Anyways, the game has 5 different modes, each with their own mechanics [of which I am still to unlock blitz because I'm just bad]\n\nOnto my complaints about the game. \n\nFirstly it can sometimes feel like you're being ripped off a bit with the almost claustraphobic screen size, could have maybe done with a little more room to move, as it also appears you cant go fully to the edge of the screen either and your ship is a bit on the large side, which isn't a problem until you get the levels where you view from above the ship, then things get a bit tight, also with some enemies coming from behind and just sitting there acting clever because you can't do anything about them it can induce profanity.\n\nSecondly what I perceive to be a bug where, upon destroying a boss or finishing a level your ship will either be locked in place or go through a set leaving the area manouvre, but enemy projectiles stay on screen and it can lead to death because they can still hit you.\n\nFinally we have the enemies shooting at you from out of the field of play, or flying through your plane on a different axis I have no problem with a few uses of this mechanic, but it was possibly overused, and with some of the ships flying through, its was a little hard to tell when to be elsewhere.\n\n\nEven after finding more bad than good to say about the game, I have to recommend it. It's cheap, does pretty much what you expect from it and passes a decent few hours, unless of course, you don't like shmups.
