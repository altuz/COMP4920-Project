So anytime creepy Pedobear Domino makes some pervy remark my hate for him grows.  There are adult women in this game stick to them you creepo.  So I spent most of the game carefully picking choices that would keep them away from him like a protective big sister.  After awhile I decided I didn't want him to get with anyone. I can't even imagine the level of creepy in the uncut version.\n\nGame also cheats you in the endings. For no reason at all, it only showed me one apprentices ending instead of both.  Apparently, only the first diploma you complete matters. LAME.\n\nDon't waste your money.  There are plenty of other visual novels with much more interesting story.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497887119, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497887213, "recommendationid": "32568481", "language": "english", "votes_down": 38, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492663", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 31, "total_reviews": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
