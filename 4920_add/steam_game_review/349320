Apparently an update earlier wiped some people's actual saves. Just something to keep in mind. \n\nIf you're here looking for gameplay and not a fan of reading (which makes me wonder why you're reading this review), turn back now. Visual novels are basically voice-acted choose-your-own-adventure books with drawn characters and background. I'd also recommend you to turn back temporarily if you can't read Chinese, as currently, aside from certain menu options, it's completely in Chinese. The devs did say they'll release a free English translation eventually, but I don't think that'll come any time soon. \n\nIf you want to know more about Taiwanese history and don't mind strong anti-KMT (Chinese Nationalists) bias, then I highly recommend this VN. Even if you don't, I'd still recommend it, only for the sake of learning a bit more about that country that used to make a bunch of electronics while enjoying a decent VN. \n\nObjectively, The Rainy Port Keelung is a decent visual novel. Being an indie VN, the OP and voice acting can't compare to high quality Japanese VNs and was jarring to me at first, but I soon got used to it. I can't find fault with the background music, or the art for both characters and the background. \n\nWhat makes the VN great for me though is the setting, characters, and story. Set in a time where Taiwan is going through a cultural identy crisis between their Japanese colonial past and future under Chinese rule, the three main heroines parallel each culture. There is the super jealous childhood friend who was born in Taiwan, there is the kind-hearted and air-headed half Japanese half Taiwanese land lady who wears a yukata, and there is a tomboy ojousama who just arrived in Taiwan from the mainland. Rounding out the female cast is a cold, intelligent, calculating, and manipulative senpai who received education in Europe. The VN centers around the protagonist and his female acquaintances while cultural tensions rise and living conditions deteriorate around them. \n\nThe only major issue for The Rainy Port Keelung is its strong anti-KMT bias. Sure, all sides in the story have both good and bad guys, but the majority of the Chinese nationalists are clearly portrayed as evil. I can't even recall an evil character who identifies as Taiwanese or Japanese.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427967004, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428772935, "recommendationid": "15166648", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569187", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448824408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 522, "steamid": "76561198055309296", "num_games_owned": 677}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 33, "comment_count": "1", "review": "It's extremly emotional and it has a lot of sadness and horror in it.\nJust finished all possible routes/endings & unlocking all CGs, I can tell that so far that this game has a lot of impact for being a visual novel. It's extremly amazing, the graphics are really nice and the soundtrack is very beautiful. There's plenty of diffrent choices which changes the story somewhat and how the ending will turn out to be, so make sure you save each time you get to choose, incase you want to load back and try out another choice. \n\nAlso even tho there's a lot of good points about this game there is ofc also a few negative points such as there being no actuall translation to text besides the menu & interface being in english.... everything else is in chinese. But they did say they were working on getting the rest translated so I'm sure this won't really be a negative point later on.\n\n\nIf you like VN's that are diffrent or simply not like most other VN's (im ref to all these love/romance/dating happy VN's) then this game is for you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448819458, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1473252280, "recommendationid": "19369575", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530278", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469598178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1360, "steamid": "76561198037336774", "num_games_owned": 327}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": "3", "review": "NOTE: At the time of this review there is no English text available in this game. For now this game is Chinese text only.\n\nI originally bought this game because this game's story is centered around \"228 Incident (a.k.a 228 Massacre)\", one of the lowest point in the history of Taiwan. This is interesting because in today's time \"228 Incident\" is not a widely discussed topic among Taiwanese. For those of you never heard of \"228 Incident\", you can look it up on Wikipeida or read a book called \"Formosa Betrayed\" written by George H. Kerr (availble for free online) to get a good idea what it is.\n\nI strongly urge you to have a basic understanding Taiwan's history from its time under Japanese rule all the way up to \"228 Incident\" before playing this game.\n\nBack to the game, after finished all routes I have to say I cannot recommend this game. Rather than doing it like a typical review I will list the problems I have with this game,\n\n1. Spends little time on the characters.\nIn my opinion the biggest flaw with this game. Several characters have very little development going on. For instance we don't know why the younger brother of the main character is so obssessed with the Nationalist Government (or why he decided to aid main character's escape in the normal ending). For inexplicable reason the main character suddenly profess his love to his childhood friend on her route, even though the preceeding common route suggests no such romantic feeling. There is more, but you get the gist from it.\n\n2. Unbalanced route\nIn this game you have 7 endings: 1 normal, 3 bad, and 3 heronie's specific. Excluding the bad endings I can only give 2 endings a grade of pass.\n\n* Ming Hua's ending: Her route turns out to be the longest, and also feels more \"complete\" than the rest. Writter sure put a lot of effort on her development.\n* Chen Yu's ending: Probably the most believable route compared to the rest. If only writter put in more effort on her development.\n\nThe rest are either confusing or ended in an abrupt manner.\n\n3. Strong impression of anti-KMT bias.\nAt the time of \"228 Incident\", Taiwan was ruled by Kuomintang-led (KMT) Nationalist Government. While the government at that time was very much corrupt and oppressive, this game spends too much time reminding you that. As I play this game I cannot help but wonder if the whole point of the game is to deliver a strong anti-KMT message.\n\n4. Poor quality check\nThroughout the game various dialogues either were missing voices or mismatched voices. Did the developer ever play the game several times prior to its release?\n\n5. Ming Hua's voice actor\nIn the game, Ming Hua speaks both Chinese and Japanese. While her Chinese is okay, her Japanese is terrible. Ideally the Erotes Studio should've hire a Japanese voice actor to cover the Japanese portion.\n\nThere are also other issues like premature text break that I could complain about, but these are the 5 problems that I have with this game. Ultimately I cannot recommend this game, despite how unique it is.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469599394, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1469599394, "recommendationid": "24550560", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516269", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485927679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 362, "steamid": "76561198061700038", "num_games_owned": 159}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I played few after I buy the game.
