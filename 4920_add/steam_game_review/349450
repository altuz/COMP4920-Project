This new update has improved the game so much, still alot to work on but I must say I am having fun with it. There are problems, but the good outweigh the bad and it has amazing potential to be a fantastic game. I like to level up my home and myself, to fight off the creatures that come out of the woods. The tutorial is helpful, and its coming along nicely for an early access project. Do not expect super smooth gameplay at this point, but the developer is hard at work and is hands on. I would love to see this game keep updating, I know I will keep playing it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506210449, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506299487, "recommendationid": "35166536", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583327", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 11}}
