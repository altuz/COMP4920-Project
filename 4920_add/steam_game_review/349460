Otherwise there is a risk it will be easily forgotten few monthes later.\n\n1. It's how you die which feels to much of a random affair. For example, there are to many traps which instant kills you, which you have no chance of avoiding with your eye (personal skill) or character skill. This leads often to an instant death which you can't control at all which leads to a waste of time playing the game in the first place. Either make the traps less deadly (higher chance you survive them) or at least let you have a decent chance avoiding them, so the game feels less lucky based.\n\n2. I also hope developer invest more time making the game a longer experience so it takes longer time finishing the game than 1-2h or so. Yeah, I know it's supposed to last that long but it feels a bit short. Make the game last at least 5+ hours.\n\nOther than that I like how most characters and mobs looks like. I will update my review if the game becomes better regarding the issues I have with the game. I don't recommend this game as it is, but hopefully in the future.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434312986, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1434312986, "recommendationid": "16399252", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511847", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430131410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 241, "steamid": "76561197988094004", "num_games_owned": 664}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": "6", "review": "So i died about 3-4 times before i managed to beat the game. The game is very short or atleast it was for me. I finished it within an hour i believe. Half later of the game became completely unchalleging as i just went around killing everything with a scythe i found that restored like 20% of the damage i cause to my HP (I forget the exact percentage but it was around there). So i basically felt immortal and was just rampaging through the game. Oh and then came a glitch or i believe it was a glitch maybe around lvl 9 where every time i killed somebody i got an extra skill point. So within the hour of playing i had a weapon that made me immortal and later a glitch that gave me every skill in the game you can have. Oh and then i found some kind of orb i think and i beat the game. \n\nThis should be a game on some kind of third rate website not on Steam.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431935113, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1431935113, "recommendationid": "15882809", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506909", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445559449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 787, "steamid": "76561198037255067", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game could be fun,but it isn't.It needs work.If you encounter a spider either run away or try to get close enough to kill it.If you don't it webs you then eventually kills by spitting poison on you and there is nothing you can do.If they don't get you the spectre's will.I cleared the first level(despite the spiders) and then went looking for the entrance to the next level.(couldn't remember exactly where I had found it.)I had 2 healing potions 4 anti-poison potions a great weapon and armor,and full health.While looking for the entrance to the next level I was attacked by a spectre,then another and another and ..well you get the picture.I died trying to get to the stairs to the next level while at full health and 2 potions on me.This while playing on easy.Very frustrating.Vampire's are almost impossible to kill,no fun fighting one until you die.Also a couple of times I went to a pile of gold and the game just stopped working.I could move my mouse and exit the game but I couldn't get my guy to move no matter what I did.If they fix all the bugs,no pun intended,it would be a fun game to play.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436385037, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439487496, "recommendationid": "16947567", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502567", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430329096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 863, "steamid": "76561198101963252", "num_games_owned": 598}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game and if you like games like Tales of Maj'eyal, Dungeons of Dredmor, or even Desktop Dungeons you should like this. It does things differently when it comes to leveling up with all skills choices open on your first level up and you pick what fits your playstyle and whats happening at the time you level up. It also does health differently with no constant health regen between turns meaning you can only heal from potions and spells.
