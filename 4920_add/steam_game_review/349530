The World Tour is most enjoyable with its various challenges. If I have any gripes, it's that some of the shot challenges are very difficult, especially the backfoot one in the USA segment of the world tour, which seems to require more backfoot shots than the keyboard instructions show you. Also, the \"late cut\" challenge doesn't seem to recognise when I play a late cut. Mind you, it's very hard to press all the requisite keys at once.

There are no graphics options (can't even change the default (720p), nor is there a tutorial anywhere in sight. I'm not sure which is worse, but the lack of a tutorial is inexcusable as there's a bit of a learning curve to actually play the game (as there is a huge difference from Don Bradman Cricket 14). If you plug in a controller after you've launched the game, you have to close and re-open the game all over again. The mouse cursor is also constantly spinning, and doesn't disappear even when a controller is plugged in. You can move it to one side, but why is it spinning (and why doesn't go transparent for that matter) in the first place?\n\nThere's constant crashes and hangs, which just continues to show the game has been badly ported or supported. This is in stark contrast to Don Bradman Cricket 14, which really shines on the PC.\n\nVersus Mode doesn't even work properly (or at least it didn't at the time I wrote this). Sure, you can choose to play two players, but once you get into the game, it's just player one against the CPU.\n\nI'm a massive Big Ant fan, so I'm not sure what they were thinking on this one, though I have a bit of confidence they'll patch a lot of these issues that really shouldn't be issues.\n\n\nJust as well the price point is lower than on consoles, because it would be unforgivable otherwise.
