I'm sure they'll figure out how to do it. \n\nAfter playing this game, now I can see that colonizing Mars really is something that we can do. I feel like I can join in on the discussion on colonizing Mars, or at least listen and understand more of what people are saying; understand what's needed, and what the concerns are. I feel like I understand the kind of life the colonists will have, on Mars. After playing this game, my whole view of Mars has changed: it's another place; not all that different from Earth, but without any oxygen, which is kind of a problem. For the first time, I could imagine myself on the surface of Mars, and felt like I could feel what colonists might really experience there. I'm really glad I played this game.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective: colonizing Mars, is a lot different than playing Sim City. There are different challenges than in other games in this genre. Decisions are much more critical. If you go short on a resource you need: you could easily die. In other games, you can often go short on a resource for a while, and be fine. Not here. When I started losing power without realizing it at first, it lead to a very tense few moments as I struggled to overcome the problem. Then all my colonists died, when I could not fix the problem fast enough. It's something that could really happen on Mars. You have to search for the future problem and fix it before it can become an emergancy, deciding what is and what isn't going to become a majour problem is what really makes this game.\n\nIt's an easy game to pick up, too.

I haven't encountered any major bugs, but I felt that camera rotation and individual colonist management could be made more intuitive.  The tech tree and achievement system are adequate but seem a bit disconnected from the game play.  I found graphics to be more than sufficient since I don't believe more visual realism would add anything to this type of game.

The way the developers chose to build / extend your base leaves much to be desired, as you can only order the construction of a new module and then just assign an astronaut to perform the construction, but you don't get to decide where and how, or even have multiple astronauts speed up the process. This is all fine since it isn't about building a base on Mars, and with the statistics for the astronauts present, which range from temperature, oxygen, general health and radiation, as well as the environmental problems you'll have to cope with, such as landslides, dust storms and the increase in solar radiation during daytime, you will have your work cut out for you.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem that at least I have with this game; It feels a lot like work and there is too much on rails for a game like this.
