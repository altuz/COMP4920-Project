Started with a barbarian to learn the mechanics. Made some bad decision but I am able to finish the first 3 campaign easily. So far so good. I gathered enough points to upgrade so I have increased attack speed, attack and defense for my bloodthirsty barbarian. Rushing through Chaos Gods campaign gives me the first surprise: end boss wipes the floor with me. From 2 hits. WTF? OK maybe I missed something so let's get back to Skeltor campaign. End boss kicks my butt. Again. What the hell is going on here?\nAfter reading through the Steam forum (because there is no any in-game or offline manual) I found that this is some kind of difficulty curve, means if you upgrade your character monsters upgraded too. This works fine for thrash mobs, but bosses get CRAZY HIGH stats you never can beat them. Upgrading your character again will upgrade the bosses too and so on, and so on...\nI understand the concept but this is silly. Character upgrades should be rewarding not punishing. I have to go back to early levels to farm gold, upgrade my equipment to compensate (!) my character stat upgrades. Or start a new character and completely AVOID ANY CHARACTER UPGRADES which is ridiculous in an rpg game.\nAs much as I enjoy the game until this point I am so disappointed and can not recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498411552, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498411552, "recommendationid": "32780899", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520454", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "total_reviews": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 14}}
