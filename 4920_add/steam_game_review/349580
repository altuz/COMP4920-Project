Gameplay is solid and gunplay is solid. Servers run great for me, NA west coast... Game needs a little work as far as 1 round per game and wait time for playing... More guns would be nice and silencers as well.. MSAA is jacked up right now so you can use nvidia control panel...  Game play isnt clunky at all you run out of breath from running to quickly but the character movement and weapon draw is legit and fast/fluent. The developers are involved in the forum as well... Here is good proof they are on the right track and working towards making this a better game.. Every FPS is a moch of doom so to say this is a rip off of R6 Siege is silly cause they both been in development for the last 2-3 years...  My advice is if you dont like comtributing feedback for a somewhat incomplete game then dont BUY IT.. So annoying, it should almost make you take a n00b test and not allow the purchase to happen cause I keep reading alot of scrub reviews that dont get what early access is about...

But to burn a few good guys over your opinions of what happened almost 5 years ago is kind of un-fair, especially when we're trying to be as open and communicative (transparent) with our community as possible about our goals and direction.\n\nIf you have questions, feel free to ask them, about us, who we are, what we do, what our plan is, where we want to go, what we want the game to be. These kinds of things will help us grow as a community and a team to make a good game.\n\nAll this he-said she-said talk and slander, and especially miss-information being spread about the Nacho Games team needs to end, and trust and information must be built up so that we can accomplish a tight solid community of players and developers working together to make this game rad. That's what I'd like to see.\"\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439175054, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1439175054, "recommendationid": "17466868", "language": "english", "votes_down": 58, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505978", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441594086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 138, "steamid": "76561197960826568", "num_games_owned": 505}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1]Burstfire AKA Misfire[/h1]\n\nBurstfire is a lower bugdet knock-off of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.  The game mimics just about every feature of R6 Siege with a few things of their own like improved class abilities, but offers no single player.  \n\nI like tactical styled games so I purchased three copies of this game for my sons and I to play while we wait for R6 Siege to release. Yes I have played the Alphas for R6 Siege and subsequently pre-ordered the game even though it was glitch infested, but then I own all of the Tom Clancy R6 & Ghost Recon games.\n\nThis game has potential but needs a lot of work, a lot.  I believe that if Nacho Games developes a high quality indie game, say like Hawking, the potential is there for a highly popular shooter at an affordable price with the possibility of DLC in the future for maps, weapons, and skins.  Another possibility is community support which would be awesome. This game could be very popular if successful. \n\nMy experiance however was disappointing.  The match making system combined with a poor reputation of the publisher, Free Reign Entertainment, and adverse opinions of Burstfire being a R6 Ripoff has killed this game.  The game seriously needs to be able to start rounds with 2v2, not making players wait for 30 plus minutes for a 5v5.  For the two hours I have in this game, 92% of that was spent waiting in ques to see the number of players rise and fall but rarely hitting the required 10 players to start a round. I played three 2-3 min rounds in a two hour period.  I waited for just over two weeks logging in regularly to check ques hoping for a game but that just never happened so I got a refund on my $45 for my purchase of three games.  \n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\nFast paced tactical combat (R6 clone)\nDestructible environment\nOpen class system (Awesome)\nAffordable for most PC gamers (high potential)\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\nHorrible match making system (must have 10 player to start a round)\nNo BOTs (prohibits the ability to play this alone when you cannot find players online)\nGlitchy gameplay (can be expected from an incomplete game in an alpha state)\nPoorly optimised with limited graphics options (no sli support, FoV distorts your view as if your looking out of a fish bowl, and drops in fps)\n\n[h1]The Ugly[/h1]\nThe graphics (engine seems dated)\nHackers (didn't see any myself in my three rounds, but I did in videos on YouTube)\n\n[h1]Recommendation[/h1]\n\nI would like to see this game succeed but for the moment I cannot recommend this game.  Before I purchase this title again and update this review to a recommend status, I would need to see that the match making system was redesigned to include bots so the game is actually playable at any time, server support, and either some graphical improvements or an engine overhaul.  \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527631915", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442002165, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443664531, "recommendationid": "17987782", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507993", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446886287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 551, "steamid": "76561198022043184", "num_games_owned": 193}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "DO NOT BUY!!!.\n\nThe Devs have once again left a game un-finished and made a quick buck from everyone who bought it when it first came out. and lowered the price to well under half of what it was to get un-suspecting people to spend money on it.
