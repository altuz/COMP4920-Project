(this action has been countered through YouTube requiring the developers to file a federal lawsuit against me to keep removed, so expect the review link below to work again in a couple of weeks from the date of Apr 9, 2015)\n\nThe above actions taken against my negative review I believe show the shady nature of the developers and how they are trying to hide the 'truth' about their game.  Be warned and aware of this and be sure you take this into careful consideration before purchasing and getting burned.  \n\nMy gameplay video:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pk1rqRKxLQ\n\nInferior surival game made by an inferior development team.\n\nTrash.  \n\nWhat's trash you ask?\n\nThe graphics, the sound effects, the combat, every animation in the game, the textures, the lighting, the reflections, the overall design of the game\n\nEven worse then trash is the map design of the world.  This map and mountains is absolutely the worst map design I have EVER seen in any video game.  It honestly looks like the developer used a world creation application and spent about a whopping 15 minutes tops to generate the whole world.  It's lazy design and it shows.\n\nIt's overly obvious to me that this game is nothing more then an attempt to try and make a buck on the current popularity of survival sandbox games.  Everything about this game from the mobs to the harvesting to the combat screams two words: \"Rushed\" and \"Lazy\".\n\nBy far the worst game I've purchased on Steam so far in 2015, and quite possibly the worst game I've bought on Steam ever out of nearly 200 games now.\n\nMy rating at early access launch:  I give this game a 3% (out of 100) Utter FAIL!  (and yes I can rate games in early access and give them a score if they can charge us retail price money for such a game)\n\nAvoid at all costs.  Even if it were free, this game is a waste of time, hard drive space, and it's not even worth the time it takes to uninstall it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428475720, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1428606242, "recommendationid": "15260574", "language": "english", "votes_down": 43, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490398", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437937196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 172, "playtime_forever": 55, "steamid": "76561197985573260", "num_games_owned": 795}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An Alpha survival game with litterally nothing to do. \n\nFirst off you can only craft 36 items, those being mostly for building a base. No options to actually build any tools to gather resources with (like an axe to chop trees with). Couldn't find any wood lying around. An hour of game play, no wood what so ever.\n\nCrafting is very time sonsuming. Resources are very scarce. The only resources you can gather are the ones lying around on the surface, no mining what so ever. There's text above the resoucres to show what it is, so that means you'll not be able to chop the trees.\n\nSecond off, your guide Brad shows up in the middle of the night and tells you to follow him (1st game), except you can't see squat, so natuarally you can't follow him. \n\nYou don't actually mine anything, all resources are lying around on the surface.\n\nThere's no mini map, so you don't know where you're at. It's easy to get lost.\n\nYou get a drone, but the commands for it don't work, so it's completely useless. Also once the drone command window opens, you can't ever close it again. since it uses the same keys as your inventory.\n\nI just wandered around until I starved to death.\n\nI tried a second game, thinking I missed something. Brad never showed up, found the ruins, well, that's all it is, it just ruins, empty ruined buildings, nothing else. Also found the survivor camp (by accident), was told to talk to someone who wasn't even there. Otherwise the survivor camp is useless.\n\nYou can't even make a torch, so you have to use the resource gathering tool you start out with for light, it's very annoying. \n\nThe only danger you have in the game is starving to death.\n\nEventually I just got bored and quit.
