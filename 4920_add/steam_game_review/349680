You have five different characteers (with their own mech) that can combine into variations, each with their own sub-weapon, bomb and charge attack, and with a unique way of handling weapon upgrades. For a game of this type it's also unusually story-rich, with visual novel-style dialogue scenes between the stages detailing the relationships between the characters.\n\nWith a catchy and heroic soundtrack setting the theme, it's definitely recommended for all fans of old-school shoot 'em ups! It's also relatively accessible, with several difficulty settings.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505332631, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505332631, "recommendationid": "34926287", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 48, "total_reviews": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
