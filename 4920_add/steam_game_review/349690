Wait, really? It's another one of these games... Pshaw. Why can't these guys develop a visual novel about a catgirl witch school or something? Instead, this is yet another tale about giant robots and explosions. The world is doomed, only one pilot can save the day, blah blah blah. When is Astroport going to make a game that speaks to me? I can't relate to mechas, but I understand catgirl witches.\n\nSeriously though, this is something that I appreciate about Astroport, they make games that play to their strengths. ARMED SEVEN is a 16 minute game. You start it up, choose your weapons, and attempt to save the world. Aside from being easily-digestible, this shooter is very entertaining. \n\nWhat I appreciate the most about this game is that it's so accessible. Upon starting the game, you have a choice of weapons. The capabilities of the main gun, secondary, and charge weapon are clearly explained. While you're liable to have better results with certain weapon combinations, the best measure of your survival is being able to dodge bullets. Each of the four difficulties changes things up nicely, with enemies implementing new and more difficult attacks.\n\nSince this is a 16 minute game, you probably won't fret as much when you lose. There aren't any continues, but the lives and shields are fairly common. However, mastering this game is a very difficult endeavor. Your play has to be close to flawless in order to get the high-score achievements. For example, when your Mech is at maximum shields, you get a huge influx of points over the course of each stage. However, if you take a hit, you're actually knocked down two levels, which means you'll need two shield power-ups to max out again. Most of the stages in this game only have three power-ups. \n\nThe scoring system also revolves around destroying enemies as quickly as possible. Whenever a large battle-cruiser or exceptionally tough mech appears, you'll want to focus on them to get a larger multiplier bonus. Depending on your weapon set-up, this can lead to a multitude of situations. You might even have to put yourself in a disadvantageous position by leaving weaker enemies alive. However, you can't allow yourself to take damage because of the max-shield bonus. These conundrums, alongside the unique weapon-system, give ARMED SEVEN a lot of replay-value.\n\nAnd...well...that's it. Once again, this is a 16 minute game, there isn't much to talk about. ARMED SEVEN is a very good shootemup, and is sure to entertain fans of the genre.

They also made Satazius, which... *cough*\n\nAnyway, Armed Seven takes a lot of visual cues from Assault Suits Valken, which was released here as Cybernator for the SNES. However, it's a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up instead of a run-and-gun shooter. Unusually enough for a Japanese shooter, you have a \"life bar\", but it replenishes very slowly and gives a fairly long invincibility period after you're hit, making it essentially a retheme of the one-hit-and-you're-dead mechanics found in much of the genre. As with most shooters, it's fairly short at 7 stages long, but it's fairly difficult and very replayable.\n\nProbably the biggest point of difference this game has from the rest of the genre is the ability to choose your weapons from a choice of four main guns, four subweapons that fire along with your main gun, and one special weapon that requires charging. \"Better\" main weapons cause the special weapon to take longer to charge, so you have to choose whether you want a more effective normal shot or to be able to use your special weapon more often. The major problem I have with this is that many of the weapons seem fairly useless to me, and I generally just end up using the submachinegun as a main weapon, either the rockets or the cluster shot as a subweapon, and either the beam cannon or the guided missile launcher as a special weapon. This isn't quite so bad for normal gameplay, but several of the achievements require you to beat each difficulty mode repeatedly using each of the 12 weapons at least once, so be warned if you care about that.\n\nAll in all, it'd be hard for an Astro Port game that isn't Satazius to not earn my recommendation, so Armed Seven gets a thumbs up from me.\n\n(Note: I originally owned this game on Direct2Drive when it was released by Curious Factory, so my total playtime is somewhat longer than my Steam playtime.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425764011, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1425764200, "recommendationid": "14782723", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507559", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1425665900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 325, "playtime_forever": 163, "steamid": "76561198016432675", "num_games_owned": 834}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Solid but not spectacular shoot em up.
