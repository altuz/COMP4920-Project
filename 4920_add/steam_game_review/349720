Made it through the tutorials, got into a room with a friend of mine, and the game stopped working. I don't mean the game froze. The prompts which ought to have been showing me which buttons to press did not appear. The buttons, which I pressed anyway, did nothing. I could see my friend's character dancing along as happy as a clam while my character did nothing.\n\nWhat bothers me the most about this is that THE GAME COMES WITH AN UPDATER. My friend suggested I may have been missing some files, and I probably was. The deal is though, the updater cleared me and let me into the game even though I was missing those files. Just the knowledge that it has a standard MMO updater which serves only as a decoration bothers me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486343790, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486343790, "recommendationid": "29732658", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498234", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501744668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 364, "steamid": "76561198053435668", "num_games_owned": 4}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "no", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487747680, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487747680, "recommendationid": "30094382", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493805", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496367287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 308, "steamid": "76561198188543014", "num_games_owned": 33}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "8>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487654508, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487654508, "recommendationid": "30072620", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497388", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485581775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561198138823885", "num_games_owned": 11}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "i dont recomend this game AT ALL, its extremly hard to play and i am not getting any fun out of it, so unless you want you rage then i suggest not playing this", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485581884, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485581884, "recommendationid": "29534494", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494198", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452591266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 174, "steamid": "76561198261119891", "num_games_owned": 1}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Please makes Mac version to play.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486258042, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486258042, "recommendationid": "29707374", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492762", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464445292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 121, "steamid": "76561198132053741", "num_games_owned": 151}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Remember d good ol days", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488072024, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488072024, "recommendationid": "30182768", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490792", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484940575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 345, "steamid": "76561198103975326", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "some shitty game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488311860, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488311860, "recommendationid": "30247083", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487337", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 9, "num_reviews": 9, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 5}}
