Fun for a few minutes in between games or if you just want a quick run. There is a nice progressive difficuly with the mazes, reminds me of a more modern version of Chip's Challenge back on older computers. It combines Speed Running with quick thinking, memory and making sure you have necessary items. Instead of Keys the levels have different items such as boats to travel across water, mushrooms and different things related to the type of enviornment Fatty happens to be challenging. \n\nYes, you play as a Fat guy stuck in a maze. 10/10.\n\nAs for price, get it on sale. Only paid about $5 for this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424499880, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1424499880, "recommendationid": "14571432", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498702", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480203482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 351, "steamid": "76561198053048675", "num_games_owned": 58}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ok game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486933720, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486933720, "recommendationid": "29882942", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496689", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
