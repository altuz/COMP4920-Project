They added a new aspect to the game and I enjoyed the newer parts because it shows that they company itself is growing. However, there could have been a ton added into it. There is only three different species you can choose from, the classes are solid, but the hardest thing to get past was the difficulty. The early portions can be challenging but once you get past this, the rest of the game is a breeze. I could easily stun/confuse enemies until I slowly shot them to death. It gets quite repetitive. But the story is pretty good, I could easily replay it. I just wish there was a few extra things like more species to choose from such as robot or any other species that made an appearance, making minerals a little more relevant to the game, and difficulty scaling (because the end fight was way too easy).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505104015, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505104015, "recommendationid": "34876551", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504912827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 172, "steamid": "76561198012330764", "num_games_owned": 125}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Good game that continues the solid formula that the games have had whilst adding a twist to it.
