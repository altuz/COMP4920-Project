It's like hearthstone but you get to move the minions around the field and strategies way moore. I like the graphics and i like the whole concept of the game. There is only a couple of things, it's seems like if the other player gets ahead with something like 10 points it's really hard to comeback so the game is basically over at that point.

First to the victory total for that map wins.\n\n[b]Impressions:[/b] I played a few total hours. Got to level 7. Played against the AI. Some UI/control complaints but nothing you can't get used to. The full 3D Isometric view and animated units are neat looking, but I don't feel like the 3D adds to the gameplay more than it gets in the way of seeing everything you might want to sometimes. Definitely more board game than CCG. You draw random cards from your deck, but there's not really combo elements or much in the way of variability. I have a feeling if I went in to play multiplayer I would run into people with some essentially unbeatable card sequences. There's not much here right now, it's fairly basic for a CCG or a board based tactics game. It's not exactly exciting to me, but I also don't feel like I was cheated by buying the game. I got something from it, even if it's just ideas about how games like this can work and some do's and don'ts.\n\n[b]Boardgame players:[/b] Recommend if you like tactics games with random elements.\n[b]CCG players:[/b] Might be too basic if you're looking for CCG depth or variety.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1483317410, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1483317410, "recommendationid": "28922353", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500905", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481494228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 32, "steamid": "76561197985280916", "num_games_owned": 349}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pure multiplayer game.\nI'm sure it's a fine game, but i'm not gonna play it unless it have ether 1) a single player campaine, or 2) more depth in the gameplay", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1481494331, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1481494331, "recommendationid": "28317873", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498287", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454891575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 33, "steamid": "76561198025477286", "num_games_owned": 629}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I can't recommend this game because it keeps crashing on me.
