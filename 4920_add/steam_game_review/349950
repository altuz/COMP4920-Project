The difficulty in this game is right on par with Silver Surfer for the NES -- that is to say, it's next to impossible.  I get that this game is meant to emulate 80s platformers, but it did so in all the wrong ways.\n\nOne thing that bothered me greatly was the lack of checkpoints.  Every time you die, you start back at the beginning of the stage.  Unless, of course, I hadn't yet reached a checkpoint in the stage, which only compounds the difficulty issue.  Another problem is that, like many platformers of that era, the game relies on pixel-perfect jumps as a means of coaxing cheap deaths from the player.  Speaking of which, the game also tries to include the Ninja Gaiden style of wall jumping, but it doesn't feel as fluid as that game.  I find that a frequent problem in games of this type; they want to emulate Ninja Gaiden, but in the end all it does is make you wish you were playing that instead.\n\nThere's one level which effectively starts with a boss fight.  At first, the pattern to beat the boss seems simple: Get out of his way when he jumps or charges, and avoid the rocks that fall when he does this.  That's enough to keep you focused, but the game devs didn't stop there.  They also throw in these slug creatures that fall along with the rocks, so you have MORE things to avoid.  Why bother?  It's unnecessarily difficult.\n\nAs a lesser point, there are some glitches/bugs, though nothing game-breaking, as far as I can tell.  During your death animation, you can actually still shoot from side to side, which is funny even though it's pointless.\n\nI notice the game is marked as Version 1.5; I hope there are future fixes coming that address the insane difficulty, otherwise I have to say this game is not enjoyable in the least.  Thank goodness I only picked it up for $2.99, otherwise I'd be even more upset.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423791607, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1423791607, "recommendationid": "14440280", "language": "english", "votes_down": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520884", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433906801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 84, "steamid": "76561198173095807", "num_games_owned": 1844}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ths is a retro style game with level reset after every death.
