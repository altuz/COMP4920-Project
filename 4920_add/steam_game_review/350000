It doesn\u2019t have the polish to compete with classics like Raiden, and it doesn't have the mechanics that engross like Dodonpachi, but it is a fun game, and at a low price you'll definitely get your moneys worth if you are a fan of the genre.  \n\n\tClearly an homage to behemoths in the genre, Exostorm emulates great qualities from AAA titles and gets them right for the most part.  The beginning asks you to pick your primary and secondary weapon, more of which you can unlock after beating levels.  These are the only customization choices you can make, but the combinations and play styles are varied enough to keep things interesting.  The rest is a by the numbers score hunt, of which scoreboard is a harsh mistress to be respected, taunting you to become increasingly daring to chain your combos and increase your ranking.  To this end, it follows the familiar formula of memorizing enemy placement and bullet patterns.  \n\n\tIt's extremely easy to see and understand what's happening on screen, which is something a Shmup needs to accomplish.  Enemies are easy to see, as are their projectiles, and you're given feedback for damage and powering up.  The control of your ship is also satisfying, though a speed upgrade would have been appreciated.  Sound and graphics are also good, and I have yet to see any glitches in either area.  On the normal setting, you also have the opportunity to replay from checkpoints, giving you a tool for learning forming strategies rather than starting all over.  \n\n\tThe biggest disappointments are by far the letdown of the in mission presentation, and the lack of two player support.  Missions are started with a really cool cinematic teasing the massive forces you'll be facing like a giant moon destroying star ship, but then the missions devolve into waves of enemies, typical of the genre.  It would have been cool if we'd seen the sweeping grandeur of the enemy forces incorporated into the missions.  The lack of two player support is a real kick in the pants, because this game begs for couch coop.\n\n\tIt isn't great, but it is good, and a fun little challenge to see how high your score can get.  With enough variety and challenge to keep you coming back for a couple of hours, you can invest your gaming time and money a hell of a lot worse than Exostorm.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431741586, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431741586, "recommendationid": "15847335", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522267", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431709758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 325, "playtime_forever": 41, "steamid": "76561198016432675", "num_games_owned": 834}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Exostorm does a have a cool 3D aspect of moving through its world to it thanks to some good environment design, but the game doesn't have the oompf or that unique feature to make it stand out. The gunplay is competent but not that interesting, the lack of powerups and enemy variety at times really hurts the game from a replayability standpoint, and with an arcade normal campaign that's beat in 4 missions and under 30 minutes, you're really going to be stretching to get multiple runs from this game. While the hardcore mode gives a challenge, it just doesn't have enough to keep my attention. If you're really hard up for a shoot em up, then this may be something to look at, but otherwise, it's an alright first project but just doesn't have enough to stand out.\n\n+:\n[list]\n[*] Aesthic works in terms of 3D in a 2D plane. Makes you feel like you're really moving around the city.\n[*] Control is precise and you move where you want to move. \n[*] One or two interesting bosses can help liven up the game.\n[/list]\n-:\n[list]\n[*] Way too short, even for a cheaper game. Can be on normal in under 30 minutes.\n[*] It doesn't have a knockout punch, or really anything that really gets me excited. It's pretty ho, hum.\n[*] Find keeping upgrades at checkpoints seems to not really help the idea that death is a punishment in any way.\n[*] Weapon balance seems off, as some weapons are vastly superior to others, with no obvious weaknesses.\n[*] Slow nature of movement sometimes seems offset by enemy position in a bad way. \n[*] Lacking impact due to missing sounds at times like picking up a powerup or using a blast power. \n[/list]\n\nFor some gameplay and more first impressions: http://youtu.be/MaQ-R-ytbt4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431712398, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431712398, "recommendationid": "15841892", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501846", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448063244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561198005018530", "num_games_owned": 400}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's good, and for the price, you can't go wrong, but for me, no bueno.
