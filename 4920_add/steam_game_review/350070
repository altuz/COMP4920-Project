Although extremely frustrating. The control is super precise. You find yourself jumping from the exact same spot, trying to nail the hookshot and after the 3 millionth time you finally did it and got to the hard to get place. Some would call it rewarding...I call it booring, and in the end I rather play Super Metroid again for the 3 millionth time. Another thing about this game, yes exploration is fun but on the map you can see just to many possible exit points to unexplored rooms that make you revisit the same closed off rooms again and again (booring). It would have been good if the game mark the exits on the map as closed off, until you get the possibility to open them, for example by showing the doors color. Exploration is fun, but running back and forth is not and its 2017 so I refuse to use pen and paper again to write my own map and mark the blue doors, the red doors, the yellow doors etc. that should really had been done in the game itself. Still I recommend this game because it\u00b4s enough fun for the money it cost.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500183857, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500183857, "recommendationid": "33577488", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510958", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 261, "total_reviews": 286, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 25}}
