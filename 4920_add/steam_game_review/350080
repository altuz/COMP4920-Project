This isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it will give you a fix for wolfenstein for sure.  It's only a short romp through Draculas castle of abominations but each area and act feels unique and well designed.  The music is well composed but sometimes doesn't quite match or fit with what is happening on screen, it tries too hard to control the players emotions and fails in that aspect, a more eerie ambient soundtrack would have been more fitting I feel.  \n\nThe stealth mechanics are nice and easy to get a hold of, hide behind objects and eliminate key targets to prevent support from arriving. The cartoonish, OTT nazi enemies provide a dangerous obstacle with releatively good but fair accuracy and  a damage level which implores players to explore for extra armour, ammo and goodies. \n\nThe difficulty of the game has a wobbly curve, I beat the game on Uber in 8.2 hours completely blind, the challenge started to ramp up before petering out when the 2nd half of the game kicked in, without spoiling; the enemies became significantly less threatening and much easier to eliminate.  The final\u00e9 offered pickings of a challenge with me requiring a few retries, but with little variation or tasks to complete while fighting, the boss becomes a simple trial and error affair, a short one at that. \n\nSometimes I feel by beating this game using the stealth mechanic I did cheat myself out of some excellent battle and shoot em up sequences, there are arena type zones in each act where enemies patrol, you can choose of course, to go all guns in, but beating it with stealth seemed like the challenging and perfectionists option.   Overall, this game is a snack, a delicious snack that I'd happily have another one of.  You won't have a problem enjoying it, and its flaws are so short lived while it pushes you into the next hole of doom, you'll have forgotten about them while you splatter the brains of the SS across fine runic pillars.
