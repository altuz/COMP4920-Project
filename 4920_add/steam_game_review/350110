If you're a fan of the transportation and/or tycoon games, TO2 is right up your alley.  The 2nd iteration is a great improvement over the original game.\n\nTO2 adds new mechanics that give you interesting strategic choices.  They greatly enhance the game experience overall, while keeping the core gameplay of managing a shipping company and profitable route planning intact.\n\n- Competition again AI or human players applies some extra pressure on you to play better\n- You can buy subsidiary businesses in different regions which provide services to the players, like refueling or tugboat services.  You gain a weekly stipend amd also a cut of the profits any time a player uses that service in your region. This incentivizes you to strategize on which geographical areas you'll specialize in, rather than sailing the world aimlessly.\n- The 3 classes of ship specialize in gaining region points, making money, or a balance of the two.  Region points are the primary currency used to buy subsidiaries.  You need to choose wisely which types of ships you buy and when, so that you're optimizing between short-term profit vs long-term subsidiary investments\n- The sandbox mode has customizable rules and difficulty modifiers, so the game has a lot of replayability (not to mention online multiplayer)\n - The story mode is kinda cheesy, but it does a good job of introducing you to all the new game features.  It's also quite difficult to acheive all the objectives in each chapter, so it's challenging too.\n\n- Some annoyances have been removed from the game, like steering boats out of port.  This still exists as an occasional mini-game if it's a feature you enjoyed.\n- A lot of the criticisms mentioned in other reviews have since been fixed by the developers.  For example, when you start a new single player game, you can choose whether pause should be enabled.  The main reason you'd want it be disabled is to train you for multiplayer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499016403, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499016421, "recommendationid": "33141840", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524532", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497023559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4296, "steamid": "76561198163261811", "num_games_owned": 20}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Man, this is another awesome game!! This time, things are spiced up WAY more than in the original, and I love it for that reason! Bulkers and tankers that are new to this series make me feel that the original is miniscule compared to this!! Plus, what I really find interesting is sabotage. When you are playing against 4 players, either real, or computer, hard or easy, they just keep spamming the \"Sabotage\" button like there's no tomorrow! Customs helicopters, frozen accounts, and bribed subsidaries really spice things up in gameplay. IMO (in my opinion), this is the best TransOcean game yet! I highly reccomend this to anyone that is interested in companies. Plus, in the next game, I am hoping to see car carriers and reefers! Plus, if anyone turns down this game, how really unwise of them.
