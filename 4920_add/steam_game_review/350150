With something playable finally released, I decided to give it a go.  Unfortunately, the actual game play mechanics are awful.\n\n  Despite being a car combat game with a focus on building your dream deathmobile and watching it get destroyed in actual combat, trying to actually build a fun car is tedious.  The actual vehicle [i]construction[/i] is fine -- however, the developer decided to hide half the parts under a Call of Duty unlock system.  Great, another game to grind away at before I can even do anything.  Another issue is the game's money and cost system.  To put it simply, in combat, you are supposed to start with a basic car and acquire money to purchase bigger and better cars, all of which can be your personal designs.  The way money is acquired, however, is horrendous, requiring players to deposit money on \"pads\" -- a process that requires you to sit in park for three seconds with a giant bullseye on your head -- as opposed to just letting you keep any earned money in a manner similar to Counter-Strike.  Also, destroyed cars cost money for them to be replaced, meaning that one lost vehicle is all it takes to set you back to square one.  Players basically wind up in an infinite loop of never having enough money to actually do anything once combat begins.\n\n  The actual combat itself is lousy.  The only vehicle design that really matters is how many massive cannons are strapped to your car; speed is moot since the terrains are so mountainous you can barely drive four feet without rolling over.  The game provides little feedback as to when you've been hit; your car gets \"hit\" and it is nearly impossible to tell where your vehicle is suffering the most damage until half your car has simply been pulverised.  Did I mention that every time a part breaks off your car, your vehicle will bounce?  This basically turns every encounter into a whoever-shoots-first-wins affair.\n\n  Despite being in development since 2013, the game is still little beyond a tech demo with a basic AI, little in terms of actual game play, and costs thirteen dollars to boot.

I've been following this game since before that other game 'Robocraft' was released, and although progress has been rather slow, (only 2 devs) the main dev is hyper responsive and gives frequent dev updates. Unfortunately, since the game hasn't been advertised much (if at all) on the steam front page and it's not F2P (which is a good thing imo) it doesn't really have that big of a playerbase, which is extremely saddening to me.

And compared to its state two years ago, this has actually taken pretty big steps. Only the good parts didn\u00b4t change at all, e.g. the gameplay itself.\n\nwot is dis?\n\nThis actually is one example of a yet unnamed genre, I call it Build and Fight, call it how you want. So the genre of Robocraft and Homebrew (since they added guns now with the latest update). Gameplay is simple: Build stuff, destroy stuff, collect stuff and repair and build stuff with your collected stuff. ez. \n\nbuild stuff?\n\nYes. You get a nice range of parts and then you just build a vehicle out of it. How it\u00b4s used and built is up to you, whether you want a lightweight ram with dozens of engines doing 400 km/h or a giant a55 tank with dozens of cannons or something rather normal, depends on your imagination. Building itself is really easy, but also depends on physics.\nRemember: Even though you can put enough weapons on your vehicle to eradicate complete europe within seconds, you can\u00b4t expect your vehicle to do 150 km/h, like in Robocraft. The limit of how much you can put on your vehicle doesn\u00b4t depend on your player rank, but on the servers scrap limit. So, compared to Robocraft, this is balanced very well. Also, you can tune the suspension on your vehicle to edit the handling and center of mass.\n\nrange of parts?\n\nYou start off with a chassis and a cockpit. You can choose between three chassis yet, a small lightweight one for cheap and light vehicles, a normal one and a big one with enough space for at least 3 million engines and cannons. Then you build on energy generators (because guns need energy to work) and batteries, cooling parts  (because guns get hot while firing), armor to not die the second you get out of the garage, engines, guns and extensions to get more space you need for another 1 million engines.\n\n\ncan i play dis on my potato?\n\nYES YOU CAN. JUST DO IT. (sry)\nIf you compare this to other games based on Unity, this game has excellent performance and looks fairly nice.\n\nAny cons?\n\nExcept having almost no players, not really. This is Early Access, so you can\u00b4t expect this to be 100% bug free, but so far In the last year I played the demos of Scraps, I haven\u00b4t encountered one bug.\n\nThe End?\nIn my opinion, this is the greatest example of this Build and Fight genre. Robocraft is nice, but these idiotic rank limits and nonexistence of balance are really unnecessary. And to be honest, no one knows how long it will take until Homebrew gets into a well playable state. Buy this. Please. We need players here.

But it still has a bit more to it, you have to watch how much \"Scrap\" you have used and make sure you are not over budget. But you can always upgrade later in game in the build menu once you collect Scrap you ether took from another vehicle or found on the battlefield. In there is a new function where you can choose to Repair, Rebuild, or Repair and Rebuild, which is one of the most useful functions since I started playing. You can outfit your vehicle with ether a lot of guns for a high firepower vehicle , or a speedy vehicle with just a few guns but is quite faster. It all depends on your playstyle. You can also ajust your suspension, as real life physics goes the higher your vehicle is the larger of a chance it has to flip, your chassis or other parts will take damage if it hits the ground, its less of a thing to worry about if your into the cornering at high speeds. You really have to watch your weight once you get into the larger designs because a small vehicle can actually weigh quite a lot even when lightly fitted with guns. Larger engines are a must for even small designs, unless you like to sit around and get shot, which is always a laugh if you made your vehicle out of anvils. In order to get your guns to fire you need Generators and some form of Cooling, your engine can provide some power but not nearly enough for you to fire your guns, I will not say too much for those who hate spoilers. On the topic of guns you have recoil with each wepon, the machine guns have less recoil, so much less that its not noticible with a good engine, the cannons have some noticible recoil, especially once they get into the larger size. There are some plasma guns but they're useless(imo).
