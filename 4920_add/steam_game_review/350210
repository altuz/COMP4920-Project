Keep in mind this game is rather short, incredibly short compared to many games but if you enjoy shooting for fast completion times and making records, this game will keep you rather entertained and is worth the buy. With a starting price of $10, that isn't too bad; if you're still not up for it this game is definitely worth buying when on sale.\n\n[h1]Merits of Mighty Switch Force! Academy:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]New levels along with classic ones from MSF1/HD.\n[*]Up to 4 player co-op for all levels\n[*]Amazing music by Jake Kaufman [virt] (music from previous MSF games)\n[*]Replayability (aiming for below par or better times)\n[*]Local competitive multiplayer matches.\n[*]New looping mechanic adds another way of thinking to navigate. (able to loop from one edge of the screen to the opposite edge without damage)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Faults of Mighty Switch Force! Academy:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Can't remap controls for controllers (not to much of an issue, but would be nice to have the option)\n[*]Only 20 original levels, not including the classic levels.\n[*]Price can be considered high if you're only looking to beat all the levels and reach the end of the game.\n[*]Reused music from past 2 MSF games for this game; I recall 1 new song might've been used outside of that.\n[*]Zoomed out camera can be a bit distorting and seems unneccessary for single player, though some courses rely on this camera view heavily making it needed.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Overall;[/h1]\n\nThis game definitely isn't for everyone, but if you've made it this far and find this game interesting I'd definitely say this is a good buy.

It's very fun and can make you use your brain, but there are a few things that I feel need to be added or changed.\n-The levels are fun and can be done very easily, but that's almost a problem. I'm sure there are more levels on the way, but right now, everything was very simple. Maybe some more challenging levels could be added or the design of some of other ones can be changed around a bit, just for a bit more of a challege.\n-There needs to be some kind of a payoff. The other Switch Force games give a reward of some sort for completing the levels. Whether it be a costume or extra levels, there needs to be something. I don't know how anyone else feels about it, but I always feel like I've successfully completed a game when I get something out of it.\n-Multiplayer! The multiplayer system is a good idea. I believe that WayForward should expland on that. But if there's a multiplayer, there needs to be a drawback on the par system. It will have to depend on how many people are present. If there are two people, they will have 45 seconds to complete the map, instead of 1 minute. If there are three people they will have 30 seconds and so on.\n-Aaaand, for fun, maybe a concept art mode or gallery. Certain conditions have to be met to get this picture or certain conditions have to be met to get the concept art. You know, that kind of thing. It's not important, it just may add some more to the game. Give players something extra to do and really strive to complete every level without going over par.\nAll and all, this is a good game. Even though it's still in progress, I still had fun with it. I recommend this game to those who love the Switch Force series. For those who don't really know of the games, this could be a good way to introduce possible new players. It's not too difficult and other reviews could really add to this game.

It shows me that they still have new ideas to keep the game fresh. The last 5 levels were from Mighty Switch Force 1, and I had slowdown issues with it. Maybe because it's all in one screen with all the background stuff going on. I didn't get the chance to play local co-op, and there is no online co-op. As much as I want to recommend this, I can't.
