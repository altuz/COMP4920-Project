I bought a \"fast paced\" shooter with a unique style due to its 0g environments. What patch 1.4 did was that it removed the fast part of the game and replaced it with constant healing nonsense where you just chase each other around the map, trying to kill the enemy. 0g environments seem to be no longer part of the game, since no new map (except the tdm testing map) features them anymore. Tactics are completely worthless now, as everyone just picks the currently most overpowered characters. I am not going to talk about the wraith here, because he just became completely unviable as they removed the only thing that made him spacial and able to compete against his enemies: his mobility.\n\nAll in all, the game was superb before patch 1.4, fun to play, exciting, with a unique style, fast paced tactical and skill-based, that I already recommended to many of my friends.\nPatch 1.4 made this game look like a cheap standard shooter, without balanced characters, no tactial play, zero-skills-required, and absolutely no fun.\n\nI will update this review if something changes, but currently I have zero interest in playing this game any longer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506374521, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506374714, "recommendationid": "35210860", "language": "english", "votes_down": 50, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642254", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505727496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 508, "steamid": "76561197989140231", "num_games_owned": 130}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 88, "comment_count": "3", "review": "It's a fun game, but how can I recommend it if I haven't been able to even play it for over a week?

Bought after 1.4 went live. I dIdn't know what to expect because of the low player count, but just had to try it because of the sale.  \n\nSo far, this game is a blast.  In my opinion, way more fun than Quake Champions.  Its super fast. The anti gravity is a whole lot of fun.  The engine is solid, it runs without a hitch on my rig, and just feels right.  It feels like you are actually getting hits when you should be unlike some other games that feel like you hit them and you don't.\n\nThis game is nothing like Overwatch.  Don't even compare it.  The only thing that it borrows is the class system.  Other than that, it is a completely different game. I'd compare it more to Quake with even a bit of Call of Duty with the feel of it. Definately not Overwatch coming from someone who almost exclusively played Overwatch for an entire year.  \n\nIf you are on the fence about it, I say go for it. Im glad I did.

I will have a load of fun and keep the feeling that skill is something which only matters in this single game.\n\nThe guys saying \"this game is dead\" or \"it took forever to find a match\" are spreading FAKE NEWS, since they fear their \"other\" waste-of-time games might die once a new game comes up from nowhere. Do not listen to them. You might miss a secret jewel in the Shooter genre. I never even waited 2 minutes until I found an (\"Objective\") match.
