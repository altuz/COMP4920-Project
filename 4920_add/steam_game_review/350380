So what's my opinion?   I can summarize it in three words :  short but sweet!\n\nIt's definitely a high quality title, but it's also a short experience that will (only) last a little longer than 20 minutes. High quality because of the presentation, the beautiful visuals made with UE4,  the high immersion, the way they built up the mini-chapters (they get better as the experience progresses), and the way they alternate between VR and clips from the movie. Very well-made and certainly a good title to demo to your friends that never tried VR before.\n\nIs it perfect? Nothing is.  Personally I feel that you're pushed forward even when you would like to enjoy the scenery a little longer. So after a few minutes, the screen fades to black and you are pushed into the next chapter of the experience. There's zero freedom. It could also be confusing for people that haven't seen the movie. I can imagine they won't always know what's going on.\n\nLast, yes for 20 minutes it's very expensive.  This is the same comment that the Everest VR Experience received and I have to agree with that.  Price should have been lower.\n\nIf you love the Everest experience, you will certainly love this one too.  If you didn't or you thought it was too expensive, then skip this one.

The story of Mark Watney (which I loved in book and movie form) would be a *perfect* match for VR tech, and Vive Roomscale in particular. I was impatiently waiting for it to be released...and finally, when it came out this month, I immediately bought it (didn't really care about the price).\n\nWell... I do like the graphics. For the most part feels like a polished product visually; some parts even look great, both on Mars and in space. There are moments when I like the \"interactive movie\" atmosphere a lot; I think the combination of VR scenes and clips from the movie is very neat and really works.\n\nHowever when I think what this could have been (given the source material) I am sorry to say it looks like a trainwreck. The very few actual VR scenes, while not bad in terms of visual immersion, are, for the most part, just mind-numbingly boring. Sorting potatoes? Pushing buttons? Come on!!! Where is the roomscale \"walk on Mars\"? Come to think of it, I would have been perfectly happy just to be able to sit in the cramped rover (without a weird time limit) and, well,  EXPERIENCE it in VR... with may be a Martian dust storm going on outside. But whoever made this decided not to include *anything* even remotely awe-inspiring. Instead, they went with a small collection of stupid mini-games that feel like a first grader came up with the ideas for them.\n\nIn short: Somebody put in a lot of effort to make it beautiful-looking, but forgot to actually include the \"Martian Experience\". I am hugely disappointed and can't recommend it at all. Honestly, I don't care so much that I paid too much for this... to me it is much worse that they completely ruined this great opportunity.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1479852135, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1479852135, "recommendationid": "26753693", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525689", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482079467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561197968666437", "num_games_owned": 232}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I bought the game because I liked the book and I even liked the movie, despite knowing the book beforehand.
