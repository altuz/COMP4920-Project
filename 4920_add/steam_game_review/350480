Ideal for beginners in pc gaming or even for the one like me that doesn\u2019t have a powerful pc with huge graphic card and gaming hardware. It's a point with the mouse with 4 keys on the keyboard kind of game. Not the usual W A D as for moving around in a game. I would recommend it for kids 10 + Years old with some hints to give them in the walkthrough (free and link bellow) if they get bored not finding the next step.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=817202219\n\nIf you like the cartoon naive kind of sketchy drawings with vivid colors (see my profile for screenshots of the game)  well you'll be playing in that universe for 5.1 hours. It's charming truly. It's not very challenging itself once you know what to do and in which order. You need no particular skills, just logic.  The rest is pretty str8 forward. It\u2019s mostly about tasks to be done and ways to make it happen. There's not much fight that require speed. Mostly a chill, logic, relaxing game and nothing will bring you to a: \"hurry the f*** up..Oups.. and game over\" kind of moment. \n\n\nIt's a puzzle like game. Find the clue, use the clue, go forward or go read the achievements guide (link is up)  if you\u2019re going crazy turning in circles. And so forth. I've enjoyed it. XD \nNo regret what so ever to have paid for this game and the price was proper considering the amount of work they have put in it 8,15 $ (CAN). But considering it's a short game i would have paid less. Still, if it encourage the creators to make other games like this, wewt !!\n\nPS: If you are an achievements freak, plan to play the game at least 2 times. Or find a way to show 30 items to Perseus within the 5 hours. LOLL Take 2... Here i come. takes just 1h to achieve what you have missed after.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500918266, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500928556, "recommendationid": "33770726", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496026", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503804027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 222, "steamid": "76561198278995350", "num_games_owned": 20}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game started out being interesting but quickly grew tedious.
