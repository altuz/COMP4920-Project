In the game you basically just run errands and whatnot for the lawyers (and potential love interests) there. The better job you do, the more money you get in your paycheck, and if you neglect your tasks for too long you could get fired. Pretty straight forward. \n\nI really liked the game. Compared to other games made by Winter Wolves however, it's definitely not one of their best. The story is really interesting, the artwork is great, the gameplay is decent, the little extras you get after you finish a route are pretty cool. But they definitely could have done better. It took such little effort to complete it, and you could literally go on one date with them then the ending would be you getting married?? It just wasn't put together very well... The game took me about 3-4 hours to complete, and that was REALLY milking it. Most of the games I get from them take me around 20+ hours to complete it. It kills me that it could've been a really amazing game, if they but just a little more effort into it...\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 6/10 maybe...

I wish I could come up with more pros for this game, but I seem to end up with more cons instead. Anyhow, this what I think about the game after two playthroughs:\n\n--- Pros ---\n- Nice Art\n- Aid your employers by helping them out on cases as their secretary within the law firm (People who played Ace Attorney or are new to the Law/Political genre can enjoy this perspective-wise)\n- Playing a character who engages in a investigative role outside her job description is a good characteristic.\n- Romantic relationship is not restricted to male characters. You can pursue a yuri/lesbian relationship too.\n\n\n---Cons---\n- Fonts are very cheap fonts and dialogue textbox design is too simple. The colour combination between the text and the box also makes it hard to read over some mid-heavy text on a few occassions.\n- The Mystery element of the story should be a little more interesting with the tension, and the outcome is pretty straightforward.\n- Not many purchasable outfits to buy. Without overworking, you won't earn a lot for them either (Basically earned $10 every time, with no added bonus for my efficient hard work).\n- Stress-management is too simple. All you need to do is eat in the lunch break room or spend $5 for a meal to keep your stress within 0-20% roughly.\n- There seems to be no drawbacks from falling behind on the cases besides displeasing superiors even though I'm helping someone else. I'm surprised no one filed a complaint to the boss for not helping them enough.\n- Need more characters to converse with within the story and free time. Dana doesn't seem to have any friends or social life outside of work.\n- This game needs scheduled events while working in the office besides being dragged into a board meeting.\n- Not much different or more impressive endings apart from whom you are in a relationship with.\n- IMO one female co-worker as a potential romantic partner feels like an isolated mix into a game aesthetically targeted for female players . This game could at least have even number of male and female partners if it is including a yuri relationship, or just male partners only. To quote Godot from Ace Attorney:\n\"A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup!\"\n\nOverall, I give this game 6/10.

Perhaps finding love along the way.\n\nA super unique theme and setting for not only otome games, but visual novels in general? An otome Law & Order? An overarching plot filled with intrigue, plus the added bonus of getting Dana to actively uncover the truth? Sounds like a blast, I'm in!\n\n...If only the potential was realised. If only the game was just even [i]passable[/i]. I've played a ton of otome games- as well as visual novels as a whole, Japanese and Western- and [b]I can say with confidence that Love and Order is amongst [i]the worst[/i] otome games I've ever played[/b]. It's just plain awful; so much so that it can't even be enjoyed in a \"so bad, it's good/funny\" kind of way.\n\n[b]Unsurprisingly, I don't recommend Love and Order whatsoever.[/b] While the premise is great and the sprite artwork is nice, I honestly can't think of anything else to compliment about Love and Order without grasping at straws. It teeters so much more on its \"tedious and uninspired stat-raising simulation\" side than its \"visual novel\"one. The writing as a whole is very poor and lacking in terms of quality and quantity (since the stat-raising played an overly large role). That \"shady business\" I was talking about before isn't explored in any meaningful detail at all and the love interests practically play no part in it. Speaking of them, the characters (including the protagonist Dana herself) are extremely flat and their development is non-existent.\n\n\nIf you want more details:\n\n[u][b]PROS:[/b][/u]\n\n[b]+ Nice character sprite artwork,[/b] but the cropping job on Jonathan's was pretty poor (you can see the white jags).\n\n[b]+ Unique and interesting premise[/b] I've yet to come across even after years of otome gaming and visual novel reading.\n\n[b]+ An \"easy\" way to get some trading cards, maybe?[/b]\n\n\n[u][b]CONS:[/b][/u]\n\n[b]- Way overpriced for what you get.[/b] I'd value this at AUS$5 at most, though I'm sure some would think I'm being too generous.\n\n[b]- The overemphasis on the poorly-constructed stat-raising, which isn't even fun or interesting to warrant this.[/b] I understand it's intended to convey the \"tedium and stress of an overworked secretary\"... maybe? Funds get sapped really easily even if you work overtime. Stress also builds pretty quickly unless you purchase a certain item... But I found that save scumming the hell out of the game and rarely passing up on overtime whenever funds got too low and stress got too high as my \"strategy\". The more patient you are, the less you have to spend plus you can render stress non-critical. Eventually, you make a decent amount of money and can afford to more frequently relieve your stress or maybe buy that \"certain item\" I was talking about. Spending cash on anything other than \"that item\", stress relief or date nights is pretty much a waste of money.\n\nIn the end, when the game's 90% subpar simulation and 10% actual \"plot\"... That's no good at all. I don't expect a perfect 50/50 balance with visual novel x simulation game hybrids, but I don't think it's excusable to be imbalanced to this extent. At the very least, I think the \"imbalance\" should have teetered towards the \"visual novel\" aspect as that is the target audience (I'd imagine).\n\n[b]- The writing is lacking both figuratively and literally.[/b] You're spending most of the time doing the boring stat-raising. Other than the introduction, some characters' event scenes midway and the endings, there's not a whole lot of reading/story going on or meaningful interactions with the characters. Amazingly, the dates don't count as they're over as quickly as they begin and on top of that, they're practically copy-pastes for each character. What a cardinal sin for an otome game!\n\n[b]- The characters are extremely flat and don't go through any development.[/b] Furthermore, they only gain affection for you if you succeed in the tasks they set out for you. Of course, I think successfully completing tasks they set out for you should definitely [i]contribute[/i] to the \"relationship meter\" increasing but it shouldn't be [i]the sole method of gaining their love[/i]. As a result, the romance is thoroughly unbelievable.\n\n[b]- The \"overarching plot\" is boring; resolved quickly and uninterestingly.[/b] The same \"techniques\" you use to get through the stat-raising is applied to solving the conspiracy! It's super easy once you determine the timing of when to complete certain tasks of this \"investigating\" to prevent the culprit from catching you out (thus, leading to a \"game over\" of sorts). Speaking of this culprit, you can predict them [i]right away[/i].\n\n[b] - The interface is far from the standard I'd expect from a game of this price.[/b] Aside from the fact it looks a bit ugly, you only get the barest of bones (some of the bare bones are even missing) and worst of all, can only save in Dana's office for... reasons.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1478245358, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1478245610, "recommendationid": "26412098", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505024", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435253374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 188, "steamid": "76561198150906571", "num_games_owned": 138}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "First of all I'm glad to say I got this while it was on sale, buying it for the full price just wouldn't be value for money.

TL;DR- stop\n\nGameplay: The whole point of this game is nothing, honestly. It's supposed to be an otome/dating sim, but it's more of a game where you have to try and keep your stress level down, which, may I add, is almost impossible. It's a pick-and-click and you're literally bombarded with bullshit you have to do in a day and your stress keeps going up and up and you can't do anything about it. All the meaningless tasks you do (Solitare, eating out, watching a movie, etc) don't decrease your stress level and they're only available during a certain period of time. All of them cost money and it's next to impossible to make any money in this game.\n\nCharacters: They're all dry and cliche. No development. They all suck. There's no other way of putting it. They get mad at you for the dumbest things and they bombard you with tasks and expect them to be done in an instant. \n\nStory: The description is horribly misleading. I thought it would have been an okay game, given the storyline, but no. This game is impossible to complete. You can't do anything and you get fired 99% of the time because your stress makes you screw up so much, you can't even do basic functions as a human being. It's like the developers purposely made a terrible character with every flaw in character development crammed into the protagonist.\n\nRoutes: You have like what? Five routes to choose from? Nah. You can't even score a date with one of them cuz you already got fired for screwing up so many times\n\nOverall: This game is so bad, I wish I never bought it. I want my money back, but I'm not going to get it back. Don't waste your time with it. It is as bad as it seems. Go play another one of their other visual novels because this one is the worst. 0/10 stop", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435028794, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435028794, "recommendationid": "16636988", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433310456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561198025569787", "num_games_owned": 1368}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ok, to start: I'm gay and only bought this for Dorothy. Just so you all know where I'm coming from, here; it's always gonna be hard for me to enjoy an otome game, so maybe I'm being unfair. Looking at the other reviews here, though, I don't think that's the case this time.\n\nPersonally I don't [i]like[/i] stat management sim stuff in visual novels, but I don't necessarily dislike it either. When the ratio of story & character interaction to stat management is as skewed as it is here, though, even someone who likes that stuff would probably have to say it's going too far. This game bills itself on getting to flirt/date with cute characters and solving a mystery, but the scenes are so short, you spend barely any time doing either. What's the point?\n\nA few positives:\n[*]Dorothy! Too many otome games that include routes for female characters are just friendship or are super ambigious; it's nice to see an unapologetic romance route for once.\n[*]Art is... well, it's really just \"okay\", but if you compare it to the standard for VNs, it's quite good.\n[*]The characters are actually adults! It's not set in a high school! Thank the lord!\n\nI might play the other routes someday to keep it from dragging down my achievement completion ratio (lol), so I'll update this review if that changes my opinion at all, but I doubt it will.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491184964, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491184964, "recommendationid": "30914073", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 20, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 13}}
