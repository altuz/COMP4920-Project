It's absoultely stunning; the author and artist should be extremely proud of themselves. \n\nFirstly, the art is beautiful. The animated eyes can look a little awkward on some characters, but overall everything is drawn in lovely detail; the characters are distinct and the backgrounds are never lazy. Then there's the music, which is sort of techno in style; it suits the game and the mood. Personally, I'd buy the sound-track if I could.\n\nThe story is engaging, interesting and well-written. Despite finishing only today, I'm already hungry for more. There's still so much mystery left, so many characters arcs I haven't explored. I felt for the characters. Some of them were very unique - in particular, I appericated Elcia, who isn't the stereotypical, sweet and loving otome protagonist.\n\nEdit: I previously wrote here you cannot skip text, but this isn't true! Holding the down arrow allows you to fly through text. Also, you can press Enter to skip whole segments of the game after you've progressed to a certain point.\n\nI'll also add that \"romances\" in this game are restricted to male/female couples, so no female love interests. In addition, none of the romances get too, well, \"romancy\", if that's what you're looking for. There's no declarations of eternal love, passionate kissing or desperate hugs - the affectionation between Elcia and the boys can be interpretted as romantic, platonic or queerplatonic, which I particularly liked.\n\nDo yourself a favour and buy this game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436533606, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436759757, "recommendationid": "16974909", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523343", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462695811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 831, "steamid": "76561198210285493", "num_games_owned": 19}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "3", "review": "WORTH EVERY CENT. \n\nPros:\n-Romanceable characters are not simple card board cut outs, each have depth.\n-All characters are integral to the overall story. All pursuable characters have a role in the story and thereby cannot be taken out.\n-Well thought out story that have little to no plot holes.\n-art is fantastic\n\n-If you've played X-note, all your answers can be found here.\n-Even w/o playing X-note, you can still play the game as a stand alone.\n\nCons\n-For most, the price will be a hurdle espcially since there are not even voices. However, given the cohesion of the story and amazing writing/story telling, I do not regret paying at full price.\n-Lack of romance. There is a MUCH greater focus on the plot. \n\n+/- not a fluffy otome game. Plot driven with more emotional/ serious undertones. \n+/- has minigames. I honestly wasn't too fond of them since I found most puzzles to be quite difficult and required a walkthough. \n\nArea-X is one of my favorite otome games and (I know I sound like a broken record) a story that is so well developed, carefully planned, and intriguing that the price is worth it. If you've become jaded with otome games (mobile, pc, etc) do give this is a try.
