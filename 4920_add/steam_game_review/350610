Thus, \"COMBAT CAT\"(all achievements unlocked) is also unattainable.  While not necessarily broken, they require an unreasonable amount of kills in a single run(something that is not tracked!)\n\n+Unique match-3 mechanics\n+Upgrade system\n+Cute art\n+Addicting\n+Cheap\n\n=Retro aesthetic/music\n\n-3 unattainable achievements\n-Constant border on the edges\n-Windowed mode does not get rid of the border\n\nHonestly, it hurts me to not recommend this game.  It's a really fun match-3-- er, y'know, 4.  It has a cool swapping mechanic that I, personally, have not yet seen.  The artstyle is cute.  I love cats.  It's a great game.  If you don't care about achievements, I'd say go for it.  It's a blast.  The only major issue besides the achievements is that, even in a window, 2/3 of the playscreen is a large border.  If the achievements were fixed, I'd definitely change this review.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495750994, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495750994, "recommendationid": "31960891", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
