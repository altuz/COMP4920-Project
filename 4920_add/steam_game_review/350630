This is the case with [b]Dodge[/b], an Action/Puzzle style title from independent publisher and developer named Yokcos. According to the official blog, it's a game that was \"crafted in forty eight hours\" through [b]Game Maker[/b], as well as [b]SFXR[/b] to create the audio. The venture has received a fair deal of praise from users and the media alike for being an example of \"minimalism\" in a complicated world, but does [b]Dodge[/b] have anything to offer gamers today, or is it actually something far more pointless?\n\n[b]Dodge[/b] is, by all accounts, a truly minimalistic experience. The core concept is simple: Avoid the incoming obstacles. You are presented a limited grid and are allowed to move frequently on it, as well as move off the edge to appear on the opposite side. There's also two different ways to play. The main allure is \"Infinity\", which is essentially a survival mode that pits you on a three-by-three field against various obstacles such as the bullets and random lines that can block your path to safety. There's also various short levels you can tackle, forcing you to stay alive until a rich block outline appears, which you need to let make contact with you in order to finish the stage. There is a total of thirty of those short stages.\n\nPretty much everything about this game screams the early days of Intellivision and Atari 2600 titles, just with a crisp presentation and a limited .MIDI soundtrack that sounds like a Punk song turned eight-bit against simple effects. The other dramatic alteration is more of a cosmetic one that lies within the Options menu, which manipulates the colors on screen. You have your traditional black and white/white and black appearance, but there's also a \"changing hues\", \"rainbow\", both of which are about the same thing, and finally \"seizure\", complete with a justified warning due to the intense strobe light effect it creates.\n\nBut, all this said, is it fun? Well, it all depends. Are you looking for something relatively simple but with a growing difficulty curve? If so, then [b]Dodge[/b] is something you'll get a kick out of. The main killing point is that this release costs two dollars US at this point. While it does offer a good amount of replay value thanks to \"Infinity\" mode, the game itself does get incredibly repetitive pretty quick. Plus, knowing it was developed in forty-eight hours does make you feel as though you're being a bit overcharged. If you're tired of long, convoluted stories with complex controls and just want something simple you can pick up and play, [b]Dodge[/b] is worth grabbing, though worth waiting for a sale on if you can't justify paying the full price given the aforementioned blog post description dismissing an extensive development regime.\n\n[i]Overall Score: [b]6.5[/b]/10[/i]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429180126, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429180202, "recommendationid": "15398446", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488634", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1428450887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 618, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561198040884867", "num_games_owned": 1193}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Not worth two bucks.
