In fact there were so many things right with it. For starters it was a good game, it had a good selection of 6 cases in a relatively new format (for a game), which was, many short stories instead of one long one (which in this case worked excellent) It had a real good depiction of sherlock and watson, the game focused heavily on story as much as gameplay (not ancient genre conventions) and because of that, it presented freely many kinds of gameplay styles , ranging from classic interrogation with a suspect to contextual actions. This was achieved doing different things across the game, from placing and object in a certain place, to smelling  a tobacco pouch to identify its brand, to throwing an harpoon on a pig (long story) to know more about a killer. All this was just the starting point, then you had your detective sense, which enabled you to find hidden prints of missing objects, and then you had your clues screen in which you associated different facts, like it was part of your brain,  and ideas about the case flowed along until you reach one of many deductions to find the resolution.\nYou had even your notebook, in which you had pictures about the different characters you meet, another page with tasks to do, and then you have your map with places to go, and finally your inventory which is not only objects but also questions and facts.\n\nIt was really something.\n\nYou had lots of things to take in (many of which, were optional) but amazingly enough, there was nothing out of place, everything was balanced and there was not too much of anything. More important, none of these different styles of gaming (action, puzzles, visual clues) felt wrong or out of place. This was the best strength for Crimes & Punishments: this game was an adventure for the new century. And it dared to be what an adventure can be, an interactive experience to tell stories and make you feel part of it, regardless of what style of game it chooses.\n\nCrimes  & Punishments accomplished that, and you felt like solving a mystery like sherlock holmes (and if you read the novels, it was much more close to it, than, for example, the guy ritchie movies....)\n\nThe Devil's daughter has many of those things, but...it fails in other things. First, the story: this time there are 4 cases, the fifth is the resolution of the story between cases, which is not a bad thing in itself, but it makes this game considerably shorter. The story for the cases are... almost good at best... and pretty bad at worst. One of the great things about the previous game was that you could choose different solutions to a case, only one of them being the good one, but the good one was not so evident. You could make the wrong choice. In this game, one of the cases has a very obvious deduction, then another one its not so obvious and it is a good mystery, but, it incorporates a very long and completely unnecessary and out of place sequence of deathtraps in a mayan temple (with sherlock playing as lara croft) which of course doesn't go well (Even if you like tomb raider) In this game, many of the action minigames felt too much and out of place. The problem is not having an action game, but having too much of them (unbalanced) or just one that doesn\u2019t make too much sense.\nThen, the next case, has a solution that feels very contrived, even checking the facts, even checking the forums online and researching about it after the fact, it just doesn't make too much sense (there's a recurring subject online about the resolution of one particular case being a little off) some characters that are presented into the case out of nowhere, others that have red herrings that are badly placed. Finally, the last story which is the story with sherlock's daughter feels to much forced, and without much meaning besides the intense moments.\nThe voice acting in this game comes very mixed. There are good voices of course, most of the supporting characters in fact like lestrade, wiggins, and many other ones on different cases, but then for some of the main game characters, like kate (sherlock's daughter) the voice acting is bad (at least in english).\n \nThen the choice to change considerably the looks and voice of both sherlock and watson didn't do well for me. \nIt went too far away from the novels (which was one of the strengths of the previous games) in fact one of the great things about the previous game was that it resembled so much the original characters from the novels and it looked NOTHING like the ones from that guy ritchie movie.... and in this game.... frankly, watson looks a lot like jude law...\n\nOn the technical side the game uses an improved version of the unreal engine, UE4 (previously it was version 3) so technically, the game is better, but it kind of looks less detail sometimes, like for example making a character portrait. But at other times, the weather effects and scene details are really good. Too bad the characters doesn't look that good. Probably it is a matter of making better use of the new tool. \n\nIt\u2019s sad that after making not only the best adventure from 2014 but also making adventure games relevant again, they falled so short on this one, but I\u2019m sure there's a very talented group of people there working at Frogwares and they're next game will be much better, especially because they are departing from the Sherlock Holmes territory and into HP Lovecraft .", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505418487, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505419249, "recommendationid": "34956186", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520207", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 186, "total_reviews": 278, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 92}}
