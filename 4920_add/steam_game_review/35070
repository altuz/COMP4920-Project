I gave it a shot but got stuck in the tutorial. Looked dated sounded rather flat, the control schemes were a little bit hit and miss, the assets for the art was quite frankly rather of an eyesore. This is library clutter in my humble opinion.\n\nCommentary: I tried to follow the tutorial but when it got to the supersize dust feature I could not proceed. Dont know if its a bug because the dust is P2P or if I am just really struggling with a badly ported user interface? It is hard to tell. Anyways this is like a really dated farm game thats out of facebook or a very old tablet farming game. I used to play Hay Day long ago on an Ipad and I enjoyed it back then. This does not seem half as enjoyable as that other game was... and even then I dont think I would play Hay Day again on a computer..."}]}
