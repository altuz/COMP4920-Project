Your deck continues to grow, and grow, and grow. Which, as any CCG/TCG player knows, is a HORRIBLE thing because it saturates the deck with low end cards, prevents synergy, prevents specific tactics.\n\nEventually, your deck will have 100+ different cards, and you'll rarely see the good ones as a result.\n\n[h1]No strategy whatsoever[/h1]\n\nGiven that, there really isn't any strategy here at all. There are no real special cards that do something unique. The more powerful cards just do more of the same (higher damage, give more resources, etc.).\n\nThis summarizes the available options:\n\n* increase your wall (which acts as a shield)\n* increase your tower height (which wins the game)\n* do dmg to the enemy (wall or height)\n* increase level of resource building (generates more resources per turn)\n* increase x amt of resources\n\nThere is NOTHING else in the game play. Cards either do more or less of the above, or they may combine one or more of the above. That's the extent of the creativity and variation here.\n\n There is no synergy between cards, there is no way to edit the deck to be \"more tower dmg\" focused or more \"wall defensive\" focused. You just get random cards put into your hands, and go with it. You'll be doing a little bit of everything, which means there is no actual strategy.\n\n[h1]Devs are non-existent[/h1]\n\n Devs are non-existent, as is the community. At the time of this review, there are 3 threads, 2 posters (myself included), and zero dev responses. You'd think the devs would care enough about their game's launch to at least introduce themselves, see how things are going, answer questions of prospective or new customers. But...they don't.\n\nIf the devs don't even care about their own game...why should consumers?\n\nStay away. Even though it's $5, it's a waste of time...and your time is probably more valuable than the $5.  There are plenty of F2P card games with substantially more depth and creativity, which will provide a fulfilling, enjoyable experience.

Are you someone who like throwing random scrolls into the centre of a screen and not knowing what the hell is happening? Do you have 1 brain cell and don't like customizing anything in any way? Do you like an awful attempt at a storyline? Then this is the game for you!\n\nSeriously though now, this is a 2/10 game. It has some good ideas for a game and could go so much further with so many extra features! I don't know if this is the first build but if it is then its just missing multiplayer, deck builder, customizable towers, replayability, and gameplay that is addictive. It seems like it has deck building capabilities but the builders decided to throw it away and focus on the fantastic story line. It is almost like an infinity wars clone.\n\nScores: Graphics = 2/10 No unique spell animations, I literally laughed at the dragon animation\nGameplay = 1/10 No strategy or uniqueness to the game\nSounds = 1/10 What sounds?\nValue = 1/10 I should be paid for playing this\n\nDear Devs, fix this game and give it the needed features and you might have the next hearthstone cause at the moment, this is about as fun as snakes and ladder with no dice.\n\nPeace!\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441482002, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441482002, "recommendationid": "17899488", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523511", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505139554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 13354, "steamid": "76561198036193194", "num_games_owned": 266}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "8/10. This is a good example of this style of game, I\u2019ve completed this game and I enjoyed it.\n\n\nI was looking for something fun and light to play, that\u2019s why I bought this. There is a good series of let\u2019s play videos if you want to see how the early game plays out, But basically it\u2019s like you would expect: You are given random cards, you can win in two ways: either you build a large enough tower or you destroy the enemy\u2019s tower.\n\nI played this game for a whisker under 2 hours yet wondered where on Earth it was heading? The early enemies were too easy, the current fights were looking like the odds were against me. And I wondered if I should ask for a refund? I didn\u2019t see myself making progress: The fights were a match, a tough opponent vs a strategic build up.\n\nI came up with an idea, and sank well half of my playtime into farming gold, I don\u2019t like grinding\u2026 it adds nothing to game-play. I left my gaming running and overnight it became a great casual game.\n\nWhen I played the second 1/3 of the game I really felt I had more strategy and more options, and ultimately I felt I actually had a match in that I could trade blows and claw my way to victory. The enemy was stronger, but having more resources meant I felt like I could play a strategy.\n\nAfter another farming run I pushed to complete the game. I felt the game was fresh and that a new or rather change in strategy was being asked for. I battled forwards knowing I was slightly overpowered but still enjoying as a casual-strategy game. By the time I got to the end, I spotted or rather refined my final strategy the last levels were fairly easy, however I wish to forewarn the last level IS tougher than the rest.\n\nI\u2019d say there is 4 hours odd of game-play. The pace I played picked up very rapidly at the end which was excellent.\n\n\nI\u2019ve talked about how I\u2019ve played the game. The reason is I feel a number of people simply haven\u2019t tried the strategy part of this game: I\u2019ve been playing the last boss fight a number of times and I do think it would be very hard without good \u201cstats\u201d or a stack of spells, but that is the game, It is more than a bunch of cards!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489441333, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489441333, "recommendationid": "30497743", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517976", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464026699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 292, "steamid": "76561198019458917", "num_games_owned": 128}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Don't look the haters!
