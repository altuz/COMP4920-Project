I found normal mode to be kinda easy (god knows how easy easy is). It was a short but fun arcade, would be cooler if there were some more random elements to it. Haven't tried co-op because >friends. And panic mode is well done, I like that the devs made sure no health dropped on hard so even if you buy the extra health tank it's only a single use cushion.  \n\nhopefully more people will start to pick this game up so there is some more fighting for spots on the leaderboards.\n\nMaybe some more achievements too, though not sure what they would be for, just doesn't feel like there are enough considering how easy it was to get all of them in 6 hours...\n\n\nMy final thoughts are that this is  great game, but I wouldn't personally call it worth 8 dollars... Perfect if you get it on sale but unless you got some money to burn and a boredom to squash then wait.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505541541, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505541541, "recommendationid": "34988676", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505685981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561197974417264", "num_games_owned": 2205}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A couple bucks and it's fun to play.

I was not dissapointed! The Bug Butcher is a very fun game that get's very chaotic very quickly. Its endless hordes of unforgiving enemies and variety of upgradable items and skills will keep you coming back time and again to see if you can just get a little bit further than last time.
