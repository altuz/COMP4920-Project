Like. We're talking bootleg level of infringement!\n\nNow, that's what I thought this was - A remake of the original commodore 64 game. But upon research learned it was a port of a Nintendo DS Giana Sisters game. Upon seeing this I immediately thought \"Oh no.\" A port of a DS game is never good, as the DS was heavily close to home for casual players, children, and alot of very horribly designed games.\n\nAnd I wasn't wrong - This game isn't very enjoyable. Upon playing the first world my thoughts towards this were \"It's okay.\", wasn't anything special yet it wasn't exactly a disaster. But after about 2 worlds it became so monotonous and repetitive, as there wasn't much variation in level design, enemies, and CERTAINLY not the music. Oh lord. That music got so freakishly repetitive later on.\n\nThe art style, however, isn't bad. Not the best, but it's not bad. There's not really much I can say about the simplistic art style of this game -  Just \"It's aight.\"\n\nBut not all hope is lost - If you're looking for a decent platformer that doesn't bore you, then there's another game in this series - Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams - Which has some stunningly great graphics, as well as, in my opinion, one of the greatest soundtracks I have ever heard in a platformer game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500196651, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500196651, "recommendationid": "33580392", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491825", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 26, "total_reviews": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 17}}
