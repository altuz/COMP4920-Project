It's rich with satisfying gravity-based machincs that are meticulously crafted so that everything is fair and your success will improve as your skills improve. It's beautiful and establishes a sense of place that is offset by the writing which conveys a sense of loneliness. Very sci-fi by the truest definition.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505739035, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505739035, "recommendationid": "35044636", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 49, "total_reviews": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
