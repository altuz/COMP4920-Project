You probably won't, though; a lot of the puzzles make little sense, the clues are often vague, some items are incredibly hard to spot. I feel a little bad, since there are points in this game where the developer is clearly trying. It's too bad that it completely fails to engage you at all.\n\nHowever, if you're a masochist that regularly hunts for free indie games in search of finding how many turds you manage to fish out (like myself), then these are exactly the same reasons that you will enjoy this game. It's so bad that it's hilarious.\n\nOtherwise, don't even bother with this trash.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461987934, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1461987934, "recommendationid": "22715638", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502937", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486797023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 22, "steamid": "76561198117322651", "num_games_owned": 89}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is amazing \nI WALKED INTO THE INN OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486797100, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486797100, "recommendationid": "29840988", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490761", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
