Some Jigsaw puzzles? Maybe a few memory match games thrown in? or some spot the difference to change it up? OHH and have no story at all? This is for you.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n\u203a Items are mostly easy to find.\n\u203a The time limits were not hard to beat. [I personally didn't play with the timers, but finished most seek and find screens within 10mins.]\n\u203a Takes a good amount of time to finish.\n[h1]Negatives:[/h1]\n\u203a Some of the items have silly names. [scroll in vase, makeup item, ex-caterpillars, ect...]\n\u203a It's very repetitive.\n\u203a Everything seems very cut and paste.\n\u203a Jigsaw puzzles have a base image and makes it very easy.\n\u203a No difficulty settings.\n[h1]Community Items:[/h1]\n\u203a The game does not include any community items.\n\n[b]Do I recommend this game?[/b]\nIf you are after a simple seek and find game with a few extra puzzles popped in this is for you but I have played better. If you are after a story driven hidden object game this is not what you are looking for you may want to look elsewhere. I personally did not enjoy this game as there are better ones out there, but if this is something for you to play casually just to kill a bit of time you will probably enjoy how easy it is to play."}]}
