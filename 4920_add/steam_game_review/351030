I say it's only okay because as many other people have pointed out, most of the puzzles in the game are DLC. When bought on sale or in a bundle, it's not too bad, but some puzzle packs are like, 6 bucks or more, and they add up very quickly. I think I got most of mine on sale or in bundles, so I haven't spent too much on DLC, but I think I bought a bundle of them through the Steam Store (on sale) for like, $20! That's expensive DLC. I bought it partially because I just love puzzle games and plan on doing all of them (even if it takes me a really long time) but also because I like the sense of accomplishment of getting the entire collection and of getting all of the achievements. Honestly, this game is an achiement hunter's worst nightmare. As of writing this, I think there's over 700 achievements, and you NEED to buy DLC to get them all, because a vast majority of them are finishing puzzles and entire puzzle packs. On an interesting note, if you bought any of the stand alone pixel puzzles games, you already have all of those puzzles in this game free, and they are slightly different because they have different amounts of pieces and possibly different shaped pieces. \n\nJust due to the amount of DLC and the cost of the DLC, I don't think I can recommend this game, unless you don't care about earning achievements, or you really, really, REALLY love puzzles. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503261340, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503261340, "recommendationid": "34381813", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508449", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500412517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 154, "steamid": "76561198014925817", "num_games_owned": 345}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "900 odd achievements locked into DLC, very expensive DLC. poor show chaps.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500380223, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500380223, "recommendationid": "33628755", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507224", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507158207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7062, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 180638, "steamid": "76561198033664088", "num_games_owned": 371}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "3", "review": "I bought this for my Mum as she had enjoyed all the other Pixel puzzle games. \nShe is very much enjoying this one too, but the sheer amount of DLC means that it's only worth picking up DLC during sales. \nThe DLC is not on sale very often and it's usually during the large sales it's on special. \n\nAs others have said, the UI isn't the greatest, but it eliminates the hassle of actual puzzles being done and losing pieces.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501574823, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501574823, "recommendationid": "33944353", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505741", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501361652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1988, "steamid": "76561198068057162", "num_games_owned": 286}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Had a lot of fun with this game but the fact that the dlc is so expensive is bullshit.
