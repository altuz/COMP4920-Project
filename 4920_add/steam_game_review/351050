Unlike the last few versions, this one has some much needed new features/improvements. To name just a few, the added Indian domestic leagues (which will please many). The ODI and T20 match engines have notably improved with much larger scores now possible. The lesser teams like Bangladesh and Zimbabwe have been given more attention leading to more accurate team selections. There are many more little improvements for the better that you will find out as you play the game.\n\nOverall, I honestly think this is a game to get for any cricket fan. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436368729, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436368729, "recommendationid": "16943752", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535248", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442052035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2280, "steamid": "76561198000896253", "num_games_owned": 246}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Cricket Captain 2015, the same game every year with given a tiny application of makeup and making no progress whatsoever. \n\nThe thing is, Cricket Captain is basically a Cricket Manager game, minus 90% of management features that are needed to make the game interesting. But let me get the pro's out of the way with first;\n\nThe match engine is brilliant, the statistical information available to the player is brilliant. The one-day and 20-20 match engines have been tweaked and are better than previous instalments. Graphics have finally gotten a facelift, but animations remain the same as in previous versions pretty much, thus edges mostly go in the same areas and not always to shots that make sense.\n\nTo demonstrate the laziness; the animations for the umpires to signal 'byes' is the real life signal for leg byes, this has been like this for the past three or four instalments, it can't be that hard to fix surely?\n\nOutside of the match engine, there is almost nothing for an aspiring manager to do. Yeah, there is team building from the transfer market, and the promotion of youth players. You also get to adjust the budgets a little, but the initial funding doesn't change (aside from prize money), there's no opportunity to build the club up as you become more successful. There's no chance to look more in depth at a youth or reserve team, and you can't hire a specific number of physios or coaches. Training is limited, staff numbers are linked to the budget but never anymore than numbers rather than actual personalities themselves - a batting coach who is aggressive for example, or a bowling coach with his own philosophy - nope, they're just generic numbers.\n\nAnd that, really is the problem with the game. It's a spreadsheet game, with all your time spent looking at statistical averages. Best batsman number 1 will always be replaced by generic youth product number 51, because there are no personalities in the game, nothing to indicate ability (outside of averages), nothing to indicate talent (outside of averages) because there's no staff to talk to, no youth team to develop and team to mould in line with bigger games such as Football Manager.\n\nThe whole thing, is just a numbers game without any real flavour to it. The hardcore fans and cricket nuts will pick it up as usual, but aside from reading the numbers and possibly playing around with tactics in the admittedly decent match engine there's nothing outside to keep things interesting, no media, no discussions, no personalities, training events or anything that adds spark and interest. Nothing but your imagination and the bland numbers popping up as each match goes by.\n\nFor a series that has been around for a long while now, they really need to get with the times and produce something more than a match engine.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439411232, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439411232, "recommendationid": "17510170", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536426", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467580419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17597, "steamid": "76561198006754790", "num_games_owned": 48}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "ICC is back again for its annual edition of the long running series.

This version is as much fun as always and looks a good deal slicker than previous versions, which is great.\n\nI still feel like the series is a little lazy, especially when compared with sports management simulators where there is more competition - e.g. Football Manager. A few small changes could make this series so much better.\n\nOne major failing is that it is impossible to be sacked or to move counties or countries once you have started a game. I think it would be great if the Board of your team (domestic or international) set seasonal goals and would review your position based on your attainment of the goals. These could be based around performance in competitions, development of youth players, marquee signings, or anything like this. Similarly, fan satisfaction would be a great feature - are the fans happy with the performance of the team; are the attached to the players; do they like the style of cricket you're playing? If so, more fans should turn up to games and the county should make more money.\n\nIn international cricket, each country's pool of talent seems to remain fairly static despite retirals and regenerations. This has in the past been frustrating as a New Zealand fan. There should also be a mechanism for a team's prestige to change, so that if you manage NZ or WI or whoever to be the no.1 side in a format, other teams will want to host longer and more regular series against your team. It is frustrating to have a great player in a New Zealand shirt who can't have a real crack at breaking records because he'll only play 60 tests in his career. It should also be possible to move international teams to keep variety and interest.\n\nI love the statistical elements of this game, especially that retired player stats are now saved. The kind of people who love cricket and play these games love statistics, so keep them coming! The more the better! For example, saving players' scoring areas over the whole of their career, saving as many quirky stats as possible about your nation or club (e.g. all time best XIs, players of the season, most runs/wickets in a 2/3/4/5 match test/ODI/T20I series, most matches, most matches as captain, boundary totals, most % runs in innings, etc). \n\nI'd also love to see Decision Reviews introduced (a really important part of captaincy these days), and realistic rain delays in one-day cricket with Duckworth-Lewis adjusted totals.\n\nA few small changes like this would make the game feel more real, more immersive, and ultimately more enjoyable.\n\nStill, I love this series, and would give this game four out of five stars.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436882400, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436882400, "recommendationid": "17043899", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510909", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453611682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 393, "steamid": "76561197970603844", "num_games_owned": 544}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The usual slow evolution rather than revolution for this series, but sensibly priced.

I probably don't need to get each edition as some have been nothing more than a databse update with a few minor additions, but this is clearly the best cricket management game on the market.  Nothing comes close.\n\nSo should you buy it?  The short answer is yes.  The three major leagues in England, India and Australia are all well covered and there are plenty of options to play both in and out of the game.  You can be a hands on coach and play every ball, go a little less with every over or even sim through games you don't feel you need to play.  It really is good stuff and you can get hours of enjoyment out of it.  With a few seasons under my belt I've been able to build a very handy side in all three formats as the contract system works well.\n\nThere are, however, a few things that need to be mentioned that haven't been fixed in years.\n\n1. - There is no true way to see just how good a player is or the potential they have.  The only way you can tell is at the end of the season when you sign their contract - if they ask for a higher amount (eg. above $50,000) then you can be assured you are generally getting a good player.  However outside of this it's hit and miss.  I've signed players for big bucks that have been a huge disappointement.  Why?  I don't really know.  Adding in a system like this would be sensational and help decide the make up of your team better.\n\n2. - There are some incosistencies with the AI.  There seem to be far too many LBW's and often when you change a batsman's aggressiveness they can go out in the next over.  The AI is generally pretty good but be prepared for the odd frustration here and there.\n\n3. - The training system is only decent.  There are plenty of options to choose from but there is no way to tell how well things are working.  This ties into being able to see how good a player is or the potential of how good they CAN be with the right training.  Fixing this would be excellent.\n\nOutside of those criticism's this is an excellent game and if you can sink some time into it you'll thoroughly enjoy it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438770833, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438770833, "recommendationid": "17397190", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.979366", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438365757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 886, "steamid": "76561198014388640", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So if you're like me and the Ashes buzz has made you want to get a Cricket game and you remember a game called Cricket Captain... you come to this.

The management isn't as deep as those two games, of course, but it's good enough to satisfy me. \n\nWhat I really like about CC 2015 is the fog of war regarding players. You don't have visible attribute settings that tell you exactly how good a player is. You get told what his tendencies are and what his stats are, and you work out from there if he'll be a fit for you or not. If a player is performing crap, you think, well, is he just unlucky? Am I using him wrong? Or is he actually crap? The player attributes make most management games easy to win; this game on the other hand is a great challenge. \n\nIn OOTP there are a sizable minority of us who play using 'stats only', where we turn attributes off and evaluate players based on performance.

You can also pick young up and coming players, and if they turn out to be good enough, you can watch them progress, hopefully into great players.\n\nFirstly, the UI looks dated.  It really could do with an update.  There\u2019s relatively limited ways in which you can influence what\u2019s going on during a match, so a lot of it is out of your hands.  That in itself isn\u2019t so bad, since that\u2019s basically what happens with Football Manager.  Probably the biggest problem I have with the game, though, is lack of information.  There\u2019s limited stats available to help you to make informed decisions.  For example, there seems to be no way to judge which wicket keeper is better than any other, since there\u2019s no actual wicket keeping stats available, not that I\u2019ve ever found.  You can assign trainers to players, but it\u2019s extremely difficult to tell if it\u2019s having any affect.  In Football Manager, for instance, you can quite easily see what affect your trainer is having on the player, and whether you\u2019re wasting your time trying to improve that area of the player.  You also can\u2019t hire and fire trainers, since they\u2019re nameless and faceless.\n\nThe game is fun, but really could be a lot more fun, and only if it undergoes a serious make-over, and it really does need one.

I once got a 0/100 on an assignment because I didn't show my work. The teacher wrote the score on the page in front of me and scolded me in front of the entire class for it.\n\nCricket Captain 2015 is very much in that same boat.\n\nThe trick with most sports managment sims is, they demonstrate an athlete's abilities to the player through an attributes system; for instance, in Football Manager, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn is better as a striker than Carlos Puyol not just because that is his natural position, but also because he has a much higher \"Shooting\" attribute, and probably several others that reflect his strengths. This is done to give the player a general guideline for whether he should expect success, failure, or something in between in a given matchup or scenario, even though it won't always work exactly the way the numbers dictate.\n\nCricket Captain 2015 does not do this. There is not clear and present attribute system, merely a series of standard cricket statistics and nebulous \"Form\" and \"Fitness\" ratings. Yet, the Form rating is hardly perfect, because I frequently have players with one-star Form wildly outperforming players with three- or four-star Form, and Fitness doesn't have any effect at all that I've noticed or had explained to me. The manual explains that batsmen also have a fatigue rating during matches, but fatigue is only visible for bowlers, so you as captain don't know when to dial back the aggression on your batsmen and try to let them recover for another big push. Unless you just recognize the names of bowlers, you really have no idea who will be good and who won't until they've taken a couple of wickets, which doesn't reflect the intense scouting and scrutiny of high-level sports. The player is given little control over what his team does, which can lead to a lot of frustrating big overs for opposing bats and wickets lost for your own side.\n\nThis is made all the more frustrating by the fact that there clearly is some sort of underlying attributes system that the player just isn't allowed to see. I get messages through my training sessions that players have improved certain attributes. What were those attributes before, and what are they now? Being able to see those things would allow me to adjust what I'm instructing my players in, so I know if I'm wasting my time trying to make a bowler more accurate or trying to make my young wicketkeeper a better fielder.\n\nDespite a manual that does offer a few useful tips, the developers don't seem to have taken into account that this could be someone's first deep exposure to cricket, as evidenced by the lack of a tutorial of any kind. I've logged almost four hours in this game and still don't quite know what everything does. A scripted T20 or ODI match to help players get a feel for how the game works and how the sport works.\n\nThe game also lacks pretty much all forms of polish. I've had games where the field completely disappears and leaves the players standing on a black screen during highlights. There is no music of any kind. There's an option for menu sound, but there is no menu sound. These things are baseline in video games these days, so their absence is duly noted here.\n\nFor all the flak I give this game, I don't think it's that far away from being pretty good. It just needs to do a better job of giving its players information about why things are happening the way they are.

I loved ICC2 but this isn't worth the effort.\n\nAVOID", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436653322, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436653322, "recommendationid": "17000195", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506286", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482526044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8679, "steamid": "76561198083611292", "num_games_owned": 111}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game that any cricket fan would enjoy!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457388210, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457388210, "recommendationid": "21693863", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498536", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502643307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3746, "steamid": "76561198001396509", "num_games_owned": 72}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Another database update with very few additions , its a shame that its been nearly 2 decades they are selling the same game again and again.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457431967, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457431967, "recommendationid": "21704120", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482829122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 32812, "steamid": "76561198127150806", "num_games_owned": 67}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Needs improvement but just love this game the only real cricket management game around", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455615281, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1455615281, "recommendationid": "21248882", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498295", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467709863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3495, "steamid": "76561198050892432", "num_games_owned": 173}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "love it but it needs a settin when u can change teams or states or countries instead of just none", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455088802, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1455088802, "recommendationid": "21096152", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498295", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505976194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1676, "steamid": "76561198144256600", "num_games_owned": 180}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very Enjoyable Game!!\n\n7/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452692793, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452692793, "recommendationid": "20504991", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453405742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2185, "steamid": "76561197981383065", "num_games_owned": 124}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I would love to say this game is good but it is flawed as anything. In terms of batting you set the level of aggression and let your batters do their jobs, Problem is you tell them to block and defend and they will all get out slogging for 6. Madness. The bowling, your bowlers will spend overs and overs and overs bowling on a pitch that has apparently no demons and you cant get a wicket. Even if you have the best bowlers in the world. When the opponents play on the same pitch it is like a mine field. You get such limited control over how bowlers bowls and the plans that it isnt immersive it is just dull. The series has been released for so many years now that they should be further ahead then they are. It seems like they have just spend all their budget on getting Jonathan Agnew to do commentary and then remembered that they need a game to go along with his voice.
