I had a great time playing Regency Solitaire and definitely felt like a princess. I recommend picking it up in the discounted Solitaire bundle on Steam.\n\n[b]10/10[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501670208, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501670233, "recommendationid": "33968205", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513834", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499798888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1032, "steamid": "76561198106451440", "num_games_owned": 255}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pros\n- pride and prejudice without insufferable bitches\n- splendid artwork\n- get to throw a ball so we can seduce rich dude who's already into us\n- power-up things\n- no eggs to ruin your life like in faerie solitaire\n\n\nCons\n- male members of our family are brain dead\n- story is bland af\n- too easy. need hell mode\n- got all the stars. no perfect clear achievement. life is suffering\n\nall in all, this game is pretty entertaining. faerie is better tho in term of challenge. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500370199, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500370199, "recommendationid": "33626142", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506763", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498607993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5999, "steamid": "76561198062935476", "num_games_owned": 40}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I initially checked out this game because Felicia Day recommended it.
