It is EA, and many promising things are not yet open, but I consider the price appropriate even for the game as is. \n\nAt the time of this review:\n\n+ beautiful graphics. There is no female hero yet, but all else is just absolutely gorgeous. \n+ beautiful soundtrack. Very fitting for the style, and really great. Where can I buy it? :)\n+ crafting system is smart, and so interesting. \n+ different skills to level. \n\n- progression in comparison to the strength of the enemies seems not yet balanced. \n- combat system is somewhat boring. \n- there is a lot of walking looooong corridors, which gets boring rather fast. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506703424, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506703424, "recommendationid": "35304340", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506961422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 560, "steamid": "76561197970493590", "num_games_owned": 227}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Interesting side scrolling RPG with a surprising level of depth, that includes crafting and multiplayer capability. The game is still in early access but is well supported by an active development team. They are quick to respond on the forums and with updates to address issues.

I don't come across many games like this one. \n\nAfter almost 8 hours of playing I feel like I got to a peak of difficulty and learning and from here it's simply grinding.\n\nI only played singleplayer so far and didn't see any meaning in the other maps besides the one you decide to start one. There is just an empty field in the middle of the map there and I think it deserves some purpose.\n\nThe bosses in the dungeons are very difficult and I barely managed to kill them. I think the damage on the low levels they inflict is too massive unless you come stocked with HP items.\n\nI didn't manage to find a lot of information online for this game besides the basics and a few tips.\n\nThe quests system is quite boring and only asked me to \"get\" stuff for a small reward.\nMore than that, when those evil priests demand something for you, otherwise they will attack, after the first couple of requests it's really a matter of preparing in advance. A few times already I was already required to get a certain animel from the surface(or dungeon) and once I tried looking for one, the map was filled with wolves, boars and buffalos, probably on purpose.\n\nI really wish this game will manage to use all of it's great potential and develope accordingly, relying on the player's reviews.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504811187, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504811187, "recommendationid": "34800636", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499986", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 55, "total_reviews": 74, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 19}}
