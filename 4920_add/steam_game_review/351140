This makes the mechanics surrounding death and gaining points more interesting than just about any other shooter. (As well as leading to some comical situations.) I wish more games would be inspired by this mechanic. \n\n-There is no mouse use and the shooting functions much more like a classic shooter, which is a nice change and controls well. \n\n\nCons:\n\n-Holy fucking shit. This game has the worst netcode of anything I have ever played. This game should have released in early access because its netcode is beyond broken. 99% of games will lead to nonsensical disconnects in matchmaking and custom games, the 1% of games that do work will generally lead to either everyone jumping around the map due to lag or the enemy team will quit when you are beating them. \n\n-There are no options to party up with your friends in matchmaking. You can only play with friends in custom games which will never work, and you will barely see any listings. The matchmaking is automated trial and error and at least succeeds some of the time. So in short if you do download this, expect to play by yourself.\n\n-There is no chat box anywhere. In lobbies to determine if a host is AFK and promptly yell at him for being the host of the one game you could actually connect to, or in game to co-ordinate strategies with your team. \n\n-You cannot invite people to games in progress. While this in a way is a good thing it means players wont fill places when someone rage quits, or if you enter a rarely functional custom game and someone starts the moment they see another player join the other team then too late! You're stuck playing by yourself without the friends/anyone you planned to play with. \n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nExtremely fun when it works with massive potential, but whoever is behind the netcode deserves to be shot. This game was not ready for full release and they have probably killed their long term player base by releasing the game fully with the multiplayer in a multiplayer only game in such a downright unacceptable disgusting state. \n\nIf the developer has the competence to actually fix this I would highly recommend playing the game as it can be brilliant, but so far (10/05/2015) the only developer responses regarding this issue have blankly said \"we're working on it\" with absolutely no eta on when the issue will be fixed with zero public announcements regarding the issue. \n\n\nTL;DR: Multiplayer is fucked and rarely works, nobody knows if it will ever be fixed, otherwise really fun game, check it out if the multiplayer gets fixed.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431180674, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431181097, "recommendationid": "15756309", "language": "english", "votes_down": 29, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606115", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433706922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8, "steamid": "76561198155814923", "num_games_owned": 20}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "resonably fun game, but no to reccomendation because there are so many things you could tweak with it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487634598, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487634598, "recommendationid": "30068639", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504113", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483744895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11, "steamid": "76561198205412900", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "crap just crap it took 10min to start and my pc basicly died", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486419725, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486419775, "recommendationid": "29750478", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484859", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1476709923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198210183952", "num_games_owned": 34}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Shit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust Shit...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486119935, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486119935, "recommendationid": "29666981", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480097", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463307331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 211, "playtime_forever": 646, "steamid": "76561198172055451", "num_games_owned": 274}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun for a while..", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488160643, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488160643, "recommendationid": "30210871", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497932", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438986129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 231, "steamid": "76561197970835441", "num_games_owned": 140}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1] I would def recommed giving this game a try. [/h1] The game is unique and a lot of fun and has a pretty dedicated dev team. Most nights you can see them in games and play with them. They are also very active on the forum and generally reply to feedback. Its really nice to see a game where the devs are so involved with the community.\n\nThere are two free characters, but they rotate weekly, and the price to buy all characters seems pretty reasonable. The controls feel pretty console-y, but you get used to them after a while.

And the free characters (especially Daisy) are completely viable right out of the box. \n- A perfect combination of strategy/twitch-action skill based combat, especially if you have a controller.\n- Visually pleasing art style\n- You're rewarded for spending the $9.99. The four extra characters are a blast to play and not terribly overpowered. (Though Maverick, the sniper, can be incredibly broken if the other team isn't smart)\n\nCons:\n- No dedicated server so if whoever is chosen as host leaves then the match results in a disconnect (and subsequently counts as a loss on the leaderboard! This needs fixed!!!!)\n- When a player leaves, creating a 3v2 imbalance, there's is no AI to substitute for the missing player. Matches can be quite steam-rolly if a player leaves.\n- I have only seen the super robot die once in over four hours of play. It seems the only viable way to stop a super robot is by turret trapping it in the middle of the map. \n\n\nOverall this game is an absolute blast and I don't regret spending $10 to support a great idea. There are bound to be balance issues though once enough players are able to play as Maverick and Valentina. Also, was the super robot intended to be so hard to take down? Especially with how easy it is to heal the super robot? Matches are literally a race to 15 scraps and that's it. \n\nLook forward to playing you all in-game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430888172, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430888172, "recommendationid": "15708626", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
