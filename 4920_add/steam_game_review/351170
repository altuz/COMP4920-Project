Also, it appears that dying in-game often changes the physics of the key-mapping, like suddenly going right is the former down key. The change-ups help allay rote muscle memory, and you seem to frequently get the feeling of learning a new skill, even when replaying. The sound effects are pleasing. Definitely not one of those +1 backlog games for me. \n\nI bought the two pack of this Puzzle/Platformer/Shooter because I saw the emoticons. :D They are prohibitively expensive in the market, so I'm hoping to drop the :blackpix: for some Steam Profile art. The cards are fantastic! When I pulled up the background images, they look pretty cool too. But, I will be putting a lot of playtime into this, like with Lyne, as it does have achievies and a workshop, so there is nothing to lose here but hours of my life on another addictive game. :D", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448657846, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1448657846, "recommendationid": "19318013", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534129", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447996304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 121, "steamid": "76561198040087242", "num_games_owned": 230}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "2", "review": "This game is tough. If you like platformers that are super challenging, but feel insanely rewarding, then you will love Pixel. It's not for everyone, so if you do not like games like Super Meat Boy then you should avoid this one. There's more to it than just platforming, and even the way it handles platforming is unique. It's a solid blend of tried-and-true mechanics while adding some unique features that really make it stand out.\n\n\nI got a preview of this game at PAX East last year and was super impressed with it, so I was happy to finally add it to my Steam Library where I hope to play it more in-depth because I loved the euphoric feeling I get from completing the levels.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenging platormer with some unique mechanics, then I strongly recommend Pixel.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431078897, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1431078897, "recommendationid": "15737716", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500027", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467247835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1234, "steamid": "76561198118664919", "num_games_owned": 209}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "great game \n\nget s quite annoying and complex and the art will really start messing with you which makes it quite challenging and fun", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1476357136, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1476357136, "recommendationid": "26010802", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449919141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1043, "steamid": "76561198010878699", "num_games_owned": 245}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very great start!\n\nI've been following this game for awhile.

Well the description is pretty damn accurate. It's a platforming, puzzle, shooter. Well not really a shooter but you do shoot. \n\n\nYou must guide your sexy pixel self through a maze of deadly puzzles, by changing your color to pass through walls, changing your bullet colors or shooting type to kill your foes. \n\nPixel: ru\u00b2 is such a great mix of Super Meat Boy and... I have no other comparison it's such a unique, fun, and challenging puzzle game. \n\nFor an early access game it's premise is strong, and there's a definite through line. The developers are doing a great job portraying their game and the path it's going to take, and if there's more of this in the future of Pixel: ru\u00b2 then I'm excited for the future.\n\nI'd have to recommend picking this up, especially right now being discounted by 15% - you can't find a much better puzzle game experience for less then $10. \n\nYou can find the first look video on my website www.earlyaccesspodcast.com.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425710492, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1427601574, "recommendationid": "14770577", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492803", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
