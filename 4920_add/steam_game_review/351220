The game is buggy, lacks certain features and the game engine itself feels clunky and archaic.\n\n[b]Here are some examples of what stood out to me:[/b]\n\n[*] When you open up any screen in the game (be it character info, inventory, checking the settings, reading a scroll and so on) the game opens up a totally new game window. All screens in the game opens up a new window.\n[*] You can't turn sound effects or music off (you can however lower the volume but you'll still be able to barely hear the game which can be annoying)\n[*] Below average quality sound effects.The sound effects become tiresome to listen to as they repeat constantly, there's very little variation.\n[*] Buttons can't be remapped. \n[*] There are no resolution/video settings except for turning fullscreen on/off. \n[*] The text font is tiny and you sadly can't increase the font size. People with bad eye sight will have huge problems reading the in-game text.  \n[*] You can't turn off the tutorial messages and they pop up during every new game. The in-game achievements and its notifications can also not be turned off.\n[*] Some tooltips are so long that they leave the screen, making it impossible to read the whole text.\n[*] There's also a FMV introduction video with the developer cosplaying as a character within the game. I personally don't mind it (even though it's cheesy), but it's without a doubt something that will turn a lot of people off. The introduction video can't be turned off and will play every single time you start a new game. It's possible to skip the video though.\n[*] Spelling errors.\n\nSimply put: There are a lot of really weird game and engine design choices that just makes the game a lot worse then what it could've been. In its current state I simply can't recommend the game even though it's pretty cheap as there are far better roguelikes out there that are also free [b](Games like: DCSS, ToME v4, Brogue, DoomRL, ADOM, Cataclysm:DDA, NetHack, Angband, Sil, Infra Arcana, UnReal World etc.)[/b].", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1428455098, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428356967, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428362691, "recommendationid": "15241978", "developer_response": "The following have been fixed/changed that you have brought up:\n\n* Changing music or sound volume all the way to the left will turn music and sound off completely.\n* You can now turn off the tutorial, achievement, and video messages.\n\n* I'd love to know what spelling errors you found so I can correct them as well as how you think the buttons should be allowed to be mapped, what tool tips are too long, and what would make the sound better for you.

I've only tried easy mode so far, and that was enough of a challenge for a starting player.\n\nOverall, this game has a good feeling and it's enjoyable, but it's not a polished game at this stage.\n\nThe game dev has been very responsive to comments and has fixed a number of issues, improving the game a lot. Thanks!\n\n\nPROS\n+ It has a very good roguelike feeling to it\n+ Enjoyable\n+ So far the difficulty has been about right\n+ The atmosphere is pretty good\n+ Good sound effects; basic but effective\n+ It's cheap\n\n\nCONS\n- The interface of this game is pretty bad. Options open in separate windows. The map is pretty darn bad and should really open in a larger window. There's no quick sell in shops that I can figure out.\n- The video I have seen was very amateurish. Kinda keeping in theme though. The voice acting is less bad, but keeps cutting out like the music does.\n- The music hardly ever plays, but it's good when it does.\n- Can't truly customise keys, though there are skill buttons you can program\n- You can do a melee attack using the arrow keys, but it seems you can't do a ranged attack using keys so you've gotta use the mouse for that. Usally a game like this would let you push a key to enter ranged mode. It feels really awkward using qweadzxc with the mouse to aim, but it does still work okay. Okay, after playing a while, I found you can right click on an skill slot at the bottom and bind the ranged attack to it, but then you can only attack in the 8 main directions. Better than nothing I suppose.\n- There's sometimes a delay for about a second after attacking or using a special move. This seems to mainly occur after alt-tabbing from another program.\n- There's several spelling mistakes, but nothing too major that I've seen\n\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n- I would recommend trying the warrior first, as the first few levels are easy with the tough guy.\n- If you run into trouble with the caster type, try again but choose a different skill. Improving the starting skill didn't seem to be effective enough, but taking the Skapens skill worked a treat.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428356500, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428476839, "recommendationid": "15241884", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513887", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433098047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 401, "steamid": "76561198004036314", "num_games_owned": 18}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'll just get right to the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- This game has a great combat and spell system.
