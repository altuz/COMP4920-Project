Then when browsing steam, I all of a sudden came across its sequel, not knowing anything about it, and decided to try it on a whim.\n\nThis game is the definition of a perfect sequel. The core gameplay from the original game which made it fun is still the focal point, just improved, and every gripe I had with the first game has been fixed. The gameplay, which consists of going as high as possible, is addictive with missions and items keeping it fresh and interesting, even after the amount of time I've already spent on the game. You can tell there was a large focus on making the gameplay feel smooth. The controls feel very similar to the way super meatboy feels, which is to say good. The graphics and music compliment the game quite well, both being very well made and a pleasure to see/hear, and overall the presentation is great, with intuitive menus and nothing to bog you down between games. \n\nSome people may argue on the price point, which is a fair point to argue given the amount of breathtaking games on steam available for the same price, but as the guy's first game on steam I could see where he is coming from. I really enjoy it, so if you don't mind the price, or the game is on sale, I'd definitely recommend trying it out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435120374, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435134976, "recommendationid": "16667357", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525061", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441562974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 212, "steamid": "76561198041666687", "num_games_owned": 126}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I wrote the music for this game. I recommend it.\nI played the first flash game a ton and was stoked to be able to provide music for this sequel. Check it out!\n\nI am of course biased, but let me talk about some of the things I personally like about this game.\nThe core gameplay of Avalanche is still here, blocks fall and you climb as high as you can. Added in are enemies and different blocks that behave in various ways based on where you are in the world. There's also a huge arsenal of powerups you can grab that will change the way you climb. This is one of those games that feels brutal at first, but when you stick with it and beat that first boss, you suddenly start to feel your progress really kick in and you're richly rewarded with new sights all the way up.\n\nVisually entertaining, highly challenging. I've seen a lot of people really enjoy just watching others play this game as all sorts of crazy things can happen.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434051872, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434064398, "recommendationid": "16312395", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471770", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453196636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 84, "steamid": "76561198024976479", "num_games_owned": 339}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I haven't played this game long, but i've gotten decently far and I can already say that this is an underrated gem.\n\nI was actually reluctant to buy this considering how little attention it was getting as silly as it sounds, because the trailer was trying too hard to do the adult swim anti-humour bit and didn't show too much gameplay. I thought since that only a total of 28 people have reviewed it (upon time of buying) that it was just a small forgettable indie game that didn't have much lasting appeal or grabbing power. I finally bought it on sale, yet I would recommend it full price.\n\nThe music and graphics for this game are the first thing that stand out- catchy and gorgeous. The gameplay's grasp on you as the player probably won't be immediate though... I started out the game frustrated and bored. The tutorial only gives you the basics (which is enough, although it doesn't have any music for some reason, making me worry the rest of the game would be just as silent) and after that you're thrown into the game, which is painfully slow to start off. The game will also be shockingly hard when you first start playing as well, making every death a \"god damn it, do I really have to start over from the slow bit again?\".\n\nThe gameplay summed up shortly: It's that one level from yoshi's island where you have to vertically climb a tower of falling blocks, only it's the entire game with much more depth. When you first start out, you will get squished. Many times. The lava will probably never kill you, because it starts out slow as molasses unless you get the risk badge. You will never be able to actually land on those damn birds that fly at you, and sometimes you might be able to sneak in a snake kill, but more often than not you'll miscalculate your jump and land right beside them, killing you instantly. Manage to get to the first boss? It will be a tedious test of patience until you finally start to do some risky moves, which will in turn make you end up dead and sending you down to the bottom again.\n\nYes, this game isn't a forgiving teacher. But don't hit that refund button just yet- it gets better. I got a hang of the game surprisingly fast, and it's secret amount of depth blindsided me. You'll start learning how to surf, and how to get combos to squeeze out as many coins as possible. You'll actually start to remember that the screen wraps and learn how to use it to your advantage. You'll learn how to kill the bosses quickly. You might even make it to space, or the moon once or twice.\n\nI do have some minor complaints with the game though, but nothing gamebreaking. Sometimes you can get an absolute terrible roll of RNG where blocks just do not stack at all how you want them to and it just never ends, making you die after a good run or make you restart at the beginning of one so you can actually progress. Walljumping feels responsive most of the times, but sometimes when you're trying to chain it, it's the most frustrating thing in the world. And for the love of god, I hate how shops work. I'm trying to run up away from the advancing wall of death and I accidentally jump on one of the shop chests, wasting my money. And if it's a deposit/withdrawl chest, I might hit my head on a ceiling and deposit multiple times. I would gladly rather press an action button to buy something than have to jump on it, even if it's some sort of badge that I have to equip to balance it out. Also, some challenges are lamely bugged, allowing you to cheat- the chest one in particular, you can just use a bank over and over to cheat it rather than actually get chests in one run.\n\nI'm not sure how long this game is before looping, and I'm not sure if the flash game was just as good as this, but I'd say those things aside it's absolutely worth your money. If you're on the fence, maybe wait on sale, but otherwise you won't regret full price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450865143, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1450865143, "recommendationid": "19867890", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503528", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505475899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 450, "steamid": "76561198067507228", "num_games_owned": 175}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's fun.

The game is so fast paced that sudden unexpected deaths can seem very frustrating at first, but as you unlock more upgrades and improve, you'll be able to avoid those situations and literally take your run to new heights. The developers are also quite active and are listening.
