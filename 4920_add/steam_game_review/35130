The combat starts out simple but towards the end of the game it becomes insane, especially when combat difficulty is set to high. \n\nThere were a few times when my buddy and I experienced some of your typicaly glitches such as no-clipping and shooting across the map when dying. However, the amount of fun we had throughout this game makes up for any minor problems. Besides, it is fun to fall through the ground now and then and have a laugh. \n\nThe length of the game is short (completed Co-op in ~10 hours on medium) but not easy. Ramping up the difficulty will surely make this short game an easy 15 - 20 hour experience.\n\n\n Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun 'small' game with an insane CO-OP mode."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506534042, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35246201", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971182949", "num_reviews": 50, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 401}, "timestamp_updated": 1506534042, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Fun and a bit challenging"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506247086, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496924", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35176279", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057221241", "num_reviews": 280, "last_played": 1506191890, "num_games_owned": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1506247086, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Nice game"}]}
