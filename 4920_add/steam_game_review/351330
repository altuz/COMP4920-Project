And then they go ahead and create puzzles that are just too difficult for me, and I can't skip them. I never got past the 2nd to last area of The City Beneath, they always do this.\n\nDROD RPG is like a standard DROD game, except the enemies don't move, ever. When you bump into them or run your sword into them, you start a back and forth of damage until one of you dies. You can get stat ups and better gear in the dungeon. For the most part, it's interesting and somewhat fun.\n\nExcept it's way too easy to play the game in such a way that the game becomes impossible and you have to restart a room, a floor, even the entire game. There are far too many ways for you to dead-end yourself. The difficulty spikes make it easy to lose all your health. Keys are a limited resource that also make it easy to get locked out of rooms and secrets. And if you want to be thorough and get most of the secrets too? Forget it, even more difficult.\n\nI've restarted the 6th floor at least 5 times, restarted the game once, and no matter what I do I keep running into brick walls because of the game design. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who isn't pursuing a room by room walkthrough, which doesn't exist and wouldn't be that fun anyway. I've given this game enough chances, I'm uninstalling it.\n\nSorry Caravel Games, but DROD RPG is bad. And I'm less likely to buy games in the series past TCB since your design polices have gone downhill as the years have gone on.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493570805, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493570850, "recommendationid": "31467828", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
