The puzzles are easy. If you've ever played any adventure game before, this will be a breeze.\n\nThe art style is okay. It's got a fun look, but nothing to amazing.\n\nAs for the navigation, it's really frustrating moving from room to room. If you click on the wrong thing, you'll have to do a lot more clicking to go through the mountains of dialogue. \n\nThe high point is the story. It's very rare for a game like this to explore such intriguing themes. I was hoping we'd explore the relationships a little bit more. Sadly, the ending is a letdown, and we don't get a satisfying conclusion.\n\nOverall: 2/5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501716298, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501716298, "recommendationid": "33981467", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503538626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 80, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "num_games_owned": 597}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[b] Belladonna [/b] is a point&click adventure that has decent visuals, story, and music. However, it also has some of the most generic puzzles in the genre. Length of the game is usually subjective criticism but in case of Belladonna, we literally talking about 30 to 60 minutes ( and half of it was reading ). I think it is fair to expect 2 to 4 hours from a point&click adventure in this price range. Personally, I found the theme of the story a lot more intriguing  than the actual gameplay and I was mildly satisfied after beating it. It's just that game is a little pricey for what it is.\n\nOur character is a female corpse that wakes up on the operating table and has to uncover the mystery behind her resurrection. Let's be honest, this isn't the most original plot and I knew exactly where the game was going. Voice acting was not a perfect match for the character but I would still prefer it over silent text. I assume the same person voiced 2 different females and the second one was a lot more distracting. Most of the story is provided through letters that are a little hard to read (where are subtitles?) I got to say that I felt like I read more text than I played the game. Saying that if you skip reading you will probably get 20 minutes of gameplay with no attachment to the characters (that would be one awful experience).\n\nConsidering that artwork seems to be made by one person it looks good. Well, he has been cutting corners in few places, you can clearly tell when something has less detail than the environment around it. To me that really ruins immersion. I like when games stay consistent with visuals. The main character is very cute for a corpse and she has some decent animation. Backgrounds, for the most part, are very nice, Overall there are some consistency issues even though I like how game looks.\n\nIf anything the game mechanics are very intuitive. Picking up objects from the background is easy and you get a text describing what you looking at. Some other games make these basic functions harder than it should be so I do appreciate nice and clean interface. The weakest part of the game are the puzzles themselves. Everything was a straight forward solution and I never had to use my brain. Maybe some prefer easy puzzles but I played enough of these games to where I expect something more creative. \n\n[b] Final Thoughts 6.5/10 [/b]\n\nObjectively speaking Belladonna does everything decently beside the most important thing, the puzzles. I really wish the game was just a little bit longer because the quality is there but not the content. Actually, I did enjoy it even though those bad reviews have valid arguments. From what I played I would recommend it only at $3 or less.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503541859, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503549643, "recommendationid": "34451089", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500095", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 135, "total_reviews": 183, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 48}}
