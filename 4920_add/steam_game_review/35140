For this playthrough I needed 15 hours, although I concentrated mainly on the main missions. I did 2 of the challenge mode maps to train my punching / evading / use of tools while fighting. This time I finished the game, and I must say it was really fun.\n\nIt's a bit frustrating, that there is no minimap, apart from that I liked the game. The story was fun, although I had to turn dialog volume to 0 at some parts of the game because of the annoying voices of Harley Quinn and the Joker, and how they announce the boss fight always the same way, sometimes unskippable. The dialog was fun too, just not when you hear the same joke the fifth time.\n\nThe fighting itself was really fun, after 3 successfull punches you are in a freeflow mode. You just hold the direction Batman has to fight an enemy next, push an attack button and he will jump there and attack sometimes flying through a whole room from one enemy to the next. There are a few different types of enemies, and you can't just punch them in the face all night long, you have to evade, block, counter, jump behind enemies to get them, but if you're good you can always use a special combination of buttons to instantly knock out any enemy, except the biggest bosses.\n\nAdditionally to the fights there are The Riddlers riddles, and in addition to that there are his little trophies. Sadly I only realized at the end of the game, that the freen text in the middle of the screen is a riddle you have to solve by thinking about what it could mean, and then using the detective mode (holding the analyzing button down) to analyze the solution in order to solve the riddle. I thought it would just be a hint for where a trophy was hidden. So sometimes I searched for a trophy at a specific spot, that fit to the riddle, but there was none. I had to analyze that spot to solve the green text riddle. Sad.\n\nThe stealth sequences were fun too, although I don't like them as much as just punching my enemies to mash."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505514713, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504237", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34982681", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198238872356", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1504900698, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1290}, "timestamp_updated": 1505514713, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Even if you aren't a fan of Batman, you should pick it up \nPros: \n-Great story\n-Great characters \n-Many easter eggs\n-Plenty of riddles to solve\n-Great map and atmosphere with and highly detailed buildings\nCons:\n-The combat system is mediocre\n-The dialogue is okay despite great deliveries from Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroy, and Arleen Sorkin\n-Sometimes repetitive\n-Storyline is less than half of the whole game, the rest is riddle hunting \nOverall, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a game that anyone should pick up\n(On a sidenote, the game may crash at least once, it happened to me only once)"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506375794, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505971", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35211139", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198107509390", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1506979592, "num_games_owned": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 468, "playtime_forever": 3041}, "timestamp_updated": 1506375794, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Best Batman series I've ever played."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506847866, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35372647", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198013594164", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1507156664, "num_games_owned": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1062, "playtime_forever": 1062}, "timestamp_updated": 1506848201, "received_for_free": false, "review": "first game in the Arkham Series, Batman: Arkham Asylum.\ni recommend the complete arkham serie ( 4games )\n\ni was not sure if i wanted to buy batman games but always wanted to give it a shot , decided to buy them all for 20$ each and i was very happy with the games.\n\nBAA tells the story of batman and a few villains in a small map where you will explore for hidden riddler trophies , fight 10 criminals at once , and try to restore peace in the asylum.\n\nthe story is good , the gameplay is good\nit is a great start to an awsome game serie"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506825657, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35361349", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198413897863", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1506837898, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 98, "playtime_forever": 98}, "timestamp_updated": 1506825657, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Its really fun, a real thrilling adventure and some puzzles to solve with lots of enemies to beat.
