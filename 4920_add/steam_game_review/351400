I only played the normal difficulty - but the game seemed like a breeze until the final 2-3 stages where all of a sudden the difficulty spikes to a point where it seems there simply hasn't been enough playtesting.\n\nIt's a great concept and the devs have done a good job implementing it for a nice little indie game.

I'm not sure why it's getting such mixed reviews. It was more fun than Bardbaraian, the closest equivalent I can think of. I have never had a problem with crashes or the difficulty. Sure the individual elements aren't excessively original (waves attack your character, drop gold, you buy upgrades every few waves) but I can't think of any other games off the top of my head that combine it all the way this one does. Every 11th wave you get a save point so if you die you can restart and shop with approximately the amount of money you would have made up to that point so you can try out different combinations.\n\nI originally bought it to play multiplayer with friends. Subsequently remembering that I don't have any friends didn't prevent me from having a blast playing it for 5 hours on easy then normal mode. Then a few months later I came back and beat it on hard mode to get all the achievements. \n\nIf the video and screenshots look even vaguely interesting to you, give The Defenders a chance. Creative light games like this should be encouraged. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445664916, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445664916, "recommendationid": "18651668", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501536", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430671847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561198006472907", "num_games_owned": 498}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Lack of Updates makes me sad so i am unistalling.
