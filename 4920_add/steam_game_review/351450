I picked Scribble Space up for half a dollar hoping it would be a short, casual sidescrolling shooter I could play through without much effort. Now that I've played it a short while, I know that if this game were freely available online, I would not have played it for more than a few seconds. Since I paid for it I felt inclined to at least get my money's worth, but this is one of the few times I have legitimately regretted a purchase on Steam. Again, it wasn't much money in the first place, but this game is much more frustrating than it is fun.\n\nThough the concept is simple, the gameplay issues are too frequent and obvious to overlook. The player hitbox isn't made clear, which makes creatively designing your own ship more dangerous to the gameplay than it is fun. Taking damage removes all your power ups, and this really wouldn't be a problem if the hitbox made more sense. Even then, though, it is almost impossible to avoid taking damage in this game, rendering you without the power ups (which are rare as it is) for the majority of the time playing. Boss fights are a nightmare to deal with, and it isn't always obvious what you are supposed to be attacking or how to even avoid taking damage. Most of the time you have to hope to just get lucky and get enough shots in to defeat the boss before you die.\n\nThe game has cards and achievements, so if you want it for either of those then go ahead. Be warned, though, that one achievement requires a lot of luck and mastery of the game, so you may spend quite a bit of time playing it if you want to 100% it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464138765, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1464138858, "recommendationid": "23193535", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500641", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449064052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 208, "playtime_forever": 161, "steamid": "76561198114829485", "num_games_owned": 896}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": "7", "review": "This game feels so empty that makes you feel want to puke.
