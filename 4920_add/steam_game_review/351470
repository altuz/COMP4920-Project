Like, a lot. You'll start off in each level in a pitch black area. Once you die (and you have to) your soul will linger there and consequently light up that area. So, basically the idea is to use your past mistake and navigate towards the end portal while avoiding spike traps and freaking insta-kill ghost.\n\nThere's both Classic and Endless mode for those who like a challenge. Me, on the other hand, has seen enough after 100 deaths. Onward to the next game.\n\nDecent 3 / 5.\n\nOh, the game does have achievements but it's in-game instead of integrated with Steam.
