It's what attracted me into playing this, fully knowing that this game doesn't include any achievements, card drops or whatsoever that I often care about when choosing games that I'm going to play.\n\nI haven't played Ragnarok, nor I know what game it is, but this piece of fine art doesn't even make me feel like I'm missing something of the part, frankly saying that I love how the game runs, simple as good ol' nintendo games, how the main menu looks like and the background music of it. Tutorial and introductions are designed properly, that any player could be at ease in understanding gameplay concepts, objectives and ideas.\n\nBattle system is simple, that the absence of complicated stuff makes the game a lot more relaxing and enjoyable to all kind of gamers, from the serious to the most casual ones. Some scenes are tear shedding, while the others are intriguing and enjoyable to watch. Game layouts are well-designed, dialogues are easy to understand, some are even inspiring, while the game's arts are fascinating, that I'd rather set them as my phone wallpaper than some cool-looking backgrounds that I have.\n\nThere are multiple endings, and the outcomes are tailored by how you picked the options. The endings are satisfying, that it really moved my heart to its content when I've finished the entire game. A quote from me for the developer, thanks letting me forget my miserable life and problems for the 9 hours of gameplay, I had fun with it.\n\nAs for the closure, (to the dev) your wish for Eternal Senia is granted, for at least, this one fan... right here.\n[i]It's still in my game library, because such an awesome masterpiece should never be deleted from my hard drive, that's what my opinion is. And although it's free, know that this game worth a thousand for me.[/i]\n\n[h1]It's over 9000!!!!/10[/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485819773, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485820170, "recommendationid": "29595136", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527062", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486500985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 347, "steamid": "76561198052268923", "num_games_owned": 35}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "For a free game, this was DEFINITELY worth the play.

There's nothing too engaging like other games like Cross code. The combat system just dumbs down to, you do damage, you take damage that's really how fights work in the game. In the dev's defense he made this game with the idea that it's meant to be a relaxing game so you don't have to constantly put a lot mind and effort into it. \n\nYou unlock 4 different skills as you progress, although they are powerful I've never personally felt like I needed to use them or have been pressured into doing so. This is due to how the game's combat works, the majority of mobs never initiate a combat with you nor do they actually continue them. You can be in a room filled with 5-10 mobs but in the end you really only end up [i]fighting[/i] one at a time. You can however use one of the AOE attacks to attack multiple ones at a time.\n\nRPG -\nThe RPG aspects are pretty simple and doesn't require any huge inventory management or whatever. This does go into the combat a bit, the combat's difficulty also does dumb down to who has the better stats and equipment. For the most part, the only RPG is grinding for materials which is luckily not that difficult or drawn out. Every piece of equipment is just a direct upgrade of the other, there's nothing like \"this weapon has higher crits but lower damage than that one...\" \n\nOddly enough you know how to build all the equipment/equipment upgrades without any problem, you don't have to learn or search for an upgrade for this or how to make that. They're automatically there in your menu.  There's only 1 instance where you could arguably \"miss\" a recipe for a weapon and armor although you technically can't miss it for any reason. \n\nThere's not many actual decisions you make throughout the game outside of the endings so not too much in the story RP aspect.\n\nDifficulty:\nAsides from the beginning and some boss fights I never actually felt too pushed or huge difficulty spikes when I was playing it. The game arguably isn't all that grindy, I'm not saying you can skip all the grind and immediately just walk through the game with no difficulty but the grind is pretty abysmal. \n\nThere is a certain dungeon the game offers you to grind for levels and materials but I'd argue that you'd only need to run them 4-6 times, (one run being 3 minutes at most) to comfortably be at a decent level to fight the other enemies but the numbers maybe an over exaggeration because that may have caused my overall experience to be too easy? By the time I made it to the 2nd dungeon I've pretty much had no issues one-two shotting all the normal mobs up until the end with my default attacks.\n\nStory: \nThe story is pretty basic, you seek out your sister that went somewhere dangerous. That's really all that could be explained without much spoilers given. The story isn't really ground breaking or inventive and I personally believe you can see where it's going if you've seen enough anime or entertainment in general. It's good enough. \n\nMy only gripe is that the only characters that are developed enough are the main character and the sister you're looking for. There's also a fairy that does join you but she just kinda serves as a information guide for when the MC doesn't understand something. You do meet a certain character but she unfortunately just serves as a plot device to progress through the main story.\n\nThe interesting thing is you somewhat feel like the dev really wanted to expand on his world but since this is his first attempt at a game he just limited himself to the main story line. Really hoping that the dev takes the feedback and tries to expand the world in the 2nd game. [spoiler]The 3rd/true(?) end might imply that the dev wants to make a 2nd game in the series since it ends in a cliffhanger of sorts.[/spoiler]\n\n\nMusic:\nThere isn't some huge array of music but there is enough variety for what you would expect from a F2P. \n\nCons:\nThe cons here are mostly just small nitpicks but they still somewhat annoyed my experience.\n- This is a game made by a Taiwanese(?) so expect a lot of grammatical errors, they never really bothered me up until the end since the ending seemed to have a lot of them.\n\n- Game doesn't scale to well at fullscreen, but this is somewhat expected considering it's using pixel graphics.\n\n- The UI is a bit annoying to handle especially when you're trying to upgrade equipment to its superior version, due to how the UI works you can't equip something or else the menu would assume you don't have the requirements to upgrade it.\n\nFor example, if I want to upgrade a sword to a mk II I'd need a Mk I version, the problem here is that if I'm equipping the Mk I version the game would assume I do not have one so I have to unequip, upgrade it than equip it again which kinda gets annoying when you have to do this for a few seperate items.\n\nThose are really my only actual gripes about the games.\n\nAfaik, they are currently working on the 2nd game and I'm really hoping the developer takes in the feedback and greatly improves on what he built in this.\n\n[h1]tl;dr[/h1]\nWhen a game like this is given out for free while a lot of Greenlight trash tries to charge you, this game is really good. \n- Gameplay is definitely not the greatest strength but it's usable\n- Basic RPG aspects\n- Decently executed story.\n- It's free and it's also their first game. \n- A small bit of grind but the grind does feel rewarding.\n- No huge difficulty spikes.\n- Short but good story.\n\nIf I had to give a rating I'd give it a 7/10. I personally won't heavily critique this game over every small problem since this game is ultimately a launching platform for a small dev team. Hopefully this series will become something great and really hoping the 2nd game improves on what we have. \n\nI'm not going to be a dbag and give this game a negative although I'm aware of its technical issues. Why? because it doesn't really deserve one, it's not made by AAA devs nor does it ask for a premium price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487152427, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487152971, "recommendationid": "29938469", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515010", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483207219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 478, "steamid": "76561198128082425", "num_games_owned": 18}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I've got nothing really bad to say about the game, beacuse it is extremely good for a free game, i enjoyed every second of it, getting all the secrets and bosses defeated was really interesting, the mechanics of all the monster were really different than others i've seen, the story was really deep and fun to experience, btw i cried with the last ending i got, and it's not easy to make me cry.\nSomething i really want to focus on is the music, it fit every second of the story and made the experience 75% more enjoyable than what it would been without it.\nTruly, when i finished the game, i really thought it should cost something, it is my actual favourite RPG Maker game, and i got so interested in it that i took my time in the bonus room.
