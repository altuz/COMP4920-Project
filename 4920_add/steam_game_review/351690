I played hours and hours of it on the Xbox 360; felt the calm of acoustic guitars, rolling hills and pigs in tutus, but also ground my teeth, threw the controller, and wept when that little popping sound heralded yet another death.\n\nHey! Remember the one thing everyone remembers about Super Mario Bros. 2? Imagine if that was developed across nearly 200 levels, with a difficulty curve that makes each new level seem possible but also makes you roar with frustration, while managing to remain fun throughout!\n\nIn short, this is the embodiment of how far a simple mechanic can be stretched, and is a MUST if you are looking for a puzzle platformer like in dayes of olde. It's quaint, fun, addictive and indie.

Two of the most lustrous hidden gems of the Xbox 360 arrive on Steam. I've only managed a brief 10 minutes with this version of the OG Apple Jack so far (I put crazy hours into throwing pandas around and getting sliced into chunks on the 360), but the entirety of it was spent sporting a huge grin, broken up only by the odd squeal of delight. \n\nY'see, beyond that adorable and effortlessly charming art direction and soundtrack lie a pair of platform games lavished with underwear creamingly smooth mechanics, a devilishly tough but always fair difficulty, and some genuine sit back in wonder level design. \n\nDo yourself a favour a buy Apple Jack 1&2 right now.

It\u2019s emphasis varies greatly from level to level, however it\u2019s generally more on the platforming \u2018execution\u2019 side than the puzzle solving, but both feel significant - full review: http://www.agoners.com/index.php/the-reviews/\n\nApple Jack 2 is basically another 61 levels of Apple Jack. So there\u2019s not too much to add to my previous review of that as it really is more of the same. Jack still comes with an immensely appley head, the levels are still incredibly varied and fun and the challenge levels are also very high once again.
