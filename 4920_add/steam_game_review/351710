If you're interested in the Neptunia series, start here. If you've just stumbled upon this, it's best for hardcore JRPG fans who prioritize story over gameplay. Controller strongly recommended.[/i]\n\nNeptunia has really grown on me in the time I've taken to get familiar with it. Everything from the world to its characters oozes with that weird Japanese charm. Helps that I'm a big fan of console history and analyzing all the little things about each console. In general, you should expect some clunky but interesting gameplay mechanics, and compelling stories with a swiss-cheese fourth wall from all the lampshading. But let's go a bit more into detail about this remake of the second game in particular.\n\nIt's true that of all the Neptunia games, the second one has some of the darkest tones in the series. A lot of fans dislike this because Neptunia is more well-known as a lighthearted anime parody of the console wars, but me? I [i][b]love[/b][/i] this. Dramedies are arguably my favourite story genre; I love it when a story can put me at both extremes while still having a natural feel. I didn't exactly have any knee-slappers or sobs, but I found myself having a lot of trouble holding back giggles at a witty lampshade, or not wanting to hug a more tsundere character when she reveals her hidden insecurities. The plot sounds straightforward enough: Neptune, Noire, Blanc, and Vert; the four CPUs of Gamindustri, have been held captive by software pirates for three years, and with the rescue of CPU Candidate Nepgear, a quest begins to save the them all and defeat the pirates. At least, it sounds easy, but with a lot of branching paths (including one particularly infamous bad ending that rivals Undertale's Genocide route), and given how every character in the game is at the very least a little genre savvy, you'll find that things are not quite as simple as you think. With regard to cutscenes, they're all quite lively through the game's animation-rigged character portraits, and out-of-character moments are few and far between. One thing about the game's storyboarding that I really do have to call out, however, is the trademark Idea Factory practice of \"wedge in a fanservice scene even if it makes no fucking sense\". A particularly egregious example in this game is a scene where the party is...frankly, sexually assaulted by Dogoos (dog slimes) which come completely out of nowhere in an underground dungeon where Dogoos don't even appear in to begin with. This happens in the middle of an intense chase scene, by the way. Yeah. Dunno what the folks at IF were smoking when they thought that was a good idea. All in all however, story is solid dramedy, filled to the brim with self-referential humour, lampshades, and fourth-wall breaking; but also balanced by some touching monologues, heartwarming reunions, and one of the most horrific game endings ever published to date. But yes, do beware of forced fanservice.\n\nGameplay is rough at the edges and suffers from forced grinding, but it's nowhere near as bad as Neptunia Re;Birth 1. As it is mostly the same compared to the rest of the series, I'll just explain the general gameplay of the whole series. Some unique mechanics the Neptunia series brings to the table as a turn-based RPG are free movement on the battlefield (which also matters, as individual weapons and skills have different areas of effect). This is a great mechanic, although you will find yourself getting annoyed when you repeatedly flick the analog stick to try and line up an attack [i]just[/i] right so you can get multiple enemies in one go. Normal attacks are put into special chains, where you assign individual attacks to different buttons based on a point budget. There are three different attack types, split up across these three buttons: Rush, which is pretty much the only one you need; Power, which is kind of useless except for Tera D-Drive; and Break, which has its utilities in decreasing guard gauge, but typically Rush is more efficient anyway. Despite its obvious balancing issues, this system feels really good to play with--freely swapping attack types at the press of a button feels pretty cool. Speaking of the guard gauge, that's something all enemies have. Effectively, when it hits zero (causing a Guard Break), the enemy's defense drops to zero. The gauge does partially restore on their turn however, so you need to time guard breaks correctly for maximum effect. The EXE Drive gauge is another unique mechanic; as you deal and take damage while in a dungeon, the gauge fills up. It's split into four segments; however, all four segments are not available immediately. Having segments filled will allow you to append EXE Finishes to your normal attacks for an extra kick; or spend a segment or more to perform an EXE Drive attack, which are the most extreme of all skills, complete with ludicrous attack animations and obscene damage. It feels rewarding to let loose with a full EXE gauge after turns of playing conservatively, and again, it feels good. All in all, the unique mechanics offered by Neptunia are pretty fun to play with, but they tend to have some issues with streamlining, and the concepts can be kind of alien at first. Also, don't use a keyboard and mouse. Keyboard and mouse control is awful with every Neptunia game; just grab your Xbox controller.\n\nAll in all, Neptunia Re;Birth 2 is the perfect entry point into the series. While its more serious tone compared to the other games can give new players the wrong idea about the series' theme and tone, it gives players a far better idea of what to expect of Neptunia games than the slow, grindy, and poorly-aged Neptunia Re;Birth 1--which I feel would actually turn players off because of its clunkiness. It's totally cool to skip the first game if you want to do a complete playthrough; you're not missing much, especially considering Re;Birth 1 takes place in another dimension entirely. And if you're not here because you've heard of Neptunia from the grapevine, this is a very strange and quite niche JRPG that can be quite the beast to tame, but you'll find yourself being a loyal fan in no time if it resonates with you. Pick it up if you're a hardcore JRPG fan, and see what the fuss is about.\n\n[strike]also uni is my waifu and i'm proud of it[/strike]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504688880, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504689498, "recommendationid": "34772004", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517396", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504700052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3021, "steamid": "76561198059638826", "num_games_owned": 221}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So I made 100% achievements and spent a lot of time on game and I can say game is good but not good as Re;Birth1 but still I had a lof of fun with this game.\n\nPros:\n+New characters\n+Stella Dungeon\n+a lot of endings\n+Sense of humour(worst than re;birth 1 but still fine)\n+Funny Moments\n+Storyline is good but not awesome\n+Free Lilly ranks from gossips\n+Opening Theme\n\nCons:\n-Crash(Maybe my pc is a bit too old)\n-a bit fps drop\n\n\nWell game wasn't good as Re;Birth 1 but still is worth to buy it and play it.
