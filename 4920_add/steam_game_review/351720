The display is stuck in a unrecoverable resolution that puts all of the user interface off screen and unavailable. I got luckhy once and managed to click what sounded like a button (hear a little sound effect like you get when scrolling over something you can click on) and managed to change the resolution to fit. I thought I was in luck, but alas no such luck. I quit the game after an hour playing (and REALLY liking the game), then thinking all was well since i changed the resolution to fit it would start right up same as I last set it to. Nope. Same oversized interface again. Couldnt get lucky off screen again, and gave up.\n\nThe developer exoplained that they are looking intio this issue with the newer MacBook Pro models. New models often have new display needs, or settings. \n\nThat said, I would suggest if you have a MacBook Pro made in mid 2016 or newer, wait until a new update comes that addresses the issue. This is a fun tower defense game and if I could play it, I would totally recommend it for everybody. Just not new MBPro users, yet.\n\nUPDATED REVIEW \n\n\nWindowed mode put the game in a unresponsive state. It looked right, but did not respond to any mouse clicks. It was like clicking on a screen shot. This game does NOT work on newer MBPs. \n\nAfter seeing there was an update recently, I messaged the developer asking for clarification about the screen issues and if they were fixed yet? I offered to help test it and buy the upodated version after it was fixed. He seemed genuinely annoyed with me. Even told me \"it works fine\" & \"Tough Luck\". OK that was uncalled for. Failed at customer service 101\n\n I tried to explain that I liked the game and only wanted to help. Then long story short he finally told me (in contradiction to earlier statements) that they \"know about the problems with all their games on new MBP's\" and are working on it:steamfacepalm:. Really? OK? He couldve just told me that in the first place. I beleive in trying to help when I can and support good development, but the BS about it \"works fine\" and saying \"tough luck\" then later contractict himself by saying they know about the problem (remember, having just heard from the same guy it \"works fine\") and will update their games in a month or so leaves a bad taste in my mouth. All I wanted to know was if or when it would be fixed, offered help, offered to purchase again once fixed. I didnt need a rude run around. \n\n I was just trying to help. do NOT buy.  :steambored:", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488717763, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494411490, "recommendationid": "30336453", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492412", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489527045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 782, "steamid": "76561197986166163", "num_games_owned": 567}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "3", "review": "In this tower defence game you're supposed to defend different stations around the galaxy each with three levels of challenge.
