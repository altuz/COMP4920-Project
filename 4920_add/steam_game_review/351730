The time you get a day to do stuff is pretty short pretty much.\n\nThe way you interact with stuff is silly. You can drag stuff that isn't in your inventory to the crafting part, but you'll have troubles doing so if the inventory covers around 50% of the stuff in range, and then you have your character to content with.\n\nIt feels like the game was made for controllers, but from what I've read even that isn't amazing either. There is also a lack of content, You can just google the crafting guide and you'll find there's pretty much not a lot in the game, which doesn't help to the repetitive feeling.\n\nIt also appears the developer has finished making anymore changes to this game.\n\n[b]See, I think the game progresses as quick as it does because it tries to mask the lack of content. You can't do a lot in a day, because there's not a lot to do in the game.[/b]\n\n\nI'd have a more neutral outlook on the game if were half priced.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498140259, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498140259, "recommendationid": "32643014", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540789", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498629353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 489, "steamid": "76561198258020007", "num_games_owned": 34}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game at first may seem hard and not fun at all but soon it will grow on you.\n\nIt requires you to know things with memory at times and guess recipies.\n\nPeople say that you lose energy very fast and say that you are forced to find food all the time.\n\nBut isn't that what a true survival game is?\n\nTrying to survive with your mind and knowlage of the envirements while trying to make new things.\n\nConstantly keeping your fire lit and keeping your food supplie high.\n\nTraveling to new lands to find rare and unusual animals to make better items.\n\nTrying to stay alive in the toughest envirement and avoiding deadly predators.\n\nAny way you can fix some of these by going to the wiki.\n\nEither way this game is made to be hard so players can have a challenge.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493476273, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493476273, "recommendationid": "31441320", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497192122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 703, "steamid": "76561198271139966", "num_games_owned": 6}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Words cant describe this game.
