It consists of [b]four episodes divided into eight levels each[/b] and you take the role of a soldier in some sort of power armor with an array of interesting weapons. You\u2019ll get teleported to different planets to deal with the AI\u2019s defense system, and although these locations vary slightly from each other, they feel very similar and some areas are more annoying than challenging. \n\nThe enemies you\u2019ll be encountering are mostly boring turrets that can hit you from long distances with high accuracy taking different chunks of your health depending on the projectile they fire. [b]There are no medkits or health items in this game[/b], you have to pick up the energy dropped from destroyed machines or enemies and be quick about it, because [b]it disappears quicky[/b]. Did I mention that shrapnel causes damage? So [b]beware of explosions near you[/b]. There is also some mechs, submarines, tanks and hovering vehicles but you\u2019ll only face them in a couple of missions. \n\nThe controls are not very smooth and [b]movement feels floaty[/b], some areas of the game have lower gravity or snow and you will find yourself slipping like the floor is covered in vaseline. The high jump is a double edge sword, as falling deals damage especially if you happen to jump from an unsuspected cliff into a pit. The map serves little navigational purpose, although you can locate certain items in it. Speaking of which, [b]whenever you start a mission you must track down weapons and ammo IN the map[/b], you don\u2019t start with any sort of defense at your disposal which kinda sucks, since most of the good guns may be hidden in the most inhospitable place. \n\nI started on the normal difficulty but got frustrated midgame and switched to easy because some of the terrains in the game are so unforgiving, aiming is terrible, falling and shrapnel damage is ludicrous, ammo is scarce and the missions are repetitive and uninspired. I\u2019d say [b]give this one a go if you\u2019re a hardcore fan of 90\u2019s Doom clones[/b], otherwise you\u2019re not missing much.\n\nHighlights include the music, ocean and lava planets, a fucking gun that fires tornadoes and the cool live action intro.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502752187, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502752187, "recommendationid": "34245311", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498576", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449151053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 444, "steamid": "76561198022244008", "num_games_owned": 2080}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The good old days :)\n\nI have played the demo to this as a kid and I only had 2 levels.
