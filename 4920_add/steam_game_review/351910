There are no real options to actively influence what the vikings are doing, what priorities they have, there are no options for the storages what should be stored where, etc. Camera angle is horrible with no proper options to move the camera where you want it. If your woodworker ever runs out of trees you're screwed because a new woodworker needs logs that you cannot get without a woodworker .. overall it lacks in many many areas of gameplay and is not well thought out. It does look like a settlers game, but it doesn't really play like one. It's more like a ressource management game where you decide beforehand what you build when, without any options to make things up as you play.\n\nIf this were an early access title I'd say it's decent and would hope that it sees some improvements, but for a full title, its lacking.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504789800, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504789800, "recommendationid": "34794046", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508600", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 64, "total_reviews": 120, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 56}}
