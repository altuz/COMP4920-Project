Would honestly make a cool movie. The game glitched out on me a few times and you'd likely have to replay it to get all the achievements as some are based on choices. \n\nReally great and not too hard for a casual gamer either!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505954416, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505954416, "recommendationid": "35094606", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500510", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 76, "total_reviews": 111, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 35}}
