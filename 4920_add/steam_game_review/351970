Even characters I wasn't personally fond of at least had unique characteristics that made them stand out.\n[b]+[/b] Music is really good and I found myself looking up the soundtrack on YouTube after I was done playing. My personal favorite being Zaveid's theme, which has a weird western/techno mashup that gives me a Wild Arms kind of feel. \n[b]+[/b] Story isn't too bad, although I prefer how the anime handled certain events more than the game.\n[b]+[/b] One of the few games where the English dub is actually pretty good, although the \"Tales of\" series has good voice direction regarding their dub content in general. I think Symphonia was incredible. \n[b]+[/b] I think the world is pretty. If I could visit a video game world, I'd definitely like to visit the locations in Zestiria. \n\n[h1]THE BAD[/h1]\n[b]-[/b] There is a tutorial for everything. 7 hours into the game I was still getting tutorials after the end of battles. I think the developers thought there combat system was far more complex than what it actually was.\n[b]-[/b] The localization team decided to include a lot of meta jokes and memes into character dialogue. Combine that with the constant tutorials at the end of every combat, you could see my ultimate frustration with wanting to like this game initially because the translators go out of their way to take you out of the story and world development.\n[b]-[/b]I wasn't a fan of how equipment worked at all. \n[b]-[/b]Treasure chests are almost never worth your time unless you need cat ears for your waifu/husbando\n[b]-[/b]Big pretty world has pretty much nothing happening in it. Large vasts of land with few enemies, just there to pad out time.\n[b]-[/b]Speaking of the map, while it has the illusion of being open world, and while you can technically go anywhere, you're mostly going to spend a lot of time just fast traveling or being locked out of large portions because of story elements preventing you from moving forward. However...\n[b]+[/b]...I do give them credit in that, instead of a solid invisible wall once you reach an area you shouldn't go to, they DO let you go there, but[spoiler]the malevolence is so thick Sorey can barely traverse through it, so you COULD keep going, but you're going to get your shit kicked in trying[/spoiler]. \n\n[h1]THE UGLY[/h1]\n[b]- -[/b] The Turtlez and Katz, holy shit, fuck those things.\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1] \nI've never had such a dramatic 180 on a game like I did with Tales of Zestiria. I went from absolutely loathing it to loving it, which was unusual considering the amount of time it took for my change to happen. I was serioiusly about 15 hours into the game and still hated my time with it, only continuing to play because of a personal disdain for leaving stories or games unfinished regardless of my opinion of them. I've only abandoned a game/story twice because it became too unbearable; this was not one of those times.\n\nThe game has a sense of humor that I don't share, which is why it took me so long to start appreciating it. And, as mentioned in my summary, the tutorials along with some of the character dialogue; I felt like I was constantly being kicked out of the world development to service some lame joke. While the jokes are still sprinkled throughout the entirety of the game, and some of the character development is questionable, once the tutorials stop the story begins to pick up. \n\nAny other game, being 15  hours into it and not liking your time would be a huge downside, but in fairness a lot of my initial time is spent in menus, reading lore, inventory management, and reading those stupid fucking tutorials that appeared at the end of battles. On a second playthrough, or a speedrun, I wouldn't spend nearly that kind of time dealing with that crap, but first impressions are everything, and the first ones left me with a sour taste. \n\nAs I stated though, I finally came around. The meta humor is still not my thing, especially in fantasy worlds, but I learned to look past that and appreciate the characters, which won me over. I wish some were better developed: the most potentially interesting one constantly leaves your party, to the point where I thought they were building up to some awesome reunion, but nope, they're not coming back. \n\nNot that it would ever happen, but I think the world of Zestiria could branch off to an interesting RTS game with the interesting political turmoil that crops up. \n\nAnyway, despite my bitching and issues, I finally came around to whole-heartedly loving this game to the point I even went on to watch the anime and purchased some of the DLC. \n\nI prefer how some of the story elements played out in the anime more than in the game, but I appreciate them both equally and can say I would recommend this game to any RPG fan. :)\n\nAlso there isn't nearly enough hentai of Laila and a disturbingly large amount of Edna.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505512049, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506314478, "recommendationid": "34981997", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536061", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506051531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 176, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3799, "steamid": "76561198065260032", "num_games_owned": 17}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun and awesome, has a nice cast and has funny humor the graphics are great although there is a issue with them using repeating ground tiles in larger areas its too noticable..., outside of that its relaxing and is fun all the way,", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505530018, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505530018, "recommendationid": "34986109", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504505", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506822234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 380, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 380, "steamid": "76561197972394679", "num_games_owned": 362}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Tutorials of Zestiria is a touching tale about a schizophrenic boy who convinces a beautiful princess that his hallucinations are real.
