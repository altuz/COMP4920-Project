I don't normally bother with them, but I just wanted to counter the negative reviews (most of which seem to have vanished now). There was an issue with steam upon release which apparently resulted in the game being erroneously free for a short period of time. It was never meant to be free, but some reviewers had given them a negative review simply because they felt shortchanged because they paid for a game that was free for a bit... they were saying it should be free to play, even though there are no in app purchases...Dev's gotta be supported somehow! I paid for it and I'm glad I did.\n\nThis is a fun little puzzle game. I'll put it simply, if you like puzzle games and want to try a bejeweled type game with a chess twist, give it a go. There are a few different game types, and it does seem to be tricky in some levels (especially the puzzle and challenge levels) and I'm still fairly early on in the game.\n\nIt's cheap, it is a tried and tested genre with a twist, and the dev seems to be active in the forums at this early stage, so I'd definitely recommend it if you like this type of game.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458308353, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1458308353, "recommendationid": "21903103", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531271", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462291751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 42, "steamid": "76561197997988763", "num_games_owned": 810}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really like the concept but i wish they had not gone for this objective based puzzle, high score or puzzle quest style battles just would have worked better.

This is mainly because the tiles are signified as Chess pieces and they follow the Chess movement ruleset. The 'matching' follows the match-3 ruleset; Puzzle Quest (MPQ), Bejeweled style.\n\nHow it usually works is each of your 'turns' is broken into three moves. So, you get to plan/set three movements of three different tile pieces, and then they all move together at the same time 'completing' your turn.\n\nYou can make match 4, 5, etc 'L' and 'T' shapes, etc. If you match 5 tiles you get a special 'Queen' tile piece that you can make some special combo matches to get bonus points.\n\nEach board will be of a certain gameplay type, including; normal mode (standard gameplay), puzzle mode (solve a trick match), challenge mode (clear a specific number of blocks).\n\nOn a normal/standard gameplay board each turn will have what is called a 'point requirement' which actually works like a 'tax'. Basically every turn after your 'matches' have triggered and you have accumulated points then the 'point requirement' is deducted from that turns points haul. If you gained more points than the 'point requirement' then your total score will increase by the difference, if you gained less points then the difference will be deducted from your total score instead. The major downside to this 'tax' is that each turns point haulage also must reach a certain amount to unlock the collectable treasure pieces, which unfortunately is after the 'tax' has been deducted.\n\n\nRoom for improvements:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n1) There is no tutorial, limited story telling, so it is difficult to workout what sequence you should play the boards in, etc. When I first started I didn't understand what the green, red, or blue 'nodes' stood for or what the 'green key' signified.\n\n2) In the planning/setting of the 3x tile movements that make up my 'turn' why can we not have the ability to 'cancel'? If you change your mind about which pieces you want to move after you have already set one piece then you are screwed.\n\n3) I am not sure yet, but I think if you want to collect all the treasure pieces you may have to play certain 'nodes' over and over as some of the treasure pieces will be quite hard to get. The real problem here though is that on the map the 'nodes' don't show you what treasure is at that location, so the only way to find out will be to enter and then play them. This will result in a huge amount of hunting through 'nodes' if you want to go back for missing treasure pieces in the future. Or, a huge amount of 'grinding' if you decide to only move forward on the map once you have collected all treasure pieces from each 'node'.\n\n4) Would be nice if the game had achievements and more music tracks, I think the game only has one?\n\n\nIf you understand how to play Chess and like match-3 then I would recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467801257, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1467802070, "recommendationid": "24131078", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485974379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 588, "steamid": "76561198015189830", "num_games_owned": 637}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really wanted to like this game but I can't.
