Limited resolution, too many buttons, lack of full support for gamepad, it adds up to a somewhat frustrating flying experience when you just want to blow **** up. \n\nOne would have hoped that whoever made it run on modern platforms (it does run fine on Win7x64) would have bothered to create a decent mapping for gamepad, but no luck here. Game doesn't want to map a lot of commands, and have no way of figuring on which control is which. For example, let's say you want to map the two triggers to shoot... nope, can't do that. Those are ANALOG controls. ARGH! Okay, map to \"rudder\" (left right turns). Go into the game... It's REVERSED! I hit left and I turn RIGHT! had to go into options/controls and turn on \"INVERTED\". Do this for EVERY analog control. Oh, and it doesn't support the digital pad. \n\nI guess I could have opened up XPADDER and tried to remap some more commands, but I'm too tired fighting with the game rather than playing it. \n\nBeing an ancient game even on older machine frame rate is silky smooth. And graphics are decent. Sound is okay. \n\nThe main problem is the game doesn't quite seem to make of itself. Being a \"Strike\" series member, Fair Strike is trying to invoke some old shooters like Desert Strike, Jungle Strike, and so on, but those are isometric and semi-3D shooters. This is a full 3D arcade-y flight sim.  It'd be the difference between original River Raid and Lock-On. There's even a \"simulation controls\" (with full cyclic and collective controls) if you find the arcade controls (almost like hovercraft) too limiting. \n\nIf you want a fun helo shooter, go play Thunderwolves instead. This game is a bit too old and quirky to be enjoyable nowadays.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429951168, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429951168, "recommendationid": "15531675", "language": "english", "votes_down": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503238", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482922613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 137, "steamid": "76561197961146235", "num_games_owned": 241}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "MAXIMUM HELIPOWER\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456007525, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456007525, "recommendationid": "21350926", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485516", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489241661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561198339401910", "num_games_owned": 74}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Shitt=shit THIS GAME IS SHITT 0/10 recommend DONT W8ST A SEC  for this SHITT:p", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492537051, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492537051, "recommendationid": "31222794", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488883", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439739892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561197969575819", "num_games_owned": 3910}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I was hoping for a nostalgic blast of action-simuation helicopter fun;  Instead it's just a rereleased old game.
