A surreal landscape which you battle across on trains isn't something you get to play everyday. Sadly, despite the game's strong visual appeal the game play falls apart quite quickly. Tutorials leave you painfully unaware of basic mechanics, such as reloading train cars via the repair station. On only the third level it became apparent that the computer has infinite resources as well as the ability to repair their warehouses for building more trains. A very frustrating fault since I was forced to constantly retreat to retrieve more ammo for my trains while the computer simply built more, restocking their forces by the time I returned and drawing out the level far longer than need be. Often I also struggled with getting all my train's guns to fire consistantly, adding to the frustration of taking down the computer's few remaining units. Also, the incessant tooting sound effect of the train's whistle will slowly drive you insane.\n\nPros\n-very beautiful look\n-quirky fun story\n-unique approach to RTS\n\nCons\n-unfair AI\n-frustrating under explained mechanics\n-lack of meaningful control during combat\n-toot toot toot\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Review is based on approx. 1 hour of gameplay.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434390340, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434452438, "recommendationid": "16423021", "language": "english", "votes_down": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475526", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464868297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 138, "steamid": "76561198132736154", "num_games_owned": 5}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Reviving my chilhood memory", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503367992, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503367992, "recommendationid": "34406784", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 11, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
