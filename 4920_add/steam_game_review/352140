The match 3 game is only really necessary when the game tells you to play it, and it's timed and impossible to strategize.

After fine-tuning your camp, you have to move to a new area and complete a very tedious process in order to bring some of your progress with you.

The demo-video on steam shows it locked to 4:3, however the game DOES scale to fill your monitor (looked fine at 1080p widescreen for me.)\n\nMy wife absolutely loved the game, and actually beat its campaign today, the same day we bought the game.\n\nMechanics are very, very, simple. It's a \"casual\" game. You can play the entire game with only a mouse. Scrolling with a keyboard feels kinda slow, so using just your mouse is very preferrable.\n\nYou control a limited number of workers and order them to complete basic tasks, gather food, wood, stone, water, and so on. Your workers cannot die, from starvation, animal attacks, or anything else, so theres really no \"mistakes\" you can make, other than just being innefficient. It's completely safe to leave the game unattended for hours, however you won't gain anything beneficial from doing so.\n\nThere are no microtransations or time sinks. Some actions/activities take longer to complete, but it's only to scale with the importance of the task you're doing (ie, scouting an important cave for a main-questline might take a few minutes) and to give each of the maps some longevity. There is no \"speed up\" options or anything like that in the entire game, although on particularily longer tasks you can \"accelerate\" the process by using extra workers and food. \n\nGameplay feels a lot like a mobile game with all the microtransactions and time sinks removed.\n\nFor the price I paid, around 5-bucks, I feel I received sufficient game depth.

By infinite, I mean there is always a way to get more of what you need.\n[*] Different actions require certain resources and time. Some tasks are done quickly while others can take minutes.\n[*] Buildings can be freely placed on an isometric grid. There aren't dedicated spots like most Alawar strategies.\n[*] There is a decent number of types of resources that each have a purpose.\n[*] Cooking can be done to use resources/ingredients to make food and stat boost items (faster workers, etc).\n[*] Smelting to make more valuable ingots to sell for money.\n[*] All items can be sold to raise money. Some ingredients can only be obtained by buying them from town.\n[*] Later in the game, there are demand spikes that make random items worth 3x more than usual. Selling in-demand items is a good way to raise the money required for the very expensive vehicles, upgrades, etc.\n[*] Random, optional objectives will appear that provide rewards if completed.\n[*] The graphics have a bit more detail than the usual Alawar cartoony style.\n[/list]\n\nThere are also different mini games inside of the overall resource gathering and building part:\n[list]\n[*] Bejeweled-style Match 3 game for mining : 3 blocks is a standard clear, 4 gives one type of power up, and 5 gives a stronger one. Ore is trapped in the dirt that is cleared as blocks are matched beside them.\n[*] Fishing mini-game : A dialog appears when a fishing spot is clicked. Bread (crafted) is used as bait. Different type of fish can be caught. One of them is used in crafting, and the others are either used just to replenish food or sell for money.\n[*] Alchemy-style puzzles : There aren't many, but some objectives require this type of puzzle to be completed. A pile of items are shown, and they have to be combined in the right order to meet the objective. Doing it without making mistakes will get you a money bonus.\n[*] A few different types of logic puzzles  : By no means are they brain-bending, but there are a few other puzzles to complete as objectives.\n[/list]\n\nThere are some things that keep this from being a perfect casual game, but I wouldn't call them cons.\n[list]\n[*] Some of the words used are a bit odd. It's obvious that they are a case of \"lost in translation\". For instance, to fish, the action you take is \"Put Out\". That sounds like something you do on a date. I would expect \"Cast\", \"Cast Line\", etc. Landing the fish is done with \"Strike\". I would expect \"Reel In\" as the action. There are also a few oddities in the in-game achievement descriptions.\n[*] There are in-game achievements that could've easily been implemented as Steam achievements. I like going after achievements, and I completed all of them in the game. It would be nice if they were also in my achievement collection.\n[/list]\n\nI really liked the game. It was about as long as I expect almost any Alawar title to be, and the overall variety made it a bit more than a reskinned resource/time/worker management game. I got this game on sale for $1.49, and it was definitely worth it. The full price isn't too bad, either.\n\nOn a side note: I'd like to know how people are getting keys to publish reviews of partial play-throughs.

They usually do not appeal to me. Yet the premise of this game \"Superhero goes missing and now you and your team must solve the mystery to find him!\" peaked my interest.\n\nThe game is quite short, and there is no way ( that I could discern ) to objectively \"lose\". Your team goes from island to island solving puzzles and playing small mini games to complete quests. Nothing is ever taken away from you, so the game is very low-pressure. (I suspect that its made for children. But its fun for adults too, especially if you just got out of a really competitve game and want something laid back to help you wind down.)\n\nThere is a strategic element to it too, but more about build order and building placement to optimize your economy, rather than commanding armies.\n\nThe story is a little cheesy , but moves right along (especially if you don't follow all the side quests, which I initially did until I realzied they are procedurally generated and infinite). The integration of archeology and comicbook style superheroes was genius. It worked amazingly well, and its something I've never seen before.\n\nIf I have any one major criticism about the game, its that its so short. Even going off and doing a lot of sidequests, I completed it in something like 10 hours. Which isn't bad, it just left me wanting more. A few of the puzzles, for example, were only done once. I'd really like to see some DLC or expansions with more islands and more puzzles.\n\nAnyway: thoroughly enjoyed it. I bought it during the Steam summer sale when it was under $5. Its definitely worth more than that. Probably $10-$15.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438563175, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438563175, "recommendationid": "17359500", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507586", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1428951335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2389, "steamid": "76561197965875174", "num_games_owned": 90}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Hello All,\n\nFirst for the price you get a much more involved game than you would think.  So far I haven't seen any bugs that I can tell, and its got good game play.\n\nThis game has one major drawback that I didn't see others mention, the constant clicking.  You have to micro manage everything, constantly.  Now most of us are used to that in some fashion in these type of games, but this is where the short cuts where taken, no matter what about every 20 seconds you have to click on everything that produces food, water, or cash, as well as all the resources that respawn for your workers to go harvest/collect.  This gets old fast.  clicklety click click click.  Thats all you do in this game.  keep clicking on the same tree, bush, same everything every 15 to 20 seconds as it respawns.  \n\nEven using the resources you gather, every few seconds click on the kitchen, to make more stuff, no auto queing.  After 10 hours I was clicked out.  Just way to much clicking.   That said, if you can suffer through that, the rest of it is as others said a fun little game.   \n\nif the workers would be auto gather on where you send them once, and the wells, tents, and grills would auto collect after the first upgrade, that would make the game much more tolerable.\n\n\nEdit the next day ... ok so once you get to level 19 ... you get a reprieve from most of the clicking.  They finally give you a perk where you only have to click on one tent, or one water well, or one brazier, and you collect everything from them all.  Also by that time, you aren't so desparate for collecting the respawning wood stone and food as much so the game play is much more enjoyable.\n\n\nI finished the game today ...  nice game, well wortth the price, but i don't see any real replay ability.   I also got the feeling like I had played this game before or one very very similiar.  \n\nI would highly suggest they patch this and put that once click resource perk so you get it before you leave the first island, that would really make the game play much more enjoyable.\n\nAlso for you planners who like to max resources before you jump to the next new place ... um as far as food, water and cash go ... don't bother , you basically start over each time.  When you get to the third place .... thats when its worth really going for it, and purchasing most of the big stuff.\n\nEnjoy, looking forward to a second one.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428777423, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428825686, "recommendationid": "15310591", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507893", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429056448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 184, "steamid": "76561198068849291", "num_games_owned": 2788}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Buka makes some very fun games and this is no exception.

It's a relaxing game similar to the types of games you'd find on your cellphone or ipad without the need to keep spending real money to level up.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433317714, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433317714, "recommendationid": "16150925", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499708", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431739424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 739, "steamid": "76561198002183810", "num_games_owned": 3283}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "must play casual game!!!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431739504, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431739504, "recommendationid": "15847025", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500087", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430737299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 811, "steamid": "76561197995797868", "num_games_owned": 129}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a simple game, easy to play, and quite enjoyable too.
