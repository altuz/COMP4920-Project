Maybe due the fact that this game is just a cheap mobile game port.\n\n[b]Level/Track Design[/b]\n- Very, very bad. It seems that they just generated a few track section elements and after that they put this few elements together \u2013 over and over again. Sometimes they call it a new track when they changed the daytime (no weather effects \u2013 only the switch between day and night), sometimes it is the same track just reversed and sometimes it looks like they just change the amount of enemies or laps. 50 tracks they said? More like 5 settings which got combined over and over again until they got their 50 boring tracks.\n\n[b]Sound[/b]\n- Also very bad. The sound mix from this game sounds horrible on my 5.1 system. Nearly every sound effect comes from the rear left/right speakers. Also some effects are so damn loud while other sound effect, like the enemy car engine from beside you, are as quiet as a graveyard.\n\n[b]Gameplay/Game design[/b]\n- Again just ridiculous. Well what else could I expect from a russian game? I mean the position notice is still in russian language and was not even translate..\n- You only got only 3 weapons. 1 rocket launcher, 1 minigun and 1 mine thrower. The minigun and the rocket launcher are hitscanning weapons so you just have to get in range and pulling the trigger \u2013 Aiming works automatically (you always aim perfectly on the next enemy in front of you as long as you are in range). \n- You got only 3 powerups \u2013 Turbo, Shield, Health. Boring and often very bad placed.\n- General gameplay decisions like:\n[list]\n[*]If a car got destroyed it will fly around for a few meters and while it does this, the wrack can pickup powerups/ammunition. Also the destroyed car can fly into the finish which count as successfully ended a race..\n[*]When you got destroyed you lost all your ammo. The ammo boxes will lay on the ground as ammo packages. Normally you will just spawn into the packages and pick it up again so this is pretty useless.\n[*] No stats for the cars. The cars which I got just feel the same in handling, acceleration\nand top speed.\n[*] You only spawn with half of your life after you died (maybe a bug?)\n[/list]\n\n[b]AI[/b]\n- Bullshit. It is just a matter of luck if you win or lose. The enemies are always faster than you. You have no chance to get them when they are out of sight for one moment. \n- Also it seems that the cars stop fighting when I was too far in front of them. Unfair, pure luck, zero fun.\n- The AI dont lose control and their cars are always stronger. If the AI wants to go right than it goes right no matter if you are in the way. And if you are in the way than they will push you away without any problems \u2013 dont even try to push back even if you would have a tank! The AI would still kick you out of the track without giving a fuck.\n\n[b]Pricing[/b]\n- You can clearly see that this game was a rip-off mobile game before it was added to steam. The prices (especially for new cars) are way too high, after I played some maps I got less money for kills and the money penalty for dying is as much as 2 kills now. At least they deleted the ingame store from the original mobile game. (on the mobile game you could buy ingame money for real money)\n\n[b]Bugs[/b]\n- The game is full of bugs. Examples:\n[list]\n[*]The race ends on many tracks far before you reach the finish line (like 100 meters before)\n[*] The game doesnt update your position correctly sometimes so you can lose a race even when you finished first\n[*]Ammo packages slide out of the map very often and the colliding boxes for these packages ares bad so you can get trouble with picking them up\n[*] I didnt receive my money after some races.\n[*] I couldnt purchase the nitro update for any of my cars\n[*] If you bought an update for your car it wont save the old part so you have to pay for every change again.\n[*] After you respawned your car it still looks broken. Even when you got fully recovered via powerups your car will still looks like scrapped\n[/list]\n[b]Multiplayer[/b]\nDoes not exist. No one would play it anyway.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nDoes not exist. Finish all maps \u2013 the end (without intro/outro of course).\n\n\n\n[H1]Neutral points[/h1]\n\n[b]Menu and settings[/b]\n- Clearly a one to one mobile device port. Configuring the few options works shitty.\n\n[b]Destruction[/b]\n- Is buggy and doesnt look impressive but at least they did something like damage models for the cars and breakable environment (of course only some, small objects!).\n\n\n\n[H1]Positive points[/h1]\n\n[b]None[/b]\n\n\n\n[H1]Conclusion[/H1]\nWasted potential so dont waste your money and time for this waste. This is just another crappy mobile game port from some random russians who want to steal your money. 10 euros for this is pure scam. You cant compare this games with games like Blur, Gas Guzzlers or Carmageddon - even Post Apocalyptic Mayhem and Fireburst are better.
