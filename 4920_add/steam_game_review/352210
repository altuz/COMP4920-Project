A very sylish game and nice easy menus. I liked having the tutorial after I jumped right in first time and didn't really know what I was doing.\n\nThere is something wickedly addictive with this game. For some reason there is some sick pleasure in banging those cells together before they go sour. You can have to stay alert because it can all go very pear shaped very quicky just when you think you've got it nailed.\n\nEasy to see that a lot of time and love has gone into this. Nice music, suits the gameplay well.

In other words, even if I click on a cell to move it, just as often as not, the cell will not move, as if the game refuses to register the hit. I've had to click a single cell multiple times to get it to register, and many times, it never does, only to turn into a virus.\nThe second reason is some of the sounds, at least to me, are VERY sad and depressing. Through the game, there's a sound that reminds me of a dog, or even a baby, crying, and this makes me sad. And game sounds basically NEVER make me sad. Only a few games, that I've ever even heard of, have sounds like this, and this game is very much one of them.\n\nNot to mention that at any time during a game, things could cascade and the game could end very quickly, with nothing that can be done to at least try to from this.\n\nMy suggestions:\n1) Get rid of, or replace the sad sounds with something not so sad.\n2) Have the cell under the mouse cursor shimmer some, before it's even clicked, simply by being under the cursor. That way you know what will happen when you click.\n3) Improve the mouse cursor hit detection.\n4) Add some more variety in levels, etc. You could vary the color of the cells as well.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452018544, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452018544, "recommendationid": "20329817", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501567", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506681452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 159, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 661, "steamid": "76561198071997106", "num_games_owned": 284}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Just a piece of crap... don't buy it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505126547, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505126547, "recommendationid": "34880316", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
