Game play, and User interface is really really good. \n\nfor the people who complain that game requires alot of reading, this was also a common thing in games from the 90s reading, it is something people did back then.\n\nthe Deal is this you can not really take a game that is over 18 years old and then compare it to todays User interfaces or games, you have to judge it from that time period, and have actully have played the games back then, including this one.  \n\nSo is it good, well yes it is good for that time period, is it fun, if you like older game style and older games then yes it is good, if you only like modern games and snappy gfxs or hate having to read then it wont be good for you.\n\nthere is a sequel https://sixages.com/   it is called Six ages both games based off of the world of glorantha http://www.glorantha.com/glorantha/", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506092272, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506092910, "recommendationid": "35129804", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522597", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 86, "total_reviews": 115, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 29}}
