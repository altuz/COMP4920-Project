It has the same aesthetic that makes you think of Papers, Please, and a very gripping concept for those of you who like a relatively laid back game that you can play at your own pace and watch unfold.\n\nHowever, this is not a good \"game\", in my opinion. And it's definitely not worth your money unless you have some to spare and don't mind giving it to something that you might not enjoy.\nFrom an outside appearance, it seems to be a nice little interactive story that unfolds as you make your decisions, or at least is infuanced by them. However, upon playing it, the game felt much more like a story I was simply walking through, not forming. The most variety you'll get is having a worker fired or maybe a letter sent to you for talking about someone a little too harsh.\nEven the ending is unfulfilling; It's simply the credits explaining what happened after you finished, with the results feeling less connected to your actions than those you get from one minute \"personality test\" quizes. At least personality tests don't take an hour of your time and seven pounds to complete.\n\nA good concept and design has been wasted by poor presentation. In conclusion: Don't waste your money nor time on this when you can get the same satisfaction, if not more, from a BuzzFeed quiz.
