So I was going to change it however after doing some more research I found out that the software I was confused on was made by the same company! Surprise, surprise the software that keeps asking me to register is \"Music Creator 6 touch\" a program that keeps asking me to register despite already registering. It's not a big surprise that software got taken down from the store. If you want to check the reviews for that software I recommend check out \"Music Creator 7 touch\".  Ironically enough, even the software that I was confused with wouldn't work. It just doesn't work, I thought it was a steam issue but nope it's the program itself. After an hour scratching my head on why a 10 minute downloaded software won't work I just gave up. And no I don't want to register to access your fourms to ask why the software isn't working while the company spams my email to oblivion. Sadly the Cakewalk manager works perfectly fine. If you want a music software this software isn't recomended (although I'll admit Sonar looks promising).

Don't pay any attention to my hours on this one. I've used it mostly as a VST with other music software besides SONAR and Music Touch Creator (both of which I own). As such I've probably accumulated well over a two hundred hours with it. In order to accumulate hours with Sound Center you must run the Steam Cakewalk Plugin Manager as I did just to get enough time to be allowed to write this review. Now on with the review...\n\nIf you're looking for a multi-instrument MIDI module VST that includes mostly real world instuments and synths then look no further. With DLC addons you can expand the sound library to include vintage synths, sound effects, world instruments and many other sounds.\n\nI'd recommend Cakewalk Sound Center if you're looking for good piano, guitar and chamber instruments. The twelve string guitar sounds identical to it's real world counterpart. With a good MIDI controller the pianos sound thick, and lush with presence of the real thing. There's voice sequences (much like from the Korg Triton and many other modern synths) and other digital instruments as well.\n\nEach sound comes with its own simplified parameters which can be set (even during a performance) via knobs on the synth interface. Most of these parameters deal with Tone, Frequency Filters (Resonance and Cutoff as well), Parametric EQ, Effects parameters and other aspects pertaining to the currently selected instrument.\n\nAs far as in a recording situation, I'd recommend a speedy computer (AMD 3-4 Ghz or i3-i9 with at least 8 GB of ram) to run this module comfortably in a recording setup. You'll definitely experience latency on some of the complex timbres such as the Steinway Grand unless you have the horsepower. Perhaps in the future Cakewalk and other manufacturers might consider using the GPU for virtual synths which would take much strain off the CPU (which is currently how pretty much all synth modules are run).\n\nSetting it up for use in other programs (including those not bought with Steam) is fairly trivial and involves adding the Cakewalk VST folder from the Steam installation of SONAR and/or Music Creator to the VST search path of the software you intend to use it with.\n\nI'd highly recommend this instrument and seeing as you cannot buy it stand alone (not that I've seen so far) add it as a bonus plus for being included with both Music Touch Creator and SONAR. I've used it with Ableton Live, Magix Music Maker and a few other MIDI programs as well.\n\nIt is also great for live real-time performance if you're using it with a MIDI controller. You certainly could gig as a keyboard player with this software as your main sound module, say running it from a laptop at your gigs.\n\n10/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498839006, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498839006, "recommendationid": "33044907", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495388233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8, "steamid": "76561197983609040", "num_games_owned": 68}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Used and even made 3 great peices of music.
