This program has proven to be difficult to run while running my DAW (Pro-Tools 12).  One refuses to work when the other is running.  This forces me to use other programs that are more friendly.  I don't have time to shut down just to use this program... Be prepared to struggle with it... with pro-tools at least... I can't really comment on how useful it is since i can't get it to work when i am in production.\n\nMy initial impression....I run pro tools 11 with an M Box Pro, various cakewalk utility programs, Novation 49 controller.  I always love new sounds to play with... for the price this has  a WEALTH of \"toys\".  You wont be disappointed IMHO.  Only issue i had was an initial demo message no going away.  The interface has been seamless so far using my MBox as the ASIO controller.  Novation 49 has no issues.   That was easily fixed with a restart of the program.  I will update as i use the tool more.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431476286, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451956034, "recommendationid": "15806415", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539241", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505333044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561197966562725", "num_games_owned": 255}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Some initial teething issues with getting this to work in Sonar was unexpected, having got it up and running with a bit of experimentation I am finding some very nice sounds with this.
