Take a popular film franchise, give the characters different abilities, create a bunch of levels that can be completed by smashing everything into LEGO blocks and rebuilding them, add in a bunch of extra things that can only be completed on subsequent play throughs with different characters, add even more extra stuff between levels then mix everything with a healthy dose of silly humour.\n\nIf you have played other recent LEGO games you will know what to expect here but it is a winning formula, this game is excellent fun to play.\n\nJurassic Park is one of those films which never fails to live up to expectations. Every time I watch it I expect it to show its age and look dated but the dinosaurs are as convincing as ever. This LEGO re-imagining is fantastic. You also get to play through all the disappointing sequels, which whilst the films failed to live up to expectations, they are very entertaining in LEGO form and bulk out this game to a very satisfying length.\n\nSo all in all this game is well worth a play if you are a fan of either the LEGO games or the Jurassic Park films.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506258947, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506258947, "recommendationid": "35180556", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532064", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506367727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 645, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 645, "steamid": "76561197962551321", "num_games_owned": 1210}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun game in couch-coop with your better half, or kids.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506541280, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506541280, "recommendationid": "35248206", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518179", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507062774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 713, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 713, "steamid": "76561198264699316", "num_games_owned": 15}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Probably the most fun ANY game has ever given to me.One of the other things that just make it tons of fun is playing with a friend or sibling which just boost's the fun and playability.This game is so amazing in fact that it does not dezerve a 10 it dezerves a 20.I did not excpect much from this game when I thought about buying it, but once I started playing it blew me away with how unpredictably fun it was.This game is WORTH the money and you should also buy the dlcs so your gaming is at its full potential.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506904433, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506904433, "recommendationid": "35400352", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505559471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1602, "steamid": "76561198105249356", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nice game for all ages :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505545988, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505545988, "recommendationid": "34989775", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493015", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504138655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 166, "steamid": "76561198294695208", "num_games_owned": 77}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The hub world is overall just kind of confusing and hard to actually get around, without really any clear directions on where you should be going between missions. \ncontrols are bunk, even if you remap them + the cameras just not smooth enough for my baby boy eyes. \nId really only recomend buying any of the lego games if you have a controller\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506767696, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506767696, "recommendationid": "35331882", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498132", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506953225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 393, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 393, "steamid": "76561198050382238", "num_games_owned": 210}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "how can i write a review on a game that will not even launch....\n\nbiggest pile of steaming turd ever refund requested", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506724522, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506724522, "recommendationid": "35314768", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470552", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 630, "total_reviews": 799, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 169}}
