I have been playing games for a long time ( 30+ years).  Most recently I have adopted alot of early access games.  Farlight being the most recent.\n\nAlthough the overall rating on this is mixed you will note that most of the recent review are positive.  Most of the negative reviews are about content, bugs and crashing.  \"It's early access!!!\"\n\nNow on to my experience, if you are familiar with Factorio and like the concept you will most likely enjoy this game as well.  I will give a \"+\" for the graphics over Factorio's 2D sprites.  The environmental models need some work but over all satisfactor for the current state of the game.  Mechanics take some getting used to, and the help screens could be written better.  There is a nice guide available that is a must read to get you started.\n\nI bought the game on sale (recommended), at full price I am not sure I would would say you get your moneys worth.  If you adopt the attitude that you are going to encounter bugs, and crashes - it's pretty good.  Has a decent concept with tons of potential.  The game gets updates regularly and the developer seems keen on getting feedback and improving the title.\n\nI give this a thumbs up, and look forward to seeing more.  Remember it's early access so you will, and I did run into bugs and crashes.  I offer my support to this title because I think it has some promise and will keep an eye on it as it develops.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502885989, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502885989, "recommendationid": "34275156", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490427", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502807894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 328, "steamid": "76561197972039165", "num_games_owned": 982}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A nice little game, lots to do and learn.
