And for better or for worse, there's no denying that they've succeeded deftly in their aim to \"recapture\" the spirit of those ye-olde Fighting Fantasy books...thereby inheriting both the good AND bad aspects thereof.  Read on, brave adventurer...\n \n   Thus far I've only played one other Tin Man game, and that is the classic FF book entitled \"The Forest of Doom\".  The book in question, perhaps even more so than many of its kin, is infamous for the \"oops, just happened to go left when I apparently should have gone right, now I don't have the object I need to complete my quest, THE END\" syndrome.   Add to this the expected \"RNG\" die-rolling antics - and combat almost entirely devoid of any tactics, and thereby suspense - and you do end up with a very random game in which your decision-making frequently seems arbitrary at best.   These gamebooks are essentially designed in such a way that you're almost guaranteed to fail the first playthrough you attempt, and only through trial-and-error will one ultimately emerge triumphant (my own progress thus far, while not negligible, seems to have reached the point where I may as well start over again, as I seem perilously ill-equipped to deal with a certain half-shark, half-human hybrid I keep encountering)!  \n \n   Fortunately this particular game has been generous enough to give you a number of \"bookmarks\" to slightly circumnavigate this problem, but if there's one thing which ain't changed about this genre of gaming - be it in paper-bound or digital form - it's that it requires quite a bit of perseverance to complete.  It's up to you whether or not you believe you are that kind of person.  Me?  Kinda, sorta...up to a point.  And while this particular \"gamebook\" doesn't seem QUITE as reliant on the sheer dumb luck of its ancestors, it's still much the same thing.  Patience will DEFINITELY be a virtue, should you choose to accept this quest.\n \n    Oh, and unless I've somehow missed it - which is entirely possible - this game doesn't have, and could sorely use, a MAP.  Sure, you can draw one of your own, but then again you could also turn your own pages, and roll your own dice, so while we're all trapped here together in the virtual realm...how about a map, please?  Forest of Doom had one, wisely enough.  Not quite sure why this one doesn't.\n\n   Now, one regard in which I definitely prefer this to the likes of Forest of Doom - a book not QUITE as grim and/or spooky as it sounds - is the actual setting and scenario.  I basically bought this one - rather than, say, the four which precede it! - because it looked like one of the more tonally \"dark\" gamebooks on offer, and sure enough it does live up to that promise.  Dank sewers, grubby creatures, freakish cultists, and demon-summoning sorcerers abound.  The \"story\", in other words, is pretty darn nice, if you're as morbidly-inclined as myself...and that's a pretty good thing when you consider that it's a text-based adventure, and thereby ALL ABOUT the story, really!  Music and artwork are also very nice and atmospheric, and the text lovingly relishes the details of your each and every demise (and those of the creatures which you slay)...so no complaints from yours truly about any of that.\n\n   Tin Man Games have certainly done their homework.  Old-school FF-style antics, brought kicking and screaming into the modern age with a new-school interface.  Who would I recommend this to?  Certainly anyone who tolera...sorry, ENJOYED...the gamebooks of yore, and anyone curious enough to give it at least one go and see what those long-gone days were all about.  How relevant is this kind of \"gaming\" in the modern age of ultra-immersion, in no less than the year that we are to be officially blessed with VIRTUAL-REALITY HEADSETS in the mainstream marketplace?  Hmmm...I'm not quite sure.  Myself, I actually LIKE a bit of \"retro\", at least from time to time.  In my world, not everything has to be the latest, OR so-called \"greatest\". \n\n   If you're definitely NOT that kind of person, and think that anything released more than a fortnight ago qualifies as \"old hat\", then give this a wide berth.  But if you empathize with my own sentiments then, well...your fate is only a die roll away (well, okay, MANY die rolls away, but bear with me, trying my best to set some kind of a TONE here, damn it)...\n \nVerdict: 7.5/10.\n\n(PS Whatever you do, don't purchase it outside of a sale.  It's definitely not worth ten bucks, unless you devour these kinds of things for breakfast.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453288327, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456228481, "recommendationid": "20639980", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560082", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484895859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 21, "steamid": "76561198123214280", "num_games_owned": 102}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Its \"Choose your own adventure\" with skill checks and difficult to understand combat.\nI died on my first save.
