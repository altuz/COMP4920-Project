I almost stopped playing because of the ignorance of this remark in an otherwise good game, but I decided to give it a chance. \n\nShort. Cheap (was on sale). Good story. \nOccassionally tedious. Felt a bit clunky. \nPuzzles boring.\n\nSpoiler alert;\n\nMy thoughts on this game, considering I got it for such a cheap price, is that it's a genuinely good point-and-click. I loved the story and was pretty surprised by the ending. Maybe that's down to my poor skills in predicting predictable things, but overall I enjoyed it and found it gripping enough to play it in one day. I'm pretty tired of time-travel story lines as I almost always find loop-holes (why didn't he just do this or that?!) but despite it being purely about time-travel I liked the way it was executed. I like being able to control when I swap backwards and forwards in time, and it's really cool to see how each scene changes depending on what time you're in. \n\nHowever, there are some things I wasn't too keen on. I've played quite a few point-and-clicks and the clicking sometimes felt pretty sluggish and as though I had to click several times before it would recognise the click. I'm REALLY glad you can run with double-click, if not it would have made the game slower than necessary. \nSecondly, some tediousness. The example that springs to mind is having to get Frank a cup of water. Possibly down to my impatience, but I like running backwards and forwards for puzzles, not so much for errands. \n\nFinal note; I like the idea that video games can be inclusive. Throwing in one sentence which was along the lines of \"she probably thinks I'm r-word\" really ruined it. It added nothing and it's just made the creators look, at the very least, pretty ignorant. Please reconsider the usage of it in the future.\n\nedit;\n\ngosh the puzzles do need to be less straightforward or weird.\nWhy did I need a Katana for the rope to be cut? \nSome of the puzzles were creative (soil/apple/tree) but other than that it was all too easy in places, but I didn't mind the easiness of the game as the art style is pleasant enough and the story is enjoyable. \n\n6/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506192892, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506193265, "recommendationid": "35161306", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499583", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1474492061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 239, "steamid": "76561198124809823", "num_games_owned": 645}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Finally, I found a good mobile game.\nNah, I will play it on PC.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505907229, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505907229, "recommendationid": "35082147", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496029", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505446243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 204, "steamid": "76561198067043756", "num_games_owned": 330}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Boring puzzles.
