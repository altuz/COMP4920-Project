Played through a few levels, and then a microtransactions screen popped up.  I suddently couldn't stop thinking about it, it was like 1 euro for 5 totems, 5 euro for 25 totems, etc.  And a giant button that said \"Unlock the full game for 1.69 euro.\"  If you clicked the \"full game unlock\" button, the game would crash, I suspected that it was a programming error which allows the shop to be visible, but it was there and still is.  I look back through my video I made, and the shop icon was there most of the time, and it is still in the game now.  \n\n1.69 euro for the full game.  Then you look on IOS, Android, and the Windows store, and sure enough this is a free to play game, fueled by microtransactions where they charge you for totems to unlock things, and it's $2.29 to buy the full version.  Not a different game at all, same old 29 races, except instead of $2 they are charging $10.  I'm really bothered by the fact that Steam users must pay 500% more for this game, and they still included the same microtransactions into it. \n\nThey would move so many more copies of this game if it weren't for this unusually high pricetag.  And I'm not going to pretend that other developers haven't also increased their iOS ports to Steam with higher prices, but I can't honestly recommend buying something like this.  Look at their greenlight page:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=275961492\n\nSee in that last image, where it says \"29 races, including 7 free races\"?  That orange button is the mictransactions store.  And the 7 free races are obviously not in this version, but what they SHOULD have done is made the game free for anyone to play and had a DLC which, when purchased, was the full game unlock.  Even if you look at the CURRENT store page where you see the exact same image, except it doesn't say \"7 free races\" anymore, you see that orange microtransactions store button.  \n\nEdit: the developer has released a patch for the game, apparently to remove the microtransactions store but I cannot confirm this yet.  Stil though, simply based on the price of the game, I can't recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444495375, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444498986, "recommendationid": "18414046", "language": "english", "votes_down": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628391", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444514598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 72, "steamid": "76561198006313837", "num_games_owned": 255}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 37, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Having played the game now I can say it has a massive mario vibe to it,  It is a mobile port but they added a few options to the settings that deserve a mention. resolution can be changed, I was playing at 1440p not that it really matters with the art style of the game and you can also rebind keys and buttons for keyboard and controller which ever you prefer to play with.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmVq7gwVXZw\nFirst Impression video fo the game showing fsettings, the intro and first 7 races.\n\nThe Game itself does play eactly like mario kart and the different characters/karts do handle differently.  All the power ups etc have a direct correlation to there mario counterparts.  All the classics are there.  Sadly you have no battle mode like in mario but the game does include labyrinth levels (time limit race through a maze) and levels to collect as many coins as possible. \n\nThe game also boosts a very simplistic story that doesnt really need to be there but it is anyway!\n\nPoppy Kart is entertaining but a lot of that is based of the nostalgia I feel from playing the snes,  I could see myself playing it hear or there to unwind when I dont want anything heavy to game with but for the price, I would not reccomend unless your a big kart racing fan.  Otherwise wait for it to go on sale 50% or better 75% then I'd say go for it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444525368, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444525978, "recommendationid": "18420509", "language": "english", "votes_down": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517285", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478288550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 70, "steamid": "76561198094813231", "num_games_owned": 151}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I enjoyed this game. It is a fun Super Mario Kart inspired game. I like the characters and the races are challenging. I am sure that the game has been updated to where there are no microtransactions (I guess there used to be).\n\nMy only wish is that if the devs could they should add more race traks and more playable racers.
