It is none of that. This is a different city sim altogether. You do not lay roads individually or place zones where you want them (although I wish you could for the zones at least), you build a city through the eyes of a politician through an old world council - or, more precisely, a European-based political cabinet. It's a different take and challenge and I welcome it. I am not debating its mechanics since I'm just starting out, but the first impression that it has been wrongly given. You cannot approach this game with the typical city sim mentality, at all. You have to carefully balance your budget, understand how to grow you city while also balancing party influence so that you can continue to build since (depending upon your political emphasis) people can vote you out if there is too much conflict from yours and other political parties. So it is challenging, but in a very good way. \n\nThis is one of those games, it seems like, that there are many paths you could take, but you're not going to be able to hit the gold mine and do everything and have the most 1337 city known to mankind. You have to make choices. So there is realism in this game. \n\nIt really makes me wonder the percentage of complaints below of \"it's too hard because I want to play it like other city sims,\" and what the real rating for this game would actually be... Apparently it got a rough start, and that's an unfortunate hit, too.\n\n***===============================================***\nUpdate: I've played a game all the way through every stage to the point you get a victory. (This took 19hrs and it was my very first game - no redos.) In my case, I managed the victory of making it through every stage. (I wasn't paying too close of attention, since I continued onward with the game (I'm glad it gave me that option), but it appears you go to the year 2020.) \n\nWhat's my impression? I love this game. It is very challenging and for a while there I wasn't sure I was going to make it, but got to Stage V and the economy was easier to manage. (My city was so poor and in the red for a long time that only a few districts had the privilege of running water and even fewer had electricity.) I definitely learned a few things about establishing an economy and am excited to try a whole new game to see what I can make happen. \n\nI really like the storytelling aspect to it as you get to create a kind of history with your game that is rather faint (but left to your imagination) when I would play Civ games or the Total War games or any city sim game - this seemed more personal. I do wish when there were world conflicts (and possibly smaller ones that might affect you) that you felt it and had to make choices like you do any other time. (For example, since you do get the arms industry, I thought perhaps you might try to promote that industry during a war or have a political aspect that may involve a vote on helping another country out or something.) That would really make you feel like you're part of a bigger world instead of feeling closed in to the city that you're building. The game hints at some sort of economic hit, but that's all I could tell. \n\nBut it was exciting and frustrating in every regard that made this game interesting. It is a pitty that it had a rough start and it is a greater pity that a lot of people are not seeing this game at a different, and deserved, angle since there is potential to make this super interesting if the developers went deeper into this game.

a link to a compleated time victory video /review at the bottom for anyone who cares to view it .. i did a lot of reading of reviews on here prior to purchasing this game and nearly did not purchase it because of them however i loved the idea and concept of this game and decided to buy it anyways ,,im extreemly glad i did this game in no way in my opinion deserves such a negative review i beleive people are buying this game thinking its a city builder and its not and never have the developers made out it is they have declared from the start its a city managment game , and i find the game to function well in the catagory its designed so i guess my main point here is read the negative reviews by all means i read them as well.. but if this game is something you think you will enjoy watch some reviews and game play and make your own mind up cause i no i nearly didnt get this because of some terrible reviews that i now dont beleive to be justifiable and im glad i purchased this ide be annoyed if i hadnt just on reviews here on steam if you are still skeptical buy it on sale you wont regret it especially on sale ..... https://youtu.be/vPMmCJcVDyU", "received_for_free": false,
