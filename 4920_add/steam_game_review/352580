You are playing as Thomas Farrell, an anthropologist who is part of a scientific expedition aiming to uncover the remains of an archaic civilization. \n\nThe game consists of 2 chapters. In the first, after waking up from a nightmare, you start exploring the boarding house where a colleague of your uncle spend his last years, and try to find clues about his research while having nightmarish visions. In the second chapter, you travel to the research site in order to rejoin the expedition team but on your arrival in the woods, there is nobody there; you investigate to figure out what is going on while encountering a nightmarish creature. The game concludes with you heading to the main base camp, where the second game will continue the story.\n\nThe game makes you explore every corners of the house and woods. I found nice the possibility to freely interact with your environment (looking at pictures, objects\u2026) instead of just walking around into a very static surrounding.\nPuzzles fit well with the story. By interacting with objects or from clues in books/notes you found, you will be able to: fix a music box, find combinations to open chests, figure out ways to enter or exit barred rooms, perform a ritual of protection from evil, find the right path to exit some nightmares and of course, find keys to open some locked doors or drawers.\nYou will need very good observation skills to play this game and get all the achievements, but you might also want to adjust the gamma correction parameter high enough, otherwise you are going to completely miss seeing some objects like I did, or you can just go pixel hunting in the black and dark areas. \n\nIt is true that it was a bit disappointing to only play half of the story, and I am looking forward to the second part as I really would like to know how the story ends.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501614266, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502787903, "recommendationid": "33955431", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497894", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 9}}
