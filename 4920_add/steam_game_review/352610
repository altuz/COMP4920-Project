Standard, one-per-ending achievements that are usual for a visual novel.  \n\nPros/Cons:\n+ It took me ~17 hours to 100% this game.  For $5.99, that is a great deal.  \n+ I really liked the artstyle-- both the characters and the backgrounds.\n+ Each of the endings felt distinct.  None of them were low-effort as I'd expect when there's so many.  \n+ The writing was free of grammatical errors.\n+ I enjoyed how each ending gave more insight into each of the different characters.\n\n- The writing often got very wordy.  There were many parts that I found myself speedreading through if only to get to the next piece of the plot.  \n- It's a bit of a depressing game-- many routes leave you feeling guilty from choices that seemed harmless.  \n- I didn't quite feel fondness for any of the characters.\n\nOverall: \nThe Way We All Go was a pretty good visual novel.  It was certainly lengthy for the price.  I was really impressed that it had so many unique endings.  With many endings, though, comes the fact that each seemingly small choice can carry unproportionate effects.  Perhaps this is an inevitable trait of visual novels, but it felt particularly noticeable here.  Other than that, I think I'd recommend The Way We All Go.  Though sometimes wordy, the horror elements certainly kept things interesting.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500777415, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500777415, "recommendationid": "33734594", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510259", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501366621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1335, "steamid": "76561197996101648", "num_games_owned": 545}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It is a short visual novel heavily inspired by the Higurashi series in both aesthetic and writing. \nIf you're a fan of Higurashi, you'll feel right at home. Even if you're not, it's a very enjoyable story with likable characters.\n\nYou should know that it's not a horror game, and the main feeling of this novel is actually... sadness.\nThere are two main characters to interact with and the whole game lasts for ~2 days, so the pacing is pretty tight.\n\nThe art is mediocre as this is a very budget work, especially the CGs, but the main characters' sprites do a fine work of conveying their emotions and after all I ended up really liking them. The backgrounds are slightly edited photographs - once again, it's almost an exact look of the Higurashi series, so this might be artist's choice.\n\nThe main characters are believable and deep enough, even more so in story segments when you can see the world from their eyes. The writing is subtle and very natural, Ebi-hime does a great work of not looking amateurish unlike most EVN writers out there. I particularly like how the writer operates the RenPy engine, uses NVL mode and paces the sentences so they always feel natural and comfortable to read. There's plenty of humour too, even though that's where I feel it borrows from Higurashi a little too much.\n\nI admit the story didn't leave me too impressed like some other VNs out there, but I still felt that the game did a great work to convey its themes without going into tropes and cliches, and along with the quality prose it was overall a very enjoyable experience.\n\nThere are also an impressive amount of endings that make a short few hours novel into a pretty large work if you include all the possible branches. There aren't too many choices, but apparently most of them can branch the narrative and lead to different endings, which is somewhat uncommon for most VNs. I believe you won't feel like you completed the game and got to know the characters until you reach at least several endings. \nThere is probably the best happy ending hidden somewhere, but I'm still miles away from reaching it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500929704, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500929810, "recommendationid": "33773720", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504405", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 75, "total_reviews": 80, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
