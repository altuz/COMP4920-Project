Action is all about adorable porcupines getting dramatically bald and now they fight for survival with one needle left each... you shoot it in the direction you move and the 2d pseudo-phisics here is totally allright! The point is you have to collect your shot back when it bounces off walls and falls somewhere, can't catch it mid-flight.. the most fun comes from occasionate suicides, when you kill 2 enemies with one shot, deflecting off two surfaces but weirdly the trajectory ends right in your own ars while you've been trying to evade the mole which has just popped out of the ground!
