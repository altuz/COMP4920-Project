Roguelight is a fun and clever little Roguelike with a light and dark mechanic, hets is a really fun and fast-paced action game, Test Chamber is a cute and interesting puzzle game, and Detective Chirpums is a cute little noir-style adventure game. The only game I disliked was Laza Knitez, which I felt was sorta slow and poorly made. Overall, though, a really great package that is absolutely worth the price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429912690, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429912690, "recommendationid": "15525313", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530911", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448928603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 441, "steamid": "76561198025704994", "num_games_owned": 2360}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I've played all games, and completed one of them (Detective Chirpums). Here is what I think:\n\nTest Chamber: After playing some levels, I can say this is, to me, the best game in this package. Very interesting puzzles that require seeing things from different angles, nice Fez-looking characters and clean, cool graphics.\n\nRoguelight: Really nice rogue-like game, which has a very interesting play with light, nice gameboy-like graphics and many upgrades. I've reached level 3, and I plan to try it a bit more to see if I can finish it. You can get this game for free or pay what you want here: http://managore.itch.io/roguelight\n\nDetective Chirpums: The game is mostly filled up with dialogs, with only 3 puzzles and some dialog choices that don't seem to matter much (you just get a different dialog response). It's not a great game, but it's OK.\n\nHets: cool graphics, randomized levels, you get upgrades when you finish a level. Not too bad, but after playing it 44 times, I got bored and decided to never play it again.\n\nLaz Knitez: joust game with shooting mechanics and some weird power-ups. Played it for a couple of minutes (by myself) and quit. Could be nice with friends, but it is boring alone.\n\n\nSo, to sum it up, I think Roguelight and Test Chamber make ths mixtape worth it, specially if you get it at the current discount (80%). If you read this later, make sure you wait for a discount.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443973448, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443998414, "recommendationid": "18327961", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530897", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487320058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 121, "steamid": "76561198217154015", "num_games_owned": 104}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Only really got enjoyment out of one of the games, but it's a cool concept!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460004252, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460004252, "recommendationid": "22279890", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500246", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444920880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 268, "playtime_forever": 99, "steamid": "76561198188515021", "num_games_owned": 1196}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Did you know that writing & drawing are magical acts?\nAre you hip to the SECRETSPACEPROGRAM?\nGot mushrooms?\nDo you eat sushi?\nDo you wish Andy Warhol had developed video games?\nAre you tired of Corporate oppression?\nWant to stick it to the man?
