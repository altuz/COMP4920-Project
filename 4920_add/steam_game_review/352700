I remember when the Shark was a beta and admin only ship. Used to be 1000's of players back in the day. The game is very simple but fun. I have 1000's of hours in this game and I am pretty sure thats the most I have on a single game. Why, you ask...Because its that damn good. Do yourself a favor and play its. What is there to lose? Its free to play, simple controls, and a very easy learning curve.  I am so glad this game came to steam and I hope the numbers pick back up to revive it to its core.\n\nYou should start of in Trench Wars zone until you learn a bit of the ships then go to other zones to learn different stuff as well.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487741327, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487741327, "recommendationid": "30093277", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
