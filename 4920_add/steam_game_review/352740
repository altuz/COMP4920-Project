Between unwanted marriage proposals and commoners aiming to dethrone you through popular opinion, it's a tough life.  What's a princess to do when even her royal parents find her rival more praiseworthy than herself?  Card battling, that's what!  The premise is preposterous, but that's why I love it so much.  Princess Battles knows exactly what it is and plays to its silliness with perfection.   In this world, a lady's parlor game is no laughing matter. Tournaments, black market card trading, demonic overlords, card battle schools, all ridiculous ideas that click together and work mostly because the story never takes itself too seriously.   \n\nI love Lillian.  She's a spoiled, lazy and entitled brat, but that is precisely what makes her so endearing.  We're given a caricature who acts more realistic than most other \"perfect\" protagonists.  Even though she's far from the ideal princess, through the challenges she faces in her rise to [i]Prima[/i] champion, she grows and matures, but never entirely loses that impudent attitude.  Oddly enough, her love interests make more sense for it.  Perfection is boring, guys want a girl with character and spunk, and Lillian has it in spades.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=428692777\nSpeaking of love interests, the boys are appealing, too, in their own ways, though we're not given nearly as much time with them as I would have liked.  Perhaps another scene or two of dialogue and a little more development of their characters would have fleshed out their stories a bit more.  But I admit, outside of satisfying my own desire for experiencing the \"feels\" of romance, it probably wouldn't have benefited the game much as it works so well simply because it's not as deep or complicated as it could be.  That goes for the game play as well.\n\nThe game consists of visiting various areas and selecting dialogue choices between characters to further the plot with card battles sprinkled in.  The battle system itself is simple enough to enjoy casually, but allows for a bit of strategy to keep the player engaged.  A race to max stats against your opponent, you play princess themed cards to either increase your stats or decrease your opponent's, all while juggling your gold and energy.  As with other card games, success often comes down to the luck of the draw which at times can be frustrating, but the battles are usually short enough to not feel like a total waste of time if you lose.  My sole complaint with the system is a bug that does not allow your opponent's attack cards to affect your stats.  While this makes the game easier (although success is by no means guaranteed), it removes some of the strategy from play and makes Free Play mode less attractive.  I certainly hope the bug is fixed as I'd love to build and play around with my own free play deck, but it's only worth it if the card battles are working the way they should.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=428692853\nWhich brings me to game length.  Free Play mode would add several hours of game play if only the battle bug were fixed.  The main game itself is rather short taking only about 3 hours to complete.  There is plenty of replayability, however, with over two dozen achievements leading through most of the branching dialogue paths and in-game events.  It took me a good 12 hours to make 27/28 with that last one eluding me, but I'll get it yet! \n\nDespite a few shortcomings, I enjoyed Princess Battles immensely.  It's not often I am this impressed by a title that looked much less adventurous and entertaining than it proved to be.  The price may be daunting for some due to the short play time, but I feel I've gotten my money's worth given how much I enjoyed what's here.  If you're looking for silly fun with a dash of romance tossed in, pick up Princess Battles.  On sale, off sale - it's worth it either way.  I know I'll be supporting Nekomura Games in the future, especially if they continue to bring the same creativeness and humor to their other titles.\n\nBottom Line - Worth it for the humor alone, Princess Battles deserves a spot in any visual novel lover's library.

Unfortunately this game managed to disappoint me. On the surface Princess Battles is an okay game. The biggest problem with it, is how short it is. The characters you meet seem interesting, but you don't get to know them properly. By the time the game gets going it's already over. The battles are pretty easy and there's only one difficulty level. On the plus side it has replay value, since it has several men who you can pursue. I struggled with whether to recommend it or not. I'd give it a neutral score if I could. All in all, you end up wanting more of it than it provides, which means that there is potential, but it is unfortunately wasted.

This game is cute and fun but very short. I got through the whole thing in about an hour and replayed several times for various romantic endings. The artwork is creative and the card game contains cards that remind me of the Princess Maker series. The card game is simple but very much dependant on luck. I just wish there was more to the game, even with going back and unlocking different endings, the card tournament just felt really short. Needs more story.\n\nIt's a lot of $$ to pay for a game that feels really short and lacking in story and card game play. There's some replay value (if you want to unlock all the endings). Many cute outfits so she can be dressed up as a gothic lolita or a maid, with many more outfits to choose from. But actual gameplay is so short I can't help but feel like I've wasted my money.

There are a number of interesting endings, which add to playing time and value.\n\nArtwork is very nice, main story and story arcs are well done, card battles are slightly repetitive but the difficulty progression is good (especially the first time through).

Not a spoiler, but good to know:  always visit every available location at every opportunity (first time through I made the assumption it was like Long Live the Queen and similar - could only make once choice at any given time of day).\n\nOverall, for me this was an 8/10 as a more casual, less intense VN/sim.
