The theme pays homage to Japanese monster films of Godzilla fame (there's even a Chibizilla end-stage boss), whilst the gameplay is an innovative take on the tower defence genre by mashing it up with some RTS action.  \n\nBe warned though, If you let the cutesy character design and bright lollypop colours lull you into a false sense of security, then you're going to get your cream buns handed to you on a plate.\n\nWhilst its family friendly graphics may make it look like something that's aimed at children or at the \"casual\" market, it's most certainly geared towards people who have cut their gaming teeth on various tower defence games.  After two cursory simple levels to get you accustomed to the controls, it throws you in at the deep end once the kaiju appear. It's a little like paddling about in the shallows one minute and then finding yourself in dangerous Kaiju-infested waters the next.  I was definitely caught off-guard when I expected the entirety of stage 1 to be a breeze, instead, I found myself barely passing level 1.2 by the skin of my teeth!  (WTF? Level 1.2? I guess it turns out that I'm crappy at tower defence games after all?)\n\nThat's a pretty steep difficulty curve, I can only presume that they've decided it to ratchet it up right from the beginning as a way to offset that cutesy image.  It ensures that your first impression is that at its core, this is a serious game, it just happens to be wrapped in a sweet candy shell.  Ultimately, I'm glad that it does so, often times, I feel that the hand-holding portion of some games last a little too long, and if you're familiar with a genre this can make for a boring experience.\n\nMy playing style generally means I keep replaying levels I've already completed (I like seeing a neat row of gold before moving on to the next level rather than blasting straight through the game) so I found upgrading my weapons and stuff relatively simple.  As such, it didn't feel like a particularly grind-y game to me, i.e. I didn't have to repeatedly replay levels that I'd already gone gold on just to get the research points.   \n\nThe first playthrough of any level can be a little bewildering so some players may become frustrated when they find it super difficult, but I relished the real challenge of developing the best strategy to approach each level.   \n\n[h1]Level design[/h1]\nThere is a unique scenario for each level, so you never feel like you're playing a \"filler\" level which keeps things interesting, and keeps the urgency and \"panic\" cranked up to 11.  (Did I mention how cute your little minions look when they panic and run around after they've been hit?  Annoying mid-game, but they do look ever so sweet.) \n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nThe music is ok, I guess it's kind of generic sci-fi game music, each continent had its own theme, but I could barely tell the difference, to be honest.  \n\nIt's moderately paced, with a driving rhythm such that even when you're in the quiet lull at the beginning of each level, there's a sense of urgency.  Whilst repetitive, it's saving grace is the fact that it's not obnoxious and annoying.   \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nI'm an avid point'n'click adventure game fan, so I love a good story.  But let's be honest, these kinds of games are all about the action and the story such as it is only exists to provide a scenario with thematic level/character design and a bit of glue to tie everything together.  In this instance it's: Monsters Attack!! Save the earth!  Kill them, kill them with fire!\n\nI guess I should reserve judgement on the story, though as I'm not even halfway through the game yet.  There could be a massive twist awaiting me for all I know.\n\nThe story is told, quite charmingly, with comic strip panels and a little bit of instructional dialogue.  Kaiju Panic keeps things light with splashes of humour and pop culture references which make for a fun game with quite a few genuine laugh out loud moments.  \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nSo, ultimately, would I recommend it?  It depends... are you a fan tower defence games?  Are you calm and collected with a steely determination in the face of adversity?  In which case, yes, the game is a fun and refreshing take on the genre, and if you're a bit of a completionist, then there's many many hours of gameplay that you'll be able to squeeze out of it.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n+ Looks cute, easy on the eyes\n+ Fun, refreshing take on a tired genre\n+ Richly designed levels and monsters\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- Music may not be annoying, but unfortunately it's kind of unmemorable\n- Difficulty curve is possibly a little too steep at the outset", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444701773, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444702475, "recommendationid": "18450226", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509810", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446073150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 268, "steamid": "76561197995227323", "num_games_owned": 365}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Here you play as a commander and must muster civillians to construct  and  man defenses\nagainst kaiju, of which there are various types, with vulnerabilities against certain defences and resistances against others.\n\nInvesting Science  earned  from defeated enemies and clearing maps  you can upgrade your commander for faster construction time, movement speed etc and upgrade your defences unlocking additional properties such as pushback increased range etc\n\nKilling kaiju by balancing what you build where you place it and what civillians you have manning what, for example if you leave civillians in defences across the map to improve them, they cant help you build  defenses for an incoming wave or repair structures that may have been damaged, or you may have difficulty evacuating them if required\n\nEarly game severes as an extended tutorial introducing how different types of kaiju and weapons interact but more types are intrroduces as you progress through levels and to 100% all missions will require going back once you have more upgrades adding a level of replayability due to bonus objectives, and also allowing you to test new weapon unlocks etc\n\nVery fun,  a well excecuted example of the genre .", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446143199, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446143199, "recommendationid": "18746380", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506219", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445769404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 554, "steamid": "76561198055720670", "num_games_owned": 229}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a very challenging little game!  The game really challenges you to get your level set up right to combat the waves of incoming monsters using the finite resources to hand.

Using the right tower types in the right zones is key to winning, unlocking all of the upgrades is not required.\n\nThe actual gameplay is a lot like revenge of the titans, where you have harvestors and turrets and have to defend with the limited resources that your harvestors provide, except you actually have to collect said resources and build the towers within your characters range. You are also encouraged to be close to the enemies to pickup science upgrade points for your permanent upgrades to towers / character.
