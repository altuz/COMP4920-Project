That is one of the main themes that I am left with after completing all 6 endings for \"An Octave Higher\". I spent the hours reading and wondering if I would have enjoyed this game more as a young teenager. It would have been a good story to read right after learning about various political theories. If you like young adult dystopian fiction, steampunk/aetherpunk aesthetic and classical music you might really enjoy the world of Overture and the many colorful and intriguing characters in this story. I pushed past my initial feelings about the game and let the story development entertain me. Seeing multiple endings is key for understanding the message and heart of the story, but many of the endings are rather dissapointing until you get closer to the true ending. That's the game element of this story and it does give the player an influence in how the story progresses. I would not revisit this game unless there will be more, but for half the price of many VN's I'd say it's well worth it. It's about 8-9 hours worth of reading to get all achievements if you fast forward through the dialog you have already seen before.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504810455, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504810455, "recommendationid": "34800405", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 112, "total_reviews": 126, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 14}}
