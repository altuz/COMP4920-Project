A combination of [b]Audiosurf[/b]'s nimble flying and [b]n[/b]'s greed for shiny blocks? With great visuals and nice soundtrack? Count me in!\n\nThere's an important thing to note, though. Futuridium's unique turn-around mechanic is interesting, but it comes with a twist: you're not nimble at all.\n\n[h1]How do I steer fast, captain?[/h1]\n\nThe ship you're guiding is [b]slow[/b]. Don't get me wrong - you can boost forward and reach impressive speeds, but it doesn't change your maneuverability. [b]The game forces you to use the 180\u00b0 turn all the time[/b], so you must flip a switch in your brain and start planning your flight in zigzag patterns.\n\nGetting used to this game mechanic is a long and difficult process. You will feel powerless trying to shoot down targets (cyan blocks) that are seemingly right next to you, only to find out the ship won't make it there, even at its lowest speed. Only then the basic idea of turning back starts to stick, and you slowly learn to fly back and forth to chain the longest possible combo of destroyed blocks.\n\nAnd don't you even dare brush too close to them. You will crash and respawn at the very beginning, which - for levels with very long \"intro\" sections - means repetitve, boring flight that drains your very limited [b]energy[/b]. Trying to enter a group of 5 blocks to shoot down at least two of them is almost guaranteed crash, but may let you hold on to that sweet combo for more points.\n\n[h1]Wait. Energy?[/h1]\n\nYou better not wait, because your lifespan within a single level is limited to 120 seconds. During these two minutes you need to fly around, evade obstacles and annihilate all shiny blocks, which reveals the final block - the enemy ship's core - that resets your energy meter and wipes off the enemy dreadnought when it's shot down.\n\nI'm not sure why it's called [i]energy[/i] meter, when it's literally showing remaining [i]time[/i]. Even shooting and boosting doesn't impact its level, which seems a bit counterintuitive for the name. On the other hand, this means you can keep spraying your laser guns and use boost to your heart's content, which is nice.\n\nApart from time, the only other energy consumer is zero-distance contact with other space bodies. Crashing into things costs half of your remaining energy, so it's better to make three safe passes back and forth than risking halving your life in a single flight. Well, at least in the beginning, until you get a grip on the controls.\n\nShooting down one of the ubiquitous blocks increases your lifespan by one second, which is a gamechanger on lengthy boss levels.\n\n[h1]They're shooting back![/h1]\n\nThe levels (enormous enemy ships) come in multiple forms. There are flat board(s) with blocks on either side, cube-like structures with rotating elements, and bonus sectors with your almost nonexistent energy refilling at numbered rings. You can even encounter wrecks of spaceships, where all cyan blocks are scattered around the wreckage.\n\nIf crashing and limited energy weren't enough, there are also turrets that spew lasers and shoot homing rockets at you. While the lasers almost always miss (Stormtroopers?), the rockets can easily catch up to the ship if you forget to boost and turn around often. There are also balls that inflate into large, impenetrable spheres of doom - a major headache, so they should be destroyed on sight.\n\nSome levels have moving parts, which need to be considered in your path calculations; otherwise, doing a 180\u00b0 turn may end with an unpleasant surprise.\n\n[h1]Where did the keyboard go?[/h1]\n\nIt would be awesome if you had a controller lying around, because the whole game will only communicate pad controls to you. Y for leaderboards, A to shoot, X to turn around. The built-in help shows a pad, and there's no way to change - hell, even [i]view[/i] - the keyboard bindings.\n\nYou have to find them yourself instead! Good luck. I found that N and M change music, arrows are for movement, A shoots (or was it S?), and C changes camera. I wish I knew how to access leaderboards from the keyboard.\n\nThere's no built-in way to change bindings, but there must be some .ini file that will let you do it the old way, right? Haha. No. Use AutoHotkey instead.\n\nThe store page doesn't mention that the game basically requires a controller. The developers said they're looking into implementing some sort of keyboard support, so there's still hope.\n\nFortunately, Steam Controller allows customization around existing pad controls, not only keyboard keys. If you have SC, this drawback won't affect you the slightest.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIf you're used to quick-reaction games like Super Hexagon or Velocibox, you will have a hard time adapting to Futuridium's rules. Perfecting a level means careful path planning, not just pressing a button when a wall appears. You will often feel frustrated when trying to aim at blocks that appear [i]so[/i] close, but are way too far to get to them.\n\nHowever, when it finally clicks, shooting stuff and zigzagging around enemies suddenly gets fun, and scoring your first perfect chain in a long level feels great.\n\nThe game offers multiple colorful skins and background music, both of which you can change at will. I would prefer it if the skin didn't randomize on each retry, but that's a minor gripe - at least the blocks are always distinguishable.\n\nFuturidium's learning curve is rather steep right from the beginning, so grab your controller tight and give your roommates a warning before running the game.\n\nYou'll be swearing a lot.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452367462, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452717761, "recommendationid": "20429205", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630384", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1473442491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 474, "steamid": "76561198013424387", "num_games_owned": 630}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very very nice!
