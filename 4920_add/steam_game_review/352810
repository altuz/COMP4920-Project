I liked the graphics, the fact that it was only 3 hours long(i like when games go straight to the point without hundreads of useless sidequests), the Japanese voices and the general idea but I found the game to be a little bit tedious sometimes. The narration was cool but the english subtitles were poor and were sliding TOO FAST. I had to go to the menu and read everything again everytime to understand the story. The gameplay was a sort of point and click with some arrow keys involved during fights. Those arrow keys were not responsive. Tried with both controller and keyboard and I found difficult to complete the final chapters.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504543010, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504543010, "recommendationid": "34738756", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
