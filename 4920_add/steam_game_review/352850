Apparently, they don't have more urgent matter (like fixing or improving things) than posing as players to misguide people.\nI could have give this game another chance later but not after this !\nDGU, it is done for me.

If nothing else, the title itself piques your interest. And true to it's name - the concept of the game is pretty awesome. You are a student in a University, training to be a Death God. And your assignements consist of assasination missions - or maybe asassination makes it sound too sophiticated. You just have to kill people - no hidden blades or exploding gunpowder is used though. And therein lies it's true potential - the innovative killing methods. \n\nNow if I just knew this much, I would have been interested enough to try it - but there's more. To make the game more fun, the targets are not ordinary people. In fact, most of them are not even \"bad guys\" in the traditional sense. Take Miley Cyrus for example. Not technically speaking bad, but annoying enough for you to have joked about killing her at least once with your friends. At least I did - and if you didn't then perhaps you should. What's funnier is that you find her in a construction area, surrounded by wrecking balls! This game is pure pun galore, and without giving any more spoilers - this is the gist of what the game is about. The teachers, targets and characters in the game are all borrowed from pop culture, fiction or even mythology - and the unlikelihood of these characters actually being in the situations that the game puts you in, is what makes this an enjoyable experience. (Fun Fact - Did you know Harry Potter smokes?... Like a lot?)\n\nNow coming to my only 2 qualms with the game.\n\n1) Poor framerates, random crashes etc. The technical problems was what marred my experience the most when I first played the game. But the devs responded soon enough, and now theres a patch (2 in fact, although I've not tried the latest one still) that fixes most of the problems. I have not got a single crash after the patch, and the overall camera swivels have become much smoother after patch 1.\n\n2) A slightly diverted plotline. While it is fun to go kill people in unimaginable ways, sometimes you hope for a much more advanced sense of coherence to the overall theme - and DGU manages to do some of it, but not all. I'm only a few hours into the game - so I'm probably making rash early judgements - but there could be a bit more done to make it all come together in a unified sort of manner. \n\nNevertheless, DGU makes up for it's techincal flaws with a fun concept and humurous characters. The little fellows all run with their arms behind them in an almost anime-like style, and speak in a language that's akin to the minions from Despicable Me. It's totally worth a shot if you're bored playing the run of the mill kind of games being released these days, and while you may find flaws with some aspects, you will enjoy the game as a whole if you relate to this type of gameplay.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441608051, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441608051, "recommendationid": "17923861", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509659", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437898481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 119, "steamid": "76561197982662763", "num_games_owned": 341}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Not finish, crash, wait of patch.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437022161, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437022161, "recommendationid": "17071355", "language": "english", "votes_down": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.369857", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463242846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 179, "steamid": "76561198174173295", "num_games_owned": 103}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I can't open my journal, when I press 'J' nothing happens", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451141010, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451141010, "recommendationid": "19964553", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484477", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
