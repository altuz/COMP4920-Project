The controls are sloppy (especially when trying to quickly switch directions), the boost has less effect than simply dashing, the power-ups don't really seem to do anything and are easily avoided, and there is effectively no reason to spend your money on this game. I highly recommend playing SpeedRunners instead as it at least has an online community of players, let alone precise controls.

Maybe if you are a Jedi master with some Sith blood in the mix you can defeat them.\n\nMy review is a bit mixed. I probably won't play it that much but if you like these types of games and enjoyed Giana Sisters: Twisted Dream then go for it.
