So if you ever wanted to know what Kamikaze feels like, join the battle!\nAnother point is the targeting system: you can't choose on your own what you shoot at. There's an automated targeting system which selects targets for you. But the algorithm for selection is incomprehensible, eventually selects something in the direction you're heading but often feels like random. So what you'll need is a lot of swarm missiles (multiple missiles shot at once that automatically select all nearest targets). So a fight with many enemies can pretty quickly become frustrating. Success on higher levels is more about luck than skills.\nLast thing: the story is very short (one short afternoon and you're through the whole stuff for a single decision tree) and its presentation is a bit \"low level\", just some audio conversation while you look at your current surroundings.\n\nSo, if it's on sale for a very low price, it's a distraction for a (very) short while if you don't expect too much, but at full price: not worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432844559, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432844559, "recommendationid": "16044067", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505002", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432840072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 86, "steamid": "76561198032574256", "num_games_owned": 78}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Oozes cheap quality, from the strange choices of voice acting and attempts at humor, to the awkward aiming system that defies physics, it feels like an arcade game from the early 2000's.

But Star Horizon, despite being an on-rails shooter, controls and feels very different from Star Fox. \n\nStar Horizon is a port of a mobile game, and was originally meant to be played with your finger on the screen, the ship itself works like an aiming reticule, so you need to have your ship aligned with the enemy to hit them, this, in the mobile phone, means you kinda have to hit the enemies with your finger, while in Star Fox the aiming reticule looks like it's far in front of your ship, in Star Horizon it feels like it's very close to your ship, so the ship moves instantly in relation to the aiming reticule, while in Star Fox, there's a visible delay and the ship is not always necessarily at the same spot on the screen where the reticule is.\n\nOnce you get that, you'll start enjoying this game for what it is, an on-rail shooter of it's own, and not just a Star Fox clone like you might have thought at first.\n\nThe thing is, while the main weapons are not very effective like in Star Fox, you have the secondary weapon called swarm rockets, guided projectiles that works kinda like the ones in panzer dragoon, and you don't need to lock on enemies, they follow automatically, this makes the game much more enjoyable and you'll rely on these more than the main weapon! \n\nYou also have the plasma rockets, a very strong guided shot that you need to lock on enemies, and need some time to be recharged before you can use it again, perfect for bosses.\n\nYou'll be graded after each mission and receive points based in your skills, you can then use these points to upgrade your ship between missions.\n\nThe story is silly, the choices you make between missions only changes some dialog during cut scenes or make you fight/avoid some boss fights. But the stages are always the same, in the same sequence, it's a very linear game, it's definitely not like Star Fox 64 with all those branching paths if that's what you're expecting, but it's fun nonetheless.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the ship has an evasive maneuver, but honestly, it doesn't help at all, it's a barrel roll, but seems to serve no purpose other than being stylish, because it never seems to deflect any enemy shot.\n\nOn-rails space shooters are a rarity these days, we should thank the devs for trying to revive it!

Instead of making the game with grandest AI, lighting effects that depends on your position... Instead your move, at least overall movement is pre-set and you need to move your ship within the narrow confines of the path and shoot or dodge things and destroy enemies. It is that simple, and it's a wild ride. \n\nAs \"John\" of the Federation, you are a starfighter pilot that was about to break the backbone of the rebellion, when a suicide attack destroyed the Federation command ship and your ship went crazy and did an emergency shutdown, leaving you in cryosleep... until you woke up far from home, and you had to defeat a few rebels to even get them to give you some directions and some repairs. You then have to decide whether to join the rebels permanently, or go back to the Feds, and in turn, you realize there is an even bigger threat out there. \n\nAs you make kills, you will get \"credits\", and you can use those credits to upgrade the ship with more armor, guns, torpedoes, and swarm missiles. And you will need them as enemy ships becomes heavier and tougher to kill, and many require a \"boss fight\" where you need to slowly peel off every turret that the ship can deploy, which can include heavy beam turrets as well as swarm missile launchers similar to yours, in addition laser turrets. \n\nTo counter this you can shoot at the missiles, and you can do \"dodge\" left and right which performs a spin move that may get you away from the enemy or missiles. Your ship is equipped with shield, which regenerate, and armor that doesn't.
