And each level ends with a small informative blurb that I assume nobody will read, but it adds a bit of substance.\n\nMore modern HO games try to amp it up with plot and animations and a story and voice acting and what not, usually with bad results, because at the end of the day, it's a cheesy casual game and reaching for more just makes it awkward.\nBut this series focuses efforts on the mechanics of HO gameplay, and it shows in how well the scenes are made.\n\nShame about that low resolution though."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1301337221, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506945", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2722822", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011647032", "num_reviews": 482, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 7489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 326}, "timestamp_updated": 1301337221, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you like to play hide and go seek on the computer then this will be a game that would be fun for you to play.

The music for me is just irritating. It\u2019s painful to listen to, it\u2019s very repetitive and all sounds the same. It\u2019s all in a low tone, and honesty I have to say it barely passes for music. Nor background ambience for that matter. It\u2019s a horrible mixture of both I suppose. I turnt all the settings down so I don\u2019t have to listen to it, but no audio at all makes it even more boring than it already is, so I played my own music in the background. Just to try and make the game a tad bit more bearable. \nThe gameplay is fairly repetitive, you play the same 5 scenes over and over and over again, and it feels as if it goes on forever. To complete, it\u2019s way too long. Or at least felt that way. It just felt like a chore to complete. I made myself finish it because usually I want to finish games I\u2019ve started before I can move on.(anyone that knows me will know my illogical OCD-tendencies when it comes to my steam library).\nLike most games, it felt so good to finish, but not in a satisfying way. Where you finish, reflect on the game and feel good about it. In a way that just made me so happy that I would never have to go near this game ever again.\nIf you enjoy hidden object games, don't buy these. There are much better ones you can buy. The \"Midnight Mysteries\" and \u201cSamantha Swift\u201d series were good in my opinion. I played through them quite easily. They actually have a story and is a lot more engaging.

Rest assured if you suffer with insomnia this little beauty will put you in a deep sleep within half hour tops. I aint kidding. I really tested this. I tried everything to combat its narclepsy effects from toothpicks under my eyelids, to black coffee straight. Nothing and I mean nothing stopped it from making me suddenly becoming lethargic and slamming my head with a dull thud on my desk as i snored away peacefully.\n\nThere should be health warnings with this game...\n\n\"Play it surrounded with pillows\"\n\n\"Make sure your computer desk doesn't have sharp edges\"\n\n\"Ensure a close relative intrudes into your room and shakes you violently by the shoulders every half hour just to make sure your still breathing\"\n\nI don't know what causes it to have such a lullaby effect. Is it the constant music that just has a metronome dull beat to it? Is it the hand drawn art which makes you squint harder than a Chinese man looking directly into an eclipse? Is it the constant vague gnawings of Hidden Object Scenes which go on forever? (for instance it will ask you to find something that 'pumps blood' so you must look for a 'heart' which could be in word or picture format).\n\nApparently I've played nearly 8 hrs on this game (7.6 which would have been me sleeping). What I can tell you is that the game was originally developed by spin top games who were later completely aquired by popcap. It requires you to grind away at a handful of object scenes constantly until you reach level 25. Each level you raise up you get an artifact (a jigsaw piece), you also get a small entry in a journal, which offers only lame info about certain places around the world. \n\nAfter every HOS you are required to solve a puzzle, from spot the difference, word find or just doing a jigsaw. Once you have completed that, you are tortured with another HOS  probably the same one you have done like 50 times already. After you reach level 25 you have to do a final jigsaw, do a very easy memory game, and then finally rotate a few disks so that they allign perfectly with an outside pattern. Then 'Poof' you get to see a picture of a diamond and for those that have ocd the satisfaction that you never have to play this again.\n\nThe game also asks you to find two gems per level until you get to 50, but this really is a no brainer as you have literally hundreds and hundreds of opportunity to find them.The 50 gems unlock two modes, one which is unlimited HOS and the 2nd which is unlimited spot the difference. These are no doubt put there for people who want to induce themselves into a coma. While it might sound like im pulling your leg, I assure you i'm not. I have no doubt that the military are also intrested in this game for weapon usage. Display this game across a projector and soldiers running across a battle field would just fall in a heap. HOS warfare is just around the corner.\n\nBe preapred to be utterly dazed and confused after you awake from your slumber too. You might find yourself out for days, weeks, months even. I awoke to discover trump had become president. I was so shocked, dazed just like a deer in the headlights. My only reassurance is that I could play this game when ever I wanted and it would no doubt put me down again in no time..."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1419777528, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496336", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13664371", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198054841422", "num_reviews": 53, "last_played": 1458866420, "num_games_owned": 2116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1430}, "timestamp_updated": 1419777528, "received_for_free": false, "review": "when you have that \"there's too much going on for me to concentrate\" feeling, this one is a fine time waster. was definitely worth a play through."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1423221028, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504359", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "14350835", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198103717424", "num_reviews": 42, "last_played": 1423220756, "num_games_owned": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 789}, "timestamp_updated": 1423221028, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Dear Gods, why did I buy the Popcap Bundle?
