People who like Carmageddon will probably like this\nPositives: \nGood graphics quality. Really good I guess for the time of the release, no worse than in more recent Carmageddon: Reincarnation\nFun physics\nNice maps with destructive elements and stuff like ramps or tunnels to perform stunts\nCars eating zombies\nCars setting zombies on fire\nCars getting energy from eating and dismembering zombies for a nitro boost\nYou get to race and eat zombies with your car inside the Large Hadron Collider\nGame-appropriate music that goes well with munching zombies at high speed and wrecking opponents\n\nNegatives:\nAn incredibly stupid lore that is hybrid of partially being ripped off S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and adapted to the Cern environment. Serioulsy, if you are trying to get people to play who know what the LHC is, it would be better if you worked more on the lore.\nVery small selection of cars\nCampaign's plot is far below average, if the game took itself less seriously, the plot would have been more appropriate.\nColours in most places are far less vivid than in Carmageddon and for the amount of nonsense lore the game has, it takes itself too seriously. If it had more of Carmageddon's senseless fun, it would have been better.\n\n\nOverall, I would recommend to buy this game if you like killing zombies with cars and getting bonuses for that.

There's fixed checkpoint races, (semi-) random checkpoint races, demolition derbies, \"ram the other racer\" races, and variations on these themes.  The fact that you're mowing down zombies between point A and point B is kind of exciting at first, but then you realize that there's far better arcade racers out there (say, the first GRID) and far better mow-the-peds-down racers out there (the old, but still vital, Carmageddon).
