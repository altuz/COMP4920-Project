Laura needs your help again, but this time it's to save her husband, whose mind has been invaded by the Sandman in hopes of making Tim his apprentice. \n\nThis sequal falls far short of its predecessor. First off, I spent about 7 hours in the first game, and just over 3 in this one. It's significantly shorter, with less areas to explore, and the areas are also smaller. The puzzles are there, but there isn't really any grading in their difficulty. They start hard and stay hard, with a couple overly simple exceptions. There's some hidden item events, one or two per each area. \n\nThe graphics have improved, but the lip sync is still horrid. The voice acting varies (Sandman is stilted and awkward, Laura is decent, Tim varies by scene). \n\nI enjoyed the first game, and I do like the story, but they kind of dropped the ball on this one. There's not really any progression in plot between the first game and this one, however. It's more like an extended bonus to the first game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1473031939, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1473031939, "recommendationid": "25355666", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502895", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477726260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 305, "steamid": "76561198197896761", "num_games_owned": 227}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "In this HOG u will be playing to save Laura's husband Tim from the evil Sandman. The big difference in this game is that it does have HOG portions while the first one did not have any. Thankfully they added a HOG in this game since I love the HOG portions of the game a lot.\n\nThe characters in this game are nice, the VA was nice, bg are very nice. and music I believe was all the same from the first game.\n\nAs said in the beginning this game does have HOG which is a huge plus. I also enjoyed playing this HOG. I'll admit I like the first one better than the second one. Also the story on the main and bonus chapter ends abruptly which is such a shame. Yup the main story ends and continues in the bonus story. I really wish the story was longer because as I'm writing this I don't think there is a third Evil Sandman game. I hope a third Evil Sandman game comes out.\n\nAll in all u will enjoy this HOG maybe not as much as the first one.
