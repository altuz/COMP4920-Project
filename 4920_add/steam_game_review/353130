The weapons are cool as well. But i would not reccomend this if you wanted to play gae with dragons. The manta rey is extremely unbalanced in my opinion. Being able to simply turn faster than everything else, rendering itself impossable to hit. Playing any other dragon is not really an option, for you will get raped by the Rey. I cam looking for game called time of dragons to be able to play as dragons.
