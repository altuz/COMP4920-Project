First, the spirit of the game is awesome. You get a kick-ass character, very well designed, which blasts through a lot of monsters. You can really feel the way the developpers wanted that game to be: kiss kiss bang bang, with a lot of references and humor.\nThere's a huge variety of weapons for you to kill your enemies, which are usually quite diversified, and that you can upgrade for even more blasting. The hard mode presents a real challenge, even a bit too hard (but it's hard, what did I expect ?). The scenario, well, it's made not to be too present anyway, so doesn't really matter that it becomes totally faded in the gore after the first chapter.\nThe art is magnificent, the design also, two thumbs up for it. You really feel in a living world.\n\nNow for the bad parts... the bugs. Oh god... collisions are horrible and you find yourself falling a lot under the ground. The way the levels are made is... good and bad. Usually you'll find yourself at one side of the map, and have to go to the other side of the map to finish the quest, when it's not bugged (happened to me twice during the game, once for the main quest). And then the dash will be your best friend to finally get where you want without it taking you forever. I think the worst part is the monsters not repoping. You travel in an empty map, from side to side.\nThe UI is okayish, just monitor your life from to time because it didn't strike me much as an element.\nThe voice acting is... almost not present. For the main characters, no problem, they have their own voices. But for all the other NPCs, you'll get a bad quality recording of the same voice (all of them).\nThe game offers you to upgrade your weapons, which is good, but for the main weapon (which have self regenerating ammo), you get the choice between a three-shot upgrade or a rail gun. Take the latter, and even bosses won't resist you (final boss took me 15 shots in total). I won't speak about under bosses which are getting one-shot.\nFinally, just imagine platform game in isometric view. Sounds good, doesn't work.\n\nIn the end, the game doesn't take too long: 10h to finish normal mode, and I had a bunch of bugs forcing me to restart some levels. I would recommend it, for the fun it provides, but definitely not at full price. But just so you know, some parts will get on your nerves.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503253666, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503253666, "recommendationid": "34379557", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505791", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499883102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 1033, "steamid": "76561198058635054", "num_games_owned": 1327}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Honestly loved it. Enjoyably retro game design with a definite classic Duke Nukem vibe. Cheesy bare-bones story filled with pop culture references and one liners galore. Great action peppers decently designed levels, perhaps a bit repetetive but charming. Light on lore but made with heart, I would definitely be on board for Bombshell 2. Great fun for the not so serious.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499889103, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499889103, "recommendationid": "33487423", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501032508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 482, "steamid": "76561198006637036", "num_games_owned": 314}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Not so good, the gameplay is somewhat clunky, you get stuck on the scenario pretty often, still has a few bugs like floating stuck enemies that you cannot reach, some strange decisions on the execution animations which breaks the action completely and overall a noticeably unpolished game.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty good for the protagonist and main villain but only satisfactory for the overall rest but i need to point out that there are 2 quest missions about halfway through the game, where it seems that there wasn't voice recorded for that specific part and they just recorded that guy's voice at the last moments before shipping the game, it's very amateur quality and almost offensive to be honest. \nGreat artwork and visual style, good soundtrack that is strangely underused, cheesy story(which i'm okay with), some good puns and that's about it. \n\nSo, yeah, just avoid it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501393064, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501394222, "recommendationid": "33897541", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489057", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499557982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 315, "steamid": "76561197971887513", "num_games_owned": 192}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "My video review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dUuoVYG-2jw", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501465889, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501465889, "recommendationid": "33918317", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480089", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 49, "total_reviews": 74, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 25}}
