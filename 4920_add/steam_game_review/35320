While not insanely successful (as far as i know), it was a fun off-road arcade racer with lots of game modes and tons of maps and cars to choose from. (It even had a cop car and a hover-craft sci-fi racer thingy)\n\nInsane 2 continues this line, being far from a realistic racing game, but immensely fun, if you don't take it too serious. Expect lots of jumps and brutal crashes. The game has quite a few cars, maps and racing modes (from classic racing to capture the flag). \n\nGameplay-wise, Insane 2 isn't too difficult. The AI has some dumb moments, but luckily, these are relatively few and far-between. The Physics can seem strange to someone expecting a simulator, but their do their job. Ice and mud will make you glide around, for example. One annoying thing is, that the car will turn into rubber when you're carrying the flag (during CTF and RTF games). While the cars do take damage, it seems mostly cosmetic until the car breaks down completely, when a reset will fix it and bring you right back into the action. \n\nThe game looks very satisfying and seems well optimized, running very well even on mid and low-end machines. Graphics-wise there's very little to complain about, really. \n\nI can't really say much about the multiplayer, as i have yet to test it.\n\nAll in all, the game is well worth your time, IF you don't expect a realistic racing game and if you enjoy over the top races. \nProbably the biggest downside, is the current price on Steam.

It could have been perfect and recommendable to anyone were it not for these issues. As it is it's fantastic but beware of control/viewpoint frustrations.\n\n\nLonger version:\nIt's amazing but annoying at the same time. Obviously a lot of effort has gone into making the game not only fun but also faithful to the predecessor and the developers have succeeded on both counts. Yet there are a handful of problems which smell of either corner-cutting or being ignorant to gamers who like to play games a certain way. \n\n1st problem: (This one will be bigger to some than others) The gamepad controls are non-configurable. Yes it'll let you use a gamepad, no it won't let you set the controls how you like them. Consequently it maps accelerate/brake to the trigger buttons, which may be the way some people like it but i think this method of controlling speed is dumb. I usually use the right analogue stick, or a face-button if this function is not available. But as i said the game won't let you remap anything. So immediately i'm forced to play on keyboard because i just can't handle stupid controls. Perversely the game DOES let you configure the keyboard controls, so at least in that regard you can have it how you like. (fyi = az,.)\n\n2nd problem: There's a choice of only 2 views and neither of them are on-car. Yep, for the first time in a long time a racing game offers no 1st person viewpoint; all you get is a 3rd person view and a slightly zoomed-out 3rd person view, both of which are irritating because they don't rotate the view consistantly to the direction the car is facing. It's bizarre, surely a 1st person view is easier to program than a 3rd person view, yet for reasons that will remain a mystery Targem decided to not to include one. Consequently you'll run into a lot of viewpoint issues particularly during the flag & pursuit events. \n\n3rd problem: This is perhaps a personal preference rather than an arguable flaw as such. The \"King of the Hill\" mode from the first game has been replaced by \"Pursuit\", this is a hateful mode and is poorly recognised with many anti-player features which just make it more irritating than it needed to be. The idea is fairly simple; a helicopter will fly a scripted path with a searchlight directly underneath it, the player scores points by staying in the searchlight. It's fine as an idea but i do wish the developers had allowed more people to test the mode before including it in the game, it's riddled with problems. Firstly, most of the cars at your disposal (especially in the early stages of the game) simply aren't fast enough to keep up with the helicopter, how the AI cars manage it is anyone's guess (they cheat; is the answer). Secondly, when  you get bumped and fall behind you'll need to catch up sharpish which means relying on your nitro boost. But this will run out just before you catch up and then takes so long to recharge that you've fallen behind again. What would've immeasurably improved this mode would've been to give everyone infinite boost. Another annoyance is that the helicopter will change direction without warning and on some of the tracks you have to do several laps just to learn the route and hope the cheating AI doesn't win before you do so. Again; a small fix would've been to have the chevron in the spotlight pointing the direction that the heli's going to take 1 or 2 seconds in advance. \nAs it is the game's shipped with a stupid mode that requires many many attempts (and a boatload of luck) to beat, while the rest of the modes can be challenging but always feel possible. \n\nAlso regarding modes: The game makes you wait for 4 or 5 championships before giving you a Pathfinder game to play, this mode was always popular in the original game and one of the main selling points, yet I2 doesn't provide you with this fun until you're 40% of the way through. If all the Pursuit maps were replaced with Pathfinder/Gatehunt/Jamboree maps then i'd have been a bit more forgiving toward the game.\n\nThose are really the main problems that mark Insane 2 down for me, i love the game and heartily recommend it but it does really get on my tips from time to time. It's a worthy follow-up to one of my all-time favourite games, it looks fantastic, it's well optimised to run on lower-end systems, the racing is close and exciting, there are tons of events and a good variety of vehicles. I just wish more attention had been paid in certain areas. 8.5/10\n\n\nPS: There's also no speedo, even though the stats say a car is faster there's no guarantee that it actually is, especially when they all jump the same distances.\nPPS: Multiplayer: There were no games available on 3 seperate attempts to play. And i created a server which sat empty with no one joining for over an hour. Multiplayer is only for those who have friends who also play.\n"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1374630824, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500590", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "4971427", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198043846577", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1374550474, "num_games_owned": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 57}, "timestamp_updated": 1385412691, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Insane 2 is so much fun.

I played the demo I'd gotten on a CD with a magazine, and then I played the full game as soon as I found it. I loved 1nsane. I played the hell out of 1nsane. This, sir, is not 1nsane.\n\nIt's not bad, but Insane 2 isn't as good as the original. But it is a fun little off-road, open-arena racer. Jamboree, Off-Road Racing and Capture the Flag are still around, and they're mostly good (though the cars seem to roll over way to easily with the flag than in the original). And there are new gaming modes as well. Yeah... about those...\n\nI think that Insane 2 suffers more from \"sequelitis\" than anything else. It's bigger than the first game. It's prettier than the first game. It's a lot more frantic than the first game. And it suffers for it.\n\nThe graphics are incredible. 1nsane wasn't ugly, but this is a very pretty game. The cars don't deform as interestingly in Insane 2, but aside from that, the stages are so good looking. The Thunderstorm stage in particular has so much going on... which leads to my main criticism. There's too much going on. And it distracts (and detracts) from the gameplay.\n\nEach race has at least 6 competitors (up from 4 in the original) meaning that there are more cars running around, pushing into you. There's nitro now, which means that everyone is faster, and the racing itself is a lot more frantic (made even more so by the motion blur). On the Thunderstorm stage, your car can be struck by lightning, which looks metal, but if you're trying to play catch-up, and you lose the race because you got hit at the wrong time, it's more than a bit frustrating.\n\nThe nitro does add a certain something to the racing, and getting upgrade points does give the game some aspect of strategy. Upgrading also changes the looks of the cars (which is always nice). But it keeps reminding me of 1nsane, and stuff that's no longer around.\n\nEach league had a pool of cars available (and it seemed as though there were a lot more of them). Vehicles had a differential lock. There was a separate button for repair, and a separate one for recovering the car. And one for righting a car if it rolled over. 1nsane was just... better.\n\nInsane 2 introduces a number of new modes. There's Knockout, in which the last competitor through a checkpoint is removed every 30 seconds. Greed is probably the most fun, because you run around the map collecting bronze, silver and gold packages for points (probably a replacement for Demolition, and good riddance to it).
