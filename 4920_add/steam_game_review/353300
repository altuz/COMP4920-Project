Right away the title screen for Rooftop Cops is of a metaphysical order and not a concept we can grasp with our own hands. It's a world and a mental state that exists in already crowded and chaotic headspaces, but it is also oddly calming.\n\nYes, Rooftop Cop is as strange as it sounds, a collection of 5 seemingly unrelated scenarios with different metaphorical consequences accompanied by some incredible soundscapes and ambient shiftings echoing through your ears and exiting through your soul. The games are confusing, they are slow-burning in progression but that only lends itself to the incredibly strange and disjointed narrative presented. It's not something you play for \"fun\", but as a meditative space for thought.\n\nIf you don't like games that cause you to think or contemplate, avoid this. If you prefer having your hand held and all of your thoughts served to you on a silver platter then by all means go play one of the thousands of generic action games already on Steam, but if you're willing to dedicate your headspace to a different train of thought, to a form of art with a bit more meaning than just 'video games' then this is one surreal trip worth taking.

Why for me is simmilar to my enjoyment of the Welcome to Night Vale podcast.\n\nBoth, at least to me, represent a subjective puzzle in which the player attempts to solve their lore, history, and story of how those systems(typically made of characters, objects, ideas) function in themselfs plus their interaction with one another- allowing you the player to project and stitch together the narrative: Through the five vignette* games you're given a vague picture where by its narrative evolution depends upon the lenses one analyzes it with.\n\nPerhaps my comparriosn to WtNV sheds off here in that within its own meduim, you are not driving the ship, when unlike  video games there's the epectation for direct and explicit rewards from effort; input then fallows personally impactful output. More so, if being someone who holds the epectation of a fully air-tight complete story [or general dislike for making \"narrative hypothesis\" and self constructed story connections], that's not what Rooftop Cop provides. \n\nIt's a impromptu for you to fill in the gaps of the story; and, that's why I compare it to WtNV becuase that radio-podcast is the same in that both are subjective to your intrpetation, yet in WtNV progresses without imput. I mean beyond playing it and fallowed by listeing to it, WtNV progresses wither or not you've individually given its aspects thought.\n\nMeanwhile with Rooftop Cop because its a video game I can see the un-ideal prospect of its mechanics being more of an obstacle; over that of additional layer for promoting contemplation, at least of the subjective story it evokes in each of us. _Side note, on that subject Idea Channel created a video in relation of 'Mechanics vs Nerrative' linked:\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsybY6dcXAQ\nif interested.\n\nAnyways, I enjoy the mechanics for they reminded me of the feeling of being placed in a foreign realm who's operations, traditions, and social norms differ from my own, hence [for me, implying] in order to begin to understand I ought be observant plus alongside employ experiential thought processes, and to extent; I think says upfront that this void of hand-holding, which several games do typically, is done intentionally. Fallowing the analogy just set-up, not every culture is catered, and sometimes there's fun figuing it our for yourself.\n\nAnd so if that's your thing, maybe you'll enjoy these five vignette* games.\n\n\n* \"a brief evocative description, account, or episode.\"\n_ \"a small illustration or portrait photograph that fades into its background without a definite border\"\n\nHave a great day\n By the way,\n  Either way you try it or not.\n; )", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448006660, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448006660, "recommendationid": "19170630", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498929", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483246304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198025044985", "num_games_owned": 402}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is a sham.
