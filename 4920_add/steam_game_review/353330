It has achievements and steam cards which sell around $0.16-0.26. Art is visually pleasing, story plot is decent, nothing too crazy ( \"slice of life\" with a bit of a creepy cute feel; is how I would describe it). Anyone who likes monster girls/reepy cute atheistic and slice of life romance, would enjoy. \n\nThe VN is pretty basic; you can\u2019t chose responses and there is only one ending. Regardless the VN is nicely done and was a decent read.  After you beat the game, extra bits will be unlocked. Some will be basic story, with the characters interacting after the ending. While the rest is more \u2018behind the scenes\u2019, with sketches from the artist/author and more on the game.\n\nReplay value for me personally is quite low, but I don't replay VNs often.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505379423, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505379559, "recommendationid": "34944848", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 333, "total_reviews": 360, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 27}}
