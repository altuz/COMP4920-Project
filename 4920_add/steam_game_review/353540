I don't want to sound like I'm parroting Jon Blow and his praise for the game, but it's honestly literally true.\n\nIt really feels like the guy who designed these puzzles is right there, daring you solve it, and it feels so good when you finally figure out the solution. There are some puzzles that are basically elaborate jokes at your expense (if you've cultivated a bad habit over the previous few puzzles, he makes sure you learn never to repeat that again). Some levels are really intimidating but actually have such simple solutions, and then vice versa. The way new mechanics are introduced feels so natural, and sometimes leaves you shocked that a thing you thought was impossible is actually routinely expected of you now.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle games and isn't afraid of a challenge.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502375251, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502375251, "recommendationid": "34147727", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495177", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505959741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2871, "steamid": "76561198021787653", "num_games_owned": 303}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fantastic puzzle game.

It does take a while to get your head around the general flow, as it initially is quite tough to move your character around as intended. But once the control scheme sets in your mind, the puzzles are pretty clever. Some seem simple at first, but turn out to be really tricky as you'll end up burning a section of a sausage even though you've thought out how to maneouver it. The difficulty makes it all the more satisfying to clear a section of the map. Every so often, a new technique is introduced, such as skewering, and it's done in such a great dialogue-free way that fits into the game.\n\nIf you're not a fan of legitimately hard puzzles, then it's not for you. Don't be that guy who gets the game, complains that the puzzles 'make no sense' or that it's unintuative, then downvote it due to your own stupidity. It's not the game's fault.

If you have ever played a puzzle game and thought it was too hard and no fun, this is probably not the game for you.  The puzzles are very challenging and figuring out what you can do and what is a valid move is part of the fun.  You will run into puzzles that you stare at for hours.  You will construct proofs that the level is impossible and rage quit a few times.  Then one day you will see the answer, and you will feel a mixture of awe in how it works and surprise that you didn't see the solution sooner.\n\nI've found very few puzzle games that do this for me, but this is one of them.

The way new concepts are \"discovered\" is a stroke of genius. It's magical and pure. Very few games have ever made me stare at the screen in shock. And I also love that the puzzles are seemless and made of the environment itself.\n\nThe only downside to a game like this is the linearity of the progression. The game is teaching you concepts, but it is also allowing you to employ those concepts, so there are a ton of puzzles available to solve. While I have exited a puzzle and searched for other puzzles to solve to gain more confidence, then returned and solved the puzzle, a player is going to have to solve EVERY puzzle to progress. Which makes the pacing very slow. This lack of incentive to move forward and the high level of spatial thinking means you have to take a deep breath, sip at a cup of coffee, and get mentally prepared when you hit that Start button.\n\nBut, it's oh so worth it.
