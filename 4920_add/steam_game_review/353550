It didn't take much convincing to get me to play since I'm an absolute tragic for late-19th/early 20th century American horror, and I'm pretty sure I got it nice and cheap as well, but it wasn't long before I realised why there weren't a heap of positive reviews for the game. \nIt's short, for one thing, really short. I fucked around for ages looking at the various artworks and reading the covers of books etc. and it still only took me 3hrs to \"finish\". I say, \"finish\", because after \"obtaining\" the key required to leave the house and finish the game, I soon found out that there is a bug where it despawns from your inventory, essentially trapping you in the game. I couldn't get inspired enough to start again despite the short amount of time it would have taken me to finish, and ended up just finding a video of what happens in the end. Glad I did that actually, because despite setting up an amazing sense of tension throughout the game, House of Caravan delivered absolutely nothing in terms of a grand finale. What probably annoyed me more than that, however, is the completely unexplained series of bizzare things that happen while you are inside the house. Earthquakes, and windows breaking inwards had me completely sucked in for some real Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness shit to start going down. Unfortunately for me though, that never eventuated. Some of the puzzles were ok, though I have never met a person who has an aparatus for piecing together torn up letters. Nor have I met anyone who keeps torn up letters with sensitive information contaied therein, as far as I am aware.\nOverall, a game with a tonne of potential. As far as execution goes though, there are a heap of games out there that, while maybe not as pretty to look at, have executed far better on all levels at the same price point.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500978885, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500978885, "recommendationid": "33783819", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502571", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503433616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 217, "steamid": "76561198100816677", "num_games_owned": 40}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Game is BROKEN, don't buy!\n\nThere's a bug that's been known to the developer for almost two years that will prevent you from playing through the game, because you cannot enter a specific room: https://steamcommunity.com/app/353550/discussions/1/613956964601642160/\n\nStupidly I let the game run when I went afk for an hour or so and had taken a bit of time to explore in general which resulted in appr. 3.5 hours of gameplay and Steam won't refund the game.
