As said just do not except a lot from the shooting parts as you can outsmart mostly every enemy but the game as still some great shooting parts and a great boss fight. Adding to the little challenging platforming parts, you have some pixelverse parts in every level. It's like Kuru Kuru Kururin (GBA game where you need to reach the exit without touching the walls), you need to avoid touching the dark pixel borders, avoid the moving \"traps\" and fight your way to the objective.\n\n[h1]- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\n\n[u][b]Story[/b][/u] \n\nYou are Rad and like every child at your age, you love to play video games even past midnight. But your mother caught you while you were playing around the evening/night. So you were forced to sleep. You were awoken during the night by the bright screen of the TV and a strange glitch just appeared on it. You were then warped to a new world with a strange tribe with fellows and foes. Hopefully you met Dusty your console at the other of the real world, and Dusty is living and speaking this time ! With the help of Dusty and your trustworthy machine gun you will fight your way to save the videogame world !\n\n[u][b]Graphics[/b][/u] \n\nSometime great graphics means greedy in resources and sadly that's the case. So you will most likely play the game with a lower resolution.\n\n[u][b]Sounds, Music[/b][/u] \n\nSounds are like the old video games and the soundtrack is really great ! No need to use your own music.\n\n[u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u] \n\nLike any Shooter from the 90s area your goal is to reach the exit of each level and reach the final boss of the world. To do so you need to make your way by killing foes you may encounter using only your gun or your melee attacks. To be able to exit the level you need to find the 4 parts of the exit token scattered through the level and reach the exit. Hopefully you got a health bar (hearts actually) a pixel dust bar and a few lives. After you collect enough diamonds you will get an extra life. The pixel is divided into several small bars, the first one always regenerates over time. You need to collect pixel dust from fallen enemies to charge that bar. Each melee attack will consume one small bar.\nAdding to that you have some secrets area in each level which gives different things. Even outside these areas you can find hearts and power-ups.\n\nThese power-ups will greatly help you to wipe the world from all of these foes ! You got 4 power-ups : Rapid Fire (beware of the greatly increased recoil), Grenade launcher, Phoenix Cannon (like a flamethrower but it\u2019s actually throw it !) and a Big Purple Laser Blade !\n\nYou will encounter about 5 kind of foes : the regular ones, the giant ones and some nasty \"dragonflies\". Some can only hurt you in close combat and some can hurt you with projectiles.\n\nAs said earlier you can defeat most of all enemies without any trouble by outsmarting them : shooting from a safe distance. But sometimes you may need to take some risks.\n\nAdding to that you have some great platforming parts, but mostly easily doable.\n\nIn each level you get a few pixelverse parts, like Kuru Kuru Kururin, you need to avoid touching the dark pixel borders, avoid the moving \"traps\" and fight your way to the objective (the orange arrow) : most likely smashing an object to warp it back to its place. Sometimes instead of smashing an object you need to use pixel dust. It took me a little while to understand that. If you run out of pixel dust while doing that, you lose a heart and go back to the world. Hopefully you can stop before and gather some pixel dust by beating some foes that spawn in the pixelverse.\n\n[u][b]Achievements[/b][/u] \n\nThey are all easily doable except one or two which involve fighting the boss. Other than that, you need to beat the game on Hard with 100% which can be a little tedious but easily doable after you know the levels. Some achievements require you to perform a specific run: finish a level without killing any enemy, finish a level killing everyone with only melee attacks ... \n\nMostly because of the Boss speed run you need to play the game again on Easy to make it Easier obviously. Only the boss on Hard may be difficult to beat but if you farm lives you can try over and over.\nSo if you want to get 100% on Hard you may need to retry many time each level. Some secrets will require you to lose 2 hearts and if you're not quick enough (sometimes you won't be able to survive) you will most likely lose a life. Hopefully these secret areas tend to give a life, but a few don't.\n\nUnfortunately some naughty crates may ruin your current level progress, yes you heard me! For 2 secrets areas you need to jump on boxes to reach them. Sometimes a collision occurs when you land on them (the crate fly away) and so you may not be able to reach the secret area after. Also sometimes you will need to destroy crates first because the TNT crate will spread them in the air, destroying a few of them and a diamond may appears in the sky. \nBut fortunately you won't have this annoying issue a lot. Only 2-3 small parts are concerned. \n\nYou can follow my steam guide for the achievements.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=951417731\n\n[h1]---------------------You want more ?---------------------[/h1]\n\n[h1]Steam Curator page[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/M123-GR\n\n[h1]Steam Curator Store Page[/h1]\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/29521492/\n\n[h1]Reviews Sorted by Genres[/h1]\n[b]Work In Progress[/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=964304642", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499158642, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499701167, "recommendationid": "33221734", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510577", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495155737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 101, "steamid": "76561198001251929", "num_games_owned": 315}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a 5$ game, same monsters, same weapons, I won't recommend this game, graphic level themes are crowdy, you finish the level and you hardly remember what kinda level you were playing in.
