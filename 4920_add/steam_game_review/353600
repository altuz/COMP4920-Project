The left mouse key can only be unsed to interact with the objects about you and turn the camera, it cannot be set as a key binding for attacks or anything, or at least I've tried to do so and have failed. Then there's the map of the castle, which based on the intro for the game your character should know because its their castle yet you have no idea what rooms are where until you explore it (which doesn't make sense). Enemies can cast spells at you while going up the stairs, but when you're in first person mode (or any mode for that matter) you cannot fire a spell upwards or downwards (I say the enemies are cheating). I know there is a toggle target key but I feel this game would play better on a game pad if instead of the left/right strafting they turned instead and something like shoulder buttons on the game pad would work better. I'm going to continue trying to play the game and at least beat it, but with how things are going I can only play in short sessions before I get frustrated. Also, the guy is a trained swordsman, why is he attacking so slowly? It almost seems like his armor is weighing him down, but as a trained fighter he shouldn't be having that problem. Sadly, unless you have a lot of patience with games I would not suggest getting this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437708068, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437708068, "recommendationid": "17198351", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504682", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429409915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 155, "steamid": "76561198163834595", "num_games_owned": 256}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty cool for an indie game.

Your character looks like crap when he runs (like he has a corncob in his butt).  Other smaller knocks would be the inability to smash wooden crates and barrels in the dungeons, no inventory, no gold to acquire, and no skills that you can level up or adjust to your liking.  All of these would go a long ways to improving the gameplay experience, but to be fair these are also things that would likely increase the price.\n\nThe game is not horrible, but not much above average.. I would recommend waiting for a nice sale price for most people.  About 2.5 to 3 hours of gameplay is probably the time needed to defeat the game, and worse yet.. the game is not going to have any replayability at all as it would be exactly the same every time.\n\nMy 'very lenient' score is a 6.5 out of 10 but my recommendation is waiting for a sale on this, even for RPG fans like myself.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426610143, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1426621939, "recommendationid": "14935441", "language": "english", "votes_down": 60, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443356", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431370189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 52, "steamid": "76561198039256402", "num_games_owned": 455}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is the biggets crock of shit i've ever seen.\n\nFucking retards made this shit, literally worse than xbox indie game cancer trash.
