It is NOT a tycoon game or a simulator of any kind. If you play this with a relaxed attitude and want to sit back and build a few tracks and ponder over choices, this game isn't what you're looking for. Train valley certainly has management decisions, but time and money are pressing issues; every second counts. You'll need to think quick, act fast and plan ahead if you want to keep bankruptcy and train crashes at bay. This may not be how this game looks or even plays in the first few minutes, but believe me: get another game if you want a slow paced game.\n\nFor me personally, this is exactly the sort of game I actually wanted to play when trying out openRRT: lay down tracks, navigate the routes and have a ballet of near-misses as you estimate which train is best to set first. Granted: the money aspect can feel a bit game'y: there's an annual upkeep cost, tracks cost money, train crashes cost money, building over landmarks cost money and the cargo loses value over time. You've got to accept this all \"as is\", but hey...that's how this game rolls.\n\nControls are intuitive and easy. Up to the point where I'd almost expect this game to be a mobile game, though the visuals are still a couple notches above mobile standards. Building rails is a matter clicking and dragging (which sounds obvious, but at the end of the level you probably have a complex web of relay junctions on the board) and everything else is as intuitive as can be.\n\nThe whole gist of this game is how things go from a steady, simple pace to keeping as much trains on the correct route as possible. It's not uncommon to guide train A to location B and train C to location D, only to discover that while you were busy elsewhere, you forgot to switch the junction so C would go to D instead of to B. The game is set up so near misses are common, and since train crashes are hard (if not impossible) to recover from, you can say that this game is hard and//or frustrating. But for some reason, I don't feel it either way. Yes, I seldomly do okay, but the fact that I'm totally in control of what I build or how many extra trains I dispatch reduces that. Most of the time, I think this game is just hilarious if things go wrong (yup...those train drivers do NOT stop on their own :P ).\n\nAll in all: do I advise it? Absolutely yes. Do I advise it for everyone? Absolutely not. Read the review, guys 'n girls. If you reduce this review to a simple thumbs up, I'm not one to come crying to when your calm little train simulator expects you to take risks to not go bankrupt. :P", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506006008, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506006008, "recommendationid": "35106545", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507355", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504975115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 116, "steamid": "76561198025982505", "num_games_owned": 112}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really fun and challeging puzzle game.
