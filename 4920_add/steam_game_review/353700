While the game was not designed for this (most objects only react to player 1), it still holds up pretty good in terms of design. \n\nThe Deadly Tower of Monsters is a top-down sci-fi twin-stick action game with RPG elements. Collect gold and resources along the way to upgrade your stats and weapons while battling monsters, stop-motion dinosaurs, FECES FLINGERS and guys in spandex suits. A director often comments on what you do along the game (like Bastion) but slower and more of a mocking, humour tone towards other tropes and series.\n\nRecommended if you want a good time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500175582, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500175582, "recommendationid": "33575739", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503278338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 34, "steamid": "76561198123973041", "num_games_owned": 73}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I bought it because it stated that offers a shared screen cooporative gameplay but it is a very poorly executed coop. The second player goes offscreen if he/she doesn't go in the same direction as the main player. Also the second player disappears every time there is a skydiving gameplay -  not a cutscene but a gameplay.  Idiotic. The game's narative is fun in the beginning but the narrator simply doesn't ever stop talking which ends up interfereing with the characters' dialog. I am very disapointed  and am returning the game. The more steam games I buy the more I become convinced that there is no oversight that the games are actually playable. What a mess.
