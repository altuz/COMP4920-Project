The only REAL next gen thing about this game is graphics. Most of the game mechanics are kind of a let down. There is also many glitches to encounter with in this game. For instants, celebrating after a goal,  you may phase right through the net. It's not game breaking but frankley unproffesional of the developers. As a defencive player in high school, I have found the defence in this game insulting. Sorry if I offend anyone, but it almost makes us look retarded. And the goalies, I know there is a ton of scoring in lacrosse (I play it) but, the goalies reactions are terrible as well. Not because they can't save anything, it's because there movements are choppy and not fluent, smoothe. If you dissagre with me I totally get, but I have been waiting for this game since the fund raised, and kinda have been disappointed with the outcome. I know you developers in a lot of hard work, and i appreciate it, but some of these mistakes are impossible to miss. I cannot get past the part I had to go out and buy a new controller to be able to play this. No keyboard support, REALLY?

It is basically a reskin of the games for Xbox they released several years ago with added career modes. I played Lacrosse at the DIII level and while this game does do some things well, it gets bogged down by an unexplained control scheme, poor AI, and wonky physics. Half-field offense is extremely difficult as is 1v1 dodging because you can never accurately judge when the D can take the ball away from you. Defensive players simply charge the ballcarrier and slide up-field with no regard to team defense, turning the game into a fast break simulator. This is a good start and I will pick it up again when the price drops to around $15-20. Hopefully they get the opportunity to make another and focus on improving the AI and tweaking the little things so that the game can accurately reflect the half-field game which is where the majority of the game is played.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459280726, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1459281051, "recommendationid": "22129942", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485188", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1457749932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 209, "steamid": "76561198002235159", "num_games_owned": 210}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Uh wow.

Installing the game and playing for the first time there was no tutorial or practice mode where u could really learn the controls. I found the controls on the difficult side to memorize, and jumping right into a game was overwhelming. I started with manual controls to switch players ect but found it wouldnt switch to the person i wanted and would go to someone across the field that couldnt even be in the play. i found that alone extremely frustrating, because it made defense impossible. I then switched to automatic and that as well went to players on attack while i was playing D. I found offense very easy and playable, at times the game would pass to the wrong person but i guess that takes practice to aim it to the right person. The annoying stuff on offense would be if a offensive player passed it across midline to defense. which causes you to lose the ball and its just annoying.. why would i want to pass there? While playing defense u can really only be one player therefore AI in the game is supposed to cover the other players that cut through. AI did not do this so i pretty much played a 6 on 1 because my AI teamates litterally stood still and did nothing.
