With my background and recommendations from others I decided to play Volchaos with a controller. I will be writing this review from the view of a xbox controller.\n\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game is fun. It passes time quickly and I find myself not getting frustrated with the levels if they require me trying over and over to complete. As for how far I am in the game the levels are not crazy hard to the point were I feel that I have no chance in actually beating the level, the levels always fell beatable. As I worked my way through to the point that I am now in Volchaos I saw the level design change as my skill set evolved. As for the controls, (a) is jump and (x) is replay, something that you will probably be pressing a lot when playing. When moving though the levels, I found myself using the dpad button to move instead of using the analog joystick. People talk about the bad controls but I found them easy to get used to as you went along playing the game.\n\n\n\nBugs:\n\nI think for an early access game I should put this here to point out problems. (if I find any more major one then I put them here)\n\n1) When booting the game it often crashes the first boot... the second boot starts the game more times than not though.\n\n\n\nThe verdict:\n\nFor 2.99... yes! I have enjoyed all the time that I have played so far and I am sure that I will continue to play and enjoy the game in the future.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447645317, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1447645992, "recommendationid": "19107673", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463964474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13, "steamid": "76561198217668240", "num_games_owned": 173}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty cool game.
