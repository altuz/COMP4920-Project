Its a nice concept but extremely poorly executed.\n\nI would have liked to do a \"Pros & Cons\" review, but im seriously struggling to find any pros beyond the reasonably nice ship models.\n\nSo, in no particular order, heres a list of reasons why you should give this game a miss:\n\n1) At the time of writing, Ive completed 20 out of the 50 missions that make up the campaign and have completed them on all 3 difficulty levels, however I have yet to be shot at by an enemy ship yet! Not one single enemy has ever fired a shot, launched a fighter or a missile!\n\n2) The same scenario every time - Warp in with the enemy ships on your right. No objectives, no story line, nothing.... The only thing that changes is the composition of the enemy fleet.\n\n3) No damage models - Every ship just seems to be a bag of hitpoints. You do seem to be able to knock the engine offline sometimes, but there are no subsystems to damage and weapons cannot be take off line.\n\n4) Many of the game mechanics are terribly thought out, missiles and fighters being the worst of the design decisions. To attack with a fighter you launch it and it then autopilots at the target ship while you watch from the chase camera with a button that says fire, when the reticle is over the target, you press fire... Wow... just wow!\n\n5) BUGS - Shots randomly go whistling straight through enemy ships sometimes, the mission \"End\" button often gets obscured by the move command of the next ship even though the game should be over, and if you complete a mission on admiral difficulty without first doing the easiest difficulty, the mission ends up as \"unresolved\".\n\n6) No Context - There is an intro video that sets the scene, and every couple of missions you get a popup news article about fighting on earth, but there is no story behind your set route around the solar system, and no mission objectives - Its just a casual waltz around space erradicating the NAN forces.\n\n7) Although the ships look quite nice, there are only about 5 models for each of the 2 factions. The same model is used for each of the upgrades and the cruiser model is even recycled for use as a heavy and light cruiser!\n\nThis game should be avoided at all costs!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451420229, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451420229, "recommendationid": "20080426", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544333", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483003631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 267, "steamid": "76561197982800561", "num_games_owned": 298}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This is a bad game.  The game concept is clearly not complete.  The Devs clearly rushed this game out the door in order to make money.  The concept of play is that you warp into a battle field and fight an enemy fleet.  However, the starting points are always the same and the initial engagement is also almost always the same.  You appear right beside the enemy fleet, so you have two options turn into the enemy fleet and fire or turn away.  So, you almost always turn into the enemy fleet.  Another major flaw in the game is that you are better off just having one big killer ship as opposed to a fleet.  The turn order is dependent on your fleet.  So if you show up with a fleet, each ship takes it's turn in a pre-determined order.  If you show up with one capital ship, it takes up all the turns in that order (instead of just one turn like one would assume).  So, your capital ship can then move and shoot many times in a turn.  \n\nAn interesting twist on this game is that you move and then shoot.  The turrets are all linked and you have to target them all according to their arcs of fire.  So ship positioning becomes important. If you can line up an enemy ship so that all your guns can hit it, that ship is doomed.  The problem is that to do so, you always do the same moves for every battle.  The game is also buggy, I've had ships just vector off in a random direction when it wasn't supposed to move.\n\nPros:\n- Spaceships\n- Unique shooting concept.\n\nCons:\n- Weak and incomplete game design\n- Repeatative battles\n- Weak plot\n- Buggy", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431622225, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431622225, "recommendationid": "15827204", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509503", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431719706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 332, "steamid": "76561198047491364", "num_games_owned": 99}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "review": "So far I have only tested this game for four hours (I am now in 18th of the 50 missions) and it seems that I have seen everything it has to offer...\n\nThe game's premise seems interesting: fight a turn based fleet action in space. In reality this game is just a string of missions where the fleet of your choosing is pitted against enemy fleet. There have been number of games where this worked alright but they had something Starlight Tactic lacked - context (why are we here? Why is the enemy fleet consisting of two freighters and three frigates? You know...fluff..) and certain demand for player skill.\n\nWhen you buy game like Starlight Tactics, you expect that the game demands some sort of tactics on your part. In reallity 50 percent of the time the enemy ships spawn next to you, where the each side turns towards each other and start pounding away. The other 50% of time it spawns right in front of you, at most 300-500 meters, where you can dispense with turning part.\nBasically it all comes down to this - position your ships in such way that most of their weapons can hit the enemy (yep, that is all there is...)\nBy this point I have covered everything this game has to offer in tactics department. \n\nShip types and roles? Just buy the ship with most firepower (Then buy the AP round upgrade and you are set for next 18 missions....). Weapons? 5 cm is not as good as 12 cm.\n\nAt this point, at this price range (10 USD) I cannot recommend this game (even for the most casual of gamers). At same price you can get Nexus: The Jupiter Incident from 2004 which has slightly worse graphics but is infinently better space fleet combat game (not for the casual gamer though). \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430665784, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430665784, "recommendationid": "15671028", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503047", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442525866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1057, "steamid": "76561198051698320", "num_games_owned": 270}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "review": "8/10\nspace combat turn based    more fun than you may think\n\nstep 1 set your move length-direction-angle\nstep 2 try to point all weapons at target with hight-left-right then fine tune your shot....fire\nthere are lots of ships-types and different factions all with there own ships that look different and work different\nthere are things you can add to the ships that will make them better\n eg damage type armor missiles shields ect\n\nnots seen many different types of missions", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428724525, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428728670, "recommendationid": "15300565", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515996", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1428612087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 322, "steamid": "76561198047358905", "num_games_owned": 163}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "7", "review": "Ok now i have had chance to play the game and big thanks to the dev for listening to the feedback on here. \n\nI like the Game so far got a few hours in today and i know im going to sink a few more hours into it so well worth the price.

Next after buying these the game said you can speed up delivery using credits but i have none so not a very helpfull tutorial.\n\nI have tried restarting the campaign and it does not seem to work as credits are still used up and ships still in shipyard. So do not buy too many ships at the start people or you will have to wait to actually do anything.

First I'll answer some of the points from other reviews:\n\n1. Have to wait hours for ships to be delivered.\nA. The devs removed this problem fairly quickly, and now the longest wait for a Carrier is about 12 minutes, while a destroyer is about 3 minutes. This adds a different dimension to the game than other similar ones, and makes you think strategy when requesting units and budgeting. Also, while you're waiting you can earn more command points (CP, game currency) playing skirmishes. The skirmishes are a lot of fun because you can set the ships/upgrades however you like. It's a lot of fun to take some revenge after your ships get destroyed in the campaign by setting your ships up with all upgrades, and the enemy up with none =). A major flaw that still is exists is the repair times for ships.  Slight damage takes 10-20 minutes to repair, and you can earn some CP while you're waiting. My carrier just got into a firefight and it is going to take 7 hours to repair? [b]That's a bit much devs[/b]. BTW you can also spent CP points to repair your ships instantly, and deliver them instantly, but when you're trying to save CP's you don't want to spend them on rushing.\n\n2. The game UI is difficult to aim properly. \nA. Yes at first, but as your get used to moving/aiming your ships you get a lot better at it. There's also skirmish mode like  I mentioned earlier to hone your skills. Again, this is a different dimension to the game that makes it interesting. As far as blind spots being as big as cruisers, well like in real life, the closer you get the harder it is for all the turrets to aim together to one point. You have to take firing ranges into account in your manuevering. Larger ships have longer ranges.  Let me tell you there is no greater feeling that the first time you line up all your turrets on the enemy ship and blow it away.\n\n3. You can only use one ship at a time on both sides, no matter how outnumbered the enemy is.\nA. Yes, this one is a little annoying. You have 5-6 ships, your enemy has only one left, and while you get to use one ship, so does the enemy. So if you run 5 rounds letting all your ships have a turn, the enemy ship also gets 5 rounds. From a challenge point of view this is good, but from a realistic point of view this is way off. Especially when the enemy has a large ship left that can take some hits, and you lose a few destroyers trying to take it out. A good strategy to deal with this is remove the hardest hitting enemy ships first, but again it's not realisitic.\n\n4. Game has no ship damage system.\nA. It kinda does. You can hit the enemy engines and damage them hard enough that the ship will start spinning. However there is no way to knock out enemy weapons or subsystems. \n\n5. The story is lacking. \nA. No dispute there. There is just a quick paragraph of information before each engagement, and none of them have anything to do with the battles you are fighting. But it does give the feeling of being in a war, and the battles are all part of the larger conflict.\n\nNow questions answered this is a fun game. It's pretty well balanced, and takes a fresh approach to a space strategy sim. Physics are in play and asteroids/other ships react to fire.  The graphics are fantastic, and run well with decent machines (I have a beast rig I built myself, and a 2012 Alienware laptop). I was able to run the highest graphics settings on either machine with no drop in framerate. Also, the game has not crashed/bugged once since I've been playing. That smoothness is appreciated. Ship designs are very familar to Starship Troopers/Babylon 5/Star Trek, and other well known scifi series. They look nice.\n\nOverall, it's well worth the $9-10 they are charging for it, and will give you your monies worth in enjoyment, if you have the discipline to learn the controls. \n\nUI 8/10\nGraphics 10/10\nSound 8/10\nEnjoyment 9/10\nStory 4/10\nBugs 10/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428522840, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428522840, "recommendationid": "15268758", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503068", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452443990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 255, "steamid": "76561198018124881", "num_games_owned": 166}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "While the game has 'promise' controls are simply unbearable and countereffective.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452195707, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452195707, "recommendationid": "20381500", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436920719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 632, "steamid": "76561198026123235", "num_games_owned": 124}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This game crashes and when it does every time you lose your upgrades to one of your ships is Pathedic.

Piece of crap, no point in having more than 1 ship as if you are fighting 3 vs 1 the AI gets to use his 1 ship 3 times (move and shoot) while each of your 3 ships only move and shoot the once each. Order is your 1st ship, then his, your 2nd ship then his then your 3rd ship then his yet again.  So unless you kill him with your very first ship he will blow up the rest np.  By the time you get to your 3rd ship (should say last ship as the first 2 are already dead) he has moved and shot 2 timesy.  So you start with 3 ships and will loose 2 before destroying his only ship.  Its not tatics at all, each of your ships are not working together at all, its 3 separate objects trying to kill 1 object.\n\nThe space is just pictures in background and planets the same, just a sky box.  This feels like a unity home edition engine that can be made in a week, the menus are poor, just buttons.

This game can run on anything, sure my washing machine could run it, its so basic its unreal.\n\nThe only thing I do like is the ship models, cracking job on them 10/10 for the 3d models, the programmer should stick to lotus 1-2-3 or wordperfect macros.\n\nAdded: 09/04/15\n\nplayed again and found this time I could progress in the game by resetting the main campaign and doing the first 2 maps a few times, as even after a reset it keeps your ships and CP`s, a little odd but it gave me enoguh CP`s to fully upgrade my ship.

ALthough its not even, one race is EPICLY nice like AAA, and the other one is good and would be great in an indy game alone but along side the others they don't stand up as well.\nDifficulty: Its neat, if you screw up and lose fleet, you can just do old missions at other difficulties to get the points to go back up. Theres also a thing about using skirmish to earn CP but I havnt really played with that.\nGameplay: Theres huge potential here,  the basic idea they have here is AWSOME, it just needs some refinement, and explanation which the videos can provide.\nMusic: Way better then I usually expect from an indy game.\nVoice acting: Its very limited, but in a game thats also mobile you don't want to have meg upon meg of voice. But what there is is well done.\nComplaints:\nLong time to repair/requisition ships: The times are now MUCH more reasonable (order of magnitude better)\n\nControls are clunky: There was JUST a patch that makes it MUCH better (actual keyboard controls and some mouse integration) \n\nGameplay is simplistic: The 'tactics' and depth come from the upgrades on your ship in the 'upgrade fleet' menu. It's not as much as I was hoping for, but its a lot more then I thought there was initially.\n\nNew player experience: Watch the videos, one move/shoot cycle should BE the tutorial, it makes what the game is SOOOO much clearer and makes the 'what the hell am I doing' so much easier.\n\nStory is simplistic: Only when compared to a AAA game, in its casual genera it has WAY more then would normally be expected.\n\n\nThere have been two patches very soon after release on this game that addressed the major issues people had.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIts an awsome example of what its meant to be! Make sure you go in knowing what its meant to be!\n\n\nOLD NEGATIVE REVIEW: \n\nIt has a lot of potential. There was a rather thin attempt at story. A lot of the ship designs are quite good. The combat system is very different take on things and is kind of an interesting idea that is a bit let down by the implementation.\nCombat is one ship at a time with move and fire phases, full 3d movement you sort of pick a heading that\u2019s going to give you a good firing line, move and then try to line up your turrets, you have 2 sets of turrets, one is up and one is down and its near impossible to either hit more than one target, or hit a target with all weapons.   Unless (and this is what I started doing) you spend your first few moves turning your ships on their sides allowing you to hit multiple ships. The \u2018turrets fire in sets\u2019 idea is interesting once you get it through your head you\u2019re not going to hit every turn with every weapon, and wouldn\u2019t be so bad if the top and bottom had separate side to side (Although that would change balance quite a bit)\nUnfortunately the controls are clunky and can frustrating the tutorial/new player experience is really lacking.  I highly recommend watching the videos in the games store page both to see what you\u2019re getting and get an idea of how the game play actually works. It\u2019s not impossible to figure out but even once you figure it out your left with a 'eh...that\u2019s odd' feeling. On mobile they might be ok but they completely ignore the mouse/conventions of the entire history of gaming on how to select directions. They are going in a new direction in terms of how to control things so its mobile friendly as well but there\u2019s no reason the mouse couldn\u2019t have been worked into that much better then clicking sliders (ala simulate touches) It really feels like a straight port of a mobile game. \nThe 'why am I doing this, what the hell am I doing' aspect is almost completely lacking. The story seems to come from another game and the world has a lot of depth. But the storyline is given as a quick \u2018read this, ok now kill these guys\u2019. Storyline is in somewhat unsatisfying glimpses.  Its missing a lot and it feels more like a mid to late beta where the main stuff is there it just needs a polish and fluff pass.\nThere are some bugs still like the campaign randomly losing your progress and selection of ships in repair menus but in all cases the game recovers to a sane state if you just continue to poke at it. I don\u2019t recommend ramming as it just spins both ships and the firing here is actually check for round hitting model so that makes it VERY difficult to hit anything.\nThe whole wait for ships that everyone complains about it was removed in favor of using the in game currency to speed it up, it looks like an aborted attempt at a mobile pay for in game currency system. They fixed it for buying new ships at least at the time of this writing.\nI really wanted it to be good, it has some excellent ideas but the controls need work. The damage/combat model needs a bit more depth (there\u2019s even a bit of that with ships drifting/burning) but lacks the usual basic features like decals. The combat system itself needs more depth (like WHAT you hit mattering, separate left and right controls on upper vs lower turrets. A bit of an improvement to the AI. And more depth in terms of things like repair, initiative etc. It has the 'tactics' label but the only part it uses from the genera is 'turn based'.  The UI needs user experience testing, I'm sure it\u2019s perfectly navigable to the developers but to someone that hasn\u2019t seen it before...it needs a bit of work and a decent tutorial. A lot of potential neat features like replays are missing.   The controls feel to me like they were trying to make it work on mobile, but I can think of two ways to make it work better on BOTH platforms then what they came up with....(although what they have, on mobile probably acceptable)\n\nThe things I DO like are Ship designs are rather unique not just cookie cutter.  There are some 'inspired' type designs (somebody really liked the Normandy) but overall I really like them.  A lot of them I'd consider AAA quality with a few that aren\u2019t quite there.  They made an attempt to avoid the Indy trap of boring menus by having backgrounds while doing things that actually matter. Very well done, but needs some polish. The 3d doesn\u2019t always match the 2d. They tried something new with the actual combat system/UI with...varying degrees of success, but I applaud the attempt. They avoid the other indy trap of bad voice acting. I really think the person they used pulled it off REALLY well.\n\nShort version is, this game is pure potential if this was early access I would have been happy with my purchase at three times the price and looked forward to exciting things to come. As a full released game like this is as good as it gets other than bug fixes....meh at best. I'm going to put some more time into it later on to see if it grows on me but the overall impression I get is a depressing 'aww, i wanted it to be good!\n\nOr maybe my standards are too high for a budget game I saw a spaceship , the word tactics and a sub 10$ price tag and leaped without looking, watch the vids they are quite good and explain what your actually getting into.\n\n(Also note that between my origional review this morning and this one in the evening the dev released a patch that fixed some of the bugs I ran into + some of the control issues, although I still think it needs work this might mean game is still in development and not to be given up on :) )", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428518505, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1428550371, "recommendationid": "15267854", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.985740", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1428618057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 22, "steamid": "76561197968768348", "num_games_owned": 208}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I'm NOT a fan of this game.
