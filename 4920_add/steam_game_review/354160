PCARS, DiRT Rally, Race 07, etc, etc - I own and play them all. \n\nWRC 5 is rough around the edges, but with some TLC I think the game could go from good to great. It's not DiRT Rally, but it's also not awful. It's not another Milestone travesty, so we don't have to worry about garbage like the sound dropping out after two stages.\n\nI'll start with the bad:\n\n- Robotic co-driver: You do get the option of a woman co-driver, but both male and female options are spliced from sound clips rather than smooth pace notes like DiRT Rally or Dirt 2 / 3. It's not bad (and the pace notes are effective), but it's something to note.\n- Poor engine sounds: The cars sound like toys.\n- No actual routes: The courses are approximations of the real locations. It's close, but it's not the actual course.\n- Wheel support: There's a limited set of supported wheels.\n\nAnd now for the pros:\n\n+ Classes: Junior WRC, WRC 2 and WRC. You get a good selection of classes and cars, plus all the licensed drivers and gear.\n+ Career mode: The team stats are slightly randomized so you get a good selection of goals to choose from. \n+ Stages: 5 unique stages and a repeat per rally, usually in a 2-2-2 format. The stages aren't terribly long, but they are fun to drive. Finland's scary at night.\n+ Challenge mode: The MP challenge mode is pretty fun. Time trials on a specific stage using a specific team.\n\nReasonably, hard-core sim racers aren't going to like this. It's a balance of arcade racing and sim racing, using a real-world license. If you want a nice introduction to rally racing, this is a good place to start. It's better than WRC 4 (which isn't saying much, admittedly, but it's a marked improvement and is a decent little racing game).\n\n7/10 - needs some work, but is playable and fun.\n\nEDIT 2015-10-14: Patch 1.03 helped with the variable framerate and set DX11 as the primary launch mode, rather than DX9. I adjusted the cons to remove the framerate issues and upped my score to 7/10.

Car handling and physics just feel awful, while the graphics aren't great considering I have a GTX 780 ti and  i7 4770k.\n\nThe game does have some positives, with the full list of WRC rallies/cars included and car damage has been done pretty well.

This is just at 1080p.  Very few options to change as well.\n\nSound:  Watch some vids, it's pretty awful.  Co-driver sounds like a robot, car sounds are very poor.\n\nHUD and Camera Views: Standard camera views, but when you switch to cockpit view, you have NO tachometer, no speedometer, and no idea what gear you are in.  This could just be a bug for the car that I was using.  If you shift views in the middle of the race it will reset your current gear to 1.  Why on earth would this happen?  The tach is nearly impossible to see what RPM you are actually at, as the colors of the green/red only get slightly darker as you progress.  You really only know when to shift if you hit the redline.\n\nWheel Support and Force Feedback:  Just atrocious....  No clutch pedal support whatsoever (don't think H shifter either, but haven't tried yet).  There are some adjustments for sensitivity and deadzones, but only a bar to move with no numerical values.  FFB is quite awful, but it is there.  There are 2 sliders in which you can change the strength and vibraton (?).  If you completely lower the sliders to 0 then the wheel suddenly becomes a vibrating mess.  In short, this game is probably best played with a controller...\n\nPhysics:  About what you would expect.   More arcade like but you do need to use the brakes in this game at least....\n\nRally school:  A complete joke.  Not even worth discussing.  You have to do the same courses for Basics, 2wd, and 4wd.  Honestly just a huge waste of time.\n\nOverall:  With only an hour of playtime so far, I'm giving this game a 2/10.  This may change with further playtime, but currently its a buggy, laggy mess.

What it is, however, is a casual game meant for rally and WRC fans. \n\nIf you're looking for realism, you won't find it here. The tracks are mostly fictional and the car physics are simcade level at best. The visuals are serviceable but dated and are reminiscent of racing games on last gen consoles. \n\nThe performance could be better, but the game should run fine on a modern low end system with some tinkering in the graphics options. With VSync off, I average around 70 fps on max settings with an r7 370 at 900p (45 fps at 1080p). Turning the shadows down a notch yielded a 10-15 fps boost.\n\nThere is plenty of content to play through in the solo campaign. You start out as a junior and have to work your way up every season to become a champion.  The rally school is a really nice addition for people who aren't familiar with rally techniques. There are random leaderboard challenges that appear from time to time that serve as a bit of side content. If you just want to drive and not worry about the career, there is a quick stage mode that has every track and car unlocked.\n\n Overall, I would say the single player portion is very plain. You don't really need to do anything but drive. The car repairs, car setup, and team management have mostly been automated. While there are plenty of tracks, they are an example of quantity over quality. Most are short (<5 minutes) and have rather bland environments. \n\nAlso, don't get this for multiplayer unless you have friends to play it with since it's mostly dead.\n\ntl;dr\n\nIf you just want to sit back with a controller (or whatever your preference) and have some casual rallying fun, then you should get this on a sale.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457898613, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457898613, "recommendationid": "21821800", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471041", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444429093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 72, "steamid": "76561197993616794", "num_games_owned": 210}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I thought this would be a case of 'give it some time and it will grow on you' but alas it doesn't seem possible. The description of this game describes it as \"THE racing simulation standard\". Well, if that is the case, I'm not so sure how someone came to that opinion. \n\nHere is what I PERSONALLY like and don't like. \n\nPros - WRC Licensing. I love seeing the pros and their cars. Though, I'm not certain the sound effects are spot on. Also, It would be great if there was a better viewpoint inside the car. \n\nCons - Nothing online worked for me. I'd get errors connecting to the server. Another mode told me there were over 100 days till I could play it online. Well, alright, fair enough. I guess you need a following to promote an e-sport. Sadly I'm not sure there will be one. \n\nController Support - \nThis game is limited in what you can  and can't use. Some of the most popular logitech wheels aren't supported, and you can't use multiple inputs in your setup. It doesn't support clutch pedals, so no manual override. \nMy current rallying setup includes a shifter, a wheel, a pro 3 pedal setup, and a separate handbrake. It would not read the input from my handbrake at all - only my wheel as a game controller. \n\nAudio - You'll end up wanting to turn off the co-driver voice - which is about the worst thing I can think to do in a rallying game. It's like a robot that doesn't understand word structure or inflection, just belting out words over and over. It's hard to follow and doesn't sound realistic at all.  \n\nThis game is planted firmly in contemporary rally, which is great if you are into it. however, after playing the game with multiple cars and setups I wasn't able to find anything interesting in trying different cars. There were differences, but not anything noteworthy enough to make the game seem fun. \n\nSo that's the big thing for me. If it's not a sim, it should at least be fun.

Gfx are great of course. Sound is okay. G25 Wheel Force Feedback is average.  My biggest complaint is that there seems to be too much traction even on full simulation mode.  I played a snow run in WRC5 and then switched to Richard Burns Rally and I felt much more comfortable with RBR.  When you floor it out of a turn in the snow there is not a lot of traction, but WRC5 gvies a little bit too much and you are soon fish tailing down the road as it tries to pull you into the ditch.\nThe interface is really cool and looks good.

I like the tight turns, which is one reason I like this game.\nThe damage to the car is very interesting and the tires keep getting worn down, making it harder to control.
