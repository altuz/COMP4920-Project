There ain't a solid story so I can't talk about it.\nThe game is actually somehow good but there are way too much stuff that kills it.\n\nThe graphics is meeh. Its graphics could have been better. The animation is also not that great.\n\nThe soundtrack ain't that good. The sound FX are great tho.\n\nThe gameplay is quite easy. The game basically runs on scripts which you can find on its web site. The movements and the rest of action are not adjustable but it's not that bad. WASD or the arrows for movements, Lclick to pick up drops or to attack, ect... but it's quite easy to master.\nThe game itself ain't that massive. Not like the other MMO RPGs. But for its size there are lots of monsters, dungeon, etc... There are lots of other features which are all listed in the game's description I can't list 'em all. It's just a review after all lol. \nLike any other RPG you have to level your character, buying items, etc.. But in this game unless you pay you will take for ever to become strong enough. You would have to farm in the same spot over and over forever.\nThe community is fu.cked up. Premium kids have too much power and they are attacking anyone without any reason at all. There ain't any safe zone so you are fu.cked no matter what.\nIt's still pretty fun to play with your friends. It's rarely to meet good players inside the game.\nThe worst thing in this game is its community. There are lots of good players but there are way more toxic players.\nThe game sometimes lagging so bad but meeh not that big of a deal.\n\nThe settings are also some scripts. You gotta know 'em to change the options.\n\nThere are thirty achievements. \nIt's not that bad of a game. I really enjoyed playing it but I don't recommend it.\nIt's more a P2W than F2P game. You will get bored when you find that you don't make any progress at all.\n\n\n[Spoiler]If you are interested in reading and discussing reviews.
