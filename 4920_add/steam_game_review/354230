After everything gets set up in the beginning, the various controls, how the game works and the all important vague back story, you realize that you've just stumbled across an amazing find in the realm of video game gold. Devouring Stars is built for, what I think, is a very select group of people; those that like back story but don't feel it's the win-all for a game to be great. This game has a very vague story to it that really makes you pay attention to it in the beginning and then seems to just drop it all together whilst you play the game. But in truth is more of a subconscious, behind the scenes telling that really, in my opinion, makes this game so great. The premises of Devouring Stars, without giving anything important away, is that there are tribes of Ancient Titans living in the deep of Tartarus, which is the Ancient Greek form of deep dark hell. And these titans take many forms; from the smallest once based around the elements, Earth, Fire, Water and Wind; to the greater titans like Chaos itself. The tribe you follow is the tribe of Chaos and its story of death and hopeful rebirth. In the beginning of the game you see your grand titan Chaos being destroyed by the other tribes. You then learn that all that survived of this once great tribe, was a lowly fire titan. Which you now must use to enact the rebirth of Chaos. This in turn leads to the discovery of other Chaotians still living in various parts of the universe, and of mysterious beings that may or may not help you on your journey. At the end of the day, if you don't think that story alone is enough for you to buy the game, check out some game play of it on YouTube. It will take a bit to get accustomed to. Not everyone is good at throwing stars at black holes trying to kill them.. \n\nAnd here is that game play I was talking about!:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7jyM_7oIE4E\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439970907, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439970907, "recommendationid": "17611028", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518966", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1455306774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 349, "steamid": "76561198167484126", "num_games_owned": 166}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So since i have played this game for a while, time to give you my first impression:\n\nSo this is the first RTS i have played for quiet some time, and i realy enjoy it. You don't have to controll to many units but still it has enough tactical depths due to the merging of entities to keep you playing the game for some time. Which is supportet by the randomly generated levels. \nYou every run with a few standart units you can select, and when you finished a map (consisting of serveral levels) you move on the the next on and unlock new slots so you can bring more entities into the next level. Plus you are able to keep the advanced (merged) entities if you dont loose them in battle. Thus, over time you are able to build a small army to fight you enemies. \nThere are several different scenarios you can find yourself into, like a trap or fights for portals (which bring you to the next level).\nI quiet enjoy the artstyle of the game and the background (beeing an entitie which can devour stars is kind of cool :P)\nAlthough the main reason i bought it was the freature to get new units by combining basic ones. That is kind of cool, but i hope in future development it will be more nessecary to switch between the different advanced units more, however it might also be that i'm not far enough into the game to realy make that nessecary. \nPotenitall buyers should keep one thing in mind: Eventhough it says \"multiplayer\" right now this is local only (and even that is not the real game). I hope they will be able to work on a real multiplayer cause the features this game offers for that are great and i would love to battle other players with and devour their part of the universe :P", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428165587, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1428165868, "recommendationid": "15204985", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501789", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433821976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 293, "steamid": "76561198039983541", "num_games_owned": 225}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I like it!

It is very fluid and beautiful, with no choppiness at all.\n\nThe gameplay is good, though it can feel somewhat stale at times, though not always. Even after it starts to feel repetitive it can easily be refreshed by the next section of the game where you may be forced to play with different entities.\n\nThe story is unique and very good, and many times the characters you play as (or entities you control) can and will die (permadeath, in a sense of that unique individual) and need replacement, but otherwise they carry on. It creates a feeling of attachment, then loss, when an entity has been with you on a number of different chapters in any given destiny, and then dies due to your poor tactical planning.\n\nThe game runs perfectly, I don't have an FPS counter but I could easily say I've been at 60FPS the entire time with no lag spikes.\n\n\nOverall the game is great.
