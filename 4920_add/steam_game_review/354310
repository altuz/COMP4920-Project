Some of the bonuses are timed. Since this is only a first impression and I haven't played it all that much, so obviously I don't know how difficult the game is going to get, but this being a casual game, I don't really expect more than medium difficulty.\n\nThe game delivers what you'd expect, no surprises, but it's not as outstanding as the 100% recommendations might lead you to believe.

It's varied and while it might use similar versions of an objective, they don't repeat and the boards are shaped around new experiences.
