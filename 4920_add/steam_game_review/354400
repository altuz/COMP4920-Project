The gameplay is simple and easy to learn, but it would take some time to master all the treble & cymbals secrets (I'd suggest reading a guide).\n\nMusic lovers get a set of unique handcrafted music tracks to swim through, and achievement hunters are going to enjoy their tadpole challenges. It's also possible to create custom levels with the editor.\n\nEverything about this game screams 'made with love', and many small things got great attention (pause/restart the game often enough and you'll [i]know[/i] what I mean ;) )", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500284096, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500284096, "recommendationid": "33604204", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505383", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500222466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 276, "steamid": "76561198030176000", "num_games_owned": 4565}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Cute and delightful, a little music adventure and a little bit of rhythm game. Story mode is pretty short (under 3 hours even if you're as bad at it as I am, yet the difficulty felt just right for me). There's leaderboards and extra challenges and composition mode, so there's some replay value too. \n\nThe music is what absolutely makes this game. The first few levels are maybe a bit slow, but then the singing starts and that's what makes this game great for me. Moonlight Bayou and Thunder Creek being my favourite levels.\n\nThe few negatives for me:  The story comics are cut off left and right on my non-widescreen resolution. The controls are a bit iffy -- I opted for controller, because the button presses were more responsive, although moving up/down with the stick wasn't quite as precise. Keyboard has more precise up/down, but I never could get the timing right for the \"attacks\".\n\nOverall, I love it, and it was a steal at the summer sale price. The most similar other game I can think of is Ephemerid; if you liked this one, also check out that one.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500224803, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500224803, "recommendationid": "33589452", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503804", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506259905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 725, "steamid": "76561198027997444", "num_games_owned": 202}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very charming rythm adventure game with nice surprises and some very good vocal tracks.\nIt's rather short, but got quite some replay value with unlockables (or highscores if that's your thing) and it's not very expensive.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500328755, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500328755, "recommendationid": "33617283", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498219", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 129, "total_reviews": 133, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
