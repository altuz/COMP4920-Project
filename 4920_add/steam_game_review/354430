For starters, the lighting / contrast in this edition is pretty bad.  Flying thru the training grounds, turret targets tend to white wash out into the background of the platform they're on.  Combat missions are equally bad with mines and TIEs being lost visually due to backgroud star clusters or flying in front of a capital ship.  The \"3D Accelleration\" option is also hopelessly broken.  Apparently it was never updated to work on anything but the very primitive graphics cards out when the game was originally released.\n\nThe controls SEEMED a little froggy to me also, but to be fair that MAY havve just been me needing a little more practice.\n\nAll in all though, a very disappointing \"upgrade\".  This coming froma huge fan of the original release and Star Wars in general.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505180968, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505180968, "recommendationid": "34893446", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502701", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 48, "total_reviews": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 25}}
