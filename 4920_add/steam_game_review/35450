It takes strategy, raw aim, and countless hours to master the nuances of the game's diverse maps and mechanics; but it's definitely worth the time you'll put in to it, if you can stick with it and brave the steep learning curve of course. This game is not easy. It will not hold your hand. You WILL die, and you will die CONSTANTLY. Not for the first 10 hours, or even the first 20 hours, but likely until you reach around 50 hours of gametime you will be dying frequently. But do not despair. Try to learn something from every death. Where did you die from? Did you see the enemy? Was there a safer way to get to the location you were trying to get to? If you'd like to improve your skills in the game quickly you need to pay attention to the high-level players around you on the map and try to follow them and learn the maps from them. There are many places that are \"kill-zones\" on the map, where you will likely die near instantly from machine gun fire or a snipers well aimed shot, so try your best to listen to experienced players over voice comms and follow your team commander's orders. For example, if the commander or your squad leader calls for the team to bum-rush through artillery or machine gun fire into the capture point in order to hold it for 10 more seconds (and possibly causing a map victory) you better risk your measly life to accomplish the specified order.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is one of my favorite PC shooter games and I hope to pour countless more hours into it and guide and help new players to learn the game. If you are new to the game do not hesitate to add me on Steam and I will gladly help you or answer any questions you may have.\n\nIf I had any criticism at all for Red Orchestra 2 it would be directed specifically to Tripwire's development team. I wish they would continue to improve and update the game. There are many small bugs and quality of life fixes that they could address to make this game a true masterpiece, a description it deserves.\n\n-Johan"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504942641, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34831295", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198061817310", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505473005, "num_games_owned": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5979}, "timestamp_updated": 1504942641, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of the best military games.
