I really love simple \"easy-to-learn-hard-to-master\" -type games, this one has only the simplicity without any depth. It's like the developer had a great game idea, then lost interest midway and just released it.\n\nThe most basic RTS elements would work wonders on this game:\n- more maps and objectives on the map\n- defensive buildings(walls, towers)\n- more than three units types(ranged shooting units)\n- upgradeadble units \"what unit should i upgrade next?\"\n- ...\n\nSimplicity is well and good, but it's not an excuse for lacking depth. The thing about \"retro arcade style strategy\" as the developer calls it, is - as with all arcade games- that there is something to master, for this game there is literally nothing to learn.
