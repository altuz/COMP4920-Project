The graphics were very good, I think this game was another that was really designed to showcase what the engine could do. \n\nPersonally I dont like having to fight minions in a Puzzle Game. Trying to think of a solution while some toilet paper covered twit chases you round in circles isnt the greatest. I had no issue with the boss fights however, as they were much like nintendo's 3 hit kill, but honestly in place of minions I would have prefered more puzzles.\n\nSpeaking of puzzles, personally I found that few of them posed a real challenge save the very last one, which took a bit of time to work out. This is not a bad thing because it meant that satisfying, rollling progress was made steadily, and you would be hard pressed to find a puzzle that you couldn't find a solution for after a few tries.\n\nA HUGE plus for this game was the respawning. All to often in games, the respawn puts you way back -looking at you Styx- but the respawn and autosaves meant that even if you died, your progress on an area was almost exactly where you were when you died; Made it a lot less frustrating.\n\nI wouldnt say the game had much of a story, more a pamphlet of explaining why this crazy crap was underground, but it was very satisfyingly brought full circle-pun intended-.\n\nAll in all, if you like puzzle games, with a bit of action/extremely mild horror elements, this game is worth about 10 hours to do puzzles and survival levels."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502249708, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34117036", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198016632416", "num_reviews": 175, "last_played": 1494103931, "num_games_owned": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 150}, "timestamp_updated": 1502249708, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a fun but datted FPS game.

Sure, they did the same thing with Half-Life 2, but Portal is the big surprise. When most companies made a puzzle game, they give you puzzles to solve, and that's it. However, with Portal, you got a puzzle, some hilarious dialog from a murderous A.I., and when you solve the puzzles in the test chamber, you move ahead and get that reward of more funny dialog, and sometimes see something interesting such as signs of previous test subjects. This \"reward\" for completing puzzles, even if not a tangible in-game object, made Portal more fun for me.\n\nOther companies have followed suit with this: The Turing Test has an A.I. that talks to you after each puzzle, Quantum Conundrum has John DeLancey (the actor who played Q in Star Trek) talking to you between puzzles, and even the Uncharted games, which do have shooting segments and such, have side characters like Sully to talk to you and say funny or interesting things between puzzles. \"Just do puzzles\" might suffice for some gamers, but Valve and other companies have lit beacon to show the way for making first person puzzle games now. \n\nIt costs a bit extra to add those bells and whistles of dialog between puzzles and interesting banter, etc., but it's worth it. The Ball couldn't keep me playing it long at all. Why do I want to finish? It's been long enough that I could play Portal, Portal 2, Quantum Conundrum, etc. and have forgotten many of the puzzle solutions, so I could just play one of those again and be more entertained thanks to the reward that isn't present in The Ball. Even with non-puzzle games such as first person shooters, unless the gameplay loop is a 9/10 or a 10/10 for me on its own, I'm probably going to stop playing after a little while, because story, interesting events, dialog, and characters are very important to me, and a game devoid of these things that hasn't completely ensnared me will have me walking away to a game I enjoy more.\n\nTL;DR: In an era when puzzle games have already evolved to include rewards in the form of enjoyable dialog, The Ball ignores this evolution and sticks to its guns, for better or for worse. I felt it was worse for it. A companion either in person or over a radio, or an enemy in either of those positions, talking to you, would have easily had me sit to play through to completion."}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499595845, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470200", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "33400102", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027769668", "num_reviews": 159, "last_played": 1375904991, "num_games_owned": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 17}, "timestamp_updated": 1499595845, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Before I played:\n\uff3c\uff3c \uff3f\n\u3000\u3000 \uff3c( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 <\u3000\u2312\u30fd\n\u3000\u3000\u3000/ \u3000 \u3078\uff3c\n\u3000\u3000 /\u3000\u3000/\u3000\uff3c\uff3c\n\u3000\u3000 \uff9a\u3000\u30ce\u3000\u3000 \u30fd_\u3064\n\u3000\u3000/\u3000/\n\u3000 /\u3000/|\n\u3000(\u3000(\u30fd\n\u3000|\u3000|\u3001\uff3c\n\u3000| \u4e3f \uff3c \u2312)\n\u3000| |\u3000\u3000) /\n`\u30ce )\u3000\u3000L\uff89\nAfter I played:\n\n\uff0f\uff8c\uff8c \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u30e0\uff40\u30fd\n/ \u30ce) \u3000 \uff09\u3000\u30fd\n/ \uff5c\u3000\u3000( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0\uff09\u30ce\u2312\uff08\u309d._,\u30ce\n/\u3000\uff89\u23127\u2312\u30fd\u30fc\u304f\u3000 \uff3c\u3000\uff0f\n\u4e36\uff3f \u30ce \uff61\u3000\u3000 \u30ce\uff64\u3000\uff61|/\n\u3000\u3000 `\u30fd `\u30fc-'_\u4eba`\u30fc\uff89\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u4e36 \uffe3 _\u4eba'\u5f61)"}]}
