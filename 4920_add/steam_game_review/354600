I had to do the tutorial, a short scenario and watched a couple of youtube videos. The battle mechanics are similar to HOI3, it's even more detailed because you are actually fighting for ground and not just provinces. There is also a little more micro management of units because the divisions are split into various parts. For example Panzer 1 will have 4 separate Panzer brigades, so you will have to move each one separately or as a group. in HOI 3 you just move the entire division around from province to province.\n\nJust one mooooore tuuuuuurn. \n\nP.S.

Each turn You get some amount of equipment of different types (different models of guns, armor, trucks, infantry, speciality units, etc.). Unused equipment is automatically stockpiled in Your main HQ unit and then it is distributed to the frontlines, where it is needed. You can even force Your units to redistribute some equipment back to the HQ resource pool and then back to other units that needs that equipment more. You can designate a new type for Your division and it will automatically get a new equipment to fulfill that role. You will need to keep supply routes open for that and need a bit of patience because it will not happen automatically.

Even on easy, i still havent managed to get passed the second scenario on time. Frustrating as that is though, it does leave me wanting to try again , and so i guess in that sense , its very good value for money.\n     The larger campaign maps are very large indeed,  dare i say a little too large for my liking, as i find them difficult to control. but they seem very detailed and its quite the job keeping tabs on whats going on. \n     Sadly the time clock doesnt seem to work in days , rather 2 or 3 days increments ,  which i find a little odd, as it makes hard work of the plan making and also knowing how many moves you have left. \n     But all in all, its really good fun. and despite not being very good at it yet, i promise i will  try harder. cheers.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452957999, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452958107, "recommendationid": "20563111", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516201", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1476055370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8669, "steamid": "76561197961224611", "num_games_owned": 230}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm still getting into this game, but it seems like Vic took everything great about DC and upped the ante.

The amount of detail and historical data the game encompasses is thrilling. As an exampe, you don't just have a an armored unit. You get an armored unit that is broken down by the type of equipment it has, its morale, training supplies and so much more. You have can interact with high command to get more supplies, trucks, new artillery pieces, even additional command staff. If your prestige and polical points (consider it in game gold for purchasing replacements) is high enough, you may be able to convince high command to abandon some set objectives and to go after another objective. Individual generals have a large effect on battles via their stats and can play differnt cards which represnt differnt command functions.
