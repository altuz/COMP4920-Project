However, I have to say that I was not remotely puzzled. I thought the solutions were obvious Whilst they tried to follow in the sucess of games such as the monkey island series, I thought this was short and simply far too easy! I would say that perhaps I am too used to these types of games but I JUST played Day of the Tentacle remastered and I was reduced to checking the walkthrough a couple of times when no amount of head scratching could yield an answer. \n\nDepite thinking that, I finished the episode and thought I'd give the second a shot because I liked the characters and the premise and I think it has potential. That potential was thwarted by a ten quid price tag for episode 2 which if as short and easy as episode 1 I would wind up regretting. Add to that, scanning the reviews I saw a lot of people complaining it was really buggy. If they fix the bugs and I see it on sale I'd definately give it another chance but until then my adventure with Bertram Fiddle is on hiatus.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506087251, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506087251, "recommendationid": "35127943", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 154, "total_reviews": 177, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 23}}
