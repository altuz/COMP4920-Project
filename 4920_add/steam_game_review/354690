The pathfinding is sometimes a little clunky, there are not a lot of characters, locations or dialog choices  (and no voices, only text). Still, for me, the game has some charm, this is the video game equivalent of a low budget adventure b-movie.  A few situations made me smile, the music is appropriate and to search for a lost city was interesting enough. The graphics are not great, but I liked the style of the characters and the ancient artifacts. This is far from the classics like Monkey Island or Fate of Atlantis, but I had some fun with it. For those who like the screenshots, I recommend it, moderately, in a sale, for less than $2.      \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431709225, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431709225, "recommendationid": "15841212", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514182", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1428281538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 214, "steamid": "76561198015972042", "num_games_owned": 419}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Lost city usually fun place full of adventures , cant say this about City of Malathendra, there is nothing much to say at all, you will not find there beautifull backgrounds, alive animation,interesting dialogs.Game is very short, not challenge, the story dont tell us anything interesting.\n\nIt was said that this should be \" a graphic adventure game heavily inspired by classics such as The Fate Of Atlantis and the Kings Quest series.\", so it is not true, i dont undestand how this game can remind Kings Quest or like said other reviewer Monkey Island.It have nothing in common with such titles.\n\nEven if it was made on some home engine, devs could make atleast something right,- walking mechanics is tottaly broken,noone cares about drawing at least something(backrounds are some mess),character animations looks awful.

The interactions are often illogical, progress is often trial and error, pixel hunting abounds, invisible walls everywhere, as a consequence the pathing is atrocious, the UI is clunky, the sounds are nothing to write home about (and the screams clearly fake), the effects are \"fade to white\" and \"fade to red\", the graphics are flash-style vector art married to eye-bleeding  \"latest 3D hardware\" backgrounds (if by \"latest\" they mean ca. 1993 - Myst looked better than this), and the dialogues are boring.
