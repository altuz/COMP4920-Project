It took me ~1.5 hours to complete, though I guess you could do it in under 1 hour if you rush.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots, the graphics are nothing to write home about, but the voice acting is very nice, and the plot is decent. You get to select some tools to do your investigations with (I chose camera, thermometer (useless) and pendulum), so there may be some replay value if you want to try solving it with the other tools. You also pick up some items as you go.

Think of a little FMV version of 'The Lost Crown': you look for the shadows of the lost souls at night, both inside the old mansion and at the cemetry, follow them to their hidden diaries, gather clues as to their past mysteries etc.\nOne drawback is the game's length - about two hours only.

As a test you're asked to investigate the house they're based out of. \n\nThe game uses FMV's, but does so badly. there is no perspective (the character stays the same size closer and farther from the camera, and tries to use lipsync (badly). During conversations the character images (apart from the lipsync) are pretty much static, yet look like they have been cut out using mspaint.\nApart from that it's a point and click adventure, but short (1-1.5 hrs according to other reviewers).\nThe narrative is quite cringeworthy at times.\n\n\nThe pricing is crazy. This is definitely not worth the 8 bucks the store asks for it.
