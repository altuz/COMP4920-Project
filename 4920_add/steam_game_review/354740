The story is good and kept me entertained the whole way way through, about 25 hours according to the game.  It has deep character cusumization for this type of games with two builds and specilazations for each party member, as well as a crafting system that I didn't find annoying due to the large amounts of materials looted and reusable components.  The combat is slightly different than traditional rpg maker games in that there is a 3x5 grip for each team and formations played into blocking for weaker party members and aoe, I liked it and it allowed for larger groups of enimies.  It is turn based which I know annoys some people.  Overall I would definatly recommend this for anybody looking for a fun jrpg to play.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499828546, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499828562, "recommendationid": "33470399", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505842", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499600137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3682, "steamid": "76561198043591517", "num_games_owned": 181}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Loved the game, it's an amazing RPGMaker gem. Loved how it allowed you to build your characters with some variability.\n\nOne hint for those wanting to play on hardmode: Ingrid's Junk Pile is the best thing ever.
