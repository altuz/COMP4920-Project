I've been with the game since the demo on gameMaker: studio. This game rocks! I love it! (still not a big fan of the perma-death though)\n\nThe things I love:\n-The soundtrack\n-the artwork. It's hand-drawn and amazing.\n-the lore. It's interesting and pretty unique.\n\nThe things I don't love\n-the perma-death. This is only because I'm bad at this game though\n\n*edit: Another great thing is how involved the deve is in the communtiry of his game. He is very open to suggestion and is a great guy. The perma-death isn't so bad unless you're terrible at the game(like I was).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430778629, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1442285003, "recommendationid": "15691732", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502068", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442632403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 262, "steamid": "76561198056656727", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really enjoy the combat and movement in this game. Even through you have only two attacks, mods and destructible  scenery keep combat interesting. Only issues I have had is that non-combat enemies do lots of damage and life is very scarce. The fact that areas inbetween save points are very long only make getting hit by something you can't fight back against even more punishing. I hope the devs can balance the damage of these enemies as I think they are a little to strong during the early game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442124798, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1442124798, "recommendationid": "18010286", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502173", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430897778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 66, "steamid": "76561198001483890", "num_games_owned": 107}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game... I like it! Another!!!  \n\nIn all seriousness in an age where games more or less copy past of the same games; it's good to see something interesting. But Not only is it interesting it's really darn good. Not to mention it's currently in early access, so it only can get better from here!

I enjoyed playing Trigger Saint but I feel it has some serious flaws. I liked this game enough that I will probably be buying any future games from this developer.\n\nThe controls work perfectly, the hitboxes are perfect. I've played too many indie games with sluggish, imprecise controls to not appreciate when somebody gets it right. Unfortunately, there is no key rebinding or controller support. This doesn't bother me, but it could be a problem for others. \n\nThe hand drawn graphics are beautiful, but there is not much to look at. The game takes place on a flat featureless plane with a few kinds of destructible scenery. the primary difference between levels is the color pallet.  \n\nThe music is good, but it doesn't always fit what is happening on screen. It also doesn't quite hit the video game goal of being engaging without being distracting. It if frequently distracting. \n\nThe challenge levels of the enemies seemed off. The mobs were too easy to kill and didn't pose any real danger. The mini bosses felt perfect. The level bosses felt way too difficult. None of the enemies have lifebars. This really only matters with the level bosses. Dying half a dozen times to a boss without knowing how close you are getting to destroying it is frustrating. This is especially problematic for the final boss. The final boss can only be damaged in one small area. I lost track of how many times I died before I figured this out.  The 8th level introduces an immobile, indestructible turret that fires faster, and has faster traveling bullets than any other enemy in the game. This changes the entire feeling of the game from an atmospheric exploration game too hectic dodging.   \n\nThe biggest problem I had with this game is the limited field of view. The Trigger Saint has very poor vision for somebody whose job is shooting a rifle. The whole game feels a bit claustrophobic. The enemies begin reacting to your presence before they are even on screen. Dodging enemy fire frequently moves the enemy firing at you off screen. It's not a game breaking problem, but it certainly feels weird.\n\nTrigger Saint is a fun, but flawed game. I'm looking forward to future titles from this developer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1471218641, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1482540453, "recommendationid": "24923250", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505444", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438087827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 233, "playtime_forever": 36, "steamid": "76561198037080732", "num_games_owned": 968}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "it feels quite nice the game itself. quite inmersive too. but ill like if in future updates, the devs add some auto generated levels in order to make it more unpredictable the whole thing. its a promising game, but in my opinion needs to have more.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438086357, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1438086357, "recommendationid": "17264773", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493888", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445044844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 51, "steamid": "76561198046082347", "num_games_owned": 348}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "have played 20 minutes or so as of now and have to say this is one of the most plished and interesting little early access games ive played.
