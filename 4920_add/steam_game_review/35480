Trace down little pathways to dig. Put a dynamite or spawn a defense tower. Thats about it. At time limit your score is tallied. Whatever. Audiovisually poor.  \n\nStrange game where a bunch of automated AI dig randomly all on the same Z level. You can script little pathways yoursef with a controlled dwarf but the pathfinding is odd with it. Time goes by very slowly and you cannot fast forward. The game has no goal and accomplishes nothing so to try to make it more like a game they added a time limit where your goal is to go supposedly as far as possible. Not sure what that even means. Sometimes mining will unleash little monsters. Meh. Removed for declutter."}]}
