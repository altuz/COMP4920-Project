I'm grown hesitant to actually buy day-of-release games, expecially if no discount is offered. But when I saw the following message on the Store Page, the decision was made:\n\n\"If you got a good experience, don't forget to mention that \"Only\" if you've a free moment. But in case you got a bad experience, then you \"MUST\" speak about it, that way you'll get better games next time.\"\n\nThis degree of commitment made the purchase decision easy. And the first few minutes of play indicates that this may just turn out to be a very pleasant game, at a fair price (even without discount.) One thing I've learned is that the most important aspect of any new game is a concerned DEV.\n\nI wonder, however, if I'll be the only player to accidentally loose all my save data by simply attempting to exit the OPTIONS screen. I'm not sure that gameplay should be a component of the setup menus. For small children, or their beginner parents wanting to bond, this sort of rage-inducing feature might be a bad idea.\n\nIf Blind Color is the same as Color Blind, having 2 levels to select for accessibility is a wonderfully kind, as well as marketable, feature.\n\nThough COATED is advertised as playable by children, don't be misled. This game is challenging enough to be interesting to gamers of any age or skill level. (I hope to update this review soon.)\n\nThank you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440535425, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440538429, "recommendationid": "17714830", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511532", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447889018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 50, "steamid": "76561198241309916", "num_games_owned": 29}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A simple puzzle game with charming visuals.
