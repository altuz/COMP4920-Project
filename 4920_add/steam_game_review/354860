The problem like I said, are the bugs. There are far too many to make this game playable entirely through without the hopes of not running into bugs that would potentially end the game in limbo. \n\nChecking the game's discussion thread involving \"Bugs\". Many of them are bugs that [i]could[/i] by trial and error, be countered (although a fix should always be addressed). But there are however other reported bugs that unfortunately put the players' entire work and effort on halt (sometimes permanently) because of a bug in the storyline that doesn't allow their game to progress. \n\nI am one of those people and although I say the game is great fun, it also needs to be playable all throughout to the end. Developers have [i]somewhat[/i] been active and I say that loosely as the common \"invisible enemies\" bug is still present since the beginning despite there being a \"We'll be looking into it\" quite a while ago. Whereas [b]game breaking[/b] glitches/bugs usually end in a \"Upload your save file to us and we'll try and fix it\" along with an entire guide on how to do it. \n\nSure, I appreciate what you're trying to do and the amount of effort you're trying to putting out, but there has to be an easier way. Players don't want to work even more to fix their game cause it's not their responsibility whether or not it works. \n\nThis sets a standard where players need to decide whether or not it's worth buying the game knowing that their entire story progress can be for nothing all because of an error the developers overlooked.\n\nI want to recommend this game because it really is tons of fun, but the bugs stand that much higher that it's hard to pick a side. I want to say I'm in the middle, but a game needs to be solid in the ways of the main story. \n\nSomeone get the pesticide.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502784818, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502784818, "recommendationid": "34251475", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506841", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492617782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561198361103888", "num_games_owned": 72}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I went into this completely blind. It was on sale for like 2 bucks and i figured what the heck. Maybe it's a diamond in the rough...Well it's more like a pebble in the rough. With some rough on top of it.\n\n\nAdventures of Tree is a buggy mess. It glitched out in the tutorial. The tutorial! There is no excuse for that. I couldn't even attack the very first enemies because the controls are horribly stiff and awkward. Hit boxes feel utterly random. And there's no sugarcoating the simplistic graphics, they're just plain ugly to behold.\n\n\nAs far positives go there is humor and self-awareness and if it was at least programmed properly i may have been willing to keep playing. But from i've seen i can't in good conscious recommend anything here.
