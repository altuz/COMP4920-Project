It is one of a series of four, that basically are each what in a traditional visual novel is a path. So basically, consider this as having chosen your path first. Sakuya (you can rename her) is a young woman who... does not want to act girly. As such, when offered the chance to be a test subject for her cousin's new attraction for women, she manages to convince him to let her try the other attraction... the one geared towards men. In the first few moments, she finds herself trapped with one of the four other participants. In this title, a young boy named Akio (who isn't really a young boy). Oh, and since she can choose her avatar, she chose to partake as a male.\n\nThere are three endings. The bad ending is unlocked if you make a wrong choice (one of which also unlocks an achievement about a carrot). The neutral/friendship ending depends on you choosing the lesser of two choices at the end of a stage. And the good/love ending is the better of those two choices. Oh, and choosing that better one also unlocks a small additional scene for the story (and accompanying CGs).\n\nThe game is beautiful, at least for the time. I have a feeling this is one of the first products put out by this publisher, as it is a bit rough around the edges.\n\nAlso, my suggestion would be to buy the East Tower Complete Edition. Especially as the last volume is almost three quarters of the price of the bundle...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501716491, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501716491, "recommendationid": "33981505", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5}}
