An imp a fiend is a blaze epic game... you know what I  mean. All, except for blaze's first magnam opus have been 2d, side view, room based, wall jump platformers, withdifferent controls or mechanics each time. This one, however, is a stand out. It combines the dashing and jumping mechanics of \"shin_samurai jazz\" with the the open room based free explore game play of \"castlevania\".\n\nYou play as some kind of part demon child in its early teens. Instead of following the deranged ghost of what may or may not be your father, you instead go in search of a bunch of gems that are blocking the underworld from rising up to conquer the mortal realm. \n\n(SPOILERS) \nit transpires that the gems are guarded by the Spirits of the loyal servants of some mortal king who sacrificed all of them to the underworld ages ago. and you were made from some evil experiment to stave off you or your mother from death. SO you, being only part imp or something, can destroy the gems. But when the final boss needs YOU to die in order to take his leave, you end up fixing the world more than anything else.\n\n(maybe thats how the universe reset itself after those 3 gangster demons in \"shin_samurai jazz\" split the earth in half)\n\n(/SPOILERS)\n\nAs for the game play, its kind of a rudimentary castlevania game. enemies are everywhere, and they respawn when you come back. And there are even parts where there are two turrets, one stacked on top of the other, pointing in opposite directions. More over, there are keys to find in each area, the screens are well layed out, and navigation is a brieze thanks to NO impossible geometry, and no characters telling you to \"go east\", when what they really mean is \"over an obstacle course to the left, dodging total pricks and assholes that give no info at all. and then left some more, then climb up the buildings untill you reach a door that may have been locked\".\n\nEach part of the world, including gem dungeons, has its own feel and biome and NPC'S have interesting, if repetitive, dialogue. The game has no map, but the split up \"regions\" and town based mission hints in the game make navagation a breeze. Some imps are even helpful or toss out hints for you and ye doomed ass. And best of all its not a retarded fighter where ALL PUNCHES are blocked by pressing up and nearly ALL KICKS are blocked by pushing down. its actually good! \n\nI do wish you could interact with more things, more tools and power ups that reward players for exploring and MAYBE open up the game ORGANICLY and maybe quest for purification OR genocide of the realms... but still... If you like exploration as well as tense walljump platformers, then i highly recamend! If you are triggered by demonic imagery, or have had quite enough of the wall based platform action lately then give it a pass", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1478699992, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1478699992, "recommendationid": "26503355", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1426524151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 119, "steamid": "76561198151130317", "num_games_owned": 535}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An Imp?
