I have played it a lot more on my nvidia account on my shield portable controller and for whatever reason it doesn't carry over my playtime and achievements onto steam when I play on the controller. But I have played the first five levels or so sooo many times trying to get everything done as far as challenges. The way this game rewards you is amazing. I really do love it. I love the introduction to the game, no menu you're just fightig away from the beginning upon first load. I think that's much more immersive and wish more games did that. It makes me care more about the story. I didn't remember that on my controller. I must not have noticed. But this game rocks, it's definitely a great introduction to shoot 'em ups because it's not the most difficult, but some of the later stages can be more challenging. I like to play with a controller, but keyboard and mouse is also extremely satisfying and the layout is pretty standard of the genre. I actually paid attention to the story.. Some probably won't, but I found it more interesting than other sh'mups. Truly a classic, and I will put some time into it on PC now too. I saw something about the game being from 2004? That surprised me because it looked much more modern to me. Games like these seem to get sweeter with age, if they have the right dev team.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505479913, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505479913, "recommendationid": "34971015", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507142051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 575, "steamid": "76561198100514748", "num_games_owned": 41}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The combination between good old retro games with today's graphic, wow enjoyed every moment to play co-op with my brother on pc, I wish we could see more and new games like this !
