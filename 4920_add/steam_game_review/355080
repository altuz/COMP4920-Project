Keep reading for more detailed reasons why this game has failed, even at it's low price point.\n\nFirst off, I should mention that this is a sequel to Crazy Steam Bros. which you can find and play for free over on Kongregate.   It's a simple yet fun horizontal shoot'em up, or shmup, that has a number of interesting weapons and enemies to keep fans of the genre occupied.  It's not quite like your typical bullet hell shooter, but the games style is what sets it apart from the pack.  I enjoyed the original, although us players were stuck using just the keyboard and there were very few additional options to choose from or adjust in game.  \n\nCrazy Steam Bros. 2 feels a bit like the original and looks slightly sharper.  In fact, the graphics are quite charming given the era that the game is supposed to take place in.  The visuals won't blow you away but they work quite well for the theme of the game.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend Crazy Steam Bros 2 because of how it controls.  It says on the steam store page that Crazy Steam Bros 2 includes full controller support, and although I could get my wired Xbox 360 controller to work, it felt quite wonky and my plain \"floated\" all over even after I had let go of the analog stick or the D-pad.  Shooters need to be smooth and precise, and while the Keyboard controls work better than the controller, I can't recommend the game considering how unintuitive the controls feel while playing with a gamepad.\n\nIt's very obvious that this is a game that could be played on a tablet or mobile device (there's even an option that allows you to hide or show touchscreen controls while you play - although I can't see why anyone would want to play this using touch screen controls even if you do own a smart monitor!).  Even mouse input would have been a nice option, but the controls really do need to be more precise.  I'm sad to say that It almost feels like a rushed port, which it very well might be.  I really wanted to like Crazy Steam Bros 2 especially since I found the original to be novel idea with some entertaining gameplay, even though it was free and the game wasn't very long.   The sequel unfortunately doesn't provide enough options, or precision in its control schemes that should be found in any and all good Shmups.\n\nCrazy Steam Bros 2 isn't a bad game, it just controls badly, and until these rudimentary features are fixed, it isn't worth your money, not even at the low price it's selling for.  It should also be mentioned that there are no Steam Leaderboards either, even though it is listed as a feature on the Steam store page.\n\nBe patient and wait to see if the game is updated anytime soon.

This game has so many fundamental problems with it, it doesn't deserve your time. I try to match people to the game and the genre type, and go with its strengths, but there is no match here.

Bosses looks great.\nAnd the gameplay have some interesting features (limited Pup usage, downgrading score when hit etc) Difficulty is hight but not impossible. \nbomb usage is nice.
