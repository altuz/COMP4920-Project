Im not sure if this is intended or a bug.\n\nWhy when i get to Lvl 5-1 the game bugs? and then i reload and i lost experience ? all my Characters have lost at least 1 level ? i only noticed since the skills were no longer available, upon further inspection i lost 3 levels?....Im at the point where i do not think im going to finish this game and will not be able to give a proper review.\n (END NEW)\n\nOn the plus side the DEV's are actually working on updates pretty fast about it too actualy, since the game only released a few days ago and they have already fixed the mouse issue. so for that i thank you.\n\nIf you liked FF Tactics this might not be a good comparisson for you, Think more hero quest or shinning force without the cutscene attacks.
