The people have been captured by some bad guy who stole all the relics.   Jump, roll, and use weapon are your abilities.  \n\nWhen you find a relic you have to take it to a pedestal and it opens up new areas, but there's no way to tell which relic is supposed to go on which pedestal so there's lots of backtracking and trial and error.  The gems and coins you collect don't seem to do anything, just add to your score.  You lose them when you die but other than that there's no penalty for dying, you can restart your progress in the same room.  The good things is you don't lose any keys or special items when you die.\n\nThe enemies always reappear in the same room even if you've killed them, so watch out.  There are simple puzzles such as switches that need to be hit.  Early on the enemies will die with one hit but later on they take more hits to die.  There are mummies, spiders, bats, and other such creatures.  You can't kill anything underwater so just avoid the jellyfish.\n\nThere's no life meter--you die if hit once.  But thankfully there is no fall damage, you can fall at any height.\n\nI've been playing for 2 hours and it says I'm 40% of the way through, so the game is probably pretty short, unless the later areas are tougher.\n\nGraphics are cute, cartoon, pixel style.  Very colorful.\n\nSound effects are okay, but I didn't hear any background music except for the opening screen.\n\nI like this game so far.  It's fairly easy, and I find it fun to collect the gems and coins.  People who like more difficult metroidvania games will probably be bored.\n\nUPDATE:  I spoke too soon about it being a short game.  I'm another hour or two in and only 49% now.

The basic controls are responsive and there are plenty of areas to explore, so it's an enjoyable game overall. If you're a fan of shorter, simpler games, this is an easy recommendation.\n\nHowever, if you have a lot of experience with other metroidvania titles, you'll notice many things this game lacks. There are no boss fights, you have no health bar (and thus there are no health upgrades to collect), and the only combat upgrade you get is a gun with extremely limited ammo. Upgrades feel more like keys, getting you past a few doors without really changing anything like if you got a double jump or a new weapon instead.\n\nThe map does show you where important items are (which is better than a lot of mediocre metroidvanias), but it doesn't show one of the main collectibles, so it's only of use for reaching the end of the game and not for completionist item hunting. Completionists may also be annoyed at the score mechanic - your score increases when you collect gems and coins, but when you die it resets to 0 and they all respawn. It feels out of place in a more exploration based game like this.\n\nIf all you want is a simple exploration game with light platforming, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you're looking for a deeper metroidvania experience with more completionist item hunting, you may be disappointed. I'd still recommend it on sale, though, as the basic gameplay is solid enough to be fun even though it's lacking more depth.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429561585, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429561585, "recommendationid": "15468385", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529330", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430665631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 294, "steamid": "76561198042628923", "num_games_owned": 932}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a fun, relaxing, exploration-based game.

I could probably spend another hour or two getting all the symbols. Some of them looked like a decent challenge.\n\nYou pick up gems and coins along the way to increase your score. When you die, your score goes back to 0 and all the gems you picked up return to their position to be picked up again. I thought this was a was a bit odd. I guess the goal is to try for the highest score you can get without dying. It tracks and displays your highest score so far, but ultimately, the score means nothing.

Look no further. This is a pleasurable little breath from the past, so to say. The graphics are well done. The sound department is too, if not a bit repetitive. The game feels responsive and I didn't experience any serious hiccups. I had some trouble mapping my gamepad to use the d-pad though (not sure it can be done), but the analogue stick worked well enough. Plenty of secrets to find, and items to collect. There are a variety of different tools you unlock underway. The user interface is obviously made for mobile play, but it wasn't any hindrance. All in all a thumbs up from me.
