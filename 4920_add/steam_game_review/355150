The main menu feels broken and not even in an alpha stage of completion. No controller was detected or working. Keyboard controls seemed a little cryptic. WASD seemed to steer the tile. Gameplay not compelling. Did not notice much of any audio. Whole thing feels like someone finished a unity tutorial not a game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501733099, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501733099, "recommendationid": "33984832", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492208", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446733997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 44, "steamid": "76561198178576563", "num_games_owned": 24}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Controlling a rolling square is so frustrating.
