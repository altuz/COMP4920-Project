It's still in early-access despite it's 2015 release, but has no micro-transactions of any kind and the game is free so it's safe to assume the developers are running out of pocket, so it's understandable.\n\nMy experience with CodenameCURE was enjoyable, to put it simply:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-Codename CURE plays similiarly to games like [i]Left 4 Dead, Killing Floor, and No more room in Hell.[/i] The controls and mechanics are tight so it's not like you're going to be bitching about how bullshit it is to try and punch zombies.  \n\n-The game itself is fun in it's simplistic right, which is more or less an aquired taste in games. \n\n-The game's mechanics are simple, but still take a little time to understand which offers challenge to people who are interested in playing for more than 3 or 4 hours, and applying said mechanics offers a satisfying result when executed right.\n\n-The classes available are not super unique, but aren't exactly generic. Classes are applied differently and offer benefits to teams depending on which class you play, some more than the rest. \n\n-There is another game mode which is simply survival, although it gets mixed up with the challenge of starting out with just a pistol, having to work your way through hordes of zombies just to get a better pistol or sometimes a REAL gun. \n\n-It's also a fun game to play with friends, especially if you're all new to it. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow there's without a doubt flaws in this game, but these flaws can affect the experience for just about anybody\nwilling to play. [u]This doesn't exactly make this game bad, but it does hinder what progress it can have into getting \nthe spotlight, having a larger playerbase, and becoming a much more unique experience overall.[/u] \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-Codename CURE unfortunately falls below the standards of zombie survival games due the depravation of content. \nThere are few maps and game modes to choose from and gameplay itself is linear. You start, run and gun, complete objective, run and gun, complete objective, run and gun some more, and then get the hell out of there. Now maps can vary on what type objective there is, but it still is very linear.\n\n-The community is small, [b]like really small[/b]. It's hard to find players since there isn't a direct match making mode available and it's a gamble when finding people. They can be griefers or complete idiots, some people being eliteists. It's best played with  friends.\n\n-Difficulty spikes are common and can prove to much of a challenge to new players. One moment you can be fine, running and gunning with you team and the next you can be cut off by a horde of zombies ready to run a train on you, so  unless you're playing Frontman or Assault you're not getting out alive. It also doesn't help when zombie spawns are so close and normally come from all your blindsides, forcing you to memorize spawns through the map so you don't get caught and mutilated. \n\n-The mechanics in Codename CURE are simple which can be beneficial to players and the game itself, but there are few \nchallenging mechanics to become adept in and once you do it becomes lather and rinse rather than being dynamic mechanics that are fun to use. Not to mention they can be abused. For example, players can block off hordes using support creates and protect sentries using support crates, which defeats the purpose of sentries being a line of defense that needs to be used sparingly due to the damage they can take.\n\n-Variation in the enemies of the game are pretty much a snooze fest. You have two zombies, regular fast ones that are designed to swing fast, slow you down, and die quick. Then there are the Military zombies, beefed up zombies that have resistances to melee and bullets along with being able to kill you in 3-4 hits (or take out all the armor you have) but move at the pace of slugs on crack.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI reccomend Codename CURE for a little playthrough, but it's your choice to keep playing since I'm going to outright say [u]this game needs a lot of work done[/u] before it can be an experience to something like No More Room in Hell or Left 4 Dead.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485453939, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1485453939, "recommendationid": "29506281", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449231", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488525054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 36, "steamid": "76561198344363523", "num_games_owned": 5}, "votes_funny": 138, "votes_up": 54, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Looked up gay dolphin porn, this came up.

For fair comparison, let's compare them.\n\nBrainbread 2 (beta) \nCodename CURE (Beta)\nNo More Room in Hell (beta)\nZombie Panic! Source\n\nKeep that in mind, Codename CURE is one of FOUR free to play source engine games revolving around one simple concept: Survive against hordes of zombies. \n\nIn no shape or form does Codename CURE compare to it's competition. The population is already worse than what you'll find in 2 of the 4 in that small list, with the only game worse than CURE being Brainbread 2. The only reason that brainbread 2 is worse than CURE is because CURE actually functions with relative difficulty to it, it's very hard to win if you don't know how to use your guns. \n\nHowever when it comes to difficulty it's repetitive and boring, there are limited maps and even more limited servers because of how few people still play. The gameplay is repetitive and unimagineative, essentially the old school \"zombie escape\" game modes we used to play as kids as far back as Counter Strike 1.6. In comparison, Zombie Panic! Source and No More Room in Hell have a far more active player base and as a whole are a better game, with more development from the community as well as the game devs. Features are tweaked and added, and the community has offered a wealth of custom content ranging from textures to maps and even new game modes. \n\nMy summary is that Codename CURE is neither original nor provides enough content to make it refreshing or worthwhile to spend time one when in comparison there are free to play Zombie Source shooters with an exponentially larger amount of content and replayability. \n\nNot recommended. Play NMRiH, Zombie Panic! Or save your money and get l4d2, CS:S, CS:GO, Garry's Mod, etc if you're really wanting a lasting, entertaining experience.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485053847, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1485053847, "recommendationid": "29412539", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501113", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503499521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 208, "steamid": "76561198256016525", "num_games_owned": 30}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I know its in early access, but as of now, its Half-Life 2, but multiplayer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nit's perfect.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488324408, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1488324408, "recommendationid": "30250329", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504294", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467232511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1222, "steamid": "76561198264585443", "num_games_owned": 163}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "7", "review": "WHAT A GOD GAME ! :o", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486746779, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1486746779, "recommendationid": "29828188", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507044", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492636743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 652, "steamid": "76561198165454286", "num_games_owned": 30}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "its good game\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487015258, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1487015258, "recommendationid": "29907761", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506638660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 72, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1719, "steamid": "76561198200353850", "num_games_owned": 9}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Its a simple zombie shooter with good classes, fun maps, and a ton of cool mods and game modes.  8/10 could use better recoil control on guns and more responsive hitboxes/ai", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488143752, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1488143752, "recommendationid": "30206454", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502050", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486157866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 197, "steamid": "76561198289574801", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty good game I thought it would be bad when I first got it but I started playing it and its really good you should get it if you want a free zombie game.
