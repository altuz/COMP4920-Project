It's primary focus does seem to be multiplayer, and goes for a bit more of the pure old school Descent feeling, avoiding Descent: Underground's different ship classes and progression mechanics. Everybody starts with the same stuff - at the moment you even start with every single weapon on-board from the get go, though I wouldn't be surprised if that changes down the line. The multiplayer really hasn't caught on as of the time of this writing though, and you're unlikely to find any other players unless it's during a developer hosted event. The times I've managed to find matches, it's been running well, though currently the weapon feedback leaves a lot to be desired. Projectiles kinda just vanish when they hit something, leaving very little indication of if you're doing any damage or not.\n\nThe game also has a singleplayer component called patrols, which is fairly basic though a decent diversion and a way to test out your settings, these missions mainly consist of narrow corridors punctuated with mini-boss arenas and color coded keys, not really offering any of the intricate and vast tunnel networks of the original Descent nor Overload.\nThe environments in general are pretty drab looking, mostly just consisting of metallic surfaces with occasional machinery, colored lightning and the odd rock surface every now and then. The visual sameness sometimes makes it hard to make out enemy robots from the backgrounds. I think a little visual variety could go a long way in making this game stick out a bit more, though I wouldn't expect it to ever quite get the polished look of D:U nor Overload considering their respective budgets.\n\nThere's a pretty good soundtrack in there too. Nothing particularly revolutionary, mostly going for the same kind of vaguely Front Line Assembly or Skinny Puppy sounding tunes that you'd find in the Descent series.\n\nAll in all, with the two big competitors in mind it's hard to recommend this, especially in this early access state, to anybody but the biggest fans of 6DOF shooters, but there is a pretty good foundation in here, however in need of more refinement, especially on the visual side in terms of environment variety and shading. I'm still giving it a thumbs up, but I'd recommend you check in on it's development over time before making up your mind.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497311028, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1497311028, "recommendationid": "32376886", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514545", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504196745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 74, "steamid": "76561197973207635", "num_games_owned": 253}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "After playing for a bit, I can see something greater that can possibly come from this beginning. The graphics themselves aren't terrible, but overall the graphics need a bit of polishing (especially the copious amounts of dense fog that kills the vision beyond a logical point. Definitely need to add individual options for that PLEASE!!!), and the robots look too... what word can I use? Not boring, but maybe a bit unimaginative, and limited? (Not all robots need gun-arms. Tubbs punched the shit out of you in Descent 3, and in the first 2, you had swingarms. Maybe add Katana or Bore-like robot with speed for close combat?) Obviously the AI isn't set in stone, and the spawnpoints need to have a controlled algorithm so they stop spawning at a certain amount of bots, or this just becomes an arcade game about points instead of actual substance. I like the weapon graphics though. They seem a bit.. 2D maybe? Probably could benefit from enemies using a variant of the same thing that the Fury has. Different color/damage/strengths. The controls feel VERY descent-like, the keyboard ramping might want to be an option for giving remove/reduce so the ship moves with proper key presses and reaction time. The mouse seems a bit draggy as well, but not horribly. I don't know how many people are working on this project, but it deserves some attention, and maybe some help to move it along. I think with a bit of story and some help, this game could definitely attact a new generation of 6DoF pilots. It does have strong competition with Descent: Underground, and Overload, though, which are being worked on with groups of people from the Descent and of-the-like industry, and I'm sure a larger budget. If you want to grab a cool little blast em up game that you can share with your friends, its worth grabbing, especially on sale. Scoffing at a work of art, or a sculpture before its finished is ignorance. Keep working, and I'll keep watching.
