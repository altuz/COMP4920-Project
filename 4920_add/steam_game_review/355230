But once I tried switching into 1st person perspective (X button on Xbox controller) it was immediately clear that I simply needed to invert pitch in my controller settings, and I've been hooked ever since.\n\nThe Hover Jets are much easier to get the hang of and the ring attack matches are lots of fun. I've spent the most time on the Jump Seat levels though, because they're quite a bit more challenging and also pretty addictive.\n\nI enjoy the music and retro graphics, and am looking forward to more environments/tracks and hopefully multiplayer in future updates.\n\nI experienced a bit of VR sickness when I was attempting to play in 3rd person mode (my jet, and thus the camera was constantly tumbling), but when I switch to 1st person things are much better. Still get little gusts of it when my jump seat takes a tumble or when I'm turning on two vectors at once- but it's manageable.\n\nThis is indeed an early access game and it's not entirely polished or glitch free (some inaccurate in-game text, some misplaced foliage in levels, game crashes or hangs if you take of your rift while it's paused), but the overall gameplay is pretty solid.\n\nI've seen some folks wishing for a non-VR version of this game, but I'm here to tell you: You wanna play it in VR. Once you try a seamless flight experience like this in a Rift or Vive, you won't wanna go back to flat-screen gaming.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1476142993, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1476142993, "recommendationid": "25974618", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515928", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497841409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 231, "steamid": "76561197991154975", "num_games_owned": 114}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Man this game is great easily one of the best vr experiencces so far, it really makes you feel like your flying around and you feel your body instinctively turning to follow the plane but its still in alpha so not that much content yet, i feel like it could blow up with some multiplayer!!!!\n\nFor the price why would you not get it?!?!?!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1475807068, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1475807068, "recommendationid": "25895371", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504336", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504936514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 853, "steamid": "76561197969452738", "num_games_owned": 242}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is an under-appreciated gem for VR! I just finished experiencing all of the ring attack and target practice levels that come with the 12.30.2016 Early-Access version as well as the free-flight canyon level.\n\nWOW! This game is really fun. Flying around in the jet is feels great! Controls are solid, arcadey, reminds me of Descent or Rogue Squadron, but your in the game, feeling like Will Smith flying down narrow canyons in an alien spaceship from ID4. Each 'ring' you go through increases your speed and the level design forces you to roll your ship, often upside-down, in-between trees/cayons/etc in order to make it through the next ring without slowing down. It is quite exhilirating to say the least!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/E5Ztyy21PJQ\n\nThe Jump Seat feels a bit more like a floaty Pilotwings helicopter or a big drone. This mode was quite enjoyable in a different way. More of a puzzle game, timing the landing and making sure your lander is level when it touches down. Limited fuel in this mode keeps the tension high. Though I never ran out, I almost did a few times, and you lose points for using fuel so perfecting your 100-point landings might lose you points if you spend a lot of fuel on course corrections.\n\nThe three game modes are enjoyable and the courses are long and well designed. I still have two free-flight courses to check out and I have already gotten almost 10 hours of gameplay out of this. (Free-flight sets you free to roam and collect a series of orbs, pretty relaxing!) \n\nThe global leaderboard is nice, makes it feel like this game is sitting in some virtual arcade and only a few people have access to it, coincidentally probably the same amount of people who had access to my local arcade in the 90's. I challange you all to beat my many high scores!\n\nWith more modes/multiplayer/new vehicle coming soon, this is an absolute steal at the current price of $6.99. I wouldn't be surprised if the prices goes up later after early access. There is pretty much no reason not to get this game if you are at all interested. You don't have to get out of your chair, I can actually play this game right at my computer even though I am a few feet outside the Vive play-space. Probably works on your favorite gamepad. Well done developers, well done!\n\nI can't wait to try dodging live networked players as well as the terrain, I'm predicting a bright future for this title!\n\nG-Dub", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1483270698, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1483881013, "recommendationid": "28899451", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495657180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 185, "steamid": "76561198039742992", "num_games_owned": 358}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's one of the most fun games for VR.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1475782603, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1475782603, "recommendationid": "25890612", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499942", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491343551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 46, "steamid": "76561198100261999", "num_games_owned": 151}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Simple, but relatively cheap and awesome game in VR.
