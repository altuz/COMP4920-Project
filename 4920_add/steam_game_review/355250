Still far from 100% completion though. Pretty hefty dose of gameplay time for a game so old and simple.\n\nThe story fits to the Star Wars - universe perfectly and gives the Empires point of view of the different events and situation leading to the Battle of Endor. For a simulation game it sure does have a nice and deep enough story with plot twists and all: so deep that I wish I could extend my gameplay onwards and rewrite the history for the Empire...\n\nI finished the Special Edition of the game. I also tested the other formats and all worked fine on my computer (Win 7).\nThe game had few bugs of ingame script freezes, which went away once I changed the difficulty on that particular mission. I'm pretty sure they were there all along and not because of the Steam-port.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501359168, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501359168, "recommendationid": "33889155", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508795", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500185494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6420, "steamid": "76561198215501084", "num_games_owned": 30}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An absolute wonder to play.
