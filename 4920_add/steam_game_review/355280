Like another reviewer said, this might be a good puzzle to play around with while watching Netflix or something. \nMy only complaint is the grind involved with progessing through each stage. You need mana to unlock puzzles and if you run out you have to do a timed challenge to get more, and the yield isn't even very. I'd feel more motivated to finish the game if mana wasn't required for the story mode puzzes.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493872329, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493872329, "recommendationid": "31535608", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503554", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
