So there's not really much of a \"game\" just a clear cut reflex quick-twitch reaction tester. It really hurts to say all this because well damn is it fun to sprint around and ninja kick your way across the screen and roll through a hazard bot holding down a button to charge up your power, while sliding up a wall to fire multiple homing missles at a bunch of training bots and jumping through another obstacle. SOOOOOOO the Adrenaline is great in here man. Unfortantely it's much like a trip to the bearded clam as after they hype there just isn't anywhere fun to go with all of this excitment. There are a very limited set of enemies that behave in a very defined pattern and while the soundtrack and unlockable content is a nice touch there's just not enough incentive to keep me interested. No dynamic enemies demanding my Ninja Skills attention or story elements giving me some loose sense of direction to cling too. The Environments themselves are exactly what you see above and that's it...the whole game's backdrop has already been painted and displayed to you at the top of the Store Page.\n\nI understand this game was a failed kickstarter and that may be the reason Blood Alloy is what it is today. It seems like they did it up making a tight physics engine and put a ton of effort into a demo. Unfortunately it looks like they may have than ran out of money to make an actual game. If this is in fact what happened I'll note this as the first time I've actually regretted not donating money to help this thing happen. This is a shell fo a game that is going to be great it's just that now it doesn't look like it will ever get going.\n\nReally though this game ENGINE is superb and if it were sitting inside of an audi or bmw frame this would be a must have...instead it's just jammed inside of an old-school VW Van and I'm too old for cross country road trips. This game was an amazing start maybe someone else will grab the baton and run with it. Here's hoping....\n\nNo idea how to rate this really. I enjoyed it for exactly 20 Minutes and realized where the title was going (nowhere) and was bored stupid after another 20.....but that ninja, slash, dash, sword thrust hijanx though....\n\n4/10???\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457469526, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457469526, "recommendationid": "21715557", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518919", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466121917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561197981691323", "num_games_owned": 238}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The New Hotness.\nI've had my eye on Blood Alloy for sometime. I've never passed on the opportunity to play it at PAX East or BostonFIG, and now I am happy to say the final product lives up to expectations. The initial tutorial is a little rough, but once the camera pulls back and the gloves come off, the game does not disappoint. You'll be dashing, slashing, running, and gunning your way through waves of enemies, with nearly reckless abandon, all while enjoying the grooves of a killer soundtrack. It's not a game that demands a lot from you and you'll be unlocking new items, levels, and music every couple rounds.\n\nNow for the main reason why I'm posting this review: justification of cost. At $12.99, no, it's not the cheapest game ever made. It's also not the most expensive one, and I can say on good authority that the developer, Suppressive Fire, has been busting their butts for YEARS to get this game out. The results speak for themselves. It's smooth, fast, and most importantly, so far for me at least, stable. People have paid much more for games on Day 1 that can't even connect to their own servers. Blood Alloy offers a solid chunk of content with really fun gameplay for a fair price without ANY online requirements. For a game to be stable on Day 1 in 2016 shouldn't be such a shock, but it honestly is.\n\nThe game seems to be set up in such a way that if enough gamers support it, more content will follow. You may think that means waiting it out, but it's a catch 22: they can't make content unless you support it, but you don't want to support it unless they make more content. To that I say, give me a break. There's no Season Pass, there's just the game, and this is a game and a developer worth supporting. Watch this game can ramp up over time and become unstoppable. Like I said, it's a solid chunk of content built on a very solid foundation.\n\nI would say this seems like an excellent game for streaming. With rounds being (for me at least) under 5 minutes long, and a consistent reward loop, this has the makings of a great game not only for communities to enjoy, but potentially even for competitions.\n\nIf I had any feedback, it would be that the mouse is very sensitive and is currently unresponsive in the menu; the vertical dash section of the tutorial is pretty punishing; and the menu UI could use a bit more polish and some more options like max camera distance and screenshake level, but these are HARDLY killer criticisms and the kind of stuff that can be taken care of in a patch or two. The game itself is great. G-R-E-A-T great.

If you're really curious, buy it like me and then refund it after your 1hr of fun because you will struggle to get past more than that. Steam is cluttered with more than enough of these amateur, cash grabbing, trainwreck games but at the very least, this one had a spark of ingenuity.\n\nThis game came out after a failed kickstarter for it described it as a Metroidvania:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/63518568/blood-alloy?ref=nav_search\n\nThe developer admitted to being able to work on it \"for a decade and make it slowly\" but nope, gotta capitalize on that failure of a kickstarter and push out a game that clearly is lacking in so many ways. \n\nThis guy worked for 5 years on QA for Harmonix (lol what QA) and then had 9 months in a design position. \n\nGood lord there is so much wrong with the design of the game. Why have intricate movement but provide nothing beyond 3 small sandboxes to utilize it? Why is a 2d game made in Unity, a primarily 3d engine? Why does the camera ever zoom in given that it's an action game? Why does the camera stick in weird and inconsistent manners? Why is the mouse in an action platformer feel so floaty on default and absolutely breaks in the alternate input mode? Why are there no rebindable keys in an action game? Why do all the enemies have color palletes that blend in with the industrial background? Why is there a wave slash mechanic that is never mentioned in the tutorial?\n\nWhy does the main character's backstory feel like some DeviantArt oc?\n\nWhy does the UI look like it was done in paint?\n\nWhy is the scoring system, the game's one source of replayability that isn't contrived, just 2 multipliers with expiration bars? You'd think a bit more thought would go into it such as slowing the bars when moving at speed or tracking net DPS or allowing faster energy regen on higher multipliers or literally any other tacked on addition to make it at least somewhat rewarding.\n\nWhy was this game ever released for 12 USD when I feel like I got ripped off for paying 6?\n\n\n\"But what about the gameplay depth\" you ask? It's so barebones that I've exhausted my interest in the hour I spent. In essense, the energy meter is tied to your dashing and melee. Melee can be used to halt momentum and also move in a limited direction even in the air. You can also cancel out of a sheathing animation by shooting your primary fire but NOT by dashing.\n\nBasically, the game is conserving your meter and using your dash attacks to clear the hordes(homing missiles and wave slash). There is a dodge mechanic in there but it lingers simply far too long and offers so little control that the I-frames are not worth the loss in mobility. I can consistently hit 8k score and the other options of slightly different pistols and slightly adjusted stats do not look appealing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1476333340, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1476333340, "recommendationid": "26007804", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497987", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456968263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561198067489753", "num_games_owned": 211}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fast paced, skill based and a ton of fun.
