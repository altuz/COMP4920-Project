This is incredible at giving you something to do besides traversing the cavern, and given this game somewhat challenging puzzles is very good at giving the player something to work towards. The mechanics traversing the dungeon are interesting, using different tools to complete quests and the cavern puzzles. As the game progresses, you get more attached to various townspeople and gradually become more upset as they pass away. Many bugs and questionable design choices riddle the game however, with some ruining the effect the game is going for, replacing the feeling of sadness and dread the game is going for with annoyance and frustration. \n\n\nBugs I've Found\n-Some layering glitches\n-Pillar requiring for a puzzle fell down a hole and the \"reset puzzle\" neither returned me to entrance nor returned the pillar back to where it should be.\n-When I purposely fell down said hole it took me to the front of a rope contrasting to the entrance of the cave when I fell down on accident\n-Townspeople needing to be talked to that die lock down the quest making it incompletable \n\nQuestionable design choices\n-Unnecessary showing off of game mechanics\nVidar strokes its own d*ck a bit too much in the aspect of being an RPG Maker game that has things like digging and lanterns and tends to put meaningless lanterns or dirt piles in places.\n-Travel time between locations of the caverns, \nVidar has a 10 minute time limit to explore the cave before you are forced to retire for the night. While I enjoy the 10 minute time limit, the travel time cuts down the time to explore the cave, and given you have to walk to an exit, the time cut from your 10 minute limit is usually 15-30 seconds more cut time than whatever the travel cost is.\n-Random strings of luck fucking you over\nDid someone a questgiver know and love die? Well you can't get the next part of the quest from them and if they die the next day the time you spent on a quest is essentially wasted. Messes with yout feelings, but in more of the \"rearranged my bedroom\" than the \"cat died\" kind, since feeling sorry for the townsperson losing a friend is now replaced with annoyance that you have to wait another day to complete the quest, and if that person dies then whatever upset feelings the player is intended to have is replaced my feelings of frustration.\n-If a townsperson requiring to be talked to in a quest dies, than the quest is locked down\nI feel like this borders between also being a bug, but many quests in this game revolve around talking to seperate people and reporting to the questgiver, HOWEVER if someone needing to be talked to dies the quest is locked down and unable to be completed. Even if all aspects are completed BUT \"talk to this guy\" and that guy dies than game important quests are locked down.\n\nLuckily, Vidar is lock proof as the player is fully aware of the fact that everyone is going to die, so quests being unable to be completed are only frustrated rather than game ending.\n\nVidar is a good game, thought it is plagued by questionable design choices and frequent minor locks.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501475082, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501475082, "recommendationid": "33920093", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
