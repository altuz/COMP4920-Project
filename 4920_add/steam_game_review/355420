It certainly adds a deeper level of strategy to the game and it keeps you on your toes.  The graphics, music, and general themex are reminiscent of Final Fantasy Tactics, although there are no \"magic\" elements like wizards.  (at least so far)  It is also slightly reminiscent of SNES or DS games.\n\nUnfortunately the campaign is only about 3 hours long. And the \"Challenge Editor\" which allows you to design skirmish fights still needs work and, at least to me, wasn't that appealing.\n\nI think Flamberge has a lot of potential, and I am certainly open to changing the review after some major updates, but with the amount of content the game has to offer I can't recommend it for the price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503018686, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503018686, "recommendationid": "34318484", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520735", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 30, "total_reviews": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
