There's a lot of cool mechanics, especially the \"plasma\" mechanic, where your only weapon harms you as well as the enemy, and can impede progress if you spray it around too much. \n\nUnfortunately, this game just isn't that fun. Most of the first \"level\" is spent traversing the same corridors again and again until a dollsteak appears, at which point you grab it and continue. There's a \"story\" but it's given to you in multiple sentences at a time while you're playing. The screen is cluttered and view distance is incredibly short. Every item appears to be randomly placed, and after three tries I finally gathered 10 dollsteak. I was then supposed to escape the ship while my heat lowered and my health drained. A gate impeded my progress and I was killed because the only keys that generated were too far away from the gate to keep it open long enough.\n\nPros:\n+Great Soundtrack\n+Mechanic potential\n+Interesting art\n\nCons:\n-Cluttered\n-Poorly executed\n-Prone to lag spikes\n-Repetitive", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427473832, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427473921, "recommendationid": "15077171", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600970", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427474772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198001077704", "num_games_owned": 1196}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 55, "comment_count": "7", "review": "The game makes no sense.

Once you have that all, you can sell them to this \"inter-dimensional trading post,\" and repeat until you find your sister lost in the slave trade. Overall, the game is pretty good, but you need to be able to dedicate yourself to finding the bits and pieces of the story if you want to understand the game.\n\nIf you didn't know already, any game made by Rail Slave is gonna be weird. And you need to be ready for that if you're buying one of the games. The graphics are trippy, the stories are strange and confusing, and that's not for everyone, which is okay, but you need to know that beforehand, or else you're in for a bad time.\n\nThe graphics are alright. The game is pixelated, which doesn't display too much detail, but that's alright because the whole design looks nice enough. The music is good, fitting the game well, and many other people enjoy it a lot, so nothing to complain about there. The gameplay is fun enough, with a need to keep moving while finding the dollsteak that appears throughout the map while avoiding or fighting your enemies, which also appear throughout the map.\n\nThe story is a main part of the game, which you might not be able to pick up. The story really can only be found in the many thoughts and ramblings of your protagonist that appear on the bottom part of the screen. Of course, Rail Slave Games can't just lay out the story for you, that would make too much sense.\n\nIn the end, you need to be prepared to play something different, although this game has much more playability than the games before.

IF YOU CAN DO BETTER, POST IN GAME DISCUSSIONS UNDER [u][url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/355430/discussions/0/611702631237897651/]HIGH SCORE TABLE[/url][/u].) \n\n[i]Snowflake Tattoo[/i] is a tough-as-nails neoretro in which you simultaneously pilot two lost souls:  a part-human, part-motorbike cyborg whose luminescence cuts through the frosty dark, and a floating mercenary with a sentient plasma rifle who has cast herself into an ever-deepening spiral of casual evil in the name of sisterly love.  Though [i]Snowflake[/i] isn't as much an adventure as an arcade experience in the vein of white-knuckle classics like [i]Berzerk[/i] and [i]Venture[/i] (albeit far more pulastingly organic), the framing narrative will resonate powerfully with any player who ever loved the synaesthetic dream voyages of Philip K. D:ck.  This story, addressed briefly in the intro and then in snatches of rainbow text during gameplay, intrigued me to the point of distraction when I began; it actually took me nearly half an hour to stop dreaming and start playing this weird, well-designed game in earnest. \n\nThe primary gamescape is an orbital freezer-ship:  an expanse of shadowed corridors, monstrous snowflakes and bloodthirsty security bots, all limned in the prismatic frizzle that is [b][i]glitch punk[/i][/b].  You control Ultra Violet, the glowing CyBike, with WASD, as she picks up cryogenically frozen women (dollsteak) and organic goop (salvage) that can be used at the inter-level store.  Unfortunately, Ultra Violet has absolutely no weapons, so when the cold shadows slide away from her light to reveal a roving turret, things can get nasty.  That's where the mercenary comes in!  She will remain hovering in the lofty foreground for as long for as Ultra Violet is moving, and while she's there, you can control the crosshairs of her sentient plasma rifle with the mouse.  With this curious weapon, you can lay down strings and wads of writhing fireballs -- and since the intelligent plasma may shift but never disappears, you can also lay traps for foes that aggressively pursue Ultra Violet.  Watch out, though!  The live fire can also dole out serious hurt to the pacifistic motorgirl if she rolls into it.\n\nOnce you have nabbed 10 dollsteaks, a dimensional portal opens to the Abstraction (a realm of inhuman beings who want the frozen girls for unwholesomely vague reasons), the temperature of the ship drops even lower, and you begin to bleed heat; if you lose it all, you die -- and as our old pal Ocelot might say, [b]there are no continues, my friend![/b]  During this panicked cool-down, the enemies stop and the shadows flash madly as you urge Ultra Violet to that spot where the shadows fall into geometric correspondence with the Abstraction's polygon.  Once you have been safely teleported to the Abstraction, you may sell your girls, use your salvage to upgrade health or luck (chance of finding life-kits in the salvage) or craft ammo.  You also may keep your girls . . .  and risk losing them all in a punishing minigame as the Abstraction seeks (and more than likely manages) to steal them from the mercenary in her dreams!  Then it's back to snowy hell, where searcher and slayer must collect more of that precious, precious meat.  \n\nThis is a difficult game, doubly so for HD-texture kids and others not at home in our hallowed blocky halls of Retro.  To make it to the end requires sharp reflexes tempered with caution, as wild plasma-slinging will do you no good against the robo-infested darkness.  Actually, If you can even [i]reach[/i] the end-game screen, you are [b]most definitely[/b] a serious old-school gamer.  And if you can make it there with more than ten frosty babes in your pocket?  YOU ARE THE LAST STARFIGHTER.\n\nLike Rail Slave's other games, [i]Snowflake Tattoo[/i] is short -- but it makes up for that brevity with a high level of retro challenge, uncompromising [i][b]glitch punk[/b][/i] aesthetics and a shotgun blast of gonzo creativity straight to the face.  The crystalline beauty of the electronica that hovers in its aural spaces is also worthy of mention.  And a final point of interest:  this game ties into the story of the criminally underrated micro-epic [i]NPPD RUSH:  The Milk of Ultraviolet[/i].  [i]Snowflake[/i] is a prequel, actually, so you can infer some very interesting things about the nature of the duo's relationship in [i]NPPD[/i].   \n\nSo, will [u]you[/u] like [i]Snowflake[/i]?
