I managed to discover that scrolling on the track pad highlighted a different resolution to pick, but I couldnt actually select it.\nFinally i found that I was just off the games \"prefered\" standing position (which is marked on the floor) - finally I could get into the game.\n\nNow, other than a very short clip of the game with the first puzzle I hadnt watched any other videos about the game - dont want to spoil a puzzle game by seeing other people complete the puzzles and make the game a walk through.\n\nThe game loads and the first puzzle is solved within a few seconds and i went onto the next.. the game is quite dimly lit after the first puzzle, so there isnt much in the way of amazing views.\nThe second puzzle (no spoilers) was very obvious and again it was just a few seconds to solve.\nThe 3rd puzzle got me for the longest time out of all of the puzzles, but as soon as I saw 1 item it all fell into place and that was solved.\n4th Puzzle was solved within a few seconds once again\n\nI do hope they add more do this game as it does look good, but if you want to see what you get for your money at the moment (and see the puzzles solved), UploadVR has the entire game in 12 minutes on Youtube (which was uploaded over a year ago 12/Jan/2016). After the Youtube video ends, in the actual game it says \"to be continued\" and you get the credits.\n\nAt the moment this game feels like a Demo. I really do hope they add more at some point.\n\nMy total play time for this (including going through the teleportation tutorial) was 23 minutes - 5 minutes was before and game play + setting up broardcasting (twice, first time failed) so a friend could watch", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486728884, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486728999, "recommendationid": "29822178", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559751", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488072131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561198005344998", "num_games_owned": 237}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Way too short for the pricetag, also very frustrating mechanics.

On that day, it was basically unplayable due to a plethora of bugs. Those bugs have been fixed  and pushed to Steam. \n\nI will reiterate from my first comment that I had played part of a demo at GDC 2015 and eagerly waited for the final release. With the bugs fixed, I was able to get through this VERY short experience (about 10 minutes.) For some reason Steam continues to log time for every game I play, even after I quite, so don't look at my time played as anything of consequence.\n\nWhat Thunderbird has going for it are nice graphics, and what I hope will be a good series once it is completed. Is it worth the $6. That's a tough call. Unfortunately, this particular release is not much more than a glorious way to demonstrate VR for friends and family who want to dip into something for a very brief time. If the series grows (as the developers promise) then I can imagine that it will be a fulfilling puzzle game. Currently the puzzles are two easy, but that is okay if they progressively become more difficult. \n\nIt is hard to tell from this if there will be a story, or just a series of puzzles to solve. I am also not clear on the business/release model. Are we going to pay $6 for each installment? I don't know how many installments there will be, and I'd have to say that if it's going to be 4 releases totaling $24, then I question the value, unless there is something about it that blows my mind.\n\nThere are still a few bugs in the game, but not \"game breakers\" like on initial release. Some collision volumes are still active, when they shouldn't be, triggering a sound that should not be played. The developer should check all locations where objects are retrieved.\n\nIn general, the mechanics are pretty good, but some of them required too much precision, especially when placing objects. If you don't have it just right, it can fail. Sometimes needing the object respawned.\n\nRoom Scale or Standing? Apparently the problem with the original release was some sort of mixup between the two locomotion versions. The issue I have with room scale is that if your boundaries are close to the edge of the game's minimum Room Scale requirements, then you are often looking at Chaperone Lines. This breaks the immersion. I would allow teleporting in Room Scale.\n\nI think there is better value for your money elsewhere, however, I think with a few adjustments, this can be a nice thing to have around for a quick, easy to use demonstration, and that is worth $6 to me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486879698, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487138923, "recommendationid": "29865494", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487886661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 57, "steamid": "76561198030519086", "num_games_owned": 687}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Beautiful and worth a look if its on very cheap (don't forget most 2min arcade machines can cost ya a quid or two!) - but go into it knowing what it is, basically less of a game and more of an interactable experience.
