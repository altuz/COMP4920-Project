Many many things left to do. Don't purchase this game expecting a full game. However I will recommend because the work that has been done thus far is impressive. I'm excited to see more. I support this game and what the devs are trying to do. If your not a fan of netstorm or have never played it, you might be better off waiting for this game to mature a little before making the purchase.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492017096, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1492017096, "recommendationid": "31100784", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
