Well balanced battles (kinda. once you get Helga and learn how to abuse her dual wield, you're OP af), funny plot, ultimate bosses and weapons, and you can even be a detective at the end. The plot is the strong point of the game. I'm not into romance story but the writters (mostly females, i think) merged it well into the adventure.\n\nNow, cons: well. Not sure if I have any, a few minor bugs, and terrible cutscene arts. But that was expected considering the budget of the game. Would be awesome if they could hire a small artist than trying to sketch it out themselves, though.\n\nps: No it's not a racist game despite the name. In fact, the plot have anti-racism value. You cant treat someone by their races. Except rich white guys, especially ones that owns a hotel. Do you even see his face?
