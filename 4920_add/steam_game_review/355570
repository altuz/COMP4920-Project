The game is more in-line with something like Crooked Man, Mermaid Swamp, or even Corpse Party than Ib, Witch's House, or the like, based partially on a more grounded and less fantastical setting (but still interesting and dark), a variety of drawn images appear throughout the game in special story moments, and the game is less focused on strict puzzle gameplay and more on exploring, finding items, avoiding the murderer, and visual novel-like story moments sprinkled with the occasional puzzle.\n\nIf you've never played an RPG Maker Horror Game, basically it's a horror game with a viewpoint like an old SNES RPG-type game but with a lack of turn-based battles and more focused on events, puzzles, chasers; but in this game's case with many visual novel scenes. This game is completely worth the $5 if you enjoy these kind of games. It's biggest flaw comes in its translation, as there are Engrish elements to it and some typos, but I never didn't understand what they were saying, and as I got more into the game, it became very easy to overlook and just enjoy. The only other thing is the game has some minor bugs, I ran into a few, but thankfully found nothing game-breaking, mainly some sequence breaking. \n\nThe game has good production values for an RPG Maker game. There's several animated videos, that look nice. The original and licensed music is all very good. The Korean voice acting is well-casted, sometimes they sound a bit dry and emotionless, but pull off many scenes wonderfully, and added rather than took away in my opinion.\n\nThis is all backed by a surprising story that was quite enjoyable, and surprisingly some good endings. Endings are something that can be hard to get right, but this game nailed it, and gave the game that extra omph to make the whole experience feel worth playing to the end. The game has three endings, all three are good though I do have a favorite, and all are worth getting; the ending doesn't just change the ending but radically changes the last third of the game for some very different gameplay and story experiences.\n\nGame actually got me a few times with its scares and atmosphere, but didn't overly rely on cheap tricks. Mixed with the horror elements is a murder mystery that gets kind of gripping, and some humor sprinkled in and used to good effect. There's also in this game a deep-rooted morale about family, but it's one of the few times a game I feel doesn't push the morale in your face and didn't feel like it was preaching it to you or feel cringe-worthy or forced in anyway. Game also is of decent length, taking someone probably 5-7 hours to get the first ending, and about 5-7 hours to get the other two endings, and a lot of that second 5-7 hours being filled with new stuff.\n\nOverall a very solid RPG Maker Horror game that can stand with some of the greats, worth it for fans of these type of games, or if you have an interest in horror games in general, murder mysteries with a spice of some psychological and surreal horror, or those wanting to try more pixelated games in the horror genre.

Yes! This is in english btw! This game has SO MUCH good about it, it's full of variety and comedy and mystery and jump scares and suspense.. it's so good!

(if you have my sense of humor this could be a positive!)\n-Bugs (there's a few that can break the game or crash the game.. just be warned they happen, but not often. - example warning spots: one of the bookcases in the library will crash the game with \"cannot find image\", other bugs are like the killer indefinately chasing you, this can be fixed by dying, loading, or something just spamming room fast enough.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426925243, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427645314, "recommendationid": "14983955", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510517", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427086833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 599, "steamid": "76561198186854633", "num_games_owned": 98}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I've recently realised I have a soft spot in my heart for indie horror games. I've worked my way through Ib, Mad Father, and Witch's House. I took a break for a while, but Spring Break rolled around, I had some time, and I'd just gotten my paycheck. So I got myself an account, and started browsing through the indie section.\n\nI really wasn't sure about this game, since it only had one review, and I couldn't really find any information on it other than the description, but I figured $5 wasn't going to kill me, so I went ahead and got it. \n\nI can say, without any sort of hesitation, that it was worth five bucks. \n\nThe story is interesting and just the right amount of macabre. There aren't as many jump scares as you might expect, but there's a lot of psychological horror. The characters are all different from what I expected, and this family certainly isn't what we might think of as loving. But it's interesting to see them battle between trusting each other and letting their suspicion run wild. \n\nI'm also a fan of the whole 'fear' system. The main character is afraid of the dark, and as you travel through the enormous mansion with a very limited field of vision, his fear gauge will go down. If it isn't replenished by lighting matches or eating chocolate, he'll begin panicking, and will ignore your directions and run in a random direction for a time. Of course, lighting a match alerts the murderer to your location if he is in the same room. It makes the game just challenging enough to keep you on edge as you make your way, trying to keep your family safe and get out. \n\nI've finished one playthrough, and I have to say, the ending I got definitely surprised me. I'm pretty sure I got the bad ending though, so I'll have to try again, it would seem. \n\nI'm always long winded, but I'll go ahead and list the pros and cons from my experience:\n\nPros:\nInteresting plot\nFrequent plot twists (I don't know if that's the right word to use, but there are a lot of very surprising events that change the way you think about things)\nSimple gameplay, but not boring. \nMultiple endings\nA lot of player decisions that ultimately change the outcome\nA good blend of the visual novel and rpg genre\nThe Korean voice acting is actually very good\n\nCons:\nThe  most glaring one is some shoddy translations. The mistakes are pretty frequent, but they don't interfere with the ability to understand, so they aren't a huge issue. But those that can't stand grammar/spelling errors should beware.\nThe characters can, at times, be incredibly unlikable. Minhyuk is very self-depreciating, and most of his siblings are manipulative jerkwads. But it plays into the story, so it's forgivable. \nThere was an occasional glitch, particularly on the second floor for me. A few times I was seen by the murderer, but he would not follow me to other maps, and I could not hide. Yet he'd be waiting for me to return to the map where he first saw me, and continue chasing. I had to load my games a few times because of this. But it's not too hard to overcome. \nSome of the puzzles aren't well explained. You are given vague directions and just kind of have to push buttons and hope. There was one that involved moving a bunch of stones to the right that I'm still not sure how to do, I just kept messing around until it worked. But you can eventually get it, even if you just mess around for a while. \n\nFor me, it was a fun game, and I'll likely play again soon to try and get the true ending. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the indie horror rpgs.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427070043, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427070265, "recommendationid": "15013960", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465499", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430801013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 772, "steamid": "76561198153638414", "num_games_owned": 41}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "1", "review": "If you like RPG Maker games like The Crooked Man or Ib, then this game is definitely worth getting.
