Sadly without the mini-games, this becomes a Conquest clone.\n\nAs far as multi-player, there is LAN only and share a PC options, so no internet gaming, if you were looking for that.\n\nThat said, for the $3 sale price it works.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427030856, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427030856, "recommendationid": "15004913", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537543", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427055930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561197968826705", "num_games_owned": 57}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very simple concept, not verry difficult. but for $3 its hard to be too hard on it.
