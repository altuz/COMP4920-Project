You can't disable the motion blur, either.\n\nThere are minor graphics rendering bugs, nothing too bad though. The jump button is slow to react, weirdly enough.\n\nIf you stay on path, you see non-interactable objects of varied relevance, then it ends in half an hour. If you don't, there are pretty places to visit, but the landscape doesn't like you straying off, so you may find yourself trying to jump out of the landscape holes for way longer than you want, and it seems that the checkpoint system isn't working (and you can't save manually). If only this were built on Creation Engine, if you know what I mean.\n\nThe story is... subject to personal opinion. If you do get used to the narrator.
