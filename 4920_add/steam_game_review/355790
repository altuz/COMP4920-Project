Other reviews are used to help stress my point across but are changed in such a way to make the review in my own wording [/h1]\n\nStyx: Shards of Darkness is one of those games that I have been following since the first day Cyanide Studios and Focus Home Interactive announced it after the successful first game Styx: Master of Shadows, just as the first game, it caught my attention and I couldn't wait to play it... first reviews came out, mediocre to positive just as the previous game. I was a bit dissapointed as I was expecting this game to be pretty good, but I trusted Cyanide to deliver a good successful sequel to the equally enjoyable first game, so I bought it and now I have finished it\n\nSo, what did I think of it?\n\nOverall, the game is not bad. The game had its moments but behind those great moments, it did have some major flaws. I felt like Cyanide didn't really learn it's mistakes, flaws and lessons from the previous game and just kept the same formula as the first game with only improving certain mechanics here and there\n\nThe story, it is pretty well written. I was interested in Styx's continuation and I kept on playing thanks to its story. Although it did have some cliche's here and there, it was pretty well done! The game is pretty damn long which I was surprised, but what bothered me was what I felt was the developers being lazy, they re-used some levels from the beginning to the last few levels of the game. I call this the 'Rinse and Recycle' method where either the developer lost money or was too damn lazy to create more different levels... just the same as the first one, they did it again with the sequel\n\nThe multiple environments Shards of Darkness takes place in are actually very nice. Powered by the Unreal Engine 4, it does bring out the fantasy genre into the environments with its open areas and secret passage ways. However, some textures were bad, not as bad as Master of Shadows\n\nThe voice acting is... sub-par, Styx's voice actor was the one I favoured the most, he brought out the character pretty well even if the voice acting did flop sometimes here and there. The other main characters were voiced... okay-ish. Some characters played their voices as if they were reading from there scripts, some other characters played them with little character in their voices\n\nThe music is pretty good and captures the fantasy/stealthy genre that the game was put in\n\nGameplay, its okay. The game heavily focuses on stealth and not in combat and the stealth mechanic is pretty good, even if it did have some flaws here and there. The combat is terrible, if you happen to be caught by a guard, you have to time your parries correctly then strike whilst the iron is hot, pretty bad combat system. Jumping... oh, the jumping, still just as bad as the first game, the jumping in the platform bits is still pretty bad, and the ledge detection although improved from the first game is still pretty bad\n\nThe game does have its fair share amount of glitches, like guards sticking through walls, the camera popping through the environment and the cutscene camera sometimes glitching through the environment. I'm very surprised that the game had quality assurance and did not find these glitches...\n\nI know that the people behind this game cared about their project and it shows, but, for their next project in the Styx universe, I hope that they listen to our feedback and improve even more from what Shards of Darkness suffered from!\n\nThis is going onto my best game in Steam library because I enjoyed it, its not the perfect and it will never be, but I enjoyed it none the less and I hope that future projects from Cyanide Studios will be better if not tons better than Styx: Shards of Darkness\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]\n[i] THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

past game in the series, and the only one besides this one (I think) was a rather disappointing and frustrating experience for me, it was the type of game that I just couldn\u2019t really experience in it\u2019s \u201crhythm\u201d so to speak.\nI just could never really get past dying and getting spotted countless of times, which it\u2019s something that\u2019s still present in this game but that maybe because the game has changed, and I have changed, both of this things come into play when experiencing this game.\nFor starters I finally understand the story, and if not the story, then the world, and the world of this game, just the universe, the characters, the intricacies, the political and economical arguments, the fight for power coming from different factions, or groups, it\u2019s just fantastic.\nIt is true that Styx: Shards of darkness suffers from some silly dialog and voice acting, the latter being probably the biggest problem of the two, the dialog in all honesty It\u2019s quite hilarious and fun, especially the one coming from the protagonist itself, Styx.\nBut the thing about complaining about something like voice acting is that I feel it\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s also a bit \u201crelative\u201d to say the least I could understand as I kept getting deeper and deeper into the game, after hearing plenty of different character\u2019s voices, where people\u2019s complaints where coming from, but to be honest, hadn\u2019t it been for my awareness of this complaints, I might have never even written this paragraph.\nThe real depth and care for the game tho, is really put into the gameplay, and the characters, as well as the universe.\nStyx is an incredible character, I seriously don\u2019t remember liking him as much in the last game, he\u2019s funny, witty, childish, immature, rude, vulgar, but always withholding a bit of charm, or innocence in it all, it\u2019s fun too, to hear him reference other games, and break the \u201c4th wall\u201d constantly, and obviously being self aware.\nThe biggest aspect that I loved about the game, it\u2019s the massive levels, the incredible corridors composed of multiple paths, of multiple places in which to hide, in which to take cover and \u201chug\u201d a wall as you sneak past a couple of enemies, literally.\nI think Styx: Shards of darkness brilliance comes simply from the freedom that the game makes the player feel, platforming, sneaking, even killing enemies, or simply traversing the level makes me feel good, with tight controls, there are only a few problems, but those ones do exist.\nI can\u2019t tell you how tedious it is to try and jump into a given place only to then pummel to your death mistakenly and stupidly after falling off the edge of a platform.\nBut for the most part, it\u2019s really enjoyable.\nThe objectives, which are divided into main, and secondary, are usually objectives that take you to get to point A, to point B, which in theory might sound a bit shallow, and effortless, but this is yet another example that I think makes Styx work in a really good way, having the freedom to get to a certain spot however you want, in a stealth game, with as massive, extensive, and detailed levels as this one, it\u2019s a joy to say the least.\nHence the sense of \u201cfreedom\u201d I was talking about in a second.\nThe problems of Styx: Shards of darkness, for me, really come to some contradictory design choices, paired with some frustrating levels of difficulty.\nI started playing the game on the easiest difficulty available, which the game defaults to (ironically enough) there\u2019s a brief description as to what difficulty it\u2019s design for a particular player, but it tends to be ambiguous at best, the crazy part it\u2019s that after playing through the first mission, and a bit of the second one in that difficulty, I kept getting spotted and failing my goal to play through the entire game without getting spotted once, changing the difficulty to the setting before the last (Goblin) make the game not only more enjoyable, because at the very least my plenty of mistakes were somehow explained given the level of difficulty, whilst at the same time, being a bit more \u201crewarding\u201d in a way, after clearing the entire game, and only dying a few times, I just didn\u2019t feel frustrated anymore.\nNot necessarily something that might affect everyone, but something I felt needed to be mentioned.\nStyx is in every sense of the word not a game for people that want to have a relaxing, \u201ceasy\u201d, and peaceful time.\nThe main issue that I must say, will almost certainly affect some people, lies with some of the problems in the execution of the story, some minor mistakes in the way the controls work, problems with pushing through the \u201clearning curve\u201d, and finally, and probably the biggest one for me\u2026\nThe contradictory game design, and the limitations that come with it.\nIn Styx: Shaders of darkness there are medals that you can get in each mission, three, one for clearing the game in a given amount of time, one for clearing the mission without getting spotted, and finally the third one, for not killing anybody.\nHere\u2019s the problem with this.\nMost of this can be easily ignored, and I would recommend you to do so, but getting every medal in each stage it\u2019s required for achievements, as well as for getting some extra \u201cpoints\u201d that you can use to level up your skill tree, don\u2019t quote me on that last one tho, I\u2019m almost sure it\u2019s required, but I don\u2019t know\u2026\nThe problem that I have with this medals it\u2019s that the vast majority of time they don\u2019t really reward the player for playing the game \u201ctheir\u201d way, instead they force you to play through each mission in a certain given time, without killing anybody, even if the game becomes incredibly more enjoyable when doing so, as well as when not getting spotted, which it\u2019s probably the only one I can agree with completely in it\u2019s inclusion.\nThe rest, completely unnecessary and in my opinion a bit irrational decisions that lack consideration for all the other gameplay aspects, and mechanics the game has.\nOverall, Styx: Shards of darkness it\u2019s a great game, it\u2019s fun, and enjoyable, challenging, even when playing in \u201cstandard\u201d or easy difficulties, and generally it\u2019s just a great time.\nThe game does lean a bit \u201cshorter\u201d in it\u2019s length, clocking at 10 hours in a very difficult playthrough, it\u2019s pretty tolerable for me personally, but I just wonder how long would the game be for people that play on easier difficulties and are simply \u201cbetter\u201d at the game than me.\nI recommend it tremendously, it is a game with a lot of character, just\u2026 Like, almost most of the times, get it on a sale.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created":
