If you can't transport everything at once, you can make more than one run. Like others have mentioned, the server can drop you and you can lose progress on a mission. I, however, only had this happen during long times of inactivity. It's best not to pause the game mid mission or you'll get disconnected after maybe 30 minutes or an hour.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504925364, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504925364, "recommendationid": "34827647", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500228", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 217, "total_reviews": 297, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 80}}
