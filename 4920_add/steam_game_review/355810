Even shopping isn't especially strategic, all planets sell the full range of goods and there's one very clear dominant strategy for buying gear.\n\nOnce you intercept a fleet you're presented with one of 4 mission types depending on the AI control of allied units on the main map: solo intercept, fleet intercept, merchant defence and station defence. The gameplay is mostly similar: kill all the enemies. The variation comes from the defence missions being failed if the merchant or station is killed, which is quite possible if you take your time getting there or fighting.\n\nCombat gameplay is real-time and gives you control of ship rotation and thrust, one turret weapon that tracks the mouse and a spinal mount weapon (or two) on the larger ships. You get to tweak allocation of power between weapons, engines and shields, which gives you a few tactical options, although shields regenerate so slowly that it's mostly impractical - if you boost them enough to start regenerating you'll be moving too slowly to evade fire, and even with max engines you're unlikely to be evading fire reliably enough to regenerate shields by kiting: so in practice your choices are max weapons to kill things fast, and max engines to get to a merchant or station in time to defend it.\n\nThat said, the fights are quite a bit of fun, although the AI consists entirely of \"charge at target, overshoot and fly back again\" for the fighters and \"charge at target and attempt to kite\" for all other ships, no attempts to evade or rotate shields (not even sure AI units have directional shields, there's no feedback in that regard). Mostly it boils down to whether you can overwhelm them with firepower before your shields give out or you run out of capacitor to keep your weapons firing. Fun enough but not too challenging.\n\nTypes of opponents gradually escalate and you unlock larger ships as you complete missions and advance in rank.\n\nAt four points as you gain rank a special mission will appear on one of the planets that drops you into four fixed tower-defence levels. These make for a nice change of pace, but since they're fixed layout and there's no bonuses for doing exceptionally well - just succeed or fail - there's no replay value once you've figured it out. They're quite fun, and I almost feel there's more depth and variety in this aspect of the game than the space combat, which is kinda odd because you only get to play the TD section those 4 times.\n\nOverall the game is fun, but you're likely to complete it within two hours and even with slightly careless achievement hunting I've done everything the game has to offer in under five hours; and while I enjoyed that time, I now feel no great urge to ever play it again.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444197614, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444197614, "recommendationid": "18364794", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514201", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436037765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 105, "steamid": "76561197977058286", "num_games_owned": 504}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Quite an enjoyable game, but I think one which most veterans will find relatively easy and with little replay value. I spent a couple of hours beating this game, and while I may return for a couple of forays I don't anticipate significant replay value. There are no difficulty levels and I didn't find the game difficult on the default setting. The space portions are well thought out and fun, the tower defense portions are like a poorly thought out TD flash game. I encountered and reported a few bugs during my run through, but both were fairly critical: graphics representing enemies and allies not appearing on the map for the duration of a mission.
