If you are planning to get this, please read my review first. It might save you from wasting your time or money.\n\n\nI'm a \"Survarium\" Veteran and someone who knew about the development of the game, as early as 2013. \nWe were promised an authentic S.T.A.L.K.E.R. multiplayer, open-world high quality experience. \n\nI took part in the first closed betas. The game was just PVP back then in small CoD-like maps. We were told that this is \"just a place holder\" and that we would get open world PVE very soon. We believed them, because the game back then looked and played amazing. The game was tactical and you couldn't go guns blazin without getting punished for it. You had to listen to footsteps and always go slowly. You had to use your camouflage to blend with your surroundings. (Unarguably the best game when it came to camouflage. No other game made it so rewarding to find a good spot.)\n\nThe graphics were phenomenal. High quality textures, thick vegetation that you could actually hide in, high-resolution anomalies spawning all over the map and great shadows over the distance. It was a masterpiece. All it needed was the open world update. \n\nBUT.... once the game became an open beta, the updates started getting slower. With every update, the netcode worsened. OP guns were introduced in the game and tactical gameplay started getting weaker and weaker. With update 0.29 the game died. \n\nThe amazing and dense vegetation was completely removed and replaced with low-quality short grass that looked unnatural. It made camouflage and hiding completely useless. \nLighting became worse. Shadows became much lighter and softer. It made people hiding in shadows easy kills. It also made the game look kind of blurry because the lighting was so unnatural. \n\nSounds were changed. Everything regarding sound was just downgraded. Gun sounds weaker, footsteps weaker/random and ambiance removed. \n\nKILLCAM added too, which made Snipers even more useless. Not only people now couldn't hide in the vegetation anymore, but they were also visible in the killcam. \n\nFrequent game crashes. \n\nNow, this might seem bad but trust me, it didn't just stop there.\nAfter that update, the forums were filled with people complaining but the developers (Vostok) completely ignored us!!! Moderators STARTED BANNING PEOPLE AND DELETING THREADS! \n\nThe devs continued to add more stupid updates to the game such as low-poly weapon attachments that completely broke how shotguns and assault rifles performed. Gun condition was completely removed and people no longer had to pay a lot for grenades. With every update, the game was getting closer and closer to becoming a fast-paced low quality COD! \n\nA few updates ago, the graphics became even worse. In distance greater than 90 meters, grass completely disappears even on maximum settings. Textures become even more blurry and the game looks terrible compared to what it looked like back in early 2015! \n\nArmors are broken. You can have the heaviest 90+ kg armor equipped with two heavy assault rifles or a .50 sniper and still be able to sprint around endlessly. Now only people who go guns blazing with the fastest ROF weapons win! The game is no longer tactical and requires no thinking whatsoever! \n\nAnd of course, the game is filled with hackers. The anti-cheat system is a joke. \n\nIf you thought Survarium was going to be a hardcore and atmospheric S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience, please stay away from this game. Don't even bother downloading it. We want this game to die already. Their playerbase is rapidly decreasing and I can't wait for the greedy liars at Vostok to go completely bankrupt! \n\nTo hell with this game.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1488535609, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488210533, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1488210533, "recommendationid": "30222324", "developer_response": "Hi, Thanks for the review and taking the time to play our game. I'd like to talk about a few things.\n\n1. The game is clean from cheats. This is for two reasons. The first being that if you search the internet (and I encourage you to do so) you will not find a working cheat for our game. Anything you do find will be nothing more than a trojan and we advise caution in this regard. The second is that even if a cheat existed and a player tried to use it, they would be auto-banned immediately.\n\n2. As for the graphics downgrade \"a few updates ago\". This is not true at all. We have not adjusted the graphical component of the game for a very long time. Question: Are you playing on the high-end or low-end renderer? Because this can make the world of difference.\n\n3. The armour system as it stands has already been completely redesigned and in the next update 0.46, we will introduce a new system which will be far more to the player's liking. \n\n4. Sound downgrade? This is not true. In fact, this aspect of the game is one we are praised for almost more than any other feature. \n\n5. It has been stated time and time again that our game is in heavy development and changes are made constantly to better suit player's requests as well as progress the game further in development. As we stated in January with the 2017 diary, we plan to launch the first implementation of co-op this year. \n\nIn closing I'd like to suggest that perhaps, take a sabbatical from our game and come back after update 0.46 has been released or perhaps even at a later stage and see what changes have been made. We're a small team, things take time and we continue to work day and night to improve our game, for all of those who play it.

We appreciate your interest. I'd just like to talk about a few things that you mentioned. \n\nYour main concern is the lack of Freeplay and open-world modes. While Survarium currently offers PvP we are most certainly going to introduce other modes such as PvE and this year we hope to introduce a Co-op experience where players join forces against mutants and other NPC AI. While we are in heavy development, many things change and as you can imaging, bigger features are vastly more complicated to introduce. May I suggest that if you are feeling unsatisfied with the current game modes on offer that you come back at a later stage and see where the development has taken the game. \n\nRegards,\n", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577924", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501801242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2664, "steamid": "76561198057567789", "num_games_owned": 366}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": "4", "review": "I'm a big fan of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, so when I heard about Survarium, I was really hyped up.  The fact that devs from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series are working on this only added to that.  I thought that it would be an open-world MMO, in other words, a way to get my S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fix, after the one which was supposed to come out was canceled.  Vostok even put \"MMO\" in the tags.  As it turns out, the MMO portion(free play) of the game wasn't even in development, so that was kind of a disappointment, especially since the game was pretty busted for a while.\n\nPros:\nFor what it's worth, it's currently not a bad game.  The graphics look amazing.  There's a noticeable attention to detail on the environments, and the anomalies are nice pieces of eye-candy.  Also, the guns look pretty close to their real life counterparts.  There's no noticeable clipping on the various armor pieces you can equip either.  Whatever engine this game runs on is great, in the looks department.\n\nThe skill system is really in-depth.  You have one for guns, one for physical activities, and one for anomalies.  Every skill tree has an assortment of skills to spec into.  Now, if only you got more than one skill point every time you leveled up.  \n\nFrom what I remember, the music and sound design really drive the atmosphere home.  The guns pack a punch, and you can hear it.  Even small pistols sound impactful.  Explosions are expectedly powerful.  Sound effects are different indoors and outdoors, which is nice.  The music is what you'd expect from a post-apocalyptic game: Dark, dreary and depressing.  It works very well.  \n\nThe business model is fair, but grindy.  People are usually very quick to label an f2p game as \"pay-to-win\", which while understandable, isn't very fair.  You can buy most things with the in-game currency.  Attachments are obtained through kills, and upgrades require both in-game currency and scrap metal; both are obtained by completing matches.  You earn a decent amount of the in-game currency every match, but only a small amount of scrap metal.  This is a problem, because upgrades have a 50% chance to succeed with the in-game currency.  If you fail to upgrade, now you have to go and play some more matches, and your odds don't get any better.  I remember trying to upgrade one of my guns, and failing, gathering up enough to upgrade again, and failing again.  It can get frustrating, especially with high-tier guns, which require a whole lot of currency and scrap metal per upgrade.  \n\nThe new UI is pretty, and didn't take much getting used to.  Not really much for me to say about it, to be honest.  \n\nCons:\nThe matchmaking was always pretty bad.  You would normally find yourself waiting a while, and having to play against players with way better gear than you.  The stash maps helped, but they can't fix a lack of players.  Now, instead of fighting players, you're mostly fighting bots.  Not only that, but you could wind up waiting 2 minutes+ with all the regions and game modes checked.  I wind up playing on foreign servers, too, so my ping is almost always above 100.  It's pretty annoying.  \n\nFriendly fire shouldn't be a thing in this game, in my opinion.  It's frustrating to be in the middle of a firefight, just for some random teammate to get in your way.  Also, I've heard of cases of intentional friendly-fire too.  \n\nThere aren't that many maps.  I get that it's a small team on a tight budget, with a free-to-play game, but playing on the same few maps gets boring, especially when you do it for as long as I did.      \n\nThe anomalies get under my skin.  They tend to spawn in important areas, like exits in your spawn points, making getting around maps inconvenient.  if you get near them, without good gear for that, you'll take tons of damage.  Also, last time I checked, most of the artifacts within these anomalies aren't even that useful.  \n\nGame updates are annoying, if you don't start up the launcher every time one is released.  If you take some time off of the game, and launch it, you'll have to wait for every update to install, one by one.  I'd prefer it if the game updated through steam, and gave you all the content in one download.  \n\nBleeding has almost been removed from the game entirely.  Back then, it only took a few shots to initiate a bleed-out effect.  Now, you could shoot somebody a bunch of times and they would lose not one drop of blood. \n\nConclusion:\nIt went from a product that shouldn't have been in the public eye, to an above-average f2p fps game with rpg and survival elements.  The biggest issue I have is the fact that we don't know what's going on with free-play past the announcement they put out a while ago.  Free play was the only reason most people even got into Survarium in the first place.  The community's slowly dying out, because the community's getting tired of waiting.  Every match I join is filled with bots.  Vostok took too long to make Survarium a decent game, and are suffering for it.  It's much better than it used to be, but the development is progressing at a snail's pace.  I think the game has potential, but will Vostok Games be able to keep up with the development costs?\n\nSidenote: I hope Vostok sees this and listens.  I've been hearing a lot about them suppressing criticism, recently.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1486637960, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485651895, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1485651895, "recommendationid": "29553782", "developer_response": "Hi $tackz,\n\nI'd like to thank you for playing our game and spending some of your time writing a review. We do appreciate the feedback. Despite what some people may think. Can I just address a few of the points you mentioned? I'm going to ignore the good points as those we are extremely grateful for and I feel the negative aspects need to be spoken about first.\n\n1. The matchmaking. Yes, we agree, it is not fair to keep a player waiting that long. Despite there being a decent population of players online during peak hours, it seems our tier system has been causing most of the problems here. Too many variables for the system to have to gather before a match can be made. This problem we are addressing in the forthcoming 0.46 update (preview due out soon). With a reduction to tiers and a complete rework of how the equipment system works in the game. You should be very pleased once reading the preview.\n\n2. Friendly fire? We believe this is not too much of a problem in the game and it is more down to personal taste. And as you have explained, you are not a fan. However, we don't see the need to remove this mechanic from the game. Not yet.\n\n3. Again we agree with you. That is why in 0.46 we are adding some updates to the maps and how they will work. I can't say too much at this point but the preview is being published very soon so please keep a look out for it!\n\n4. The anomalies are supposed to cause difficulty for the player. They are a random mechanic that creates the need for either a different approach to your destination or the right equipment to survive. Having said all that, we are redesigning the static and dynamic anomaly system to better suit the gameplay and fit the game accordingly.\n\n5. We are always looking to improve the technical side of our game. This includes how the client works both through Steam and non-Steam. Even if the game were to combine all updates into one large one and update once, you will still need to download all the data which would take the same amount of time as the multiple fixes. So it makes no difference at this point if there are multiple patches or one. One wouldn't make it faster.\n\n6. I cannot share much at this stage regarding the bleeding. But again, in the forthcoming updates a major redesign of how most of these mechanics work is being done. \n\nIn closing, perhaps come back to the game in a little while and see the progress. You may be pleasantly surprised.

"review": "Hello,first of all let me introduce myself to you,as i have a history of gameplay since 1985,so i can say im veteran when playing games comes to line,prefer FPS as favorite genre and literally there is no good FPS/SURVIVAL i didnt played till day,and i will make my personal oppinion about SURVARIUM so can help you decide if this game will suit your needs with some elements described from game,ill be glad to help you...\n\nSo the game SURVARIUM is basically new Stalker but with PVP in mind.STALKER was one of first FPS/SURVIVAL open world game and it was released in 2007,most of games cant compare to that game when atmsophere,and enjoyment comes in place,kinda game u just cant wait you play next morning and continue your journey in hope to find and mod your favorite weapon or gear...With massive support from players and alot of work dedicated from developers almost 3 years in development,id like to mention that STALKER PVP mode was brilliant for that time.Stalker was called game of the year and represented feedback for all future open world game releases(10 years in gaming industry passed since then).\nSo developers of that game started new project named SURVARIUM,PVP based fps/survival with alot of similar things especially wepaons like Stalker,they polishing and updating the game almost on daily basis,i can see alot of todays new kids on the block actually find the game not for their taste,as they used to play games without sway of weapon,recoil,and with 1 million health bar,well this game is not like that,its fast pace,somewhat very tactical and pretty realistic FPS,damn challenging when u confront some serious players.\n\n1.Weapons are trully amazing in this game,with photorealistic details,real sounds of shooting and reloading,tons of mods,and upgrades which u can see in the game after you upgrade,bullet travel is not linear,reticles are different from weapon to weapon and real joy when u look through sniper.\n\n2.Gear,u have 4 factions to choose each one can progress to Tier 10 through Tiers you unlocking new gear and armour with photorelaistic details in mind,each part of helmet,mask,jacket,pants,gloves,backpack looking completely different for each Faction and each level,with possibility to upgrade each part of equipment\n\n3.Skill tree,pretty powerfull and wisely created,so you can choose which role will suits your need best,rifleman shooter or fast run gunner,maybe skillfull long or short range sniper,you can build your player style u want through the levels and skill points\n\n4.Factions,4 of them you can chooose,each one has their own benefits,some are faster,some more precise,some healtheir,some with stronger armour,unique thing is you can play simultaneously by switching to different Factions while you progress through levels and tiers if u want so if you find the other faction more interesting to play with you can max that one and best thing is you can combine factions gear and weapons to your character and make ultra fighter of your choice as each part of equipment from different faction gives different upgrades,more ammo,more exploves,more ressistance, faster reload,less recoil,etc...\n\n5.Gameplay,well u have 4 unique mods,PVP plaer option,bot vs players option and ranked mode option which u need to pass Tier 5 to play,u have 9 maps to play on,also 16 players in game with additional bots if u choose.Apocalyptic atmosphere is fantastic with ruined world weird glowing radiated obstacles,anomalies,physics of weapons  with challenging sway and recoil,running,walking and jumping are damn fluid so u think real person is running infront of you,servers are quick and maximum wait is about 3 minutes to enter PVP match,u always play with same equipment and weapon Tier as opponents so no OP player can kill you,pretty well balanced game wehn matching comes,u have silver and gold as credits,silver you earn and buy stuff with it and  u can buy ingame gold and become premium player which benefit is more EXP,silver,and faction ribbons per match also one addtional profile for your character,but its definetelly not pay to win game as casual non premium player can own payed one as upgrades are basically same,except some weapons and equipment which u can buy for gold but only gives skin outlook and extra silver per match,so if u want to rnal fatser u buy premium,all in all u don need to pay to own in the game. \n\nConclusion:Survarium is improving each day,and since early alpha  game changed drastically,developers and support is pretty active in game polishing things with each update and answering players demands over chat,also alot of giveways and random bonuses like free premium are on daily basis,if you are serious FPS player and admire atmospheric survival-fps game with elelments of tactic and rpg,great community and challenging opponents i  recommened this game 100%  over most other similar genre games,and most of all its free to play...\n\nBest regards to all gamers,HC977...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485432882, "written_during_early_access": true,

you immune to them upon use for i forgot probably 5-10 seconds its enough to just pass through few of them or destroy/collect them which is sad if you ask me theres no point of using oxygen tanks and well game isnt really balanced well you can see that some guns are supperior to others its not like snipers are supperior to assault rifles at long range some assault rifles are supperior to others at every fucking thing type of game doesnt even have that many players so you at least waste 5-10 minutes searching for a game and before that ammunition update i could've said this game is not p2w but thanks to that update its actually hard to say that cause now people have a one small but obvious advantage against you if decide to pay for it well actually on higher tiers i can say its pretty p2w some people might call it p2acces or what ever that shit is but in my opinnion both of them are the same thingso simply you unlock attachments for your weapon after getting enough kills with it its pretty easy at the start like 10 kills for laser sight and stuff like that and yes they make a huge difference well after tier-3 it starts to get really hard to unlock equipments for your guns and guess what most of the usefull ones are not the first ones you unlock well its something like get 400 kills or something like that to get all the equipments and on tier-4 and 5 its worse lul but if you buy the same guns premium version which doesnt have any stat advantages it has the same stats you get it with all attachments unlocked and considering how bad iron sights for most of the weapons in this game that is a huge advantage there are premium armor sets and stuff but meh they dont really make such a huge difference if you ask me and then theres the treasure hunt system which is pretty annoying and a really bad decision devs made like they usually do with this game you get 2 treasure maps per week and you can join this treasure hunt thingy you can think of it as cs go cases but you get 2 free keys every week by playing the game but well your chances of getting the main reward is pretty low like REALLY LOW but no fear you can spend real money to buy more attempts and well at least you wont get the same rewards so you can get the main reward if you try few times instead of openning 50 cs go cases and getting jack shit i'll give them that well i dont really have anything left to say i guess this is all if i can think of anything i'll just edit this again i already edited this shit few times anyway oh right i forgot theres a goddamn upgrade system in the game which annoys the hell out of me simply put you get spare parts after everygame no matter if you win or lose from my experience and i guess i can count myself as a experienced player you wont really get much of em even if you play really well so to upgrade your guns which is not any sort of attachment type of upgrade by the way youre just giving it stat bonuses you just go right click on it and click upgrade then you just use your spare parts to upgrade it it has 50% succes rate and this doesnt go up if you fail and failing multiple times in a row is not that uncommon really i remember failing 6-7 times in a row OR you can pay real money to make it 100% :^) anyway its no treally that big of deal AT THE START but when you started to get higher tier items you'll realise how much of a pain it is to upgrade your weapons and those upgrades have a difference even the smallest advantage can make the difference between losing and winning a gun fight so yeah those upgrades are important but when one upgrade requires 100 spare parts and this goes up after every upgrade i dont remember the exact numbers but lets say 100-200-300 and you usually get around 10 spare parts a game things get little too grindy and dont forget the fact that you dont have 100% chance of upgrading it so you need much more spare parts to upgrade a high tier weapon to max level and you might need to reroll it cause you didnt get the buff you wanted or its not the highest amount like it can get up to 25% but its on 20% so you reroll it which costs fairly high amounts of spare parts too BUT MY DUDE YOU CAN BUY SPARE PARTS WITH GUESS WHAT YES REAL MONEY so yeah you can easily call this game p2w but who cares its a free to play game what do you expect anyway  holy shit this review is long",

We appreciate it. I'd also like to just talk about a few of the points you mentioned.\n\n1. With regards to the low FPS you mentioned. We offer players the choice of two different renderers in an effort to give the best possible performance to players with vastly different computer systems. Perhaps try the different options which can be found in the graphics menu.\n\n2. Playing only with bots. This is not true. You are able to play against other people, you need to be sure that you've selected the \"pvp\" option and not \"training match\". \n\n3. You mentioned that you feel some weapons are not as effective or more effective than you expected. To this, it should be stated that as a player progresses, they will earn XP and Reputation. These skill points are then used to better style your character in the way you prefer. As a rookie, your character will naturally not be a master at shooting or weapon handling. \n\n4. In closing, perhaps come back and try the game again after we release the next update, 0.46.

Series is probably my favorite game series of all time. I've put thousands of hours into those games over the years. I ran S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Files (part of the former FilesNation/GameFront Files Network) which was the #1 place to get mods for the games. When S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 got canned and GSC Game World let everyone go I was really bummed out.\n\nVostok Games rose from the ashes and I jumped at the chance to support them and I hoped that they'd be able to capture some of the magic that the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games held in what they were doing next.\n\nI decided that I'd support their efforts and backed them by getting a \"Founders\" status on their new project, Survarium. It was a $99 investment in what I hope would become an amazing game.\n\nSurvarium has sure had its ups and downs and I am not entirely happy with it but my main issue currently is with how they are handling the accounts on the game.\n\nI have my original account with Founders status and my prior progress on it. I don't play it very often but I've been keeping track of the game for a while awaiting the \"Freeplay\" portion of the game. That's my bread and butter.\n\nWhen the game came to STEAM I downloaded it right away but when I launched it, it just made a new account linked to my STEAM account that started from scratch. There was no option at all to log in with my existing account nor link my STEAM account to my existing account. This naturally annoyed me so I took it to their forums.\n\nSeveral members told me that this wouldn't be an issue and I could just have support fix it. I contacted support and they were of no help at all, nothing got done. Still other players assured me that this was possible and that they'd had it done for them.\n\nI even contacted their community manager Joe Willburn on Twitter and he looked into it. No luck there either.\n\nFast forward a couple months and I saw that they'd put up a Discord for Survarium players. Hopped on there and chatted for a bit and was once again told that it shouldn't be a problem getting an existing account linked to my STEAM account, once again this person had it done for them.\n\nOpened a new support ticket, submitted my request. First got a response back in Russian that I had to use Google Translate to even read, basically told it's not possible. Argued back and forth with Support for a bit, basically telling them \"Other players straight up told me this is possible and that they had it down for them.\" Support comes back and says that was something that use to exist but the feature was disabled one year ago and they don't have any plans to re-enable it.\n\nI was basically told that there is no way at all for them to resolve my problem and if I want to play on my Founders Account I must play the game with their stand alone client. I don't find this acceptable.\n\nThere are dozens of other games on STEAM that use their own stand alone launchers/updates and do not have this problem. Most will just let you log into your game account via their launcher (which is launched via STEAM). Some will let you generate a STEAM Key (which is 100% to the devs by the way) that is linked to your game account and allow you to redeem it on STEAM (Elite: Dangerous does this). Some games will do the login from the game itself. Survarium does this last option but for reasons unknown  to anyone but Vostok Games the STEAM version bypasses this for some asinine reason.\n\nIf you launch the game with the stand alone launcher you are greeted with a login page, just enter your email/password and you are good to go. If you launch the game via STEAM (which has the same launcher by the way) you are greeted with EXACT SAME LOGIN PAGE but there is no email/password box and there is just a button to login via STEAM.\n\nThe solution to this problem is so simple a Unity Asset Flipper could figure this out yet Vostok can't seem to.\n\nI cannot recomment any player, especially anyone who started playing this game prior to it coming to STEAM to continue to support them when the cannot even manage user accounts with any sense of compentency. \n\n\n\nTL:DR Impossible to use existing paid game account on STEAM, support refuses to fix issue.
