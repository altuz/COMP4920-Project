Nice voice acting and puts you under just the right amount of stress. I noticed some reviews where people had problems with the VR setting-- made them dizzy or didn't work smoothly; I played without using that, and I suggest doing the same if you're interested in this game so that it's not ruined for you if the VR option has issues.

Be it through the discarded notes found strewn throughout the house, the murmurings and ravings of the brothers, or by virtue the environment itself and the events which transpire through the game - the story is told dynamically, and in a way which builds a beautiful sense of tension and horror without relying on jump scares, strewn entrails, or constant unrelenting violence.\n\nTo be sure, there -are- threatening and awful undertones about the world the protagonist is thrust in, but it's by their implication rather than the outright use of them that they remain potent until the end of the game.\n\nWhilst a lot of the game play revolves around figuring out how the house functions, there are segments which are both resolvable through stealth and/or running haphazard through the house - with additional means of bypassing hostile forces unlocked a bit over halfway through the game. Ultimately, however, the strongest and most engaging aspect of the game is the world itself. I, for one, definitely look forward to learning more about the world and it's characters in the next episode.\n\nP.S.

I love the art, quirkiness, voice acting, story...just everything about this game.  I have played through this game twice now and just had to write up a review for it.  If you enjoy a game with bizarre characters, amazing (and hilarious) voice acting, gorgeous art and a fantastic world then I highly recommend you pick up this game.  I want to say there is roughly about 2+ hours of play value in this episode but what I got during those 2 hours for me was well worth the price...I even preordered the other episodes.  Don't care how long they take to make as long as they are as amazing as the first episode.   All I can say is if anything in the pictures/videos interests you I highly highly recommend you pick up this game and give it a shot!\n\nDetailed:\nI honestly can't think of anything I did not like about this game.  Again this will vary per person, but for me I loved literally everything about it.  No matter where I was in the game there was always something I could find within a few feet that made me laugh. *spoilers* Like being a peeping tom...all I can say is body goals! haha or the billboard above the conveyor belt which said in detail how to mutilate my body before trying to throw me in to the fire. But the one thing that made me laugh the most was when one of the grandchildren was giving a speech inside the house.  Whoever did the voice acting there I can't applaud you enough. *end spoilers* There is only one part in the game I was a tad confused on what to do (how to work the gates) but that only took a couple of tries to figure it out. Other than that it ran extremely smooth for me, didn't encounter any bugs or anything of the sort.  Not trying to give this game a glowing review solely just because I can...I truly just didn't encounter a single thing that made me dislike the game or gave me an issue.  Overall I highly recommend you pick up this game! Especially with Episode 2 coming out this year...so excited!!!\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493323848, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493323848, "recommendationid": "31401188", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499384", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495594514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 175, "steamid": "76561198104442950", "num_games_owned": 148}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Took Me about 3 hours to beat in total.
