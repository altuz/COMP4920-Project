It looks like it works just as planned.\n- You need to get used to controls (btw. you can invert the input which makes the game much easier) and you master them pretty quick.\n\nLanding:\n- this is where the problems got started. Sometimes you land perfectly and fall down. Sometimes you don't land at all and it counts.\n- Impulse while landing is just horrible. It's 50/50 you can guess it, often it just makes no sense at all.\n\nObjects:\n- some objects in this game also need a rework. You can get stuck in a tree. You can get stuck on the fountain. You can even get stuck on a bench without dying.\n- You can land near the chair and it will count. Sometimes it counts too late, so like if you land and start instantly flying it doesn't count the landing and as i said, sometimes you don't even land on an object and it counts as a landing.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's fun for a casual game untill you get to platinum. First level is already bullshit. Missions like \"land on every object in 26 seconds\" are 90% of the time not possible just because of the bugs i described above.\nIt was disappointing for me, since i wanted to 100% the game, which is not possible without spending hours into platinum mod and it just gets annoying really quick.\n\n~6/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445033571, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445033935, "recommendationid": "18512289", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519236", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449083032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 23, "steamid": "76561197972837049", "num_games_owned": 605}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Since I was a boy I've dreamt of having a jetpack.
