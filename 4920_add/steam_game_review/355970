It's also the very embodiment of \"pretentious walking simulator\", a genre I happen to like.\n\nIt ticks the pretentious walking simulator boxes: narrator revisiting past, telling stories, plinky-soft emotional piano music in the background.\n\nBut it's 30 minutes, tops. I was shocked at just how fast the game was over. The graphics are pretty good for an idie effort but they won't blow you away. If you're playing with a controller, you'll have to do battle with a forced setup window requiring mouse and keyboard before you get into the game.\n\nIt's hard to recommend this game. It's clearly a labor of love from the developer and it's definitely not some quickie trash thrown out there to collect money off an asset flip - some care went into this.\n\nAnd yet, because it's so short and light, you really need to be in the mood and willing to pay (at this time, $3) for that experience.\n\nIt didn't do it for me, maybe it'll do it for you.
