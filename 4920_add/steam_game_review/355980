As of writing the review, I have unlocked all levels and have beaten the game. It took me approximately forty hours to do so. The value here is immense; going by the $1.00 per hour of gameplay rule, you can expect to get four times or more of your money's worth, considering you buy it for full price.\n\nThis game is somewhat reminiscent of Dungeon Keeper. Your goal is to prevent the good guys from reaching your dungeon portal, and you must use various traps at your disposal (along with rechargeable spells, of which there are many that you may unlock over the course of the game). Keeping true to the genre, strategy is key, for particular traps are more useful in some areas than others. Unlike many tower defense games, many traps are able to be placed on the ground rather than on \"towers\" or walls, such as spikes/slime/grinders, which varies things up quite a bit. Throughout the game, winning one level will unlock up to three more, and each level shows you its layout and what it unlocks upon completion before you even play it. There are over forty levels in the main game, some of which are required to progress, and some of which are optional and grant you gems (required to level up everything; they upgrade your traps, spells, and even how much gold/lives you start out with). Beating a level also unlocks the ability to replay it with runes, reminiscent of the Gemcraft series. Each rune offers a different challenge, such as additional enemy health/speed, and enabling a rune on a level and subsequently beating it offers you an XP multiplier, which helps you level up. Thus, if you ever get stuck on a level, there are multiple options at your disposal to allow you to earn XP to level with and try again.\n\nI am past level 70, and there is no end in sight. Do not expect reachable level caps here. Even once all trap upgrade tiers are unlocked (they can upgrade to level four, granting additional benefits and abilities during the level) you can continue to upgrade them to cost less, trigger more often, etc. You could, technically, play this game forever, and keep upgrading your already powerful traps to become ridiculous.\n\nLevels are varied and interesting, and even the environments change (from excavation/mining areas to tombs to ice levels). There is a level editor to create even more levels, as if the abundance here isn't already more of an offering than most games in the genre. The graphics are endearing and colorful, and the game does not shy away from pixelated gore, a DOS-era voice chiming in after a killstreak to comment, \"Juicy!\" The music here is fantastic. There is an Easter egg of sorts to be found by those of us who are fans of the tower defense genre in later levels, and there is a secret level to be found within the game. I encourage you to find it yourself; if you beat the game without finding it, the ending credits will tell you which level to go back to in order to search for it.\n\nI haven't had this much fun with a tower defense game since Kingdom Rush Frontiers. I spent 40 hours in this game over the course of a week, and I didn't get bored. This will be a game I will revisit in the future, and I highly recommend it to tower defense and strategy fans. Upon beating it I immediately searched for more Valsar games to support, and was disappointed to find none. If the developer releases more games in the future, I will be supporting them for sure.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506659846, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506659846, "recommendationid": "35282330", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503208", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1479517588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3379, "steamid": "76561197995433131", "num_games_owned": 313}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Now this is an indie TD game done right!\n\nIt's fairly basic in terms of mechanics, but that's not a bad thing, because what it does, it does VERY well. It can be a pretty difficult game, but the game features a neat difficulty system where the players chooses how hard do you want it to be. There's even an \"easy mode\" you can activate if you get stuck in a map at any time.\n\nIn terms of graphics and music, listen, not gonna lie, it's not particularly impressive. The 2D pixel graphics are serviceable enough as to be able to see what you need to see but very basic, imo. They're not horrible either... Music is fine but there's like 1 or 2 BGM tracks total, which is a shame, because the whole thing has an obvious OMD flair, which, on one hand is quite cheeky, but on the other hand: hey, it works =P\n\nFor the price, this one is very much recommended, specially if you're a fan of TD games. This should prove to be enough of a challenge for TD afficionados, plus due to the aforementioned difficulty system, you'll probably get your money's worth and more in terms of content.\n\nGood job, and very much looking forward to the sequel... hopefully they'll improve as much as possible of the graphics and music front =)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506805761, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506805796, "recommendationid": "35354334", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502973", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505200399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 7155, "steamid": "76561197970730314", "num_games_owned": 1775}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Where to start?\n\nUnique tower defence with rock-paper-scissor combined physics combined traditional TD game mechanics\n\nUser maps\n\nFantastic eye candy from explosions and traps\n\nGravity and wieght are actually important things to consider\n\nMutators (modify map with runes) to challenge even the hardest of hardcore TD bull fighters.\n\nx1 x2 x4 speeds for high wave count maps\n\nGritty interesting sound effects that don't grind your ears\n\nSecret level!\n\nTrap combinations eg freeze and then push off into pit\n\nMinecarts plough through the map and some explode\n\nDestructable crates (can be upgraded to be invulnerable)\n\n3 upgrade tiers per trap while on map\n\n50 points for each trap to increase power or reduce cost\n\n50 points for each level specific upgrade \n\nPathways open as you complete levels\n\nTraps are unlocked as you progress\n\nAnti-grind mechanics: Acrue points for each successful level completion, repeat playthroughs don't get any more points unless you beat your previous point score.
