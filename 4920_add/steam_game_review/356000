I will try to keep anything too close to a spoiler from the review.\n\nIt's one of those CYOA novels where the personality stats are more for flavoring the text, some things your character thinks/says will be different depending on their personality. It was actually done fairly well, with your characters view of those around them being fairly interesting to read and to set you up for thinking through justification for their thoughts. This goes along well with good (not great) scene writing.\n\nWhile their are different paths to explore, there are not many and certain parts of them simply do not seem to change. You can basically be a warrior, a thief, a wizard, and a bard. These can have different story paths that can be fun, but the big events of the game seem largely unchanged other than how your character will skill check something. The description can be a good read, but the choice aspect of it doesn't seem as strong as others in the CYOA genre (such as Mecha Ace, one of my favorite and first CYOA by the same author).\n\nThe main problem with the novel, is that it lacks a lot of character development. Your character is essentially the A list, and there are a few B list. All of the others are basically extras. This might not be so bad if the B listers had more character development. Two of them have a decent bit, but even they are more of a few paragraphs of backstory and a few lines  of personality driven action than anything that really makes you care about them. They do not seem as their own people who have value other than telling your character some things to do and a few encouraging words. They are nothing outside of that. Your own character has some good development, though some of the studying and skill building seem to be more for a bigger world than what this CYOA provides.\n\nThis CYOA novel is okay, though the time and money might be better spent on others. It feels like the beginning of the building of a world, almost like a demo. A sequal seems hinted at by the way the CYOA is written, but I can't remember it ever being deliberately said. Currently, the novel provides some good reading but the feeling of being cramped and rushed, especially when you decide to stop and try to get a feel of what's around you. It's not the worst, but a sequal or a big rewrite is the only way I can recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504234297, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504234297, "recommendationid": "34649880", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504214", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 69, "total_reviews": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 20}}
