With many obvious needs that you must take care of at all times this game can be quite stressful, but once you get the mechanics down it becomes very fun and very addictive. \n\nPros: \n- Fully detailed shelter to micromanage \n- A wasteland to explore \n- Short quest lines to complete \n- Loads of building options \n\nCons: \n- Exploits (running from every battle with no consequence) \n- Hard start, easy after surviving first hour or so \n\nGetting your shelter together & filling it with happy survivors is a great feeling.
