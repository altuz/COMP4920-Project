You put missing parts in machines and fix them. The game always gives you clear instructions what the machine should do, there is never any confusion about the goal. Most of the problems are timing related, which can be solved by trial and error, but also with a little bit of thinking ahead. For someone who loves games like spacechem and infinifactory, the puzzles are pretty easy to solve, but still fun. \n\nThere is not much of a story so far, but this is only episode 1.\n\nThe artwork looks pretty good, and suits the game perfectly. The same can be said about the music and sounds. It just has this nice atmosphere, that fits perfectly with the game. \n\nBut, without rushing, reading every dialog, and playing around with the machines after i build them, it still only took me about one hour to finish the game. Mostly because of the easy puzzles, I never had to think to hard or was stuck for longer then 30 seconds. The whole game just feels like the tutorial for me. But a good one. \n\nIs it worth it?\nFor the current price and considering the time to complete the game, i would compare it to going to a movie. About the same price per hour. (At least where i'm living). \n\nIf you are looking for a relaxing puzzle-game, with no time pressure, no frustration and no danger of overheating you brain, this game is for you.\n\nIf you are looking for a something spacechem / infinifactory difficult, or just want a lot of playtime for you money, this is not it. \n\nWould I recommend it: YES, if you like mechanical puzzles and don't mind spending the same amount of money as you would spend on a movie. \n\nAm i going to buy episode 2: Already done.\n\n\nEdit: After playing episode 2:\n\nThe puzzles get more complex and difficult to solve. The gameplay lasts a bit longer. The puzzles are still very good, based around a different theme this time. After playing the second episode, it seems that the first one was indeed just the tutorial in how to play the game. The second episode has all the good parts from the first, and improved the one complaint i had. So, even better than the first part.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432661620, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432833907, "recommendationid": "16013981", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489976", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432087571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 69, "steamid": "76561197988105623", "num_games_owned": 786}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Took me just 1.2 hrs to beat the first episode.

I was really expecting twice as much content, even for $5.\n\nThere is a small amount of replayability or non-puzzle interaction.  For example, once you (partially) fix a Space Invaders game, you can play it.  Once you fix a DJ console, you can mix a track.  And if you choose not to complete the 1st episode by traveling to River City, you can take a vehicle to the race track to compete against the clock.  One lap takes about one minute; the best players do it in 49 seconds. This  replay value isn't much, but it's more than most pure puzzle games give you.\n\nIf you are looking for a very short, very casual puzzle game, Machineers would be a good choice.  Kid friendly for mechanically-oriented kids.
