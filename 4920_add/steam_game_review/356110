Isn't going to turn heads, but is a solid platformer that shows me a developer with real potential: As a lot of the design decisions regarding natural player progression, level design, and basic gameplay shows a lot of good design elements and smart decision making. While the game does seemingly lack content over the long haul, the two based action gameplay regarding switching between forms is the highlight here, and while the art and collision detection fails at points, it was an enjoyable experience in the end. I'd pick it up on sale when you have the chance.\n\n+:\n-Good Elements of Level Design here, leading to teaching the player the rules of its world naturally, rather then through a tutorial.\n-Switching between elements is probably the most action packed it gets and can be rewarding\n-Different objectives leads to different paths in the world to go through and try a level differently.\n-Controls are what you would want for game like this and give you the freedom that you need\n-Some designs of the actions are rather nice, despite the 8 bit nature of them.\n\n-:\n-Art sometimes ends up being misleading as a spike end for example is deadly, but the base of the spike is.\n-Can lack oompf. Doesn't stand out at any point, hitting the solid point and nothing more.\n-Music can wear on you after a while.\n-Extra Modes seem derivative of the main mode. \n\nFor Gameplay and More First Impressions:  http://youtu.be/CNFDsA21wSk", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430763153, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430763153, "recommendationid": "15688467", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518654", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440891809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 215, "steamid": "76561197977848487", "num_games_owned": 148}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A hard but addictive die & retry platformer.
