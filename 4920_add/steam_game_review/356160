This was something completely macabre and unnecessary in my humble opinion. I've played some really disturbing horror games before, and enjoyed some of them to their inhumane depth. I played tons of HOGs, that one would think that I'd get sick of the genre by now. But by no means have I ever played a HOG that masquerades as a horror game before, until [i]The Emptiness[/i].\n\nOur pessimistic little game starts with a booming male voice, announcing a state of depression, while a pretty, oh-so dark girl sits in complete darkness. We are informed that we are trapped in a \"symbolic\" house that consists of our deepest fears and unresolved (!) feelings. We should master the secrets of this 4 room apartment, collect letters of some obscure spells to open doors, redefine ourselves in the process and earn our right to leave this place. I suspect that our main character must be a sociopath rather than a sole depressed person, 'cause this is no way an ordinary subconscious with fears.\n\nIn my defense, I'm not in expectancy of great graphics for games. Heck, I love basic unity, I'm alright with games hailing back from 90s and I'm accustomed to playing many 16 bit games even. But this was basically lazily done modelling of the same 4 rooms over and over again, with cheap animations thrown around. We have only two characters in the game - a FMV demon and an angel - and they seem and sound like two-dollar whores rather than clashing aspects of our soul. I'm not gonna even start with the voice acting, because it seems acting itself doesn't exist for those two.\n\nLet's take a close look on the gameplay itself: we are given a made-up word which is supposed to sound mystical, we go through the same rooms over and over again in hopes of finding the letters of the given word around. When we collect the whole word, we unseal a new part of the house, which is rarely that new, and never that interesting. We go through this ordeal with the occasional appearance of a very run on the hill, clich\u00e9 puzzle - which is supposed to present an element of choice in some deeper meaning of life for us - and voila! We complete the game. The game keeps using the same gameplay over and over again, also using the same concepts - like lights on, lights off - until it becomes nauseating.\n\nHere comes the actual question for a game which tries so hard to be scary: is it scary? No, it's not. It's only cheap. It is a collection of the most common and distasteful jump scares ever encountered. The game actually starts with the disclaimer of \"not recommending for the faint of heart\"! That \"disclaimer\" is the most pathetic presentation of self-importance that I've ever encountered in a game, I tell you! Avoid this game like the plague, because if you are obsessive on completing a game that resides in your backlog, finishing this gonna be a chore.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445561691, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460503161, "recommendationid": "18632399", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575156", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430102253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 421, "steamid": "76561197996678922", "num_games_owned": 450}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a hidden object game that tries to hide that it's a hidden object game.\n\nTo it's credit, it doesn't follow the traditional pattern. The game has a single location that expands as you unlock doors and get access to other rooms, but you will continually find yourself looking through the same rooms and in all the same corners and shelves trying to find hidden clues and hidden letters to open up a new door that will give you yet one more room to look through when you reach the next door... and so on.\n\nThere are also some puzzles, and again to the game's credit, they are different variations of familiar patterns... a switch-15 sliding puzzle that has tiles that can rotate along 4 different facings, a series of identical-looking room labyrinth puzzles... but they are the same kinds of puzzles that these games frequently use, and if you know how they function, the newness of the variant fades quickly.\n\nAs far as the atmosphere, well, that's actually fairly cool. The game has a good number of weird moments and jumpscares that happen very suddenly and have little to no warning. There are some trap instances where you walk into a room and suddenly you are warped into a puzzle, good uses of noise, light, and darkness, and some of the strange moments are just plain creepy... but the warning hype that the game tries to give of how this game is dangerous to those with heart conditions, and don't play this if you've an unhealthy state of mind... yeah, no. That is prime huckster talk, coaxing you out of your money to see the mighty egress or man-eating chicken sideshow farce.\n\nGet it on sale if you like puzzles and creepy-weird games, but know that beneath all the hype, you're buying a hidden-object game that wants to give you a fun little scare, and that's all it will do.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429592615, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429592615, "recommendationid": "15472587", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540390", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1434327446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561198035785835", "num_games_owned": 987}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I can't, in good conscience, recommend this game.\n\nI love hidden object games.  Really love them.  I've played so many of them it's stupid.  But this one, I only got through about twenty minutes and the idea of playing any more makes me cringe.  I will probably go back and finish, just because I have a complex about leaving things unfinished, but it will be when I have played through every single other game in my library.  Twice.  Because god, this was so bad.\n\nGameplay feels extremely repetitive and boring.  You essentially wander around the area looking for letters to form a word that will unlock a new area, and then you go back and wander around again looking for the next group of letters in the same area to unlock another new area, and lather, rinse, repeat.  So it appears that you'll spend the whole game reexploring the same few rooms over and over again.  \n\nJumpscares are frequent and gratuitous.  They are startling but not scary (there is a huge difference) and after several in a row, they stop being even startling.  The warning at the beginning about the game not being suitable for people with heart disease and nervous disorders is possibly the most flagrant example of dripping self-importance I have ever seen.\n\nVideo sequences do not synch to the sound, and that plus sub-par acting makes those sequences painful to sit through.  Sound can be jarring in places.  A lot of places, actually.\n\nOverall, it makes me immensely sad to not recommend this, because I had high hopes from the preview pictures and description.  I was expecting something that was on-par with the better developers out there, and instead I got a game that it's going to be a chore to finish someday (and I have NEVER put aside a hidden-object/point-and-click game unfinished before, so I hope that impresses on you how awful I feel this was).\n\nSo please exhaust your other HO game options before you get this, if you feel you must try it.

This is not a hidden object game or really a puzzle game in the traditional sense.   I think this game takes patience and a willingness to take their time on this game because you will be in a 'house' going through the same rooms many times to discover what you need to discover.\n\nBasically your trapped within a 'house' though this is just really within your own mind.  You won't have other characters to interact with however you have a couple of 'guides' that essentially introduce you to the next 'puzzle' or 'mini-game'.\n\nThe puzzles are spell words.  \nThe idea is to search the various rooms of the house and find each letter to the spell word which will open up a new door. \n\n   If you think this very simple then think again.  \n\n While some of the letters you search for may just be easily found by really going over each room with a fine tooth comb, others will prove more difficult and take time and patience to figure out. \n\n sometimes you need to find something first ( an object of some kind to fix something for example) in order to progress because you need to finish a task in order to start your search for the letters of the spell.\n\nIf your looking for a story here there really isn't one.  The story is about you. \n\n\nThis game has a warning at the intro about playing this game for the faint of heart or easily scared or something but don't be to overly excited about that. I think it's just more an atmospheric narration to help with the feeling behind the reason why your there (the 'house' in your mind) and while there are some creepy sounds and sprinkles of some creepy visuals here and there it's not too mind blowing or scary.  There are far more scary games that really need a warning before playing but this isn't one of them. \n\nthat said I thought some of the unexpected sounds or visuals that jumped at me time to time were pretty fun but I'm a fan of the scary in games and other media so in a game it has to really amp up it's creepy sounds and visual for me to get my heart a jumping or make me want to look behind my chair in the darkened room.  \n\nThis is another game I feel I would purchase if I want something a little different but found it on sale or in a bundle which is how I obtained the game so it was super inexpensive and I have no regrets playing it or having purchased it.\n\nThe hint system can be limited but also I kind of liked it that way.  I could click on the ? to only reveal a vague hint and get another click on same hint after the timer is done to reveal more so I didn't have the answer reveled right away and could see if I could do it myself with the little info I had.\n\nThe reviews that said there were no hint system or skip buttons I can only assume were players who had this game when it first came out and since then the developers changed that because there is a hint system and skip buttons in the game.  You also can skip the intro when you start the game after having already played it.  Basically if you come back to the game the intro starts and just click your mouse to go to the 'resume' game screen.   I think that may have not been available at the time too as I read in some reviewers something about not being able to skip the intro. \n\nThe 'mini' games that are sprinkled about required patience as well for the most part but there is a skip button.  Once you click that you do get the chance to decide to not use it so if you still want to give that game a try just click NO. \n\nhappy gaming~\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487545203, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487545203, "recommendationid": "30046444", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515561", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443136464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 308, "steamid": "76561198169311898", "num_games_owned": 1789}, "votes_funny": 20, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Genius.

This would be tolerable if not for the fact that exploring a corner of the room sometimes takes multiple clicks, then you have to go backwards before you can move through the doorway that takes up half of your field of view in the corner you're mindlessly clicking around in.\n\nThe \"jump scares\" in the game become so frequent that you end being more surprised when they DON'T happen. They're completely pointless and you can't click on an object that you need to pick up until a few seconds after the animation is finished playing. It's as if each scare is a video file instead of a seamless part of the game. It destroys the immersion.\n\nThen there are the so-called puzzles. Nothing screams CD-ROM more than the puzzles in this game. They are too easy to be anything but a nuisance and the biggest challenge is figuring out which pixel on the screen you're supposed to click on to make something happen.\n\nOne puzzle requires you to lure a sinister shadow into a dead end of a labyrnith. Sound exciting?\n\nThe shadow ends up being a still video image of a woman in black, and you \"lure\" it by shooting a stupid little orb to make the image move backwards. If you get stuck, you simply shoot her through the wall and she ends up behind you. You can't turn around, though! No...each turn puts you in a different room, so you actually have to walk around the whole damn maze to get back where you need to be. If you're old enough to have played games like 7th Guest and Myst when they first came out, you'll feel like this game is a step backwards from what those were like.\n\nStay away from this multimedia nightmare. \"Gone Home\" is a far superior (and scarier) house-exploring game.

For first 30 minutes - then You are just angry.\n\nThis game is not worth any money.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505409221, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505409221, "recommendationid": "34952936", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 18, "num_reviews": 18, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 12}}
