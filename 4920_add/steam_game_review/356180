Whilst the games concept is a good one its implemented in a way that takes all of the fun out of it as it basically hand holds you all the way through the adventure giving no feeling of freedom and self discovery.  \n\nWhilst some of the graphics are impressive the actual creatures appear in an otherwise lifeless environment which appears clearly incapable of sustaining creatures of this size and quantity which appears one of the many flaws when the game is trying to be 'scientifically accurate'.\n\nWhilst learning about the life styles of these creatures is not without interest the tedious nature of the data extraction and repetative tool use killed the enjoyment for me.  I would have far more preferred to just observe these creatures in their environment and simply tag them to learn more about them from a resulting narrative or info screen rather than having to jump through all the hoops in order to make it game like!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498993520, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498993520, "recommendationid": "33126193", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 48, "total_reviews": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 25}}
