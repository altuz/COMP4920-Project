I got this game on sale a while ago. Never heard of this before, just wanted to try something with the WWII theme. It was a good surprise to find that the game was so large, with 2 big campaings: one for the nazis and one for the russians. Took me many hours to finish it. \n\nI liked the RTS element and also liked that you can't produce units but you rather get reinforcements from time to time. The game is old but the graphics are still decent and the sound and music are quite adequate for a game like this. Also liked the cutscenes that are real footage from that conflict.\n\nFound no bugs or crashes. Runs with no problem on win 7.\n\nFor a game that is usually pretty cheap it packs a lot of content. Lots of different units and many different scenarios with varied goals. Strategy and approach is relevant to win the game and it's rewarding as you get medals for performance. The game is IMO a little hidden gem and is very recommendable for those that like RTS and WWII stuff.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507107204, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507107349, "recommendationid": "35466567", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 35, "total_reviews": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
