Mediocre game Real time strategy, ww2 theme with a ''what if'' scenario, fights between germany/france/america/uk/russia/china, no decent storyline whatsoever, just random VERY repetitive battles and objectives. It's good for the most casual of gamers if you put the difficulty on easy (written as ''low'' in-game). It can be so easy that when defending, you can just speed the game up and you win. But on impossible... holy hell, it can be frustrating! Game mechanics are very clunky, hard to control vehicles, it takes more luck than skill to play, but even so, it takes a bit of skill to play. Just don't compare it with a really good strategy game like starcraft or warcraft. Has mostly existing 1930-1970 tanks (patton, t-54, etc, even leopard 2 if you use cheats). You can move armies around on a map and then go into RTS battles. Can be time consuming, good if you want to relax after a long day from work.\n\ntl;dr: good for very casual gamers if you play it on easy difficulty, and if it's on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498411429, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498411429, "recommendationid": "32780812", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504535", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503347897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561198261371080", "num_games_owned": 21}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "good game but it kept crashing me when i am on the game for 1 min", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496504982, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496504982, "recommendationid": "32155499", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 17, "total_reviews": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 11}}
