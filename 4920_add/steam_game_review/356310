The whole game feels like a cash grab there will be missions where you will keep losing because you do not have the appropriate unit/character/vehicle to deal with the mobs of enemies they will throw at you. The free units they give you takes a while and tedious grind to unlock. \n\nThe better units are locked behind a paywall requiring 100+ dollars to unlock all for a game with a simple yet interesting mechanic. \n\nIt pains me to say this but you are better off playing the android/iphone version, just forget about this game and better yet forget about the company that made Metal Slug. The only thing they really care about is money.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485304305, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485304305, "recommendationid": "29473204", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
