Fun, casual little game. Some levels almost play themselves while others are ridiculously frustrating. I was able to get to the Ark Cluster and could not get past level 6. The amount of adjusting required to perform the orbits without running into obstacles was too much for the mass my comet had. If I were to go back through and get more stars to upgrade my comet, I might have been able to complete it. For a casual game it didn't seem like collecting all the stars should be a requirement to complete levels. I usually play casual games for relaxing fun but Orbit HD really pushes the limits of what I would call 'relaxing.'", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502159992, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502159992, "recommendationid": "34094142", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501080968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 33, "steamid": "76561197996890045", "num_games_owned": 2079}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Orbit HD is an odd little game.\n\nAs far as I can make out, you have to conduct the arc of a comet to circle planets as many times as you can before the comet burns up.\n\nSomewhat picturesque, but not very exciting.\n\nIt seems like it could be a nice little game for some people, but I just found it a bit too boring.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501078869, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501079373, "recommendationid": "33809569", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 26, "total_reviews": 41, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 15}}
