The way the game assaults your senses is both exhausting and immensely satisfying. My play sessions were usually not much longer than an hour because I started to have trouble focusing after a while due to the intensity. This also meant that I never felt bored or like I was grinding. The 30ish hours I played feel like much much longer due to that intensity.\n\nMy first casual playthrough was a great experience on it own. I encountered a difficulty spike somewhere in the middle and another one later on but eventually got past it. When I replayed for S-ranks I started to appreciate the game on a whole new level. On my first playthrough I was just focused on surviving, which was tense enough as it was at my skill-level. When playing for S-ranks you have to play near-perfectly and you have to learn a bunch of new techniques that you didn't need when playing casually. I really got to appreciate how the levels slowly teach you new concepts and then just keep building on them more and more. It was also funny how on my first playthrough the bosses were the most difficult, but with S-ranks it was the levels themselves and the bosses almost felt like a break where you could relax a bit.\n\nI usually don't replay games and the reason I did for Thumper was because its actions were so satisfying to perform and the state of mind I had to be in. If I got too stressed or frustrated I would make too many mistakes and would be unable to proceed. I had to remain calm in the face of repeated failure and the sensory overload the game throws at you. Every time I tried to learn a bit more or improve my muscle memory. That calm combined with the amazing sound, visuals and speed has made it one of my best experiences in gaming.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504716078, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504716078, "recommendationid": "34778960", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533879", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506375739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 254, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 644, "steamid": "76561198021016212", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Finally, a game I feel I didn't waste money on. I\u2019m late and everyone has said everything that needs to be said. One of the faster games out there, seriously. Whaaaaaat? Sliding difficulty and I love how sloppy the turns can feel on the controller. I'd play it. Standard courses are more fun than the boss fights. 5 hours in and it has left more expression and lasting memory than anything in the recent past. Also worth noting this game seems to expose a common thread in modern videogames that require story and narrative before the industry takes itself seriously.
