Beautiful design. 2.Campaign pretty easy until you reach the last 2 levels or so; 3. Achievements probably impossible to make. 4. Multiplayer doesn't work.\n\nI don't remember buying this game but since I discovered it in my library and looked cute enough to give a try, so I did. The design is simply wonderful, I love everything about it: the colors, the movement, every element (except the ship maybe, 's kinda weird) so it gets 10/10 from me. But after 4h trying to finish the campaign, there's not too much left of it. You can change the difficulty and lose your shit because no matter what handicap you choose, you still get your ass kicked. Multiplayer doesn't actually work but there's something interesting enough..watching other's people replays..?! \n\nI really want to recommend this..but no.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504898657, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504898657, "recommendationid": "34821424", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 81, "total_reviews": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 12}}
