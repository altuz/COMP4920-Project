I love the different atmospheres and unique car styles. Makes perfect gameplay for a commentary video. This game is criminally underrated and deserves a ton of more exposure. There are a ton of community tracks which makes fun gameplay for a video or just plain entertainment. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone if you're looking for a casual, chill drive or a deeply-invested, intense racing game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504844258, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505068012, "recommendationid": "34807658", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
