Like many other users has said, a perfrect mix of age of empires with the best of what Star Wars has to offer. \nThe sound effects,voice acting and units are amazing, for it's date that is. Graphics wise I say that they are still holding up quite well.\n\nSo where is the catch? Sadly the game doesn't run quite well on modern sytems and if It does you will have to deal with cropped resolutions and other issues with compatibilty.\nIn a nutshell the game wasnt updated at all during this whole time. One thing that pointed me in that direction was that my antivirus picked Up an ingame file as a virus. A false postivie one can imagine, but this dam thing was happening to me when the Game originally was release It.\nI opened a support ticket just to be sure, and they said things like \"we cant do anything..\" \"we dont know\". Oh but they did finished the support ticket replay email with a \"may the force be with you\".\n\nHa! Well I guess they are right on that one with this title.\n\nCan the game run? Sure, but it's not a 100% garantee. \nIt's the game and support outdated and abandoned? You bet.\nIt's the game fun? No doubt about It. \nShould you support this kind of software or game sales?
