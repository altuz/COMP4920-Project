Worldbuilding is very well integrated with the story. Discovering more with each route about the intrigues of the court is the game's unique strength, and the issues burdening various characters are both serious and affecting. The character spites are rather rough and pasteled, but the CG art pieces are all excellent. The very different pathways the heroine can take make this quite a roleplaying game, with a chance to form her character on quite different ways. This game is surprisingly short, which emphasizes how well crafted the routes are, except for one route (I won't spoil which) that is a total dud. Despite stronger worldbuilding this game probably loses to Cinderella Phenomenon on the scores of romantic chemistry, but chemistry is there, and this is certainly a very strong game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500014864, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500014864, "recommendationid": "33529940", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501050035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 142, "steamid": "76561198204905047", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The Royal Trap is neither an great game, nor a terrible one. I am choosing to not recommend it only because its 91% approval rating (at the time of writing this review) is a bit too high than the game deserves.\n\nPros:\n- A strong, intelligent, and practical female protagonist. Madeleine Valois is definitely among the upper echelon of otome MCs. She consistently surprised me with her level-headed decisions and rational way of thinking. The only fault I can find is that she tends to introspect in long inner monologues of block text, which may be difficult to peruse through.\n\n- Polished CGs. The artwork is generally quite good. I thought the sprites were slightly awkward-looking, but that's mostly subjective.\n\nCons:\n\n- BAD PACING. Probably the biggest reason I cannot recommend this game is because of the build-up of romance with the various bachelors is practically non-existent. The only romance that feels somewhat natural is Oscar's, since he and the MC had a preexistent history. [spoiler] Callum's [/spoiler] route left me completely confused and off-kilter [spoiler] (MC and him have one friendly conversation in the woods, and they start making out the next time they see each other in the dungeon? What the hell?) [/spoiler] Another route [spoiler] Nazagi [/spoiler] is essentially a business/political transaction and has no romance in it.\n\n- Repetitive soundtrack. Certain songs are linked to characters or scenarios (dangerous music to dangerous situation, lively music to Oscar's appearance, etc.) This transition was at times abrupt and very noticeable (say MC and co. are in danger, and suddenly Oscar pops up with a happy little tune).\n\n- Subpar plot twists. In many otome games, playing though each route gives you various clues to solve the overall mystery [spoiler] in this game's case, who Cassidy really is [/spoiler]. In contrast, the MC may arrive at a certain theory, have it \"disproved,\" only for the ending to reveal that the first theory was really true. In my opinion, this removes any sense of suspense and mystery around the plot.\n\nFinal Rating: 6/10 \nI would only recommend this game if you got it for half-price or less.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501123590, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501123590, "recommendationid": "33822801", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499902", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 69, "total_reviews": 76, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
