It has the worst German translation I ever read in any VN, and there is no option to switch it back to English.\nI couldn't stand to play the third and fourth part. I even wish to tear my brain out to forget I had to read such nonsense.\n\nAside from that, the game would have been enjoyable. But it sucks that there is no language option, so I give it a thumbs down.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506851941, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506851998, "recommendationid": "35375209", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
