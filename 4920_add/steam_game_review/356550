This edition of the East Tower saga features a boy named Kuon who wants to escape reality... So for some reason, he is trapped in an endless loop... and so are you. How... nice. You again play Sakuya (you can rename her), a young woman who... does not want to act girly. As such, when offered the chance to be a test subject for her cousin's new attraction for women, she manages to convince him to let her try the other attraction... the one geared towards men. In the first few moments, she finds herself trapped with one of the four other participants. Oh, and since she can choose her avatar, she chose to partake as a male. Oh, and the real Kuon... may not be that old...\n\nThere are three endings. The bad ending is unlocked if you make a wrong choice (one of which unlocks a CG). The neutral/friendship ending depends on you choosing the lesser of two choices at the end of a stage. And the good/love ending is the better of those two choices. Oh, and choosing that better one also unlocks a small additional scene for the story (and accompanying CGs). There is a split in the route for the Love Act/Scene/Chapter, as you can choose to have Kuon in his real form or adult form.\n\nThe game is beautiful, at least for the time. I begin to think these were made back-to-back, as the small issues seem to get only slightly better each volume.\n\nAlso, my suggestion would be to buy the East Tower Complete Edition. Especially as the last volume is almost three quarters of the price of the bundle...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501732991, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501733063, "recommendationid": "33984812", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504500", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
