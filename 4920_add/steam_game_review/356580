It clearly pulls deeply from GBA era sidescrollers, but fails to understand why those games were excellent. The game features good art and overall excellent music, but is plagued by an inconsistant, often nonsensical script and tone, extremely poor level design, and a sizeable pile of half baked mechanics. It has the seed of something interesting, but none of it adds up in to a particularly strong finish.\n\nThe game's mechanics have a lot of promise, but the stealth is legitimately bad and rarely engineered to create any interesting situations. Enemies are extremely dumb, and often kill each other with friendly fire. The player gets very poor feedback on most things, outside of \"enemies alerted\". Beyond that, the free roaming world is slow and often extrmely confusing, with no maps or guides. The player is often asked to visit locations via landmarks they haven't seen, with no reminder text about where they are going. Most missions are, in the opposite, extremely linear with no decision making -- generally rewarding a brute-force \"kill everything\" playstyle.\n\nThe storytelling has a variety of problems, too -- specifically in that the game starts in media res to create mystery, but never really gives you a motivation for any aspect of the story, and it's so interested in being mysterious that every conversation is either a direct order or a long, confounding speech, until you finally encounter a boss who vomits exposition on you in a way that not only seems extremely out of place but is also extremely tedious. The plot revolves around a shadowy puppet master, but their plans are so inane that its laughable. Both endings to the game utilize a sudden reveal of major plot details in order to create surprise, but ultimately just undercut the rest of the storytelling.\n\nThe other plot details raise significant concerns. The game revolves are a feminist dystopia, but doesn't seem interested in exploring that idea outside of a cartoonish visage (contrasted by the dark apathy and angst of the protagonist);  the main character is a trans woman who is oppressed by this society, but we're never really shown this outside of a single optional side mission. Its filled with all sorts of negative feminist stereotypes as well, with little justification. After playing through the whole game, it seemed that the designer was trying to create an interesting setting and explore some outside politics, but simply had an extremely poor grasp on what they were depicting.\n\nIn the end, Aerannis is a short, frustrating, buggy ride. It's not terrible; it's just not good.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499530176, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499530176, "recommendationid": "33378571", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517773", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503637525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 521, "steamid": "76561198078569376", "num_games_owned": 41}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Aerannis is a 2D stealth shooter/platformer with some Metroidvania elements set in a dystopian future secretly ruled by shapeshifting demons. It has beautiful background art, an excellent, moody soundtrack, and great writing wherein it fairly successfully tackles modern political topics in a progressive way. Most notable is the fact that a large proponent of the game's women-only society subscribes to a trans-exclusionary radical feminism that actively oppresses Ceyda, Aerannis's trans protagonist. \n\nThe combat, stealth puzzles, and platforming are fun and engaging, while being just difficult to stump me in a few places. Controls are occasionally a little finnicky, but not so much so that I ever felt like putting the game down. If you're a fan of stealth, you will find Aerannis enjoyable.\n\nI was mostly drawn to this game because of its trans protagonist and progressive politics. Reading some commentary around the game online, it seems some people are hesitant to believe Aerannis truly is progressive due to it being co-opted by some discriminatory groups (ie. Gamergate) because the game appears, on a surface level, to be anti-feminist. GG also bought its way into the game with a cameo thanks to a Kickstarter tier. Rest assured that their presence in the game isn't noticeable if you don't know what to look for, and the game's overall message (\"transphobia is bad\") is clear by the end. Either way, most of the politics fall away in the last hour or so in favour of the very satisfying Lovecraftian conspiracy based around the shapeshifters that have engineered the game's world into its current state. Aerannis is enjoyable on a variety of levels and I highly recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503645932, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503645932, "recommendationid": "34475590", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 26, "total_reviews": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 17}}
