Spooky's House of-waitwaitwait shit, its JUMP SCARE MANSION not House of Jumpscares. Hahaha, what are you talking about? To get hype for the HD Renovation, I decided to get back into the reviewing spirit and share my thoughts on this wonderful little game. So strap in, folks! [spoiler] THINK YOU CAN SURVIVE 1000 ROOMS?\t[/spoiler] Let's get straight into it with...\n\n[h1] Story\t[/h1]\nThe story is that you are an anonymous player, probably self insert, investigating a mansion that no one has ever come out of. You're greeted with the host, Spooky. A cute little ghost girl that owns the mansion. She invites you to delve through a thousand rooms to find what lies at the end...If there's even an end. Legit, she honestly doesn't know. As you delve through the floors, you start to realize just how twisted this seemingly cute mansion is. Obscure, dark places are explored as you find yourself running from unimaginable terrors. At the end...well...spoilers time. [spoiler] You are greeted with a monstrous creature... Specimen 9. He appears in a new form, what seems to be a skinless humanoid with red dots in the black, soulless eyes. He challenges you to a battle, where you must counter with your axe. (found in Room 555) He fights back with creatures of the dead and hands of the damned. Once you kill this thing, two possible endings occur. If you have killed or destroyed plenty of stuff, Spooky will make you her next Specimen. A person who went insane, and would chase down to chop anyone who would roam through the mansion. Or, the \"GOOD\" ending. The roof falls upon you as you are denied of your victory. Spooky invites you into her army of ghosts to become the most feared army in the world, despite being adorable. What a fuckin ending. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Gameplay & Presentation\t[/h1]\nThis game looks beautiful, the style works so well with how it changes on you. It goes from a cutesy looking 8 to 16 bit dungeon with an adventure time-like artstyle to a HORRIFYING nightmare with creatures you wish never existed. It impresses me how much this game spooked me. As for gameplay, you walk about in first person through the thousand rooms Spooky has set. Eventually, you will encounter the SPECIMEN. Creatures that want to end your life. There are many kinds of Specimen, so you must know what you're dealing with. They have their own signature sounds...and haunting music whenever they draw near. Most of them guard a specific big room, usually the 10th of every hundred. For example, 310. The appearance of the child-like puppet, Specimen 6. He only comes forth when you do not look at him. And if he takes your life...I hope you didn't mind him taking your eyes. Once you get an Axe in room 555, you can start choppin down Specimen 01 (The harmless cardboard cutout) and other creatures. Just...not the specimens. They're invincible.\n\n[h1] Final Score [/h1]\nThis game gets an A+ from me. It does an excellent job at spooking players and getting them hooked with lore. There's also a DLC that's only 1.99 called Kalamari Hospital. More spook, why not? Give it a whirl.

I will always think of this game being called its original name before some German company \"Spooky House Studio\" put forth a cease and desist against the game's creators because they were attempting to trademark the name \"Spooky House\". Although irritating, I find the creator's of Spooky's reaction to handling the necessary name change on the game's main menu to be quite amusing even to this day. But for the sake of this review, I will refer to this game by it's current name.) was certainly a game that subverted my expectations in many ways when I first watched YouTube Let's Player \"Markiplier\"play the game back when the game was still pretty new and slowly getting a name for itself. A friend of mine was curious about the game after seeing it in some video thumbnails, so we decided to check it out and we both found ourselves enjoying the game more than we were expecting. Its only recently that I've finally had a chance to play it for myself, and I've been enjoying it.\n\nIn Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion, you take the role of an amateur historian that decides to make a trek up a mountain to learn about a house on a hill that has been at its location for as long as anyone can remember, to the point that its origins have been lost and forgotten. Upon entering the house, you encounter a cute ghost girl who challenges you to make it through all 1000 rooms of the house and see what lies at the end. And that's basically the whole premise. Pretty simple, right? \n\nSpooky's Jumpscare Mansion is basically an affectionate parody of various horror game plots and tropes crammed into a little package that goes from starting out silly and playful to geniunely frightening with very real dangers that you, the player, must overcome as you travel through the various rooms of the house, otherwise they will eat your face (among other things, depending on what exactly you end up encountering). You generally have to move past these face eaters by outrunning them before you are killed, going from room to room and hoping that you'll eventually lose them. You'll also occasionally come across various notes left behind by other people who were in the house before you, which will help flesh out elements of the story, such as some of the rooms you will encounter and the enemies that are trying to kill you. There are also the chance you'll come across some rooms with a few easter eggs scattered about, although I won't go into the detail as to what they are -- that's something that those among you with a curious mind can look into yourselves. \n\nSimple premise, simple gameplay, and the main game is free to play (and I don't mean \"free to play\" as in the sort of thing you'd typically see in the mobile market of games. The only money you can put into this game is what you decide to buy out of the game's currently available DLC, but I feel that the DLC story \"Karamari Hospital\" is worth investing into if the main game manages to catch enough of your fancy, because I feel that Karamari Hospital takes numerous elements from the main game, such as atmosphere and how it instills a sense of dread in you, and improves upon it and makes how you encounter some of the dangerous elements less predictable, all the while fleshing out the overall story of the game, although I won't say how -- like with with the easter eggs, figuring out how the Karamari Hospital DLC fleshes out the story of the overall game is something I'll leave entirely up to you. No spoilers from me.\n\nI realize that the idea of simply running away from your adversaries every time you encounter them while going from room to room until you reach the end goal, all the while exploring new elements in the environment as they present themselves, is not for everyone, especially in a horror game, and the game's overall aesthetics may turn some people away at first glance too. But for those who don't mind such a style of gameplay (if not outright enjoy it), and enjoy (or can at least tolerate) games with cartoonish, silly aesthetics just fine, then I'd recommend giving Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion a try. Doubly so if you want to play a game that might make you laugh if you enjoy horror games. The game doesn't mind poking fun at itself and the story elements/tropes it throws at you, and its got plenty of them, so there's bound to be SOME joke or two that will make any horror game enthusiast chuckle. \n\nOn a final note, a word of advice to those who decide to try out the game and want a tip to help them get through -- save often. You never know what kind of dangers you may encounter and when, so it's a good idea to save often in case something happens and you don't want to get set back too far. Of course, if you're a skillful player, you'll probably be able to easily afford taking some risks here and there, but if you ever feel unsure of yourself or just want to be cautious, it never hurts to save your game when you can. \n\nAnyway, this is my review of Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion. I don't regret my time with both watching and playing it, and I hope to see the creators of the game go places and make even better games with whatever experience they have gained making this game and it's expansions. Also, to the creators, thanks for making a game that has given me and my friend some fond memories to look back on.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1480301804, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1480323557, "recommendationid": "27910427", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516241", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489093363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 217, "steamid": "76561198305947960", "num_games_owned": 17}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The atmosphere is unnerving as you walk through the halls of the mansion.
