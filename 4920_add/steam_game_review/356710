The barriers are force-fields which allow units and damage to only pass one way. Often you have to be careful when entering a space as you will not be able to see if there are enemies within.\n\nIt is like a maze, uncovering rooms as you move along the best route you can see.\n\nI like that the units have different benefits, so I often split my band ...each with a scout and an assault drone. The scout moving forward and disrupting enemy weapons/flipping barriers with the assault then following to destroy enemy units. Heavies are good for clearing heavily defended rooms.\n\nI like that the game is side-view rather than top-down. You have to consider which rooms to advance into, cover, barriers, sight etc. It just seems like a more effective way to present an area than top-down, reagardless; it works very well for this game.\n\nI like the backgrounds.\n\nYou can upgrade drones to have different abilities or fulfil certain tasks. I always unlock hacking and pick the best disrupter for scouts and increase clip capacity and unlock mines for the assaults. Accuracy improvement would be a good idea for heavies.\n\nA really fun strategy game.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427900208, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1427900208, "recommendationid": "15155705", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512222", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438620830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 533, "steamid": "76561198038963412", "num_games_owned": 1350}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "8/10 Great for the price, but has a feeling that more refinement is in the works\nIf you're feeling nostalgic for Lazer Squad then grab some BoD action.
