A world where Middle Eastern, Mesoamerican, and Indian cultures combine is very literal.\n\nHowever, the first third plays like any of the other numerous Choice of Games. You work your way through childhood studying your preferred stat, and make the rest of the choices based on the stat. Some interesting path diversions occur with the Gods. The first choice, which God do you worship, has the most effect on your plot. Choose wisely, because it has the most effect on how you play (well). Because of the differences in the way each God is handled, roleplayers will be able to do multiple runs. Single-run players are advised to consider their preferences. Gods are simple creatures, and about as broad-minded as Balkoth.\n\nThe middle third plays like Choice of the Broadsides or Sabres of the Infinity. There's a war. You can't get out of it. The best route to take is to play to your chosen strength (read stat) and God. You can lose. On a positive note, the game provides some options for recovery. Not every loss or death need be permanent.\n\nThe last third is Indiana Jones. You go splunking with your cohorts, meet a few demons, and steal artifacts. It is a dramatic change from the first two sections. There is more character-building. Many of the characters in the first two sections are non-descript, and if you saved/helped them, you aren't sure why you helped them. The last third helps explain.\n\nThe game is nice, if short. If you're bored, hankering for a choose your adventure, and you need a jungle adventure/diplomacy checker/big plain battle, it works. It has some good descriptions about costumery, customs, and jewelery that fill out the world. The various Gods provide good replay.\n\nBut, it isn't a very good introduction to this play-style. If you've never played a choose your own adventure, this isn't the first one you should pick up. Accent marks can be wearying. Stat specialists are encouraged. The entry into the world, ie. the first question, is very dependent on knowing the world. You can pick up some, read some, restart some, but maybe not enough. \n\nMy advice for beginners or intermediary CYOA players is to wait. Play one of the medieval, napoleonic, or oriental adventures.

It is too short. When finally something interesting was starting to happen, in the next slide there was an epilogue. The boast of \"many thousands [can't remember] words novel\" probably comes from different routes. Well, some people usually complaining about CoG games (\"the choices don't matter at all to the story!\") may be satisfied, however for me the story ended when it was just starting.\n2. It has pretty big barrier of enterance - the setting is quasiprecolumbian America (Tekumel). Not many of us are familiar with it, and, what is REALLY ANNOYING, the author introduced a new quasiprecolumbian language which is EVERYWHERE and uses \"Tekumelian\" words in amount which made me wondering about what I'm reading. Yeah, it probably builds some atmosphere - but when you get used to it, the story ends (look at 1.).\n3. The story is plain and simple (mild spoilers ahead) - creating some background of your character, then some battle, then some dungeon crawling with plot twist at end - and, well, that's all, plus some usual CoG romances.
