I bought the game, started it up, and found tabs for a handful of different game modes. Alas, only the tutorial and the main game tabs seemed accessable so I chose the tutorial. Once in I was unable to interact with anything at all, thus rendering the tutorial a waste of time. Okay, that's fine, it's EA of course, so I tried the main game. That turned out to be the exact same thing as the tutorial. The only other playing options were 2 tabs that were for testing- TESTING!! \n\nI decided to withold any negative thoughts and instead posted my problem on the forums, thinking maybe I had missed something. The next day one of the Devs (beast) replied to my post stating I shouldn't have been able to access the main menu tab in the first place because he is still working on it to get it ready. Oh really? Then why is this product ( I refuse to call it a game anymore) on here? I can't say for sure but with such decietfully misleading info being given to entice the unwary to purchase this product, I don't have much faith in the people involved as of now. I may be shown to be wrong and hope I end up wrong. If that happens I will personally apoligise to Beast and will update this review to reflect any positive changes taking this product foreward but for now stay away from it.

In fact, all of the \"Settings\" consist of three options: Screen Resolution, Volume (only main volume, too), and generic graphics quality.\n\nOn my machine, which relatively new and built for gaming, the framerate was hugely jumpy right from the initial screen regardless of Generic Graphics Setting.\n\nBut being very hard of hearing, the inability to mute or quiet the music so that I can hear other things was a deal breaker.\n\nThe audio also pops constantly. I think it's just the music, but since I can't adjust the different sources of sound, I can't be sure.\n\nThere are clipping problems right in the load area. Seeing through walls, walking through rocks, etc.\n\nThere's dust/fog so thick that you can't see more than about 30 feet, but even what you see more than about 20 feet away has NO TEXTURES applied. You have to get within about 20 feet for a texture!\n\nThe roofs on buildings are generic roof pieces overlapping one another, so that shingles run into one another.\n\nThere's literally zero explanation of what to do. You have no idea what the controls are. No idea what your goals are. Nothing.\n\nThere are generic, idantical bad guys in the starting area who have these name plates above them with their level, type, etc. Those plates don't ever disappear, so they block your vision when you're near the bad guys. That's epic.\n\nYou are told that you are given a sword, and if you click around you eventually pull up a menu with the sword there, and you can click equip, but ... nothig seems to happen. You wield no sword. I have hit every key on the keyboard and I cant' draw the sword. No clue what to do.\n\nGarbage in every way. This is someone's project to learn how to use Unity. That is literally all this is.\n\nRefund requested.\n\nLet me add that I hope you will all click the \"flag\" button and report this product as \"broken\".
