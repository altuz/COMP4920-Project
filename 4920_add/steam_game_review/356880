Sharp colors combined with music that complements the visuals immensely make the aesthetic value of the game worth so much more than the small amount of $1.49 that i paid for the game.\n\nThe story is apparently about a tribesman on the planet Eron who uses his ability to switch between 2 parallel worlds to combat aliens that have invaded this realm. The world switching mechanic is a pretty sweet concept and not something i've seen in many other games and it's applied here so beautifully taht in a matter of minutes it becomes second nature and the game starts to very fluid.\n\nThe controls are simple and few buttons are in use, but as the game is intended for controller use, there's no option for button mapping, which would be great to have. But if you do have a controller then the game controls just beautifully and is very smooth and the only thing i have to complain about it is that many of the platforms are placed so far away that you need to go to the absolute edge to reach it and it's not easy to time it correctly which makes me think that this is just a gimmick to elongate the gameplay.\n\nI for one wholeheartedly recommend this game, especially since it has such a low price.

When I first bought the game, I hated it. The lack of interchangeable controls angered me because I'm left handed, and not once did I ever let go of the sprint key, making the walk option useless. Ironically enough, after I returned the game, all of these problems were removed. I decided to give Eron another shot, and I bought it again using the money I got from returning the game. The beautiful scenery and the upbeat, nicely done music make Eron an immersive experience. The only complaints I have are the fact that there's a very cheap feeling fall damage mechanic, the lack of checkpoints, the inability to change direction in midair, and that the music repeats everytime you die. Don't let those discourage you from buying this game, however.

Landing on these platforms might sound easy, but you need to be precise, co-ordinated and quick with your shifting. \n\nYou are thrown into the game without any instructions, which I found to be a plus point. Considering that this game was meant to be a difficult platformer, being thrown into, blank, adds to the difficulty. No idea how to do what, take time figuring out and getting used to the controls, I found that to be a plus point in terms of difficulty.\n\nThe level design is quite good. The puzzles were pretty challenging but not as much as I thought them to be. After you've caught on to what's going on and actually focus, they turn out to be quite simple. Of course, you learn through trial and error.\nAs you progress through the levels, you encounter spheres that you need to destroy and explosive ones that you have to evade. Shifiting worlds saves you from the explosions caused by the explosive ones. You have to be really quick in shifting in and out as majority of the time, platforms underneath you shift as well. Won't be saying more, \"puzzle\" eh?\n\nThe story has really no effect. It's just basically another level that drags on until you finish it. That's kind of the main problem, there's no \"motivation\" to play further on other than just finishing the game. The art style was cool and all, but not as much that would push me further to see what the game brings on in the next level other than a different puzzle.\n\nThe jump mechanic is kind of weird, once you stop in mid air, you're just going to fall down no matter what. You can't do anything to change that outcome. In a way, it's a good addition to the difficulty but also quite an annoyance.\n\nThe shifting mechanic sometimes just breaks, randomly, there's no going back. You have to die to start back at the beginning of the level to get it working again. It's quite irksome to have to do the entire thing again and it not being your fault. Pretty cool if it gets fixed.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty retro and quite catchy. Does suit the atmosphere of the game, but after a while, it gets really, really repetitive. Not the type of repetitive that would be fun to hear to, though.\n\nOverall, considering the up and downs of this game and its price, I'd recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441383966, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441386561, "recommendationid": "17879047", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450905086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 201, "steamid": "76561198124281747", "num_games_owned": 61}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is stupid hard, but, it is also stupid fun.\n\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing and I love the feel once you finally figure out how to beet the lvl.\n\nIf your up to the challenge, its a great game for only 30 cents (or $2)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438525560, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438525560, "recommendationid": "17350788", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504668", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1426808465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561198068659798", "num_games_owned": 17}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Eron is a 2D side-scrolling platform game, published by Red Splat Games, in which you play as a local tribesman on a quest to stop an invading race of aliens who have destroyed your home village. It relies heavily on reflexes to navigate in between two separate layers of the game world. Fair warning, be prepared to die. A lot.\n\nDon\u2019t let that dissuade you from playing this game though, as it is immensely satisfying when you do finally get the hang of the controls and are able to progress past whatever particular obstacle is hindering your progress. Although I would also recommend playing on a controller, if you have access to one, as it was clearly designed to be played this way and requires quick reflexes to switch back and forth in-between layers. That\u2019s not to say that it is impossible to play on a keyboard, but due to a lack of button mapping options, you will be stuck with the default keyboard layout which is probably not the most efficient setup. \n\nThe level design is incredibly well balanced, with each level being just long enough that it can be completed in around a minute, which is rather handy, considering how often you are likely to die before you manage to master the techniques required to pass each challenge. This in turn means that you can be back to where you were in anywhere between a matter of seconds to just a minute or two. \n\nThe difficulty increases fairly across each level, adding a new element of danger to the ones found in preceding levels. The only real issue I have with level design is the large, red and black balls that you have to destroy in order to progress through the level. It\u2019s not eliminating them that is the issue, but the sensitivity of them; you must be almost directly in the middle to destroy them, so phasing into them at the edges will cause you to just pass through them without destroying them. There is also a point where you must clear a rather large chasm by jumping into one and using it as a booster for your jump. However this technique is not explained at all in-game, and so can be a little confusing to pass until you figure it out for yourself. \n\nThe graphics are simple and effective, although I personally believe a little more work could be done to the main character, as well as differentiating between the large black and red balls that you need to destroy in order to progress through most levels, and the smaller, but identical balls that will kill you on contact. However it is the nostalgia inducing 16-bit music that really sells this game for me, with each level having its own distinctive style that fits beautifully within the game. \n\nFor only $1.49, this game is worth every cent, and provides a solid and challenging platforming experience. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426680727, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1426680727, "recommendationid": "14945637", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504374", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1427306561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 22, "steamid": "76561198075273648", "num_games_owned": 114}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A very nice concept indeed, but the lack of checkpoints as well as the lack of music continuation, means song beginnings are always heard, which can be rather frsutrating considering they sound like good songs.

This is a tough cookie. I really like the game. It gives me a new level of decievingly hard that I haven't seen for a long time in a platformer such as this. There are no giant spinning spikes of death or vicious monsters trying to eat you. Just you, floating black spheres, and your reaction time. I've played this game quite a bit on a friend's account, so disregard my play time when I say this will make you frustrated throughout the entire game.

I can safely say this is the ultimate speedrun game, but if you don't record it no one will believe you since there are no save games and no achievements. (Hint: when you reach the oh-so slightly too wide gap near the beginning of the game, you need to jump from directly under the center of the black sphere to get the jump boost. Trying to jump at a normal angle will leave you seething for an hour and a half like me. Don't be a me.) I personally play my own music over the game so I don't really care of the music starts over when you die, but I see this as a plus with this game as there are no awkward song skips during actual gameplay.
