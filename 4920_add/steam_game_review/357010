Graphics are nice, unlike most games of this sort it was not built for smartphones which shows in the slick visuals and presentation. \n\nGameplay is simple, you dodge obstacles until you get to the end of the mission. Stick to move, trigger to boost. There are also three different camera modes: third person zoomed, third person close, and first person.\n\nMissions have various objectives to complete with bronze, silver, and gold ranks attainable. There is the standard time trial in addition to a mode where you're blowing up mines (point the crosshair at them and you shoot automatically), one where you're collecting pickups, and boss fights. Missions get steadily tougher, especially as you progress through the sectors, each of which introduce new obstacles and differently themed visuals to encounter.\n\nThere's a solid amount of content here with 6 sectors, each of which presumably has 9 missions. You will also unlock survival mode fairly early on into the campaign.\n\nSuccess is largely tied to how well you manage your boost. Boosting gives a short increase to your mauverability, so using it in bursts can be beneficial in certain areas. For time trials you generall want to boost as much as  possible, but you will start to overheat eventually. If you completely overheat your ship blows up and you have to restart the mission. Letting off the boost lets your ship cool down, as represented by a bar at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThere is a progression system where you collect coins to level up. Leveling up grants you an even larger chunk of coins. You then spend them on new ships, ship upgrades, and powerup duration upgrades which will be required in order to achieve gold rank on some missions.\n\nEach mission requires a certain ship, so if you spent too much and don't have enough to unlock the one you need to progress, you may need to go back and grind missions you've already completed.\n\nThe game's music is generic, I recommend turning it off and playing your own instead. Sound effects are also nothing to write home about but they get the job done.\n\nI have one major gripe and it's that the layout of the missions seems to be somewhat randomized. Placement of obstacles is always the same, but the type of obstacle you encounter can differ slightly. This has the potential to create zones from hell that are almost impossible to navigate without forgoing your boost completely, which is a big problem on time trial missions.\n\nPowerup types are also random, which has a terrible effect on gameplay. For example, there are some sections of each mission where you will get a powerup right before hitting some ridiculously tightly packed obstacles. You were obviously meant to get the shield powerup, which will let you clip right through everything while invulnerable, but instead the game decided to give you the unlimited boost powerup, which is next to worthless here. Likewise, you will also encounter long, open sections with no obstacles at all and lots of coins to pick up. You were obviously meant to have the unlimited boost powerup here, but the game decided to give you shield invulnerability instead, which will end up being completely wasted.\n\nAll this randomization means achieving gold rank is often a matter of repeating the mission over and over until you get the perfect setup: the right powerups when you need them, and obstacles that can be navigated without sacrificing speed.\n\nOverall though, there is enough content and polish here to warrant a recommendation.
