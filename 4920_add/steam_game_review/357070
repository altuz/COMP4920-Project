I wish there were more games like this, the kind that you can just pick up, start playing with no nonsense, and then put back down because you feel fulfilled (or decided on a better use of your time).\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome, the pixel art is very well done, the gore is comical, and the different class mods add some spice. There's no story here, just bullet hell and you trying to beat your previous score. Simple, fun, worth much more than what the developer is selling it for.
