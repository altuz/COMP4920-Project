It's not bad, but it doesn't stand out compared to others. It looks fresh and clean on the outside, but it is repetitive and gets boring for me. It's a little better in Co-op play. I can see that it would be a good time waster to play on a phone, but for a PC or console game, it needs to be a lot more. One of the disappointing aspects of the game is the impact of hits and throws. I feel like I'm punching or tossing feathers, so it doesn't feel satisfying. You'll get power-ups and special moves during the game, but it didn't change the feeling for me. The appearance of the game is great, it just needs to be more innovative and have more impact when playing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499547658, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499547658, "recommendationid": "33385656", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500165", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 26, "total_reviews": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 9}}
