So ensure a stable connection and close proximity with your opponent to expect a fun game. There aren't many playing in Australia at least so grab a buddy.\n\nPlaying it as a local 1v1 fighting game or just fooling around to find the flashiest touch of death combos is the main draw and is immensely satisfying.\n\nHowever the game is lacking in extra modes. With just arcade and Hero vs Heralds mode to play alone in addition to the standard vs fights. \n\nGraphics show their age is some respects but is generally well masked by the bold art style. Morrigan's bat effects are an extreme example.\nMusic and sound design are great. The effects are satisfying and you can feel the characters personality through their mainly techo styled themes. \nFun both in learning from the start to refining your playstyle.\n\nFair warning though. Marvel has always had bullshit and Umvc3 is no different. But for some people that ridiculousness is part of the allure.\n\nI also broke my pad playing this game.
