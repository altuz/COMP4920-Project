Flash forward several years \"Star Control 2\" was released, Bigger, Brighter, higher resolution, and a fully fledged campaign that had one of the best stories - ever.\n\nI bought \"500 Years, Act 1\" because it looked eerily similar to such a classic franchise (and I like collecting games) and to some extant it did bring give me a certain feeling of nostalgia, the artwork certainly has the '80's / '90's retro look, the gameplay / story is basic yet interesting(ish), as were the sound effects.\n\nDid this game live up my StarCon (1 & 2) inspired hopes, no, not really, no.\nIn fact definitely not.\n\nUnfortunately  the story, which is kind of intersting, is far too short. And then just like my previous sentence, it just ends with the promise of a continued story in the form of DLC to come. Much like the games of the '80's (and even some modern ones) there is no real decision making in upgrades, nothing to spend your non existant monies on you simly get to upgrade your energy levels and place power in systems to improve them - a simple system that works, but is nothing exceptional.\n\nIt would be great if the dev's could rub some funk of this game and include resources / money and a larger playing field, in fact there is a lot that *could* be put into this game which would add to the experience .\n\nIf you have read down to here (congratulations) you might be thinking I would give this game a terrible review, oddly enough the opposite is true, for all its shortfalls it was an enjoyable game with some good potential, and maybe, just maybe, with some support (and sales) that potential might just be realised.\n\n\nP.S.   As this game stands I have no idea how Valve has put a ~$8 price tag on it, buy it on special $2 - $3 is chump change and almost certainly worth it to try to entice the dev's to add more content.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436863243, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437035175, "recommendationid": "17040347", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509248", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1455599808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 124, "steamid": "76561197988994736", "num_games_owned": 2058}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I think the mostly negative reviews are unfair. This is a good game. Harkens back to the days of Starcon.... True space exploriation and interaction with an interesting back story.  I actually hope to get to play the second act someday.  It was fun and challenging and funny.  Probably not worth 8 dollars though.  Get it on special-- at about 2-4 dollars I would say its worth it.  The biggest drawback is how short it is, and the graphics could use a little punching up.

Just Wow.\nI really dont know what else to say.  I completely understand that this is an independent game and a low budget title.  I can certainly forgive the poor graphics.  However, the writing is absolutely horrendous and the gameplay is ... well absolutely horrendous.  The controls make no sense and are extremely awkward.  Getting your ship to face the direction you want is nearly impossible.
