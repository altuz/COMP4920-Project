The latter one is [i] evil, dark and gloomy [/i]. \n\nThe main idea for [b] gameplay [/b] is that you switch between those universes and some platforms appear, some disappear. So do spikes. What ridicilous is that you have to be [b] precise [/b] about both the [i] location of the objects [/i] and the [i] timing [/i]; although, you are given a [b] poorly designed [/b] game mechanics.\n\nMain pros and cons:\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n[list]\n [*] Attractive background visuals\n [*] They mention [i] The Dark Tower - Stephen King [/i]\n [*] Cheap price\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n[list]\n [*] Poor game mechanics\n [*] Player avatar is more [i] abstract [/i] compared to the background\n [*] Sounds are off-putting\n [*] Lack of the feeling of progress\n [*] Being [i] \"difficult\" [/i] because of poor designing.\n[/list]\n\nTherefore; I wouldn't recommend this game for it has low level of effort in it.
