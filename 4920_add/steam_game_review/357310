You know the person has not played the game a lot or either dont have the brain matter to comprehend the game if you see this as a complaint.  Bandits will appear at the extremity of your map. Meaning that, the more you explore around, the less bandit will be knocking at your door.  The game tells you to go explore in the very first turn too.  So basically these people are whining because they did not listen to the AI giving advice in-game. \n\n\"Peasants revols all the time and nothing I do seems to calm them\" \n\nI had a few problems with them until I understand the mechanics behind it.  Its pretty historical as well. Ancient China was plagued with revolts and rebellions from peasant so in that aspect, the game represents it very well.  Basically, you do not want to over work your peasants. Any work you tell them to do, is forced labor, they are not paid to do that work, you forced them to go work for the state, for the greater good.  And so they get angry because they cannot work on their field and are likely to starve. \n\nThis mean that your farms wont produce if all your farmers are working at building roads and buildings. And your people will get angry as they are starving.  \n\nJust keep a close eye on the revolt bar, it tells you a percentage of people that are unhappy with the state. Build some shrines, to reduce, and research tech that adds cultures (for peasant) and Authority ( for nobles ).  Shrines will affect either noble or peasant, just make sure you look at the info before you click. \n\nBasically, this game sets a historical and realistic tone, you do not want to work  constantly your peasant, you do not want to be at war always. There will be lots of turn where you just dont do anything. Its peace time, and nothing needs to be done, you are accumulating money and thinking about the future of your people.  \n\nWhen you have multiple cities, there will always be something thats is being done, but what I do is I build one city a lot,  until my peasants gets tired, and then I leave it alone and concentrate on another.  \n\nOnly build what you need. you do not want EVERYTHING.  Only fortified your border cities,  Choose how you want to plan out your cities, Ideally, have all your food/market cities on the borders of others, and have all your military cities in the inner circle.   That way,  if you get attacked, you wil lonly loose business /food cities. And you will be able to build an army to go an recapture them.   \n\nALWAYS keep money wiht you in case this happens. There is no need to spend all your money all the time. I usually keep a coffer of 3,000. Just to be able to mount a quick army and defend my towns in case Im attacked by surprise.   That means that I have a coffer of about 6,000 at all time, and I dont permit myself to use any of it once it reached 3,000.  \n\nLeave garrison troops  near the Rivers. What I do is I build road across the River, that way, everybody goes trough the roads.  So I will have a road that cros the river on the far right, and one on the far left. I keep 4 units of  Proffesional soldiers; Heavy spear and 1 Noble on horses to both crossings. With this, I will leave  a mix units of Horses in the middle, to quickly be able to reinforce whoever gets attacked fist. \n\nI conquered all the clans behind that river, took a few of their cities and made them recognise me as an Emperor. Meaning that I dont have to worry about them attacking me. And I can leave all my cities undefended in the rear  and middle ( keep in mind, ALWAYS keep at least one noble in each town, not completely, 100% undefended )  On the Front, I have my frontline, where I guard roads and River crossing. I also made a Garrison city across the River so that if anything happens, it will be the first one to be attacked and I will have time to prepare and fortify while my garrison city takes the blow.   \n\nThis, of course, depends largely on where factions are, and the map. I am talking here as the Grand Campaign map. With the first faction available that I picked to play.  \n\nMake strategies that ressemble what I have said here, and it will be a cakewalk. \n\n-Dont use Peasant armies to calm a Peasant revolt.. seems logical enough.\n-Try to get proffesional soldiers as quick as you can trough research. \n\n-I didnt have to use any armies until turn 100. I barely use any of my peasant armies. I used  multiple 1 unit of noble to discover the map in all direction, never had a problem with bandits.  \n\n- I mainly use proffesional soldiers to garison my cities and my important roads/river crossings. \n\n-I will summon peasant, leaded by Nobles, to fight big war\n\n-I will summon proffesional soldiers, leaded by characters ( Generals ) to fight big war. \n\n- Dont build your cities close to each other... Discover the map and look for Mines, Wild Horses, Rhinoceros, and other resources.  Build a few cities all over the place, close to resources, and you will quickly have rich cities. Make sure you put this to good effect by building a bazaar and making them trades. Build roads to better trade.  \n\n-As soon as you see an AI,  BE NICE, to them. Try to make peace, dont go into a defensive pact, just make a pact that you wont attack each other for 20/40 turns.   \n\n-Be friendly with everyone. Until you carefully choose your move. Try to pick the weakest link in the chain. Capture a couple of his cities and sue for peace, and get them to recognize you as the righfull emperor.  \n\n-Once you have picked your target, build up and army,  and get close to his border. Chances are, he will embargo you because you are scaring him. This is your chance at a war. Declare war on those fuckers for embargoing you ( Just like Japan did to the U.S during World War 2, when you think of it ) That is basically how I go on about war.  \n\nI usually dont completely capture my enemies, I take about 2 cities or 3 from them and then sue for peace. then I got wonderfull Allies that are protecting the flanks of my cities. \n\n\nThe game is extremely realistic/historical of that time period so just think as if you were actually a Chinese Emperor and everything should be fine.  \n\nIn Total war games, you can easely be a Tyrant without any danger. In real life, it aint so. And you wont be able to be a Tyrant in this game. \n\n______ \n\nThe game have a few bug,  mainly camera, sometime it will just start flying in one direction until I stopped it with my keyboard ( arrows ). Thats about the only bug I have encounteered.   \n\n\nOverall, great fucking game. A bit too easy, but I will try to play with a higher difficulty and see what the game offers. \n\nAlso keepin tracks of your characters is a mess. Or maybe I just didnt discover the window for it yet, to be honest, I didnt bother too much,  so I will go look and edit this part of the review if needed, but so far,  its a mess. I wish there was a family tree window type, a la total war. \n\nEDIT : Keeping track of your character is fairly easy, I just figured out that you only need to click on the character's face on the left bottom of the screen to see his role.   \n\n\nWhat else is bad about the game...hhm.... I dont know.. I like... I really like it.. OH YEAH ! \n\nTHE COMBAT : Lets address this issue that a lot of people seem not to like. This is fine, to each its own. and I wish, as well, that you could actually control your units a la total war.  \n\nBUT, the combat is pretty nice in itself. You can have a battles plans, choose formation type... Basically, you are the emperor, and not a General, your Generals and Noble will fight the wars for you, you just give them some basic rules to follow. \n\nI didnt get into any bug so far about the combat. Units react good, and they are not too dumb, but even if the unit arent the smartest ones, keep in mind that the enemy is the same so it balances well.  \n\nI actually enjoy the combat.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505509062, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506016909, "recommendationid": "34981124", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616293", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505713781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8016, "steamid": "76561198071110065", "num_games_owned": 21}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": "1", "review": "At last, a civ game where your empire can crumble from the inside.

It is inovative for many game mechanics, the chinese setting is to often overlooked and it is really immersive.\n\nBut there are three major problems:\n\n1.

The combat system is bad in the sense of you don't understand how your actions are linked to the result.\n\n3. The UI for unit movement and unit orders is just annoying like hell. Units you want to send together get seperated for no reasons with no simple way to pack them back together, no easy way to order all units of the same type to use the same tactic, units you place in the middle of the formation get moved back to the side for no understandable reason and so on.

This is NOT a total war or civilization reskin, it does new and interesting things while being more realistic than either.\n\nNoble and Peasant happiness are separated. They are appeased differently and their rebellions behave differently. You can create noble and peasant units for free although upkeep costs apply. Conscripting huge peasant armies is easy, but long campaigns will take a toll your economy. Professional soldiers require money to train and equip, but they won't defect to the peasant rebels and won't make your farmers unhappy when you throw them against your neighbors. This isn't a total war game where peasant levies are happy to fight with you forever, employing them in large numbers is for short term conflicts and emergencies.\n\nThe happiness of your empire isn't something that is static. To begin with, dissatisfaction will naturally fluctuate a little on its own and differ from city to city. Next, random events such as natural disasters, eclipses or omens can cause large swings in mood, the negative effects of which can be mitigated with research. Furthermore, the authority of your leader may vary. Send him out to win victories and your people will be less inclined to rebel. Lose battles and your authority will decrease. If he dies in battle or old age, his successor will have a temporary penalty to authority. It\u2019s even worse if your leader dies without an heir. Messy power struggles after a king\u2019s death are common in history, so it\u2019s nice that the game reflects this with its mechanics.\n\nRebellions aren't easy to deal with. Nobles are more likely to rebel further away from your capital, and armies with too many peasants will join peasant rebellions. Creating and moving professional armies around takes time. Entire cities can defect to rebels. The AI isn't immune to infighting; It's satisfying to watch a large rival split in two.\n\nEdicts are handled cleverly too. You can order your nobles to keep horses to transform them from an infantry unit to a chariot unit, create a central bureaucracy, force peasants to use a new farming system for increased profits or recruit officers to reduce unhappiness in cities or grant a bonus to armies they lead. Passing one usually means angering nobles or farmers in the short term or permanently in addition to requiring gold per turn. Therefore they require a bit of thinking before using.\n\nPeople looking for total war style battles will be disappointed, but that doesn't mean the combat has no depth. Using various unit types, tactics and the terrain matters.\n\nSince it's difficult to control a huge number of cities on your own without rebellions, you'll need to create vassals and convice other factions to recognise you as Emperor to control the huge map of China.\n\nThis isn't a game where you paint the map your own color.

The latter I know next to nothing about but have play many a game like these for over 30 years. So with that in mind I played a couple new games focusing on the mechanics, how each part of gwoing the population, how each aspect affects them and worked outward. Still no master of it, and currently learning how the various approaches to trade and diplomacy can affect my choices.\n\nProbably the biggest surprise was how it's laid out, resource wise, so some areas have a certain bonus, and others have next to none but are good sized areas for growing the populations. Still alot of land to explore and find all the various resource types, but the bonus here even if you cannot find resources you're after, is that it's out there and you can take it or trade it. Both have their good and bad sides.\n\nMilitary units are one of the key components imho, each Clan has it's special attribute Unit or other focus, so learning them all give a new perspective on how you might choose to play each one. When it comes to barbarians or revolting peasants, you can choose to crush them or apease them. Your choice :D\n\nThe hardest part of the Leader Character is knowing when you get one, or when you'll get another. Still learning how this works, I am liking the way it works so far. I send out a simple unit, army or leader, to explore the surrounding area to gather information, then when bandits show up, combine a couple with a leader to crush them and earn them a nice victory with xp so that when a neighbour comes to knock your door down, you can at least try to stave off losses. In my second game, most of the major players rarely send bowman, so simply creating walls, and ambushing these creates a stalemate where they can't take my towns.\n\nThe various tactics, formations, and so on have various benefits, often if you change the status of each unit and terrain with what they're up against will come in your favour if you play it right. This tends to be a hit and miss affair in the beginning as you learn how it works. Imho, this is a bonus compared to CIV as that seems to be more tech vs older units, yet in TW you get the zerg approach and out numbering tactics. This is a nice blend, and yeah sure, it could be improved upon, but liking the new approach honestly as it makes you think before each action.\n\nSo since this is new, there are things I believe can improve this even more, not a MUST have to currently play, but a nice vision of future updates and *cough* DLC *cough* that could expand it more.\n\nHaving a training scenario for each Clan, with an actual walk through of each as if recreating history. Even if this was only a small portion of what each is known in history for. That would then give you a \"possible\" guide to getting started with each special attribute of each to get things going. Without out it, you're trying to figure it out on your own, and for me atm, this will give more time to learn what does and doesn't work, but if added would help educate me on Chinese history a bit more and have fun while doing so.\n\nSadly it's named Oriental, so does somewhat limit future expansions imho to Japan and possibly other Asian countries surrounding China itself. On the plus side, this is a huge area that has many possibilities though. If they're like this game, then I'd give them a go as well.\n\nMy verdict, early days and alot to learn still, but I can see me sinking many hrs into playing all the factional clans and getting the most out of this in more ways than one. Pretty much shelved Civ becuase it's just downright dry, run out of something \"fun\" for me. Same goes for TW, it had it's moments, but in the end something seemed to be missing. Oriental Empires fills those voids and is interesting, fresh, and a different spin on things that makes you want to come back for more.\n\nMaybe I'll come back when I have more hrs into the game and add further goods and bads to this review....", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505893698, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505893698, "recommendationid": "35079488", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516137", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506722783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 176, "steamid": "76561198173799255", "num_games_owned": 26}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I fell upon this game and I was rapidly seduced by the concept.\nThere's one thing I particularly like.\nAs a big fan of the Civilization franchise, which I play since Civ 2 (you'll see why I speak about another game), I was a bit doubtful about the gameplay changes in Civ V (one unit by hex), even if they are very interesting.\nWe can't ask Civ to have a welfare like Total War on the other hand, let's be realistic.\nBut I wanted something more sophisticated, and it's exactly what is implemented in Oriental Empires.\nOn an hex, there can be an army of maximum 8 units, which can be different, with different formations... So there can be real Total War-like combats inserted in a global Civilization-like 4X gameplay concept. Of course it doesn't match graphically with the huge battle you can see in the TW of the last decade, but there is a real deep strategy, good graphisms, and it's more realistic to prepare your plan during the turn and then to see how everything happens (like in an old game called 'Legion', if you know it, same thing, 8 units an army, and you prepare your formation before the battle), so it's even more realistic than a Total War where you have omniscient powers at every second over every regiment (reminds what Tolstoy writes in War and Peace about the Napoleonian Wars : generals prepare plans before the battle, but the latter happens rarely as planned, orders arrive always too late during it, etc).\n\nSo besides that, the game is focused on China, with every faction having its special abilities, well, normal.\nThere is a manual, everything is explained.\n\nOn a darker side, I hope the developpers will see this little complaint, there is little choice about the key bindings, maybe mods will allow a more satisfying game experience. For exemple, I'm used in every strategy game to go east on a map by putting the cursor along the right of the screen, and in the options you can chose whether it happens or not, to match the different habitudes of the different players.\nIn this game, there is for now no possibility to assign key bindings to open windows, very little options you can chose to put on or off. And for example, to move on the map, you have to click left and to move the mouse, which is a bit unusual to me, and to every Civilization player who would be used to move on the map like I do. It's a little example, but I think the developers should allow more possibilities of key bindings and other practical options to match more to the different ways to play a 4X game.\n\nSo to conclud I recommend this game, moreover it's not very expensive, this first week it has 20% sale, so a cost of 23\u20ac, barely twice the price of a DLC of Civ VI bringing two civs and one scenario... And even the global price, 30\u20ac, is half the price of the biggest licenses of strategy the day of the release of a vanilla, so it does seem a good idea for the fans of these kinds of games to try this 4X turned toward China and with a touch of Total War !", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505516479, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505516479, "recommendationid": "34983121", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511415", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506265581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 452, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 452, "steamid": "76561198032382434", "num_games_owned": 2155}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "9", "review": "Good game flawed by poor design.\n\nI was really enjoying myself until I got to a point that no matter what, attacking city with trebuchets and archers that have NO UNITS IN, somehow kill a bunch of my men and can't even breach the walls.\nThey're too busy shooting the damn towers.\nWhat in the actual hell?\nDon't even get me started on the number crunching.

Very good.  If you have been reading kingdom manga or are a fan of historical turn based strategy games this game is one of the best out there to simulate a very under-rated period in history (Warring States period, China).\n\nThe game has so much potential I could see an expansion or second iteration being close to a perfect game and that is a truly rare and remarkable thing.\n\nWhat it does well: It plays and flows well, with a give and take in the battles that seems so much more deep than a system of rock paper scissors like in civilization.  It is very addicting in that classic 1 more turn mentality.   The battles, the tactics, timing, possibilities etc are awesome and allow a deep layer of strategic micromanagement that is balanced at the perfect level - you can go completely nuts down to the smallest flanking maneuver or rear attack etc or just smash large stacks together in a battle of attrition and numbers.  \n\nThe graphics are excellent.  The style is perfect, everything looks and feels good when playing.  The UI is minimal and shows off the gorgeous map and game board.\n\nThe game feels and looks a lot more realistic and immersive than the vast majority of their better capitalized competitors.  Even the weather effects that block out part of the map are awesome.\n\nMost importantly the game is really fun.  You need to set a timer or something or a day might just be gone the next time you look up.\n\nI admit I got my ass kicked in my first game when I overexpanded and many cities rebelled.  I had a heck of time clawing back my own lands and it was very fun and challenging.  The game does have a slight learning curve though and will punish you if you dont watch your class loyalty levels.  I reccomend players put on the automatic farming option so they can focus on more important things. like WAR.  It is the Warring States afterall!  We've got unification to think of!\n\nWhat the game never explains is how the class system works and I think a lot of players get frustrated before they figure it out.  In general you use your upper classes to supress the peasants and the lower classes to keep the nobles in check, while your own professional soldiers and elites can be used against both.  Makes sense.  Once you understand this losing a city to revolt is very rare. So if you have a peasant revolt you will need to use armies made up more than 50% of nobles/professionals and ideally led by your king.  \n\nTo prevent your king constantly dying it is helpful to set their individual unit ai to \"withdraw\".\n\nHaving played several thousand turns too I will say the AI is better than average and quite good in most respects.  I feel AI can always be improved in games, which leads me to the other side of the coin.  There were a few times where say Qin declared war on me with 100% of their cities undefended and not a unit in sight on the hardest difficulty.  Even when it took several turns to approach they didn't make a single unit and I captured the strongest foritified cities in the game unopposed. Silly.  Then a huge wave of Qin came in from the north and got obliterated on their own fortresses.  Bad moves happen in war, if I would have attacked them I would just be taking advantage of their weakness and that is a smart move - but they declared war on me!  Those Qin should mass up on my borders first, especially if I am their chief rival for hegemony.\n\nThe game badly needs a harder difficulty than \"very hard.\"  Guys like me need more punishment, more collusion amongst the enemies.  Give them more gold and troops and make the ai more aggressive.\n\nI also feel like the base authority rating should be higher or that very small cities shouldn't consume a point until they grow to a certain size.  The map feels unpopulated until hundreds of turns pass and even then there is still open land just begging to be exploited but you cant beyond a small number or risk a big revolt.  So you just cede it and burn enemy cities.  More points could just be added to the base rate or to some techs.  It just leads to some weird semi arbitrary points where you almost need to disband pissant settlements in order to keep giant cities happy, and forces you to always keep your kings and heirs crusading on the front lines to increase their ratings.  The rating itself is fine as a system to prevent overexpansion but having the rating reset to when your king dies of old age is more annoying than fun especially when the number of cities the kingdom controls isn't that large.  This is CHINA.\n\nA large % of battles end up being sieges.  Nothing wrong with that, I actually really enjoy cracking a tough city and they should be difficult to take.  What I find immensely annoying though is sieging a city for 30 or 40 turns only to have a random guy come and take the city at the last second.  That is infuriating and it happens A LOT.  This leads to weird games were you try and time the last hit on the siege.  Obviously if I commit 3000 men and decades then a random guy comes and bypasses my siege lines and then takes the spoils that doesnt make any sense and is ridiculous. Without save scumming and trying to trial and error it you will lose the city, loot, resources, 1000s of men, time etc.\n\nI also think that many of the policies/edicts are awesome and also stupid at the same time.  Many of these don't seem balanced or worthwhile.  A king appointing a general reduces his authority?  Okay, maybe, but what happens when that loyal general goes on to conquer half the world for you and becomes famous and feared? Still reducing your authority. In a way it kind of make sense he might get delusions of grandeur or something and revolt but overall most generals throughout history have stayed loyal to their homeland and cause. Maybe they could add a loyalty stat, but I do like the way it is now, simplified to a city's loyalty.  The penalties especially in authority in regards to edicts  usually lead to never chosing certain options and that is unfun/unintended. It also leads to a lack of generals/personality characters until very late game.  I think that is one of this game's weaknesses, the characters feels all generic and lifeless when say a simple family tree or random trait system layered on top would add a lot in depth.  I want to feel like a king and I want to know who my vassals and enemies are. If I want to be Wei and choose 5 elite generals and war in all directions that is my perogitive - even it backfires and leads to revolts or a large cost, whatever, I at least want the option.   Even at max authority/characters it seems a bit light for the scale of all of China.\n\nI think they need a slightly better presentation for complex diplomacy.  Many games have a system where you click one nation and it reveals all the relations with coloured bars.  Would help organize a bit of the chaos in this chaotic ffa.\n\nIn the future I would like to see the player able to establish more historically accurate mods to their kingdom by undertaking customizable agricultural (irrigation/canal) improvements like the Zhengguo Canal and the Great wall of China.  They can add heavy fortifcations / castles that link together and maybe have levels since the QIn built a large defense against Chu even though it was nothing like the scale of the great wall.  They could even add river/canal diversions and dams etc to increase the usefulness of water/ship transport and similulate Qin's prepartion for their attack on the Yue.\n\nOverall Oriental Empires is excellent and should by purchased by those who love history, strategy, and quality games.  It is actually far better in my opinion that many AAA titles like Civilization.   The Warring states is basically a 100 way ffa of small kingdoms duking it out in the most chaotic and ignored period of history in the west.  While Rome was fielding 1000s, these kingdomss were raising 100,000s and rising and falling in never ending waves of battles and bloodshed!
