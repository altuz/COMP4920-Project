[/h1]\n\nThis game deserves WAY more praise than it gets. It's 2D sidescrolling action platforming at its finest, however be warned that this game doesn't have conventional play by any means. It's main combat style is heavily oriented around this game's unique Rolling mechanic. You don't aim with a mouse, so the only way to shoot above or below you is rolling, not to mention it can deflect bullets, increse speed, chain combo kills, stomp opponents, and entertain me for hours!\n\nNot to mention its SUPERB soundtrack and graphics! The lighting is incredible, the sound design is top-notch, and its production quality is above and beyond any other 2D sidescrolling platformer I've EVER played! It has endless polish, a banger of a soundtrack, a beautiful artstyle, tons of content, online multiplayerplayer, a huge story mode I have yet to finish and SO much more!\n\nAlthought its difficulty is immense, and the difficulty curve is hard to cope, I think this only adds to the experience. It requires split-second timing and quite a lot of strategic planning with how you approach certain enemies with different weapons, but really that's more of a plus than many negative reviews give it credit for. If you're struggling with this game, don't feel discouraged! Skill comes with practise, which comes with time! I'd reccomend the arcade mode challenges to practise your skills.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game. Extremely well made. My biggest quip and my only problem is how  it was marketed. Cobalt gets barely any spotlight, and as such suffers greatly. Mojang, publisher of Cobalt, developed the biggest hit game in history, Minecraft, and yet they totally failed when trying to raise Cobalt. It's a real mystery to me how it flew so low under the radar. Barely anybody plays it, so nobody's online half the time. It's a real shame.\n\nAnyways, buy it. It's worth your time, and it's more than worth 20$. Also, thanks for sticking around and reading this whole review, I really appreciate your dedication. If you got this far, you deserve to play Cobalt, so do yourself a favor and buy it.
