The trailer is a good representation really. It's story-heavy and the puzzles aren't particularly taxing although I did get stuck at one point because an obstacle wasn't really an obstacle. Its main goal seems to be humour, and it made me laugh a lot so it's done its job! There's even a joke in the options screen that made me chuckle.\n\nIt looks like a programmer has drawn it in MS Paint. Mostly that's fine, it's a comedy game after all, but the characters do look a bit out of place being so pixelly. The voiceovers are fine I think, though I'm not picky.\n\nTook me about 3 hours to play through - there are achievements you could aim for, but I'm not really interested in replaying to get them.

Slight humor makes some more tedious tasks enjoyable\n3. Best 16-bit graphics that 32-Bit can render\n4. FUN!!\n5. Price\n\nCons:\n1. No widescreen options limited to 4:3 ish scales\n2.

I am not sure the three or so hours you get are worth it. The game is audiovisually poor, game self aware humor will get a smirk out of you at best and the whole setting and storyline feels convoluted and confused. This almost feels like an episode in an episodic series and it comes from and goes nowhere.\n\nReview : Astroloco starts out cringe-worthy as it explains the premise of it`s sci fi setting. Thankfully the exposition for the game's setting is soon over and it gets much better from there as the game drops all pretense at taking itself seriously. It is fairly humorous, voice acting is clearly home made but entertaining. I recognize some in-game music being chopped of track of another point and click game (Kyrandia).\n\nCharacter sprites are awful even in contrast to the MS-Paint style backgrounds. Plot is short and for the most part divided into fairly easy to follow tasks that require mostly low puzzle solving ability, which is good as puzzles isnt what you would want to play this for. It makes references to classic games of the genre, and has mostly a space-janitor/roger wilco theme along with trains and british flavor thrown in. \n\nI had a few genuine laughs, the autotuned robot and that whole sidecharacter was comparably underdevelopped. Basically a collection of small inventory puzzles in different sections with a NPC acting as a in-game journal to keep track of whats left to do.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486758976, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504640091, "recommendationid": "29831907", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467185734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 334, "steamid": "76561198155724062", "num_games_owned": 319}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Genuine British humour!
