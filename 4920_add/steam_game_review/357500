LoL, WoW, DotA2 and CSGO are just a common sense way to say they're toxic, because in fact, this game ends being way more toxic than all these four together. After been playing like 8~9 years, I've seen a lot of stuff and even tends to get worse since they've moved to GamesCampus and now RedFox. Here's a summary of pros and cons:\n\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n+ If you want some single player fun, you can play Boss Mode, which is very challenging depending on the difficulty.\n+ Has no solid competition on the free-to-play market bar Zone4 (and Lost Saga for NA).\n+ Fun to play with irl/steam friends in a [b]private[/b] room.\n+ If you manage to get new friends there and you still talk with them ingame, they'll be for life.\n+ The devs are pretty open on accepting forum suggestions.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Full of [b]bugs and glitches[/b], people win matches by abusing glitches that \"pros\" proclaim to be legal.\n- Much players doing [b]drama and trash talking[/b], during battles the trash talking can be so intense at the point of themselves getting typekilled (which also results in more trash talking and drama).\n- [b]DDoS[/b] everywhere via chatroom or lobby, some even post via megaphone the victim's IP address, if someone tells something against a 10 year old he'll DDoS everyone in the room.\n- For players outside of NA it [b]laggs[/b] as hell, and everybody will kick you (or DDoS you if you're persistent) as your internet signal bar is visible to everyone in the room, if you have one red bar (or two yellow bars for the 10 year olds) then better play alone or with friends from your location.\n- Some hackers [b]stealing/hijacking[/b] accounts while GMs do nothing against it.\n- Much [b]bullying[/b] and humiliation at the point of making a thread in the Rumble Fighter forums showing your girlfriend's facebook profile and calling her ugly.\n- [b]Elitism[/b], if you're a new player you'll be always kicked by others from most rooms due to you being low level.\n- Players with [b]VIP syndrome[/b], this happens when trash talking + elistism + GM riding are mixed together, resulting in auto-proclaiming themselves to be superior and demand to be treated closer to GMs, while in fact they only stalk and backseat GMs.\n- Most items on the store are [b]recycled[/b] from other previous items (like a t-shirt but with a different texture) and most wearables and acessories are aestethically exagerated for a \"fighter\" that makes you look like a walking pile of garbage: like having fluffy bear legs with a helm full of snakes, huge golden KayneWest like glasses, a vanity katana on the belt, boxing gloves, huge headphones... and a DJ mixing table on your back. It's good for the devs to implement player suggestions, but the bad is that most of them are recycled from others and lack creativity (I saw before at GC forums a suggestion of an exocore made out of WhiteFang scroll combos... and it was being supported by many).\n- There are [b]no controller settings[/b], you have to change it manually via regedit.\n- [b]\"I'm A Real Gangsta\" syndrome[/b] (Filthy Frank tags them as \"[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6iefP8lf3o]Bad Internet Rappers[/url]\"), where should I start? well, some \"pro\" players frequently act and talk like gangstas, using phrases like \"n\u00edgga I owe ya nothin' bro\" or \"yo n\u00edgga mah dawg, go lick yer sh\u00edtz from yer pantz\", all these while most aren't \"n\u00edgga\" at all (most likely kids), also they love to replace the game music with underground [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi9lagitKJ0]hiphop music[/url].\n- [b]No trade system[/b], you can only \"trade\" by sending gifts between players, 90% resulting in getting scammed.\n- Skyhigh [b]Pay2Win[/b], you'll need to spend like $3000~4000 to be ready to face 1vs1 players\ufeff, if you're going for the free road, you'll spend one month nonstop just to get an underpowered carat scroll (cash shop scrolls are overpowered and much abusive), it was already defining the term \"Pay2Win\" back then but now stuff like a cashshop lucky event box where you have a small chance of getting an OP scroll... that's pretty much cashgrab.\n- If you still don't believe in the trash talk, drama, bullying and any sort of toxity in this game, you can even see it on [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnFZt-M6ik]this video[/url] (the toxity is so intense that it even spreads to the video's comment section).\n\n\nFeel free if you want to tag Rumble Fighter in the Store Page as \"Toxic\" (new tab), you can also add the existing tag \"Psychological Horror\" aswell.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485985850, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497223606, "recommendationid": "29636900", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535218", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506218825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198122204723", "num_games_owned": 25}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I still play this game (been playing it for 5-6 years, when OGP owned the game), but I don't reccommend it to anyone.\n\n+Pros:\n+Plenty of unique fighting styles and clothing. Fun to play at times. Fun to play with your friends in a private lobby.\n+Fun to play, hard to master.\n\n-Cons:\n-Devs have not updated the game in ages. There are NUMBERS OF HACKERS and TRASH TALKERS that will want to make you quit. None of the GMs really care about their rules anymore.\n-Connection is P2P. If there's someone 1000+ miles away from you, you're going to get endless lag.\n-Elitists.

I don't always launch it from steam (Takes more time) 2. Does not account for my extreme amount of hours when before this was on Steam (OGPlanet - Original Owners)\nNo this isn't a polished 2017 game.\nRumble Fighter has always been there since ~2010 and so on.\nThis game was apart of my childhood. \n\nBesides the obvious subjectivity, \nthe game does not full screen as in 16:9. (This does not bother me as I just enjoyed the game)\nthe game has a low population (A small community that doesn't seem to grow) \nthe game hasn't been updated to look like a 2017 game, but that's because it isn't. It was made in 2007 and 10 years of age will make it seem unpolished.\n\nThis game doesn't lag, no matter what computer I have used it has never lagged.\nWhy do I recommend this game for the 2 people and maybe someone on my friends list who is stalking my reviews?\nIt really depends, if you come into this game expecting a new game, you will be disappointed and almost immediately stop playing and never come back. \nThis game DOES require skill, there's many techniques and tricks you can pull off to outplay your enemy.\nThis game DOES have microtransactions / minor pay to win. If you're truly pro, you can easily defeat others even if they purchase Scrolls / Exocores / Stat Items. Carat items are available with stats as well.\n\nWhy I like this game from 2010-now? \n+ The Customization. I've always loved customizations and this game does well for me.\n+ Anime / artstyle - not much to say, I just really enjoy how it looks.\n+ Community - Not the toxic/salty players (In every game there is always those bunch) but how the community created a gamemode that never was official, but players somehow made it official. \"NHAA\" (No Hitting At All) is a player-made game mode where fights are prohibited unless you ask to spar 1v1s or ask for permissions, the purpose is to farm carats and chat and relax. \n+ Nostalgia: I actually enjoyed this game and played it very much near 2010 when I was around 10+ years old. It still is fun to me to this day.\n\nIs this game ideal? No. Is this game good? No, not really, it is many imperfections, minor glitches (i.e. airgrabbing, counter glitches - which don't / can't ruin gameplay), and also is not as professional as 2017 games are, but that's not what this is. This is your chill game to meet other people and enjoy fighting / outplaying your enemy. I recommend this game because if there were more players, I would definitely be playing this way more often.\n\nFrom an old generation player. - KillerJames (Old IGN, is now \"Jett\")", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486514136, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486514214, "recommendationid": "29772152", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505771", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496603168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198231989656", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "This game is so bad and it needs to go back on OGP I highly do not recommend playing this low tier game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487107421, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487107421, "recommendationid": "29929017", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499852", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502451618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 19, "steamid": "76561198083567507", "num_games_owned": 68}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game with alot of potential!
