No - does it manage to be some awesome fun? Absolutely! The game is early access and from what I can tell is lacking content, but that's to be expected from an early access game. It's actually very, very fun though and as long as development goes smoothly from here on out, should shape up to be the great game it looks like it's going to be. If you are ok with being an early bird in a game like this, I would highly recommend it.\n\nI've tried every character, but I spent very little time with the melee guy. Every character felt genuinely unique. Each character has a \"limiter\" of sorts to stop them from putting out endless DPS. The generic shooter guy has to reload, and thus plays much like you'd expect a generic shooter guy to: small engagements, reloading inbetween, etc... He was very fun though, don't get me wrong. He is clearly meant to be the \"basic\" class of the game, but manages to do so with finesse.\n\nThe sniper girl also plays like you'd expect: She wants to engage as few enemies as possible at once and does extremely high single (or few) target damage. Some of the later levels have large enemy swarms and I haven't made it that far with her yet, but I imagine she is VERY difficult as the game goes on. She was very fun though. Her gimmick is that she needs to charge her shots up, and can \"overcharge\" to do extra damage. She fucking DESTROYS bosses.\n\nThe melee guy, as I said, I didn't mess with much. It was difficult to deal damage with him without taking damage in return. His gimmick is that his weapon can overheat and be rendered unusable if spammed for too long.\n\nThe robot is by far my favorite character. It has amazing stats all around and a shield to absorb damage before losing health, but to deal damage drains an energy bar that slowly fills up. You can switch between 3 modes that charge your shield bar faster, your weapon bar faster, or split charge power equally. You HAVE to switch to do well, trust me. It's a very fun character though.\n\nThe game has a fun unlock system for content, but as I said, there doesn't appear to be a ton of content as of yet. But early access is early access. If you like roguelites and sci-fi, this is a fantastic game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442372519, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1442372519, "recommendationid": "18052083", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529476", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495361016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 241, "steamid": "76561198041044732", "num_games_owned": 902}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[EARLY ACCESS OPINIONS]\n\nPretty fun little game. Reminds me a lot of Nuclear Throne in the little while I've played. The sniper is probably my favorite class, but I warmed up with the gunner; looking forward to going back to try him out now that I understand the mechanics a little more. It seems like a pretty straight forward title, I can't wait until they add the online coop since I very rarely play couch coop. I think it'll benefit a lot from that addition, but only if they add it soonish.

Its exactly what you would expect of this old Super Nintendo style shooter genre.\n\nWould love greater variety of weapon pick ups, but other than that its a blast.  Being able to buy new abilities mid-action within levels is great.\n\nCurrently 4 different characters to choose from with unique styles and a couple of different game modes.\n Rogue has you progressing through levels killing bosses and slowly becoming more powerful.  Its a good place to start as enemies won't swarm you unless within your range of vision.\nSo you can take your time and explore.\n\n Conquest gives you an objective to destroy while giving you the option to activate turrets to help defend yourself and sending increasingly difficult waves after you.  Good strategy and experimentation is required to succeed here.\n\nOnline multiplayer is also due later this year, but has seen a few delays.  However local co-op works well.\n\nCheck out videos.  If its a game that appeals to you then you are sure to have a good time here.\n\nFingers crossed that a release date for online multiplayer arrives soon to make it even better.
