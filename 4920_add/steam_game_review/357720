One day, the music starts getting corrupted, and three block dudes go to investigate and discover something terrifying.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, this is the spiritual successor to 140.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what 140 is, it\u2019s a psychedelic, blocky platformer where the world around you moves to the rhythm of the music \u2013 but you don\u2019t. It forced you to pay close attention to the music as you jumped on moving platforms and avoided obstacles. Every moving object added their own riffs and beats to the music as you passed them by, making an infectious, ever-changing soundtrack. It was a fascinating, challenging little game that I remember fondly, but it felt like little more than a concept demo.\n\nThe only big complaint I had with 140 \u2013 that it was far too short, and didn\u2019t nearly explore its concept enough \u2013 were overwhelmingly addressed with Inside My Radio. Here is a lengthy, fleshed-out rhythm platformer with the same concept. Across 12 levels, it explores a staggering number of ideas, some of which were already done by 140, but most of which are completely new. Also like 140, it\u2019s got a pounding, unfairly catchy soundtrack that changes depending on what objects are on the screen (although personally it took me until the second playthrough to really appreciate the music).\n\nOverall, it was exactly what I wanted! Except for one small, new problem\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s the controls. This game tries something very different than any game I\u2019ve ever seen before. It\u2019s a platformer, but you need to time all your moves to the beat. Unlike 140 where the rhythm was enforced by the level design only, Inside My Radio forces you to literally perform all of your moves \u2013 jumping, dashing, walljumping, and ground-pounding \u2013 to the rhythm. If you don\u2019t, the move will simply fail.\n\nDoes it work? ...I\u2019m really torn on this question, but I\u2019m going to settle on \u2018yes\u2019, with the disclaimer that you [i]really[/i] need to spend a long time getting used to them before they\u2019ll really click. For me, it wasn\u2019t until I [i]beat[/i] the game and began the time-trials that I felt that I was really starting to master the controls. Up until then, they were mostly frustrating, and made it feel like the game was randomly dropping inputs in critical situations. But when that moment comes when you\u2019re finally in the zone and you\u2019ve practiced enough to know how to hit every note, it feels very satisfying to shred your way across the terrain. It just takes a while to get to that point.\n\nFortunately, you can easily toggle a rhythm-assist with the push of one button, which displays a graphic around your character (and rumbles your controller if you\u2019re playing with one), which I found really helped when I was starting to lose track of the rhythm.\n\nI have some complaints about the level design, too. When the game is doing what it\u2019s supposed to be doing \u2013 rhythm-based platforming \u2013 the level design is perfect. Unfortunately, sometimes the game will try to throw puzzles at you, and they\u2019re all really, really bad. One level is filled with laser puzzles that make zero sense, and amount to just hitting all the switches you see on the screen. Another level has an absolutely infuriating \u201ctuning\u201d puzzle which breaks all the momentum and took me over 5 minutes to solve the first time (and it was especially awful in the time trial!). Another level has an especially irritating part where several events are triggered by the movement of your character, except that the events play their own music, and that music isn\u2019t guaranteed to sync up with the background music, making it really confusing to tell when you\u2019re supposed to be hitting buttons.\n\nThe game itself is on the easy side, but the time trials required to get the final achievements are quite challenging. After a bit of practice, I got 100% completion in about 6 hours.\n\nOverall, my opinions were positive. I think that if you liked 140 and want to see more of that gameplay, and if you\u2019re willing to accept that this is just as much of a rhythm game as it is a platformer, then I recommend it wholeheartedly\u2026 just, again, know that the controls take a few hours to get used to. After playing the game a few times and getting all achievements, I feel that it\u2019s about an 8 / 10, but it\u2019s not for everyone. I do not recommend the game to those who don\u2019t enjoy rhythm games \u2013 you\u2019ll probably get too frustrated to enjoy it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1481256614, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1481262783, "recommendationid": "28264677", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518757", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466586764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 242, "steamid": "76561198079206128", "num_games_owned": 132}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I just picked up Inside My Radio.
