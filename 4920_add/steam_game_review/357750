A point and click FMV adventure with an absurd plot. 100% Spanish voiceovers with English subtitles. A limited knowledge of Spanish (I studied in high school) makes it even more fun. If you're an old-school gamer from the 90's who remembers the days of FMV adventure games, you might enjoy this throwback. I'll give it a thumbs-up at its asking price of $5.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493363230, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500006610, "recommendationid": "31410335", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509030", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
