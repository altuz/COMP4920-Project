I'm a little surprised by the overwhelming positive reviews, even by people that have put a lot of time into it and wonder how many others they've played. It is very inexpensive and will give you some challenge, but I'm not sure it's the type of challenge I want from a TD. I don't want to grind just to upgrade heroes, I want to be challenged to find that right mix of towers to get past a level. The difficulty ramps up a lot by the mid-game but mostly due to overpowered creeps and gimmicks. \n\nContrast this to Last Hope or Kingdom Rush, which also have you grind a bit for heroes but not as badly and are for me the more interesting games with more varied levels and goals. I'm not even going to mention Defense Grid. Oops. \n\nIt won't cost you much to try if you love TD games, and the grind will give you many hours of cheap entertainment (and cheap frustration), but you've probably played more interesting ones.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501369536, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501369536, "recommendationid": "33892163", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504207", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500162965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2173, "steamid": "76561197984813201", "num_games_owned": 467}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty good tower defense game.\n\nSolid progression and difficulty curve.

Learning curve is well done. There are not a lot of different tower types but the ones that exist are well designed.
