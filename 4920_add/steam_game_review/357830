The character and attack animation all looks nice too. Wide variety of enemies sprites as well.\n_Plays well: Controls exactly as you'd expect it. Feels precise.\n_Co-op: The game has co-op, and co-op play should make almost any game better.\n\nCons:\n_Bare-boned: This whole game feels like one level. The enemies, while varied in looks, mostly behave the same way. The levels are all the same too, with no set-pieces or events or anything interesting. The 4 chracters are basically only 2 characters: The melee type, and the ranged type. Chracters upgrade in a linear fashion twice, but there's no variety in term of how they're upgraded. There's no items that change the way you play. Shops only sell the same thing over and over. The list goes on.\n_Short, really really short: I mean, it's really short. Might be a blessing, I suppose, if you're not having a good time. But it's hard to excuse a game that is THIS short, even on a $6 price tag.\n_Co-op is only local: Minor point, really, but worth mentioning.\n_WAY too easy, too.\n\nIs it worth $6? I'm afraid not, and that's coming from the guy that gives every game the benefit of the doubt. It's simply too short, too shallow, too dumb, too easy, too simple.

There are many flaws that even the maker has ammited to and says it would take an entire rewrite of the game to create the game he imagined. That said this game is fun. With a multi player and many classes it can bring hours of entertainment either alone or with friends. I tried out all of the classes, with the melee class being nearly impossible to play, and they are all uniquely fun.\nPantsu's Rating (out of 5)\nGraphics: 3 The NES style graphics leave much to the imagination, and with lighting effects somtimes you can't tell what color some of the monsters are. (White bat looks red next to torches)\nPlayability: 3 The controls are pretty simple, either mouse and keyboard or handheld controler, but it lacks a few options I would like to see such as the ability to put down a scroll instead of using it.\nFun: 3.5 Random generation is always great but some classes have hard times with corners or ranged enemies.\nSound: 3 The music isn't horrifing, and neither the sound affects but I wouldn't seek out a soundtrack.\nReplay: 4 Random generation, multiple classes, and progressive achivements will keep you coming back for more abuse.\nFinal Score: 3.5 \nFinal Thought: This game is worth getting, and at $1.99 you wouldn't break the bank if you didn't want to wait for a sale.\nHey I figured out how to record my gameplay.

Sadly, it doesn't offer much depth, but it isn't an expensive title. This is first impressions of the game.\n\nA peaceful kingdom is treathen by dark presence. A labyrinth of pure evil, with an army unlike any seen before. So, now it's up to four Champions to save the kingdom. Simple story.\n\nThis is 2D game, so the lacking of video options is understandable. So is the rebindable keys to ceratin degree. It would be nice to change them. The graphics are retro pixel art with a lot of colours\n\nThere is four classes to choose from. Those are the Champions. I only play with the Wizard. With him the gameplay is a twin-stick shooter. You have only one attack \u2013 a projectile and that's it. Well, there is more, but not much. In the levels you can find or buy upgrades. They change your projectile and your appearance. The wizard can be upgraded two times, I don't know about the others. The only other thing that can help you are scrolls. They are one time use magic spell. Health, Mace, Summon, Shield and Radiant. The last is extremely powerful clearing spell. You can carry one at a time. There is nothing more to the gameplay.\n\nWith the gold you collect from dead enemies, chests and everything that explodes, you can buy from a shop inside the level lives (yes, there are lives here), scrolls, health and upgrades and nothing more.\n\nDungeons or labyrinths are pretty diverce as layout. I saw ice cave, mines with tracks, grass, dirt or gold and so on. All levels are randomly generated, which add to the replayability. When you enter a labyrinth you have to find a key, then the exit. Also there is place with a map, that shows where those things are and the shop. There is no mini map and sometimes it's a little bit confusing. Before every boss you have to make it through series of levels. The first is small, but they get progressively larger. The labyrinth with the boss encounter are pretty big and without a mini map it can take you a while to find the key and the exit.\n\nEnemies are okay. Different types of spiders, ghosts, archers, knights and so on. When they surround they are dangerous. The game is pretty intense and I like that. The bosses are creative and fun to fight.\n\nEffects resemble 8-bit games from the past and they are nice. Music is okay, but not very memorable. I can't think of a single track.\n\nThe games is okay. It's very colorful with responsive controls and it's fun for a while. There is local co-op, but didn't try it. Probably it will be more fun with a friend, but I think it's a mistake not to have online multiplayer. Sadly, my biggest disappointment is the lack of gameplay depth. One projectile and scrolls. I played almost two hours and i'm already getting bored. It's just functional, fun little game. But when you consider the prise, I think the game is alright.

I don't exactly remember when/how I got it, but I wanted to play a dungeon crawler, popped this one in, and was surprised by it. \n\nFrom what I've collected, this game seems to have had a rocky history/start, but I can't really find anything major to gripe about it. I'd imagine major issues have since been patched by the time I played this game.\n\nAttack of the Labyrinth is pretty basic and it can be beaten in about 80 minutes if you're experienced with the genre, slightly longer if not. It's hard to get a game over in this game because if you're decent at it and like to explore you'll either find a ton of 1UP's or be able to buy lots of them from the store. There are two endings that I'm aware of and the requirements to get the \"good\" ending aren't that hard.\n\nMy only real gripe is that there's something weird going on with the achievements, namely that some people think one of them is outright broken, and that there are a couple whose unlock requirements are unclear. As I write this review there's no guide and no insight on the forum as to what's what.

The point of this game is not to continue getting more powerful and enjoying the rewards, but simply to complete the game.\n\nThe challenge keeps ramping up, but the rewards do not. There are 3 levels up upgrades you can find pretty quickly and then you just play the game like that. You can't save your progress and continue later....\n\nThere are 3 parts of the game, and once you finish a part, you permently unlock the next part, it seems. So you can start a new game and start at part 2.\n\nBut I found that if you want to try to get anywhere in the game, it will be significantly easier to play it from begining to end, starting at part 1.\n\nBut the first section is where you become powerful and build up like 10 lives. The second part is where you get bored. :p But theoretically, if you keep the momentum going, you have enough lives to bully your way through the game.

A more gradual ramp-up of enemy difficulty and frequency.
