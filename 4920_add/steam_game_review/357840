I was enjoying the game around the time of the writing.\n\nZombie Camp: Last Survivor is a shooter... where you stand by your position and kill zombies, skeletons and... well giant bosses (they're not alone in their waves though). The goal? Survive during 10 waves! And while you begin only with a pistol, you can gain experience and money to unlock new weapons, upgrade them and resplenish them - because even if the ammo can go to 999 (apart the pistol), you'll need ammo if you're using the same gun each time.\n\nRight now, there are only two levels: a graveyard and a farm (or medieval town, choose what you think it's best). But, in the end, you just want to kill them, because well, admit it, while you don't move and you just shoot and shoot and shoot, you want to beat the score. Since the release, you have a coming soon, meaning that a third level was intended. But I've never seen any update, which is quite disappointing.\n\nIt's a little game, perfect for breaks and for brainless moments. While the graphics aren't the best around, the zombies are still well done and in a \"parody\" mood, the difficulty is well-balanced if you can get past the bugs and the fact that a low-level will have an hard time to survive until the end of the first level (I've managed what 3-4 wave before seeing a game over?).\n\nThere are some bugs - that are still there, as I've said, developers didn't seem to care about our feedback to improve the game and to decrease the frustration due to these problems\n\nThe first problem is in the upgrade menu: it's hard to scroll inside, which is frustrating as the upgrade menu is also the shop for ammo.\n\nThe second problem isn't really annoying per se but can cause some headaches for some: if you pause during a berserker passage (when you take the skull bonus, you're in a berserk rage with a sort of machine gun), the specific view can stay and as it's a shacking one, you understand why some people could be bothered by it.\n\nThe most frustrating problem is an auto-switching of weapons for no reason at all. And if you try to go back to your previous weapon, you can shoot one bullet before seeing the weapon next in the arsenal on the screen. It's very annoying when you're stuck with a grenade launcher or if you have a huge wave and can't do anything but change weapons while enemies are coming to you. Soundtrack may be lacking during waves at these moments.\n\nThe fact that the developers never patched that showed how much they cared for the game on Steam, if there is no other serious reason preventing them to do something. I mean, you put a game, you get feedback and you get no answers.\n\nFor the price, true, you're not robbed.

The game is incredibly basic consisting of only 2 levels with 10 waves each. It has an unlock system where you get a new gun every few levels, i had fun just grinding kills and upgrading them to max. i also like how you have to shoot the gems to get the money, adds a little challenge and desicion making to it. The upgrades are good, limited in what they are but work none the less, you can really tell when your weapon has been upgraded. However there are a LOT of problems with this game, making it virtually unplayable. First off your level gets stuck at 19 with 7xp to level 20. Next is the gun reload sound, it sounds like a slow mo grinding noise its horrible. Your gun dissapears when you look to far to the left or right. However none of that compares to the most annoying thing about this game, for no reason at all your gun will just change, you might have a sniper rifle out and you shoot and suddenly the weapons swapped itself to the shotgun. This is a huge pain in the ass. If like me you have only the unlimited pistol ammo and ammo for the weapon youre using, then this game be deadly, its made me lose on several occasions because everytime i get the right gun out it just swaps it out again.\n\nI got this on a sale and i guess im okay with that, i wouldnt pay full price for it thought.
