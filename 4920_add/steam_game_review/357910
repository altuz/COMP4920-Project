I have almost completed all the quests, and honestly would like to see more. If it ever gets more support some things that would help the game are\n\n1.MORE quests the game's title practically is suggesting its based off quests. There is a total of 4 quests that are easy beside bandit quest. (I'm personally stuck on the part of bandit quest 2)\n2.I would like to see some more dungeons to beat\n3.Items. The shops have no obtainbable items, but you earn currency throughout the game\n4.Companions. In the bandit quest you can choose a bandit to work with you. If the bandit is taken to a dungeon it acts as a companion.\n5.More places to explore beside the few in-game as of today\n\nIn my opinion I see potential, and I feel the game will never grow without support. Overtime I would say more stuff can be added beside what I said. So today I'm hoping the developer see's my comment, and at least thinks about continuing work on this game. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494464210, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494464210, "recommendationid": "31675108", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 7}}
