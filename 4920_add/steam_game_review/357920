It shouldn't be DCS World style, but a little bit more realism would make for more tactical gameplay and hopefully make it more interesting\n- Some geometry glitch on the ground needs to be fixed, seems a solid is poking through the textures - nothing major it just is very noticeable\n- The ground textures could possibly be made a little bit higher resolution on the highest gfx settings as they look very bland now\n- A little more developed targeting system would be welcome - leading reticule for guns and a more solid lock on mechanism with tone for missiles maybe\n- The enemy AI could be a bit more after the player - they have a tendency to leave me all alone at the start at least\n\nAt this price you can probably afford getting it even though it needs work - given some more development it could be an ok title for smaller play sessions.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466683768, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1466707170, "recommendationid": "23725189", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516262", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466687570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198152381259", "num_games_owned": 642}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "not recommended at the present time, no button to reset your tracked seated position, so you have to run steam vr room set up and hope for the best, on menu i was sat behind my avatar and in game to the left of the pilot, controls were horrible could not swap sticks for roll, the cockpit canopy looked like it had not been cleaned for months and my machine guns fired constantly without me pressing anything.  with patches to correct the above faults this could have potential.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466699705, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1466784771, "recommendationid": "23729915", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504658", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467006519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198042800608", "num_games_owned": 74}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I know it's early access but the physics suck!

I tested the game using the HTC VIVE and Keyboard + Mouse to very negative results. The key issue involves the main window being unable to catch the mouse cursor before it leaves the border of the screen. If this happens, you cannot register the mouse clicks. I ended up, after several failed attempts, resting the Vive on my forehead and looking at the display window on the monitor to at least attempt a few more playthroughs. This allowed me to see where the cursor was, but it does not help the initial problem. Graphics are presentable, audio is extremely loud on default (and stuck on default), settings for volume and display options do not work, and motion sickness is a possibility. The content for this game is bare minimal with a couple of environments. The main objective revolves around destroying the alien mothership and that is pretty much the gist. \n\nI cannot recommend this game purely on the circumstances I played it, which is a Vive owner using a mouse and keyboard. You might have better luck with a controller or the Rift, but if you fall under the other two categories I highly recommend skipping until these issues are fixed. I know this is Early Access, but if a game is barely playable with a listed component, it still needs work. I wish the developers all the best and hope to review this again six months down the line. \n\nThis has been a EAW PSA. Included is a short video of my play through using the display window on the monitor.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ewTFrfhxQ0", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467084570, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1467084618, "recommendationid": "23881678", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497011", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466905772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561198280357058", "num_games_owned": 55}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is rough!
