I want to like this game but to many frustrations Not to mention so levels with toatly random worms floating around ??? thats not a Puzzle or stategy to that it is just messy and confusing for no reason??? I have even looked up how to beat some of the levels I could not beat but what I saw in vids never ever worked for me no matter what I tried or how fast. even got to the point where I was almost winning but still lost.
