First off the Xbox 360 pad is hopelessly lagged out and unusable. Game shows a bunch of yellow arrows on the first map for stuff to loot, its very hit and miss whether or not clicking on the arrows will allow me to loot. And yes you got to click the arrows not the things they point at. I cant loot the corpse so maybe thats why the game is unplayable as the tutorial is stuck at this stage? I am supposed to hold some kind of action key until a meter fills up, I can see the meter for a split second but then its gone and nothing happens. I tried pressing every key on the keyboard and I tried the mouse buttons. I tried aiming at the corpse and the arrow. Does not work. Otherwise the map is full of invisible walls, the doors wont open and I cant leave the parking area. I can see a mini golf area nearby, and I picked up a golfball gun but thats pretty pointless. Apparently this is some kind of walking simulator and puzzle game hybrid. The voice acting and comic book strip intro kind of won me over but the game itself was understandably a huge let down. Going to have to remove this one for Library Declutter.
