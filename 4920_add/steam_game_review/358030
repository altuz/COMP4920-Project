Just like One Way Heroics, a console-looking but really unique game (also not made in RPGMaker) that I love.\n\nSo I picked it up. Ive played literally thousands of RPGs.

If youre a fan of console RPGS, this one is way better than paying who-knows-what for another RPGMaker yawnfest. Even if youre burned out, its worth picking up. It is set so you dont have to grind if you dont want to. Always a plus, as grinding just to progress is one of those things that should be left in the past. You can also get rid of that annoying \"CRT scanlines and convex screen\" effect in the options. Its cute, but thats another thing that should be left in the past.\n\nOverall, its well done.

As is item & magic. \nThat's right... each turn of combat is picking ONE thing the ENTIRE party does, you literally can make ONE decision per turn. \nAlso, the fight action for both you and the enemy is un-directed, attacks from ea. character/enemy tries to hit every opponent in the combat.\n\nBoth of these choices combine to throw almost all tactical depth out the window. \n\nThis is the first RPG game I have ever played where getting a 2nd character became a liability... b/c instead of that character giving you an additional tactical choice each turn, \nthey essentially just become an extra fight attack. An extra attack with its own, lower health bar that you have to waste time with defend/item action to keep alive,\nsacrificing the attack that could have come for your other, full health hero.\n\nThe simple additions of letting you choose an action for each character, and requiring players to choose which enemy/group of enemies to attack, \nwould have made the experience so much better. As it is the grind is REALLY noticeable, and tactical choice is restricted to knowing to cast the element the enemy is weak to a lot.\n\nI have an inkling that they were trying to mainly imitate the original Dragon Quest... without taking into account that in the original DQ you didn't have a party, and you fought only a single enemy at a time. \nLater DQ games, with more player characters, you got to do multiple actions per turn, and you had to decide what enemy you hit with an attack command.\n\nIn addition to royally screwing up the battle mechanics, they game cheaps out on having towns you can actually explore. most cases you walk over a town and just get a menu to rest/shop/etc.\n\nI'm just really, really disapointed. The game runs well, they got the aesthetic spot on, the world & story are interesting... \n& if they had just put the time in to flesh out mechanics instead of taking shortcuts, ESPECIALLY with the combat, this would be a positive review. \nAnd the changes to the battle mechanics are not, to put it bluntly, rocket science.

This game defintiely deserves one, however.\n\nI went into this game expecting a retro experience with maybe just a bare minimum of a game, like most retro games out there.  I liked the premise, but the battle system seemed simplistic, and I was skeptical when I read that the game was ~20 hours.\n\nThus, I was pleasantly surprised when the mediocre impression I had before firing up the game proved completely wrong.  This game is definitely old-school in that it will be hard, even on the regular setting, but it rewards you for exploring everywhere all the time.  Even up to the final endgame portion of Another Star there was more stuff to find and more of the games world and lore to learn about.\n\nAnd to that point, the plot is actually pretty darn good as far as retro games go.  It's very Star Ocean/Phantasy Star-esque, which is what drew me to the game in the first place.  Yet, unlike a lot of games that go down this route, Another Star doesn't fall into the trap of doing too much with it's plot and fully explores the gameworld without feeling like there's too much extraneous padding.  I can say without a doubt it's a very satisfying and good plot, even if some of the running gags got a little old by the end.\n\nMy only complaint is that the difficulty balance seems planned around the \"High\" growth rate.  For most of the game, the battle system is surprisingly deep, with a wide variety of enemy strategies employed throughout the game, and much more thought involved than you might initially think!  However, I played ~2/3 of the game with the \"Standard\" growth rate, and a number of brutal encounters, but around that point it's almost unwinnable without large level gains for their HP increases.  Enemy magic is also brutal--elemental resistance equipment is worth its weight in gold.  So much so I would advise everyone playing this to keep those Waterproof Ponchos on hand the second you can get them early, because they were useful essentially until the last stages of the game.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game if you like older, turn-based RPGs!

I'm talking about the real hidden gems here, not the ones that are well known by now, but those games with not many reviews and which are fairly unknown. I can now say i've stumbled into one of those with 'Another Star'. This retro 8-bit console RPG insipired game is just awesome and a must have if you are into the whole retro-vibe/feel in modern games.\nIt plays its retro card very well, for example the CRT emulation is the best i have ever seen, even in official emulators. It was just so convincing that while playing on my big TV in the living room, i sometimes forgot i was playing on a modern LED TV. The music and sound effects are all delivered through Yamaha sound chip emulation which is again spot on. An amazing effort in making the game look and feel so retro authentic.\n\nAnd with the feel we hit another topic that is executed to perfection. It has all the mechanics and limitations of those early JRPG console games. There is no build-in world map, there is no mission log, so keep paper and pencil ready to take lots of notes. The combat is turn based, operated through menus, that will be familiar to a lot of retro gamers. However, a lot of the frustating bit, that plague the original classics, have been left out or have been improved.\nCombat is very balanced, not to easy and not to difficult, you will die a lot of times (there is a battle-retry option after you die), but it is fair almost all of the time. In case it does get too difficult, it is possible to decrease the difficulty.\n\nBeing an RPG, the story is important, and it is a great tale, with the usual unexpected twists and turns, funny moments, deaths of popular characters and a slew of memorable characters you start to take in as the story progresses. Excellent writing and never a dull moment as there are so many side quests and hidden secrets in the game that in my +30 hours playthrough i feel i have only discovered half of it.\n\nIsn't there anything bad to say about this game? There is one thing, they messed up the save system. It is very easy, if you're not careful, to screw up your save game and you possibly have to redo a great portion of the game. The issue is that you can 'save' at any point (which is good), but the 'exit/quit' option also saves your game! So, if you screw up and want to reload a game you cannot use 'quit' and reload, because it will overwrite your only previous good save.\n\nIn short, I can't recommend this game enough, if it would have been released in 1984 instead of 2014, it would have been one for the books, one we would still be talking about today as we do of the original Final Fantasy series. It really is that good.\n\nThe game works perfectly on SteamOS/Linux, i don't suspect it to be that resource heavy, so it should play well on less powerful machines.

It was a throwback to classic style RPG games, but can be played at a much faster pace.  I enjoyed the retro sprite graphics and the music was overall fitting and catchy (like an earworm, but enjoyable).  Random Battles are not an issue since you have the option to skip them.  Leveling does not have that significant grind-y feel and fights can be fairly quick since all characters in your team attack together (no micromanaging turns) and if you take the time to explore learn magics and exploit enemy weaknesses most enemies fall within 1-2 turns (except bosses of course).  It is easy to near the end max out your characters and feel very overpowered, but it was an earned feeling.  The game itself can be difficult or hard depending on how much time you'd like to put into exploring the very vast overworld.  There are secrets in almost every map, so it encourages you to check out every nook and cranny (and revisit some areas later on).  My main complaint was the limited inventory space.  I would frequently have to throw away items, to make room for new ones, which can be an issue when you don't know what they do.

But what it will do however is surprise you with a very heavy dose of nostalgia, especially if you grew up with a Sega console.\n\nThe game is basically a tribute to the RPGs of old where the mechanics couldn't be complicated and the presentation was very basic due to hardware limitation. If you ever played the early Phantasy Star or even Dragon Quest, you'll feel right at home.\n\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n\nThe game has a few options to configure the overall look, defaulting to using a shader to emulate the feel of a CRT screen. While it can be disabled rather easily, I would suggest leaving it active while adjusting the curvature to your liking. The shader will also add scanlines to make the pixels stand out somewhat more as well.\n\nThe music track uses a soundchip similar to old Sega consoles and the score is rather pleasant to listen to. Props to the composer as the music, even by the game's end, wasn't hard on the ear. Sounds used for combat were simple but also intended as such.\n\nThe overall story is told through very short cutscenes with textboxes without actual animations. In fact, the game have characters show up instantly in their places then disappear when no longer needed. The world design uses a similar simplistic look which requires a good dose of imagination to enjoy.\n\nTowns are visited on the world map and while there are no transition to 'town maps', the options offered usually offer a bit of lore about what is currently going on in the world. In fact, I was surprised by how quickly the dialog changed with every step of your quest and how each consultation often described an event in the form of paragraphs you'd usually find in \"Make your own adventure\" books. It gave the game a lot of personality and was unexpectedly engaging.\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe overall experience of the game can be configured to be either inline with old games' difficulty by adjusting the difficulty of battles (enemy damage vs player damage) and growth rates (rapid gain of XP and ressources or slower up to including a 'need 4x more XP than normal).\n\nThe battle system is turn-based, using simple commands that determines the party's actions. An unique trait is that there is no actual targetting since any action affects either the player's or enemy's party. For example, if a regular attack is used then each character in the party will attack every other character of the other party. If a spell is used, then all enemies are affected or all allies are.\n\nSpeaking of which, the magic system in the game doesn't use MP but are all cast from HP. This would be problematic if the game didn't also let you recover roughly 40% of your HP when the combat ends and about 15% while defending. Each character receives a unique set of spells and using one takes the whole turn, meaning your allies do not attack. Luckily, the same is true for enemies using any form of ability : if an enemy uses an action other than attacking or defending, then only that character acts.\n\nIt is an interesting way to speed up combat and once the variety of spell elements and their effects are mastered, some rather unique strategies can be made for boss battles.\n\nEncounters are random though you have the option to ignore a warning \"!\" to skip a battle if you only wish to zip through  an area (much like the system used in Wild Arms 2)... however, any \"!!\" must be triggered else the party gets ambushed on the first turn. Considering how short battles are however, grinding for XP and ressources isn't too taxing.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAnother Star is a fun experience. I went in not expecting much but Vision Riders Entertainment surprised me very much by their product. I would recommend the game to any who played old style RPGs and enjoyed them and even newer players wishing to experience something they might never had. It won't please everyone, of course, but for the cheap price of 11 CA$, it is hard to complain about the 10 to 15 hours experience offered for a single playthrough.\n\nThe game offers a nice set of achievements including some which require playing the game a certain way while others work as milestones. Completing some would require repeat playthroughs and likely lengthen your time with the game itself.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469773974, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1469774069, "recommendationid": "24590458", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475538802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 491, "steamid": "76561198206419189", "num_games_owned": 240}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is awesome. it is like playing Dragon Warrior for Regular Netendo (spelled wrong).

When I did stream it, I accidentally marathoned it. \n\nSecret areas galore, hidden sidequests, clever bosses.
