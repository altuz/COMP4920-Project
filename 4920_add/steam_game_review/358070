I'm going to say a little about getting the most out of the game.\nFirst, think of it more as a 'Garden' that you just leave running in the background, and come back and tend to every so often. For me, that's about every 20mins or so. \n\nAt first, you need to unlock all of the descriptions for the different plant and bug types, so that yo know how they interact... what the feed on, how they reproduce. To do this, you need to keep that plant/bug alive for 5000s straight. I'd recommend focussing on the Moulds first (OK, some of them are Carnivirous, worry about them a bit later, then) and pretty well ignore bugs altogether early game. Why? because The wrong bug can easliy wipe out an entire species or 10 of Mould.\n\nIf you have a Mould or bug that keeps dying, for no reason, it's probably Carnivorous, and has no food. Try reintroducing it once you have a bigger eco system running.\n\nI have yet to create a balanced, self sustaining system. It involves quite a lot more than you might think, actually. Right no I am in the middle of Terraforming to create separate Mini-Biomes, so that I can introduce several complementarty species that can rely on each other, and hopefully not wipe each other out.\n\nThis is the appeal of this game, it's preject with a view to the long term, kind of like making Bonsai.\n\nIt's always interesting when the planet decides to throw something random in the mix, though.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430717573, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430717573, "recommendationid": "15680826", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596667", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454109199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 390, "steamid": "76561198018811596", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty cool and unique little gem here.

Unfortunately I wasn't managing it well and eventually saw my ecosystem nearly collapse. with only two fungi left and all my bugs gone. \n\nHowever, I manged to bounce back. Once I got a grasp on how the various bugs and fungi interacted, I soon found myself with a healthy enviornment with mushrooms and fungi, plenty of roaches and beetles, mantis to eat them, saw my first spider come in and grow into a little spider society a little away from my mountains with my mushrooms and flies. It bounced back completely, much more diverse and more individual creatures and it felt like I had accomplished something. \n\n\nEarthtongue has a nice balance of being able to interact with the world enough to guide it, but you're not expected to micromanage every single thing.

Some combinations mesh well, others are at odds, and some develop symbiotic relationships. \n\nThe beetles, for example, are territorial and won't hesitate to attack other insects. However, they leave a lot of carcasses (theirs and their enemy's) along the ground, which is useful for flies to munch greedily upon.\n\nThe setup relies less on action and more on re-action. You push and pull the flow of creatures at a meandering pace, more intent on watching the What and the How than trying to force your agenda. Like a real terrarium of sorts, the experience is in dropping one or two new objects and waiting, or even just checking back in an hour. As you learn what makes every creature unique, the entity will write in-game logs attempting to detail them in ways that you might not have noticed.

It will point out quirks that you will learn as you play for hours on end. It covers the base game-world, but the resources that you manipulate in the game has patterns and limitations, and will appear in any game module.\n\nWorking with the game ecology and finding the in and out of sustainable systems, i want to say the ecosystem is flawed, and the 2d nature of the game is part of the reason. The game life finds local maxima to survive and will burn out over time. Life in this game works like wild fire burning dry trees, leaving behind ash for the next generation to regrow. Maybe this fire analogy is an accuracy way to expect how life will NOT continue to thrive without considerable maintenance by the user to 'fuel the fire' of this system.\n\nTo support the system there are two resources: water and nutrients. How these resources move in the ecosystem limits how plant-like life grows:\n\n Rules of water is simple and less critical to life, water refreshes at the lower layers as ground water, and very rarely by rain, life and time drains the water, some life depends on water more than others, the top of mountains are dry and only some plants will naturally migrate and survive on hills.  There is no way for the user to improve the desperation of water without continuous work of manual rainfalls. \n\nHow nutrients replenish in the system, is ideally, by nutrient falls from the air. This is like another rain, but it is governed by rules the user must explore and he can enhance. There is a max cap or nutrients in the system that will fall before it stops and it can be increased by the user, but the amount of time and work to saturate the entire land with even falls automatically is unclear and possibly unachievable when compared to the volume of the land that is slowly increasing.  \nIt is the scarcity of nutrients which will kill your ecosystem overtime because of limits how nutrients migrate. The dead rot and emit nutrients back in the surroundings. The living can move and die somewhere else, then rot and make that new land fertile.  \n\nThe rules how nutrients, as a particle and in  this 2d space, is what limits life in local maxima of good condition.  Nutrients will over time sink deeper in the ground, and be inaccessible to  all but few plants with the right roots to reach, plants that by chance may never grow above these deep nutrients, and in this a world stacked with deep vertical tiles. Nutrients do not move off tiles on its own, and i am sure, never spread horizontally on its own, this limit of motion is what forces only local healthy sub-ecosystems;  be it intended or a flaw i do not now, but do not expect drainage from ground water to help move nutrients along the world, and happenstance to hot spots of life that need it.\n\nInstead to move and fuel nutrient short term and as a buffer, within supporting life the time of random and a slow nutrient fall hits; you need swarms of creatures feeding and rotting above plants. The creature ecosystem has balancing problems. Ideally there are diminishing returns feeding  nutrients down the food chain, where the loss appears back into the falls, but there are errors of positive feedback; flies and corpses on top of sticky-like plants was one, but was patched; but know where there are dead-eaters stacking, there is a deadlock of nutrients being looped and disappearing in that mini system and not spreading around and hopefully reappearing in the falls somewhere else.\n\nLikely, when the measure life is high in local spots, there are dead zones somewhere else, and like the wild-fire analogy, plants will burn out without fuel from the falls, life will die, and the unique life count will drop down to zero, without your help.   \n\nDon't expect life in this game to be self sustaining , expect everything to burn out because resources that fuel this strange life: water and nutrients, do not migrate naturally in the ground, diminish within food chains, and slowly and randomly drop from the sky.
