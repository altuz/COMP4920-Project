I like it a lot.  It's a tough rogue style game with a great narrative and oodles of charm.  \n\nAs far as the replayability debate goes I would say this.  Whereas the content of this game is low enough for you to discover it all quicker than some people feel happy with I view it with the same regard that I would a board game.  After all, it feels very much like playing a board game.  I have plenty of excellent hobby boardgames where I am aware of all of  their content yet I still come back to them again and again.  What is replayability?  For me it is having enough variables to ensure a different experience every time.

The result is that after 1 or 2 playthroughs the game will start to become boring once you have seen most of what the game has to offer.

It's more arcade-y than most other roguelikes (you always have a final score), and you can easily complete 6 expeditions in two hours. This makes it really forgiving in comparison with the long campaigns that you typically see in other roguelike/RPG games.\n\nAs a result it's very easy to pick up and play for a couple of hours, which in my opinion balances out the repetitive aspects. Then again, I really enjoy games like this that rely upon optimizing a team and their gear to see things through.

While the other reviews are correct that this is limited in its scope (ie once you go on a few expeditions, you know the game inside-out) this does not detract from the challenge or experience.  The randomness of expeditions and higher difficulty setting makes this game very replayable.\n\nFor those who appreciate nods to old PC adventure games, references to historical figures, dark humour and feeling the reward of a long struggle, this is for you.  Without spoiling the game, if you play the harder difficulty level you will find yourself eking out crucial resources (water/food/whiskey/ropes/machetes) just to clear a few miles of jungle/desert/grassland/tundra.  You are always so close to your next goal (a moment of rest, peace from scavengers, a few treasures, some scattered items that make the difference between a comfortable week's journey and utter hell), but something always arises to stifle you.\n\nThis game can be punishing, but when you reach the prize it is all worth it.

It's difficult, it's got that strange quasi-educational vibe, and it's strangely addictive. In a way, it's a lot like FTL: Faster Than Light: A rogue-like strategy game with lots of exploration and well-written flavor text. Usually describing grisly bereavements.\n\nThis game is reasonably priced for the content you get, to say nothing of the completely free expansion packs and updates the developers include. Not just bugfixing, there've been brand new characters and even new expeditions added in updates. Really cool stuff. Also the development team is really amicable and involved, which is great to see. As a result, Curious Expedition feels like a lot of thought and effort has been put into it, and it's always improving.\n\nThat's not to say I don't appreciate other peoples' opinions: The most common criticism is repetition and lack of content. In my personal experience, everything is still feeling fresh and interesting twenty hours in. I'm still discovering new stuff, unlocking new explorers, and learning new optimal strategies that make me want to play again. Curious Expedition is also difficult, occasionally unfairly so, due to some roguelike elements. Superior tactics can only get you so far sometimes, and you can definitely get a disproportionate amount of bad luck. But succeeding is a great feeling, whether or not you feel like the game \"let you win\". \n\nI do feel like there are a few balance issues. Some of the explorers are drastically better than others, which makes 100% completion potentially frustrating later down the road. In addition, some strong enemies or obstacles can be \"randomly\" placed in front of key objectives, which can effectively torpedo your entire effort up to that point. I've heard that the game will never give you a truly \"impossible\" situation, but I'm not so sure. Either way, it doesn't really matter. You don't win every run in Enter the Gungeon, you sure as hell don't win every run in FTL. Getting straight-up screwed over in a video game can be frustrating, but it doesn't matter if it still feels like you're making some form of progress.\n\n[spoiler]Oh yeah, and Harriet Tubman fights velociraptors with dynamite.[/spoiler] Recommended.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500236587, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500236587, "recommendationid": "33593427", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503401511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 213, "steamid": "76561198012008918", "num_games_owned": 489}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really cool little game. There are a lot of mechanics going on here but all are simple enough to navigate after just an hour or two. The art and writing is really nice and a big part of what makes this game so pleasant to play. Sound design and music is very decent. Although not super historically accurate it still scratches that exact kind of itch. The way you approach your expeditions has multiple approaches, such as trying to maximize fame, maximize fortune, or just trying to survive and restore the loyalty of your crew. You also get to prepare for your expeditions depending on the climate you plan to embark on.\n\nCombat is really cool, each member of your crew gets a certain set of dice, and during combat you get 3 rounds to roll your dice before the enemy gets to go. You then make combinations of these dice to create certain moves, in a Yahtzee kinda fashion. Or you can build your group around avoiding combat, and specializing your loadout/playstyle for that.\n\nI also really appreciate the difficulty level. You have to make very tough and intelligent calls to survive your trip based on randomized encounters, and there are plenty of compelling greed incentives to make things spicy. RNG can really screw you but it's up to you to play that out conservatively and get your crew out with minimal damage. No matter what your expedition should have a chance at success if you play smart and plan for the future. You play a series of expeditions and have a chance to compensate for a couple disasters.\n\nThe amount of characters and starting loadouts you can choose is huge and pretty interesting, although not quite diverse enough to make any one character require that drastic of a playstyle change. This makes unlocking all of them a bit irrelevant if you aren't into completionism. The maps also get to be a bit samey, even across climates. You can tell that once you learn the systems the game will start to lose it's fresh feeling of exploration, at around the 5-8 hour mark. However the gameplay mechanics seem have enough depth to keep it interesting even after that, as a sort of roguelike text adventure.\n\nA small technical problem I encountered is freezing after alt-tabbing the game. But of course that could be specific to my computer.\n\nOverall a very solid game, 7.5/10 in my book. Must play for those that like text adventure/roguelike genres. I  gotta be honest I don't see myself playing it too much longer but that is no knock to the game itself. I just get bored quickly. The $15 price may be a little steep if you aren't hyped on the atmospheric, anthropology/historical side of this game. If there were more specified character loudouts, additional writing and music, and diversity of encounters I could see $15. But for $10 or $5 I'd say is a good price to buy at and very fair in my opinion.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503399022, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503400271, "recommendationid": "34413121", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504021", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500149799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1687, "steamid": "76561198059612278", "num_games_owned": 203}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Forgive me for the simple review.
