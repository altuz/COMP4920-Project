Very good options for allowing kids to practice on their skill level.\n\nIt also saves a players name so you can go back with logging in with that name. \n\nFor a 25 year old game, it did it's job of letting my kids practice math and have fun.\n\nOne of my kids that hates doing math home work at the table played this fo 2 hours strait and I could see her getting better at figuring out what a word problem was asking.\n\nSo if you are thinking about picking this game up on sale for kids to play it holds up well and honestly seems to be much better than the word rescue game (but I only tried the first level of that one and felt it was very basic with picture matching, where this game let me set the difficulty to the child)\n\nSo is it worth $20, no way.
