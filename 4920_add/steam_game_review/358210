And as of now, they have that certain charme.\n\nControls are pretty easy, gameplay is simplistic but still challenging. To move forward to the next level, you have to rescue all the pets and find the (sometimes hidden) exit. During the levels, many different enemys stand in your way, such as zombies, skulls, witches, demons and so on. Another thing that might be interesting, is the fact that there are plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nFor my part, it\u00b4s very enjoyable and wll done.

Johnny Dash is 10-years old whos puppy Tex has gone missing for a few days. Just as when night falls, a Thunderstorm rolls in as Johnny is pulled under is bed by a hairy arm with green eyes who's on his side then warns him that his puppy hasn't just gone missing but was kidnapped by the evil Count Chuck; ruler of the Underworld. Count Chuck is kidnapping helpless household pets and is turning them into monsters. Johnny is enraged by this turn of events. So the green eyed enity arms him to the teeth with a slingshot and a special rock that somehow has infinite ammo then vanishes.
