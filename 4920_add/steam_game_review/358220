I used to play this game so much as a kid,  and you know,  there weren't many games at the time that I could say that about.  This one draws you in all easy;  the first tower is a push-over.  Then comes the second tower; you need to do a little thinking in this one.  By the third tower,  you are at wits end; never knowing which corner a monster will be,  never sure of where the next bit of food might be laying in order to save the rest of your starving, dragged out,  now poisoned body.  This game is worth the price tag,  and if you have the reflexes and brains to get to the last tower,  I will personally mail you a delicious loaf of stale, pixelated tower bread.
