So you have to make your way to the exit but every level gets a bit more challenging. Either its aliens, laser guns shooting at you, other lasers (or electricity, it depends), spikes or other traps, you should survive it all. And also think your way out in order to open closed gates or use moving platforms wisely. And that's pretty much it.\nAnd the control is very basic and easy, so no complaint about that.\n\nSure, it looks very dated and barely even has sound but if you like playing games like this one for nostalgia and don't feel bothered by all this you can get some nostalgic, cool sci-fi entertainment out of this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462489790, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1462489790, "recommendationid": "22818497", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503214", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452735387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 158, "playtime_forever": 50, "steamid": "76561198038310096", "num_games_owned": 612}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Monuments of Mars plays somehow /somewhat like \"Pharaoh's Tomb\" - just better since its...\"playable\".
