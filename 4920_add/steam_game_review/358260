Some of the platforming is a bit tricky in some levels, like pixel perfect jumps, inevitiable hazards, and some traps that will require a level restart. Thankfully, unlike a lot of older platformers, you do not have lives. You can die as many times as you want and it will immediatly restart the level you are on. I wish a lot of older games were like this as it makes the game more relaxing and not pain-stompingly difficult to the degree you rage quit.\n\nTo the people who complain about the lack of music, just use Steam's Music player and put on some tunes. I used Retro City Rampage's soundtrack to this game and it fit perfectly! ;)\n\nSince this game is a platformer, I could not recommend enough to use a controller when playing this game. If your controller does not work in the game automatically, use JoyToKey ( http://joytokey.net ) to map your buttons to a keyboard key.
