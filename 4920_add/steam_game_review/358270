You start with around $500 and a really bad car, and you must work your way up the ranks to become the best...yeah, no story. But it doesn't need one, as it lives and dies by it's gameplay.\n\nYou use machine guns, upgrades, new cars, and sabotoge? Yes, you can bribe mechanics to damage the best racers. You can also get rocket engines, spiked bumpers, and mines. You earn money from winning races, but you can get extra by doing certain tasks like killing all the opponets or not taking damage. You can also get hired to do things like killing a certain racer or getting \"objects\" and achieving first place (to hurry and deliver it...but wouldn't that draw too much attention if you get first place? whatever...). To start with the graphics they're great and have a nice blend of colors.And the crowd can smear blood trails if you hit them which is a nice touch(why are they on the track of a place called death Rally!?)though the tracks while they look good...some seemed to look the same with diffrent colors. \n\nThe sound is good. The machine gun sounds are great and the music is fine, but while it does it's job, it's not as dark as I thought it would be. Nice engine sounds as well. The controls are really tight and gets better with more upgrades. \n\nThe gameplay really shines here, with a great sensation of speed and the need to destroy your opponets, it just always feels intense every race. I really should mention you can turn off weapons...but that would ruin a lot of the fun,though it could be used to get the hang of the controls. Now the down sides are that, it can be grindy since you need cash to upgrade and get better in the races. You can NOT win without new cars and upgrades, and while that can be a turn off to some, it never made me feel like I was wasting my time. Not too much in the terms of replay value. Just multiple difficulty levels, though I had enough fun to want to play it again. Also the ending was anti-climatic. Not much beyond \"You Win!\" but I think the gameplay makes up for it.\n\noverall 8/10 -If you want a good arcade-style racer with some edge, then this is what you want.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498864567, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498864717, "recommendationid": "33059835", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514563", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502514030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 4240, "steamid": "76561198168690505", "num_games_owned": 579}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "review": "This gem of game.. where do I start...\nFirst of all thanks to whoever is responsible for this being here, it works flawlessly on windows 10 not even screen tearing like the original dos version, absolutely brilliant!\nNow about the game itself, it's probably the best racing arcade game ever made, the content, the immesrive gamplay, the texts, the freaking coolens, the art, its quite amazing for those times and relevant even today.\nIf you never played this game as a kid I highly recommend you to give it a go if you did well i dont need to say anything do I..\n12/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498839729, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498839729, "recommendationid": "33045380", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498964222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 319, "steamid": "76561197984178431", "num_games_owned": 109}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "a classic Remedy entertainment game, remember playing the demo years back.\n\nKind of like micro machines but with guns, steroids and magic mushrooms.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498856440, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498856440, "recommendationid": "33055640", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 29, "total_reviews": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
