Then an Alien Race known as the Kretons jump to Earth using a Wormhold and plans to conquer it as if things weren't bad enough. So the call goes out to Major Harrison Stryker, a hero of the Recent World War who takes a Special Attack Starship into the Wormhole to destroy the Kreton Homeworlds on the other side. The Problem is that the Kretons have also taken Human Hostages and you need to free them by ramming into their Holding Cells using your ship since they're immune to Weapon Fire.\n\nWith a Total of 24 Levels: 12 Stages & 12 Boss Battles, you'll be blasting the Kretons to Atoms again and again. There's 4 Sectors for each Episode that contains 2 Levels in each Sector & a boss battle for each one:\n\nThe Lava Planet contains: The Orbital Station, Water Sector, Land Sector & Lava Sector\nThe Arctic Planet contains: The Arctic Sector, Land Sector, City Sector & Lava Sector\nThe Desert Planet contains: The Orbital Station, Desert Sector, Lava Sector & Tech Sector", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432420084, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1477769844, "recommendationid": "15973446", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494431", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
