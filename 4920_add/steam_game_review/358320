I bought it as part of the 3d Realms anthology. A set of classics that are mostly excellent (though some have already been released like Raptor and Shadow Warrior Classic).\n\nRealm of Chaos had good graphics for a game of its time and was well advanced for a game of its time. A nice smooth scrolling platformer game. The sounds are expected of a game of its time, but the graphics are very nice. The game play is pretty straightforward.\n\nThis is definitely a game for nostaglia.\n\nThanks for re-releasing it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441677346, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441677346, "recommendationid": "17937268", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512804", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447821400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 34, "steamid": "76561198148807374", "num_games_owned": 162}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A hack and slash platformer from one of the masters of classic PC games, Apogee (now 3D Realms).
