I spent so many afternoons playing this after school and it brings back wonderful memories. \n\nThe game is pretty straight forward. Just match the word to the picture that is hidden somewhere and there are bonus little monsters roaming about. The controls are easy to learn and it is a great way for children to start learning simple words and perhaps it may encourage them to read, which it did for me. There are many different environments in the game and all are bright, colourful and easy to navigate.\n\nThe price is low and well worth it, even if it's just for nostalgic reasons :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506089336, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506089410, "recommendationid": "35128661", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
