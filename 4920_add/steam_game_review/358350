It might not have been as popular as Duke Nukem, but it still has a charm of its own. This title doesn't really have a complex plot. You're just some secret agent who's trying to stop the evil plans of this criminal organization. I don't think that's something bad though, I mean, when the plot is something as cheesy as that, the last thing that I could possibly care about is the story. As for the levels, there're 3 different episodes available and you can pretty much navigate throughout the island and choose wherever you want to go, kinda like Megaman style, but fancier (or more bureaucratic) in a sense of word. That said, compared with some other games from nowadays, Secret Agent doesn't really have some smooth graphics, cool sound effects and not even a proper soundtrack. Either way, the most important factor is still there, which are the gameplay and the fun factor. The controls are very responsive and they're also compatible with a X-Box controller, which makes everything much interesting for someone like me, who as a kid, only had the first episode available (shareware), and also had to play the game on a keyboard. Since the game is old, it still relies on that points score system, which nowadays it's somewhat irrelevant. I mean, even if there's the internet available for you to compete with the whole world, there's always a funny guy to mess things up with an exploit or something. The only bad thing about this Steam version, is that you have to download nearly 1gb to play something that could easily fit in a floppy disk... Well, and the price too, come on, have mercy! That really makes no sense whatsoever. Well, that's pretty much it, I hope that you may enjoy this game as much as I do, even though it may seem so outdated, it's still quite fun and challenging in my modest opinion.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498607097, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498691210, "recommendationid": "32898311", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495387094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 84, "steamid": "76561198081294899", "num_games_owned": 264}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Time to get to one more childhood classic of mine: \"Secret Agent\" by Apogee.\nIt's a 2D platformer starring an agent \u00e0 la James Bond (more like Daniel Craig actually which would be anachronistic) who has to master each level by collecting certain items, opening gates and doors, shooting bad guys and finding the exit. So a real deep story is not present, it's very basic. It's not even like you can drive awesome cars or have some stealth action or hot loving. You know, like your next door agent.\nNevertheless, it is quite a fun game but also a challenging one. The challenge is that you can die pretty quickly and you need to memorize and learn in order to pass certain dangers properly or to avoid mistakes that can mess up your progress.\nYou choose levels \u00e0 la \"Commander Keen\" by looking at maps and enter accessable levels you can find. \nYou can save and load your game but just by typing numbers (goes like \"Save your game by pressing a number between 0-9\"). Just keep that in mind if you're used to clearly visible safe spots (as all of us) or if you share \"Secret Agent\" with other players.\n\nThe gameplay is not flawless (it's especially not always easy to control your character when it comes to landing jumps precisely) but in general it's okay and easy to learn.\nThe graphics are not bad for the time period it was made in but unfortunately it uses a whole lot of grey, so it gets kind of dull here and there. So it's not one of my favourites when it comes to graphics in classic platformers/Apogee games.\nWhen it comes to music: There is none. There's only sound and it's also rather minimal and hardly heard. Mostly you will heart bullets or rays being shot, sound cues that tell you when an important event has happened and your own jumping sounds.\n\nOne word about the villains because they are a lot of fun compared to other elements in this game: Have fun checking them out because there's quite a variety of them. From robots of various kinds and Terminator-like dudes to rolling ray guns on the ceiling.\n\nSo, \"Secret Agent\" is surely something to try out for classic platformer enthusiasts. But others might find little attraction in it because of the dull and dated graphic and sound design or the same tasks you have to solve in every level while performing trial & error lots of times.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500492933, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500492933, "recommendationid": "33657977", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503187603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 228, "steamid": "76561198071206305", "num_games_owned": 1177}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I loved this game in the early 90s and I'm glad to say it holds up really well.\n\nSecret Agent is a basic puzzle/platformer that's all-around really solid. Your moveset is limited: You can run at one speed, jump, and shoot. Despite these limitations, the controls are very responsive and your protagonist is pretty easy to control. You can stop on a dime, even in mid-air. Your jump is also always the same height so you learn pretty quickly to recognize out-of reach ledges and collectibles.\n\nWhat really makes Secret Agent shine is its great design. The level design gets deviously trickier as you progress, pushing your mastery of the simple controls to its limits. The point in every level is the same: To escape by finding and blowing up an exit. To do that you'll usually need to find some dynamite, collect keys to unlock color-coded doors, find a floppy disk and use it in a PC to deactivate laser fields, and sometimes find glasses that make new platforms visible. Besides that, many levels have optional objectives to net you more points. The letters S, P and Y offer 100 points each, and en extra 10,000 points if you collect them in order. There are out-of-the-way satellite dishes you can destroy for 5K. There are hidden money bags you can trigger by jumping in certain areas. You get a 25K bonus for beating the level without getting hit. All of this adds a surprising amount of depth to the game. You can play it like an arcade twitch game and just try to find the quickest path to the exit, or you can try to maximize your score by thoroughly exploring the level and seeking out all its secrets. Should you risk taking a hit and missing out on the 25K bonus in order to backtrack to a satellite dish? Shoulld you use 5 bullets on a relatively easy-to-avoid enemy or save the bullets for a future stage where you might need them more?\n\nThe graphics, though incredibly basic by today's standards, are absolutely packed with charm and awesome details. The background elements include a security cabinet with an animated view of a camera looking down a hallway, armories stacked with crates and various (decorative) weaponry, and even lived-in touches like pool tables and steaming coffee cups. The brick wall tilesets include convincing shadows when a ceiling light shines down on a floating platform. Everything looks very clean and recognizable and is pleasing to the eye. The sounds are sparse and, though limited to PC speaker, are still quite charming.\n\nIt's certainly possible that my nostalgia for this game has influenced how I currently see it, but I think Secret Agent is a gem of a game. The level design is fantastic and filled with optional challenges. The controls are solid and responsive. The graphics  are delightful.
