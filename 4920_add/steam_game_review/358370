Controls are perfect using the 360-Controller - firing with the right trigger is extremely satisfying! The levels however are a bit pale from a game design standpoint - you pretty much do the same all the time.\n\nNote: I've played using the Microsoft 360-Pad and the Saitek PS3200. For some reason, the controls using the MS-Pad are a bit stiff in that the Analog Stick doesn't seem to support diagonal movement. That means you can either move to the X- or Y-axis, but never both. The Saitek-Pad however works just fine and lets me do vertical movement. I don't know if this is a problem with my PC but I thought I'd share this with you.\n\nThe graphics are very smooth and nicely done.\n\nThe levels are cool - you get the typical icy/volcano-ey and deserty planets, but also a sort-of death-star-knockoff shaped like a giant dagger. \n\nThe music is cool, however they are only like 40-Second-loops, which was OK for when it came out. This isn't a bad thing -  as a kid I didn't even care about that. The music is still a lot more creative than the generic orchestral soundtracks you get in pretty much any AAA-game nowadays, and it has a nice variety. The \"Moon Dagger\" music is really awesome and together with the dark level design makes it really intense!\n\nGreat game. 10/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433189344, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434297897, "recommendationid": "16121950", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510513", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431380324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 545, "playtime_forever": 1171, "steamid": "76561198036196702", "num_games_owned": 2963}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This one has my childhood all over it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456411332, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456411332, "recommendationid": "21444664", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515234", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451273251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 15, "steamid": "76561198021912561", "num_games_owned": 147}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ahh, an excellent game similar to Descent but by 3d realms.

The game is pretty good, but it was the first in its series, and many of the obvious faults, such as the somewhat bland level design, were objectively improved upon in the later games Fury3 and, my personal favorite, Hellbender.\n\nApart from one crash, the only problem I encountered was an awkward control situation. This is emulated through DOSBox, which seems to have issues with input hardware detection. Worst case scenario is that the game ignores the analog control of joysticks and gamepads. Instead, it will recognize these motions as regular keyboard presses, and this is a pain for steering. Mouse controls sort of work, but take a lot of tweaking to get just right. I personally found the best option to be a gamepad, steering with the directional buttons and controlling thrust with the right analog stick.\n\nOther than that, this is a blast to play.
