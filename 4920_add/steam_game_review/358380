From when it came out on the snes to the present day with Mario Kart 8, it's made people who don't even like racing games enjoy it with it's crazy weapons and a ton of personality. Wacky Wheels was an earlier attempt to give DOS users a kart game. And it does this...and not much else.\n\nI will start with the pros. This game has a good amount of content with 30 race tracks(15 orignal and 15 bonus) and a battle mode where you hit targets to build points, with 12 tracks in this mode(6 orignal and 6 bonus) as well as a time attack, all this is enough to keep you busy. It also has two player split screen and online which is cool. The graphics are nice and colorful, the characters are all animals and are cute. They come with a lot of animations for the time. The sound design is good with nice sound tracks and plenty of the said tracks. \n\nI must say as good as the animation and graphics are, it has problems. It's a little jittery. I can't describe it but it's almost like it's loading scenes as you drive. This isn't so bad that it breaks the game. But I did have to get used to it.\n\nThis game also suffers from limited weapons. You have porcupines as a main projectile(as we all know how dangerous they are if fired out of a gun) They are scattered all over the tracks and carry over the races. The less common ones...aren't all that interesting to me. Heck, half of them are planted on the ground and stand out on the road limiting their usefulness.\n\nMy biggest issue is the tracks don't have much personality. I can't tell you my favorite stage...because they all feel the same to me. The tracks have diffrent aesthetics(although only 3-4 diffrent ones) but none of them feel diffrent to play.\n\nAt the end of the day I don't think this is the worst kart game ever. But if you have better ones as an option I say go for that, as I can't see the need to go back to this game now that i'm finished with it. But if you like kart games then I recommend it, just don't expect anything mindblowing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500418451, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500419765, "recommendationid": "33639911", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502037", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 29, "total_reviews": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
