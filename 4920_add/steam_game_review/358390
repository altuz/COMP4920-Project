You may also need to disable Steam Overlay then, since the pop-up will get stuck in the margin.\n\nThis is a pretty solid side-scrolling shooter from the nineties. Sound and graphics are similar to what you'd expect from a classic Amiga action game, with bouncy MOD format music, pre-rendered 3d art and animation, and parallax scrolling.\n\nThe Steam version runs in DOSbox, since this is an old MS-DOS game. It was very stable on my Windows XP system.\n\nI used mouse control for this, and it felt pretty good. Mouse movement response can be adjusted from slow to instant, with or without a visible mouse pointer. Left button fires your main gun and special weapons, right button fires nukes.\n\nYour ship starts with a main gun that can fire either a spread or a stream of bullets, depending on your Plasma or Pulse pickups respectively, and can be upgraded in power during the level by grabbing more pickups. You have two \"nukes\" you can detonate to unleash a wave of powerful bullets, which spiral outward from your ship and cancel enemy shots.\n\nThere are pickups and powerups to collect from destroyed structures and ships, including extra nukes, gun upgrades, shield recharge, credits, lives, and invincibility. Many are hidden, hinted at by a brief \"sparkle\" around their location.\n\nThere's also a shop system accessible between levels, where you can spend credits, from the green crystals collected from destroyed ships, and from grabbing credit pickups. You have two empty weapon slots, top and bottom, and you can buy special weapons to mount in these for extra firepower. These vary from bomb droppers and credit collecting drones, to auto-tracking turrets, homing missile launchers, and a dual laser which can shoot though walls and multiple ships. You can also buy more nukes, extra lives, faster engines, and \"satellites\" that orbit your ship and absorb shots.\n\nThere are three difficulty levels available; the highest can be a real challenge even for experienced shmup players. There is a six level \"shareware\" mission, plus three full \"registered\" missions of nine levels each. These are space, surface, and underwater themes. (Your engine and weapons all work exactly the same in each environment, even if you have a flamethrower installed.) Waves of ships firing a wide variety of projectiles, hazards like hydraulic doors, and bizarre boss ships await you. The levels are well-designed with lots of hidden pickups, destructible structures, ambushes, and traps.\n\nYou can save in different slots during the game, or between levels at the shop. Finishing each of the full missions plays an ending cutscene, and there's a high score table. The options menu includes adjustments for amount of debris from destroyed ships, male or female announcer (\"shields low!\") voice clips, mouse response speed, and a music jukebox.\n\nMinor gripes section: There was supposed to be support for SNES and Sega Genesis (really) gamepads, and it's in the options menu, but it doesn't do anything since the adapter that was supposed to allow this was vaporware. The ending cutscenes can randomly crash the game. Starting gear you can afford kind of sucks, in particular the very slow engine you start with, so the first couple of levels of each mission will be off to a rough start, until you can afford better gear.\n\nOverall this is an excellent piece of work, and a cool blast from the past.
