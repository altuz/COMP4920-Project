I will update my review when I have finished extreme rise of the triad (might take awhile). \n\n\n\n\n[u]What I liked about the game[/u] \n[list]\n[*]\tHas one of the best power ups in any game; one which allows you to become a dog which \nallows you to bite people to death.\n\n[*]\tLots of different traps, makes the game quite challenging.  \n\n[*]\tThe levels don't feel too much like a maze. The levels are big and open, and they take place inside and outside.\n\n[*]\tThe biggest selection of rocket launchers I have ever seen. \n\n[*]\tAwesome and challeenging boss fights.\n\n[*]\tYou can play as different members of the HUNT team. \n\n[*]\tMany secrets to found throughout the game. There are also secret levels. \n\n[*]\tA fair life system, which doesn't seem to have a limit on how many lives you can have.  \n\n[*]\tNew enemies and weapons are introduced in each episode.\n\n[*]\tYou can customize the controls in options; you don't have to mess about with Dosbox. \n\n\n[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u] \n\n[*]\tOnly two weapons that use bullets, and they have infinite ammo.\n\n[*]\tSome of the levels are too long. Sometimes it takes a while to reach the boss on a level; which quite annoying, especially when you die and have to start the level all over again. \n\n[*]\tKilling enemies isn't very satisfying, compared to games like Doom and Wolfenstein. The enemies in the last episode are like bullet sponges, the game at this point becomes more of a chore to get through.   \n\n[*]\tIt's a shame it doesn't show you each of the characters stats.\n\n[*]\tLevels aren't particularly interesting; I didn't like the use of colours.\n\n[*]\tIt's a shame you can't select the episode.  \n\n[*]\tThe shrooms power up sometimes doesn't wear off causes sound to go all wonky. \n\n[*]\tYou can sometimes get stuck on objects. The game crashes sometimes. \n\n[*]\tThey reuse the same cut-scenes in all three games.\n\n[*]\tHow you supposed know what to do to defeat the last boss is beyond me.\n\n[*]\tNot easy to look up and down, you have to use the keys; there is no free aim using the mouse. \n\n[*]\tWish enemies dropped their Mp40 more often.\n[/list]\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u] \n\nNot a bad game, just wish there where more bullet based weapons (and other things). If you like games like Wolfenstein, Blake stone or doom then I recommend you give this game a try. You get a lot for your buck. It might be worth buying the Apogee throwback pack instead. For an extra \u00a32 you can get both rise of the triad dark wars and extreme, plus you get Blake stone aliens of gold and planet strike. You don't get the rise of the triad the hunt begins episode, but that episode was shareware so you be able to get it for free.  \n\n[h1]7/10[/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497566955, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497567026, "recommendationid": "32455815", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512545", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
