Graphics are pretty basic and plain and ugly. Sound effects are super basic. It's not really much of a puzzle, just a \"Click here to catch drips\" and then \"oh, a leak, click the hammer, click the leak\" and then \"oh a ghost or a ufo, click your object and then move it out of the way\". It's really not worth any adult's time to play this.
