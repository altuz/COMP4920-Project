While this game is episodic, the first episode has shown a lot of promise and I was able to get 3 hours worth out of the first episode. You play as Violet, an esper who's special power is being able to read people's emotions. She is out to work on a new case with her partner, Blue. After completing what may be a simple murder case turns out to be much more and starts Violet on her journey to her decision on how to save humanity.\n\nIn the game, you are met with a couple of investigation scenes and interigation scenes. During the ladder, it's much like L.A. Noire with its system of presenting evidence and doubting someone based on their testimony with their emotions when you can't present something. Out of these parts, you can pretty much expect the usual with visual novels and choices. Similar to Mass Effect's renegade and paragon system, you will be forced to pick choices that will make you allign either towards blue (Law), red (chaos), or stay netural. I only did one playthrough and stayed relatively netural, so I'm not sure what changes there are between the three allignments.\n\nFor the first episode, I found myself really lost in the world. There are so many questions you find yourself asking and thankfully albeit slowly, the game does give you some answers. There are a few surprises, one even made me scream at my computer. GG writer, gg.  For the price, think of it as a Telltale game.

It\u2019s available on Windows, Mac OSX and SteamOS/Linux via SteamPlay for $5.99, and includes both Steam achievements and Steam trading cards. Published episodically in four installments, the first episode is currently available with the rest being included as DLC for the same price, to be released in the future.\n\nLex parsimonae\n\nThe story revolves around Violet, a psychic agent of SPECTRA, working for the Bureau of Human Protection under the supervision of the Selenon; the all-powerful beings ruling the Earth from the dark side of the Moon. For the most parts the story is well-written and captivating, yet some scenes manage to feel more or less a filler that adds really nothing to the story \u2013 maybe because they don\u2019t achieve the deeper character development they aim to do, and just end up making those scenes feel a bit rushed. There is also a whole lot of back story available in the in-game dossier, presenting more information about the world and people of Selenon Rising to those interested in that.\n\nIt takes about 2.5-3.5 hours to clear the first episode, and assuming this will be the case for the remaining three episodes as well, it can be said that overall this is shaping to be a decently priced title. The obvious problem with episodic content is that the next installment will be released when it will be released: there is no definite release schedule available, so the closest thing is \u201cupcoming months\u201d listed on the store page.\n\nVisually Selenon Rising is competent, and the black and white backgrounds help create the feeling of a somewhat depressing \u201cretro-future\u201d. The occasionally used more draft-like drawings for the CG\u2019s are quite nice, but I would still prefer to have the styles matching each other better to keep the overall art direction consistent. Animation used in some scenes is really nice, and it brings life to those moments.\n\nFor the most part, the audio work in Selenon Rising is magnificent, and it really fits the theme and helps set the mood. However, I found the music used in interrogation to be pretty much the exact opposite of this: it\u2019s quite loud and fast electronic music that seems to be completely misplaced. I can kinda see what the developers were trying to achieve with such decision, but I do not feel that it fits the game at all.\n\nWait a minute!\n\nThe main gameplay aspect in Selenon Rising is the interrogation mechanic, which is pretty similar to that of L.A. Noire, and I mean that in a good way. The player is able to listen to what the suspects are saying, and then either question them, doubt their emotions or present evidence that contradicts what the suspect is telling. This mechanic may sound a bit complicated, and to be frank especially when dealing with judging emotions and shooting down interfering emotions it can get pretty hectic. It\u2019s not overly hard, but will probably lead into few confusing situations, and might be completely off-putting to some players.\n\nBut it does add a nice element of interactivity, when one has to search the scene for related items, and then use this information when confronting a suspect. There is a way to turn on an outline for the important items on the scene, making it easier to find everything that is needed. Those really into point-and-click games might be happy to just keep it off, which is the default position.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nWhile Selenon Rising has few shortcomings, none of them are too much to make skipping the game necessary for someone interested in a mystery visual novel with interesting gameplay mechanics. That said, I am completely opposed to the episodic release method used more and more nowadays, as it leaves too much open questions in terms of continuation of the series. Still, assuming that the rest of the content will get released in a timely manner, and that they\u2019re all around the same length, is Selenon Rising definitely worth the money.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1475833871, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1475833871, "recommendationid": "25900371", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499835", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501686763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 347, "steamid": "76561198101799498", "num_games_owned": 68}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Has great potential but the lack of choosing your own path and choses such as not being able to side with the selenon or being forced into a romance with blue was beyond infuriating i screamed when you couldnt agree with the dark one, but it has an interesting premise i just hope the devs address the romance and pathway chooses, such as having a chose to shoot or at least arrest Zarla.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464037181, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1464037813, "recommendationid": "23161968", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487348", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484337245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 96, "steamid": "76561198299718188", "num_games_owned": 278}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Selenon Rising is a horrible visual novel.\n\nJust horrible.\n\nEven if it's free don't do this to yourself.
