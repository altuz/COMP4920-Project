The stages are so so boring and predictable it looks like they got an asset named \"ground\" and just plonked it around at random. The enemies are all the same and the combat is ennoying rather than fun - it is not challenging though, it's just a bunch of guys doing the same thing as the first minute of the game.\n\nThe \"luck\" mechanic was a kinda neat idea but in attempt to be all stylish retro it lacks any real substance.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502411845, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502411845, "recommendationid": "34158055", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505278", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 31, "total_reviews": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 9}}
