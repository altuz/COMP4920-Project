There's no real replay value because of how long it takes to beat the game and get all the fun toys like the purple death laser that floods the screen with purple imposible to see, or the cool looking blue death laser that misses 90% of the time. I like the unreliable nature of the top tier weapons, but some are much riskier than they should be, like the plasma cannon that losses it's ability to kill missiles effectively and trades it for a very low damage AOE attack that hits me most of the time and barely does anything to enemies.\nOn the other hand the secondary shotgun weapon near the end of the game, kills missiles, does good DPS and it's knockback can be used as a pretty good makeshift dodge at times.\n\nA note for the devs, if you ever make Good Robot 2 make the corridors much much bigger, give us essential upgrades from the beginning and make the game more instant response, bullet hell action where death is merely a minor annoyance instead of an unfair Dark Souls with limited lives.\n\n\nIn short, if you have time to kill and are more into the electric side of music perhaps you could have fun with this game if you're good at Dark Souls.

The visuals aren't widely varied in terms of the level design and backdrop, but it was pleasing nonetheless. A lot of games will skip out on this aesthetic polish. I didn't find it too difficult, but it felt like scratching an itch trying to find the weapon combinations that I most enjoyed. It took about a dozen iterations before I found what I wanted and proceeded to beat the game on my 2nd try. That being said, I played like a total coward since I noticed early on the increasing cost of resources it took to upgrade/repair. If I could avoid spawning more enemies onto the screen, I always took a cautious approach.\n\nMovement was crisp, but I felt much more in control using Mouse/Keyboard (to each their own). Weapons were not necessarily innovative, but they all had their own distinct feel to them in a polished manner. Some felt strictly better than others, but perhaps I'll have to test that in another run of the game.\n\nThere's no way I'm going to get those hat achievements.\n\nSolid game for a solid price.

If you die, you start from nothing.\n\nIt's a very simple game, just random level layout. The layout is not complex at all and each level is farily short (5 screens worth).\n\nAt the end of each level, you can choose to purchase a set of random upgrades or items. These upgrades go buy buy if you die. Again there is no saving.\n\nYou can purchase hats for your robot for each level, but they do nothing but change your appearance and the hats disappear after the level is complete. You can buy a hat at the begining of each level.\n\nThroughout the level you can obtain, money, primary gun and secondary gun. Guns are replaced so you can only have 1 of each, and you can't choose from a list og gus you've collected because you can't collect them. Guns go buy buy if you die.\n\nUpgrades incluse increase damage, rate of fire, shield capacity, etc. They are expensive and you can typically accumulate enought money to purchase 1 upgrade per level, but that is if you don't need to replenish your health. The store at the end of the level, where you purcahse the upgrades or items is random, so you don't always get to choose an upgrade or the option to replenish health/shields.\n\nYou can also get shield, which is just health. You'll need to get health throughout the level or purchase it at the end of the level in order to survive through the levels.\n\nAfter a level is complete you can decide to go through 1 of 3 gates. The gate you choose decides what your next level challenge will by. They can be more money/items, more enemies, harder enemies, boss, and maybe others. The gates appear at random, so you don't get to decide which three gates appear.\n\nGame mechanics are simple, just fly around and shot either enemy robots or wall mounts that produce enemy robots. The contoller version doesn't allow for finer motion of the gun, I'd recommend mouse and keyboard, you you get this.\n\nI guess the biggest disappointment is the lack of any kind of saving or progress retention.\n\nI purchased this for #3 (66% off), but it's probably only worth 50 cents if that. It's entertainment value last an hour at most. There are more intreging games out there, that were better thought out. I'd suggest skipping this one and getting something else to spend your time in. As there are a lot of games out there and this one just doesn't cut it. The onyl thing it's got going for itself is the pretty graphics/art (but even this is only ok ). Clean, crisp and colorful eye candy, that's all it is. I guess that is what sold me, and the price, but boy was I wrong.\n\nSkip!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495725105, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495725105, "recommendationid": "31953352", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481706", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498500619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 11, "steamid": "76561198004493629", "num_games_owned": 448}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nothing bad about it, nothing great about it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498500651, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498500651, "recommendationid": "32824781", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468211", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 110, "total_reviews": 120, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
