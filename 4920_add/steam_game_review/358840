So if you play solo I guess it's a good game but I refuse to do so until they fix this problem maybe the next update.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434757756, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434757756, "recommendationid": "16538452", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509684", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472782760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198196112105", "num_games_owned": 30}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ok.
