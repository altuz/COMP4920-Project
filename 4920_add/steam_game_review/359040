There's some interesting and unique worldbuilding, as well as tense, eerie moments but as a complete package it just feels a bit too vague and abstract to be tangibly and entirely good. It suffers from very awkward dialogue and far too much exposition from its characters. The protagonists are both pretty unlikeable, and considering how much of the game is their character interactions, I can't recommend The Music Machine wholeheartedly. If you can get it for $1 then you might enjoy it enough to justify that price point. It's not the worst of its kind but it's not notably great either. 5/10 for me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503828146, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503828146, "recommendationid": "34525772", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499505", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472796068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198046311355", "num_games_owned": 824}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I could only get so far in this one. I just tried it out and found the story to be terrible and very amateur in its technical aspects. In other words the writing is very poor. The graphics are okay I guess. If you are interested in this kind of thing being the main visual style. Even if you like this walking simulator, I find it highly overrated on Steam. It's really not that great, and I will try just about any game no matter how boring some may find them. Dear Esther for instance I liked quite a bit. Many other walking simulators like Firewatch and Edith Finch are actually written well. I just couldn't get into this one. It feels too much like a college art project, and not even one edited by a competent writer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502783643, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502783813, "recommendationid": "34251240", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494918", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 141, "total_reviews": 154, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 13}}
