Your vehicle upgrades matter more than your agility, and as you start with the most upgradeable one, there's no reason to ever use or upgrade another.  While there are tracks that show they know how to give you -just- enough of a view to quickly react, all too many contain spots where you literally cannot see what's oncoming.  There's a reverse-your-controls debuff that's leaned on entirely too much, and that reverses your boost and brake buttons in a way that knocks you out of the game (given you otherwise just hold down boost at all times).  Buying gate keys and track info is completely pointless, and \"gold\" times and tantalum are just the same thing (that is, the tantalum you get is just based on finish time, and the time needed to get all the tantalum is the same as the gold time).\n\nOh, and the gates are the four usual suspect colors, with no way to change 'em.  If you're red-green colorblind, it will be a problem.\n\nDodging gates is surprisingly fun. Get into it, get a good streak going and you feel like a ninja, it's awesome. And those moments are much rarer than they should be, due to several elements of the game's design.

It plays nice, and such... On Windows.\n\nI, however, use a Linux PC. Primarily one that is 64 bit in nature. Switch Galaxy Ultra, despite having a SteamOS logo and \"Linux/SteamOS compatibility\", doesn't even get off the ground on my Linux PC. Why? Well, if you look on the forum, you might find a post regarding how 64 bit Linux distros are failing to run this program due to missing libraries. The game is looking for 32 bit versions of said libraries instead of the 64 bit versions that may ALREADY be installed on said system.\n\nThis has been going on since the game was released. The developer is aware of the situation, but have yet to patch an update. There have been no updates as to its progress since I brought it to their attention.\n\nAs it stands, if a user wants to fix this, they can just download the 32 bit .deb files and extract them to the game's library directory, which does make the game work. (This was also detailed in the forum post.) Developer has not reacted to the findings.\n\nI will admit, I did get this game on a sale where it was at a discount. However, I did get DLC with it. None of it works on my Linux PC.\n\nSo, as a result, I did something I really DIDN'T want to do... and I installed the game on my Windows PC and played it long enough to leave a negative review. It has been months since I brought the issue to their attention. It has been since the game was released that it has been broken on ALL 64 bit Linux distros. I tried giving them ample time to fix their problem, but not one peep has been made about it. It's a real shame, too.\n\nNow, should they fix it, I'll be happy to reverse my recommendation upon testing on my Linux PC. I WANT to give a positive review. I want to support Linux developers. Unfortunately, when the developer doesn't develop their game past a broken state, I can't honestly support the developer's work. If they were honest with their Linux release, it would at the very least work on all forms of SteamOS distros, including the 64 bit version. Since someone using the 64 bit SteamOS mentioned it didn't, I'm going to have to leave a negative review for now. Here's hoping they fix the issue soon.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462764117, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1462764117, "recommendationid": "22874158", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522822", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448249739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 35, "steamid": "76561197997527737", "num_games_owned": 266}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very challenging game.

Along the way, you earn money in the form of credits, which can be used to purchase new ships, upgrades, and new paint jobs. \n\nMusic and sound effects are decent, but nothing special. Why the developer has a music pack DLC available is anyone's guess. \n\nGraphics are okay. although they certainly aren't what I'd expect in a three month old game (the game was released on Nov 20, 2015 and this review was written on Feb 20, 2016), although I suppose cutting an indie title like SGU some slack in this area is only fair. \n\nUnfortunately, there are some major problems with SGU. \n\nThe voice acting is atrocious and characters pronounce words oddly, as if English isn't their first language. Maybe it isn't, but if you're going to do voice recording in English, you'd better get voice actors who can do it without sounding like a bad comedy sketch. \n\nI have to assume the developer tagged friends, family, and co-workers to do the voice work. If not, then they must've hired the cheapest professional voice actors in the area. \n\nControls are also a little weird. Although you can use the keyboard or controller to guide your ship, all the visual cues in the game are from the keyboard. Normally I wouldn't have an issue with that (if nothing else, usually the opposite is true), but a game like this seems better suited to a controller and if the game acknowledges one, the cues should change depending on which gaming device is being used.\n\nWould I recommend Switch Galaxy Ultra? Not at its normal price $9.99 USD, but if you could find it on sale (like right now, when it's 80% off at $1.99 USD), then it might be worth it. \n\nBecause the rating system on Steam only allows a \"yes or no\" decision, I'll have to vote no since I can't give a positive vote to a game where the decision to purchase it hinges on a huge discount.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456021559, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456021559, "recommendationid": "21354316", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504264", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456006788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 131, "steamid": "76561198254686499", "num_games_owned": 45}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's insanly difficult for a racing game, unless you like games like that you should avoid this one.
