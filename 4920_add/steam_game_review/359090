With just 12 missions, it didn't take long to complete everything, including the optional bonuses. \n\nIt's very easy, but it also features some great pathfinding, partner and enemy AI for such a small project. \n\nThe low-key piano music is a bit odd at first, but helps create the slow pace that the game moves at. Despite being slow, it can also be frantic in a couple of the later levels, with Mission 8 being a particular stand-out for 'traditional' top-down arena shooting craziness.\n\nCould've done with controller support and quite a lot more content. Maybe an 'endless' arcade mode, or something.
