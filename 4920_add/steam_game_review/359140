Ploughing through the enemy with a horde of commandos was immensely satisfying.  As was completely wrecking the scenery with flame throwers and grenades.\n\nBut it was only the momentum of that first fun that carried me to the final act.  Kick Ass Commandos gets repetitve fast.  Some have called it a bullet hell shooter but it's not.  The slightly springy camera makes precision dodging difficult.  The enemies bullets are small and fast and don't come in patterns, their only attack style is to shoot straight at the player with some random spread.  \n\nThe gameplay leans more to a stats/grind style than a skill based shooter.  The Easy difficulty setting is far to easy but the Elite (second) difficulty requires levelling up health and damage before they can be meaningfully attempted.  The core feature, the Commando companions, is a bit of a gimmick.  There is no way to change their formation except to squish them into walls.  At the beginning of the game they're overpowerd but towards the end they're useless except as brief bullet sponges.\n\nThe Commandos get in the way, steal health, trip over mines and get hooked on things.  I found the best option was to go it alone carefully and then come back and rescure them just before completing the stage.  A troupe of elastic skating commandos on the late ice stages is a whole lot less fun than it sounds as they slew wildly into trapped crates and boxes.\n\nGarry, seriously man.  Get out of the way.\n\nThere's also number of small annoyances that compound the frustration.  There are no in-game options, there is no music volume control.  The - I assume - store bought muzak tracks are not balanced (and not great either).  I had to quit the stage to turn down some of the louder tracks.\n\nSteam achievements only worked in the first two acts.  The Commandos themselves are all identical with only different skins to distinguish them; there doesn't seem to be a way to respec points after they've been assigned.  Points put into Valor are points wasted.\n\nThe game icon is still the default Unity icon.  The Steam overlay doesn't work.  The irritating 'Please give us a positive review' message breaks In-home-streaming if clicked accidentally.  The springy camera makes precision shooting whilst dodging difficult.\n\nAll-in-all Kick Ass Commandos isn't terrible but it's only worth getting if it's heavlliy discounted.  You'll probably only put a couple of hours of play time into it before moving on.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498510072, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498510072, "recommendationid": "32830148", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519676", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506033278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5071, "steamid": "76561198038038563", "num_games_owned": 37}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Loving the George Washington update for U.S. Independence Day.\n\nI do hope that down the road, however, we can have some customizable levels.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498783632, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498783632, "recommendationid": "33016878", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503949", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498612521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 160, "steamid": "76561197970203803", "num_games_owned": 184}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Good little twin stick shooter, still in development.
