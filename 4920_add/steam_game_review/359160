Okay, so here's a maze chase game between you and a zombified child except one of you can walk through the maze walls and the other can't. Two guesses as to who gets to wield that obscene power. This is actually unplayable. It's clear that from the start of the game, Zombie Kid spawns in the opposite corner of the maze and just zeroes in your position, striding through walls like the goddamn Juggernaut until she either traps you in a dead end and just stands there waiting for you to end the game or suddenly no-clips through a wall to do it herself.\nDifficulty ranges from Easy to Brutal but doesn't seem to have any impact on the game. Admittedly, I didn't try Brutal although I predict that doing so would give her a skateboard or the power of flight.\nCheck out the video below for a glimpse at this utter catastrophe.\nhttps://youtu.be/-DVSlxsaEuc", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436286987, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436286987, "recommendationid": "16928756", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436349112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 429, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "num_games_owned": 1513}, "votes_funny": 10, "votes_up": 157, "comment_count": "6", "review": "\"End Game Triggered.\"  It's not often that you see THOSE words pop up on-screen in a game (unless, perhaps, you're the programmer themselves doing a demo run).  This occurred after many, many minutes of running down literally IDENTICAL stone corridors, and was the result of me going, \"Hmmm, that's the first thing I've seen even vaguely resembling a nasty in this game\" - in the form of a spooky little girl with fucked-up eyes - and wondering what would happen if I walked up and said \"hello\" to her.  Result:  \"End Game Triggered.\"  Which, apart from some tiny words in a corner of the screen, basically added up to a brief image of her up close-'n'-personal before my game, well...ENDED, oddly enough.  \n\n   \"Play again?\"  Hmmm...sure, guess I'll humour this a WEE bit longer...but alas, skipping between the three different maps, some of which feature rain and others which feature a snowy blizzard, still doesn't suggest that there's much VARIETY to be found here.  What's more, it seems drastically underfinished...again, the word \"demo\" springs to mind.  Hell, your footsteps don't even make a sound in the corridors of the great pyramid of Giza, and apart from some quite lovely music there doesn't seem to be any other \"sound design\" whatsoever.  Though oddly enough, I don't see the words \"Early Access\" anywhere on the Store page...\n \n   There's a serious lack of fresh ideas in the horror genre of late.  Some obscure little game called Amnesia gave the genre a much-needed boot up the rear some years ago, and \"stealth horror\" masterpieces such as Outlast, Alien: Isolation and Among The Sleep have slightly raised the bar since then.  This is one game destined to NOT join the ranks of those masterpieces, and while it doesn't necessarily \"lower\" the bar any, it has perhaps one good \"idea\" in its tiny little head...namely, the dropping of flares like breadcrumbs to know where you have and haven't been yet.  This IS a bit of a necessity, though, given that the scenery is so gosh-darned SAMEISH that you wouldn't have the foggiest what you're doing otherwise!  And that's about where the \"innovation\" of this one ends.\n \n   Now, I'm not saying there isn't any potential here.  Although the serious lack of any STORY - these are just one-off \"maps\" - means that this won't be going down in history as a horror \"classic\" or anything, no matter how hard the devs try to save it.  But DO the devs have any intentions whatsoever of improving on what they have here (which isn't really that much)?  I cannot, in all good conscience, recommend this until some serious improvements/embellishments are made.  And ten bucks, full price, is just a sad joke.  Here's hoping that the folks behind this AREN'T just hit-'n'-run opportunists, and they do enough work to make their \"game\" worth at least HALF the price they're currently asking.  I won't be holding my breath, however, given that the devs chose to call themselves Undead Yeti Software...'nuff said?!  \n \nVerdict: 3/10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436259200, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447915477, "recommendationid": "16922949", "language": "english", "votes_down": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625970", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436387835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30, "steamid": "76561198025451131", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 53, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game appears to be very unfinished.

The control is taken away from the player, and the pacing of the game is slowed down, right before a very low-poly model of a zombie child 'attacks' you. There's no fun, and no variety in the environments, or in the scares.\n\nThere's certain parts that could have potential, but this is very beta-esque. And that price tag??? For this? Unreasonable. I filed for a refund after about a half hour of attempted gameplay (I will have a rather humorous LP video of it up, soon.)\n\nRemember the movie 'The Room'? It was so bad that it was good? This kind of feels like that, only it's a game. It's kinda fun to laugh at it, actually, and that's what I enjoyed in my LP video. But, that's short-lived.

(Daylight, Time Ramesside)\n\nOn the easiest difficulty you can complete this so called \"first person indie horror game\" in less than 10 minutes. If you crank up the difficulty the game just add a chasing ghost. There is only two levels in the game : the maze and the house. The maze is a total mess as it is so confusing to navigate through. The house, on the other hand is pretty much straightfoward. So basically what you do in the game is : 1) find your way in the maze, 2) find a giant skull that teleports you in a house, 3) pick up a key, 4) return to the maze, 5) find the exit. At the end you are greeted with a congratulation screen. And the plot, what about it? There's none. Not really rewarding, isn't it?\n\nThe only positive things about TAKEN is that you're given the choice between three types of ambiance/esthetic and five difficulty modes before getting into gameplay.\n\nLet's hope Liam Neeson never find out about this game.\n\nHere's my playthrough :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aos8nuYLFw\n\nRating :\n1.0 / 10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441832048, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485412326, "recommendationid": "17961400", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526024", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440813704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561198139641362", "num_games_owned": 117}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "3", "review": "I Hope People Read The Reviews and look at what the rating of the game , this game is so bad i didn't but I Got A Refund.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440814039, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440814039, "recommendationid": "17764250", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503317", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448213628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198197234309", "num_games_owned": 314}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I like supporting indie games, which is how I got this one.
