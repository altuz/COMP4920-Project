People who don't mind a game with an arguably environmentalist message.\n\nRituals is a point & click art game, not an adventure game. I want to preface with that. If you don't enjoy walking simulators or games designed primarily to evoke thought and emotion in the player you'll find Rituals extremely boring. On the other hand if you do enjoy similar games I would encourage you to give it a try.\n\nRituals is not the most emotionally provoking of games and in comparison to others I did find it a little bland but overall it tells an intriguing story about modern human's relationship with an animistic earth. To pick up on the story you do need to read notes & magazines, all of which connect together to offer a loose narrative. That said they're fairly hard to miss as long as you explore the whole game.\n\nMy one complaint follows the others that have been mentioned, the controls are a pain to work with. To move you click preset arrows and to look around you click and drag. This separation of camera and movement controls meant I was constantly switching between moving and readjusting camera perspective which felt like a waste of time.\n\nOverall some parts of the game could, and probably should, have been done better but if it's goal is to tell a story and create an interesting atmosphere I feel it succeeded. I'm not sure I would recommend it at $4.99 but if it interests you definitely keep an eye on the price and play when you can.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502316633, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502337012, "recommendationid": "34134190", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
