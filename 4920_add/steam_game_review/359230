If you'd like to maybe get away from your more emotionally taxing games, like Dota2, this is a great go to game to recharge your spirits. It's a modern day take on Pharaoh+Cleopatra, a game I've loved since my childhood. The mechanics are almost the same, but LPOP is more understanding. The graphics and the soundtrack are amazing.

I recommend city-building lovers to get this game, but I suggest waiting for it to go on sale. :D", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504893202, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504893202, "recommendationid": "34819686", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510950", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506245878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561198006159887", "num_games_owned": 44}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Do not buy this, you can't play it on 1920*1080.
