That being said, hidden object games can sort of be a hit-and-miss thing for me. There are some really good ones out there, but there are some that don't do a good job at all.\n\nUnfortunately, \"Green Moon\" is one of the latter. I could not get into this story at all. There's no hint button, like in other HOGs, to help you out when you're stuck. None of the characters are relatable, it doesn't feel like there's any motivation for the actions you perform...how could such an interesting idea for a story end up being such a mess?\n\nLike I said, there are a lot of good HOGs out there, and there are plenty of them on Steam.

SOLUTION TO GAMEPLAY PROBLEMS !!!!  First of all: totaly worth the money if you can buy it in a sale and like old style point&click adventure games. Strange plot but nice scenery and totaly playable if you know the quirks of the gameplay. First of all I had issues with launch and then with not being able to put items in inventory or combine certain items that should be combined, but the trick (for me) was to download the game, then completely exit Steam. Start Steam again and from within the library choose Green Moon and press play. The inventory problem was solved by not clicking the item and then clicking it on the empty spot of the inventory list (as described in the tutorial) but actually dragging them from the scenery onto an empty inventory-list-spot. The combining items was more tricky since it's a bit random. Sometimes you can just click one item in your inventory onto the other to combine and sometimes it only works when one item is in the inventory and the other is dragged onto it from the scenery (this for instance was the case with the pestle&mortar in the basement wich is used to ground coffee and red pepper but also for the steel cutter and copper wire from the garden and some others). Two real glitches for me whilst playing: trying to light a match in both the pyramid and the Maya cave as well as using the magic chalk in the Maya cave halted the game completely so I had to close the game and restart (thank got for save games). And be sure to save regularly since you can die at several points and the autosave works on completing a task as well as when exiting the game through the menu but there are many points in the game you want to save before continuing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504256699, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504256783, "recommendationid": "34655024", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
