You fight increasingly difficult monsters along the way, ranging from little skulls that will barely hurt you to long range fiery monsters that will be your doom on many-a-run. This game was ported from mobile devices, and while it may be a fun game to play on your phones and tablets, it does not meet the standards for a PC game.\n\nThe settings are very simple and do not allow you to control much. To start off, the few options available are not very clear. They have unusual icons, that You can\u2019t control the overall volume of sounds and music, and both of these are extremely loud by default. You have to turn it off entirely to get rid of it, which kills the point of having a soundtrack placed in your game. PC games need volume sliders or whatever it might be to control the exact volume of the noise, because many PC gamers may have other audio playing while playing games and you may want to make certain things louder than others. There is the volume mixer, but sometimes there isn\u2019t enough space on that to make it the appropriate volume and honestly, add a volume slider if you\u2019re going to being making games on PC.\n\nThe font has proven to be quite confusing at times. When learning the controls, the messages popping up can be confusing for certain letters, like \u2018O\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019. These can be easily misread, which makes the controls very confusing and this quite simply shouldn\u2019t happen in games. The font should be very clear, and while it should suit the game and not just be a fancy cursive font all the time, every letter should still be clear and distinguishable to make all the text fully legible.\n\nWhen you first play the game, as you get farther, the difficulty of the game will automatically increase and more difficult monsters will be introduced to the game.This is an interesting concept, but in my opinion it doesn\u2019t work with roguelike gameplay. You should be able to choose your own difficulty whenever you want. This is a vital aspect that makes the game progressively more difficult, and stay that way even when you\u2019re starting a run. Sometimes the scaling can be very steep, and you will start fine but then get pummeled on even the very next floors. The automatic difficulty increase makes it so you can\u2019t control how hard the game is, and can be very frustrating.\n\nThe classes in this game all play very similarly. Of course there are differences, and they are quite apparent in terms of actual character stats and the stat increases as you level up, but generally the play style for all of the classes is quite the same. Classes with shorter range are much more difficult to use, and classes with lower damage are for the most part useless. Classes with higher magic can keep spells going for longer, but spells are mostly uncontrollable in this game, making it pretty useless. As soon as you get a spell it activates, and they aren\u2019t even very common so having a high magic stat will not be very beneficial most of the time.\n\nThe PC controls can be very inconvenient at times, even with the 2 separate sets of options. The standard WASD is available, which is fine, but the arrow key controls are entirely useless because they are so difficult to use. If you don\u2019t like WASD and you want to use the arrow keys anyways, you should be able to customize these controls in the settings, which is also unavailable because of how little you can control in the settings.\n\nOne of the most annoying aspects of this game is that the auto-fire, which in my opinion is a core aspect of this game to truly make it unique and honestly more fun to play from the get-go, doesn\u2019t work properly. You can press any of the given auto-fire buttons (I believe it\u2019s X and A) and it will fire, but it won\u2019t always continuously shoot as it should and you have to keep holding it down to get it to aim and fire properly. On my first runs, the auto-fire would keep firing after I pressed the button once, which was as an auto-fire should be, but later it stopped doing this and I had to hold the button down to get it to aim, which is extremely inconvenient given the control scheme for this game and the other buttons you need to press to play the game.\n\nThe quests in this game, which you can get by entering the rooms that will sometimes show up on the level, are very badly made. It will give you a random quest to either kill monsters, collect a certain type of money or save friends, but sometimes these quests are impossible because the type of monster you need to kill can only be found on much deeper floors or much higher floors so you can\u2019t find enough of them, or the time period is simply too short to be able to find enough of the item given the size of each floor. The quests should always be completable, and since you\u2019re given a time limit, the game should give you quests based off amounts of certain enemies and items that you will be able to find on your current and upcoming floors.\n\nThe graphics are exactly what you\u2019d expect for a game ported from mobile devices, and while it\u2019s not that bad for a roguelike game, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s quite up to par. It\u2019s cute and everything is very pixelated, which is generally a normal thing for roguelike games, but some things are a bit too pixelated and unclear as to what the shape is supposed to be. This isn\u2019t the worst aspect of the game, and doesn\u2019t really affect gameplay too much, but it\u2019s worth mentioning to anyone who finds graphics to be very important.\n\nOverall, this game is quite simply not worth your money. You may be able to get a couple hours of mild fun out of it, but in the end it doesn\u2019t seem worth getting, even when it\u2019s on sale. Playing a short 2 hours of this game, I found far too many flaws for my liking to continue playing and it was just far too annoying and boring to keep going. With so many flaws and things that haven\u2019t been looked into after the porting of the game, it\u2019s not worth the money you spend on it and the little space it takes up on your hard drive.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435809959, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435809959, "recommendationid": "16837742", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529547", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444071798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 203, "steamid": "76561197995225947", "num_games_owned": 156}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty cool game, but has lots of small problems.\nSome bugs had been fixed on the very first day, so I removed them from the review.\nIt all feels a bit cheap and rushed. For example it has mouse support, which doesn't add as much as I'd hoped. If you keep the mouse still for a second the old auto-aim and auto-fire kick in, wasting your powerups.\nWhat bothers me most is that the game doesn't tell you how basic gameplay mechanics work.\nThe dev says it's part of the fun, but in my opinion it's frustrating, because gameplay mechanics are buggy and inconsistent so you never know what's intended behavior and what's a bug.\n\nFor example I had a health-regen potion that lasted me for 15 or 17 dungeons. And then suddenly it was gone without a warning. The screen is waaaay to busy to notice something like that.\n\nEnemy projectiles are nearly invisible (some actually are!). At some point you will encounter an enemy that rushed towards you as soon as you enter a dungeon and kills you within 1.5 second. No idea what to do there. Some goodies are way OP, some work for 0,1 second so are quite UP. Everything seems very unbalanced. Good for a browser flash game, but for 6 euro's I expected more of a game that followed some of the unwritten rules of game-design\n\nOh yeah like all dungeon pixel games it requires lots of luck. Don't get good loot or do-able dungeons? Try again :) But that's the norm nowadays and that's cool. There are also some bugs, like some monsters can hit you 20 times a second without doing an attack and the ram-thing that comes out the wall shouldn't damage you when it stopped moving, but sometimes that also damages you 20 times/second. If you get hit at that speed you don't hear yourself getting hit either, so you might not notice it before you're dead.\n\nI wish I would have just gotten the 3 times cheaper similar android version. Then I would have thought I would have gotten my money's worth. On the pc though... Meh, it's a fun game to waste 10 minutes on...
