I launched it, couldnt open settings, everytime I tried to go to button configuration the game freaked out and brought me back to the home screen, the \"back to main menu\" button crashes the game. But, easily the worst thing about this game is that it doesnt work. When you click on a level it brings you into a loading screen where there is an animated icon in the top right corner where a finger is repetedly pushing a button, i pressed every button on my keyboard and i could never get past the FUCKING LOADING SCREEN, the closest i could get is that \"p\" for some mother fucking reason PAUSES THE LOADING SCREEN, useful right? I know you have to press something to get by this loading screen because i got past the first loading screen by smashing my keyboard until it worked, also game play wise this game also sucks. It tries to throw this god awful, cringe inducing convoluted story at you that has nothing to do with what you're doing in game; but thats another story. This game is amateur AT BEST, and thats being extremely generous of me.

But you still get cash even when you die, so it won't be for nothing.\nI like the music and feeling of destruction you make, especially when you level up a bit and go into lower zones.\nLeveling up your char, and upgrading your abilities with special coins, which.. I still have to find out how to get.\n\nI didn't like the dialogues to much, there is some humor in it. But it couldn't really keep my attention. \nAction feels a bit clumsy and the characters are unbalanced.\nAn additional note is that you can't play on fullscreen (although it still fills up until your taskbar).\n\nSo is it a taker? That's up to you, the price ain't that high. And if your into this sort of games, there is plenty of hours of gameplay to put in.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVa3ZZRTezA", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433803613, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433807231, "recommendationid": "16267537", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496371", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1455805016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1286, "steamid": "76561198012590081", "num_games_owned": 210}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Ok!\non fullscreen (Alt + Enter)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433847836, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433847836, "recommendationid": "16274060", "language": "english", "votes_down": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449632", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452428904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561198174300681", "num_games_owned": 88}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "What is this game and how do I play it???
