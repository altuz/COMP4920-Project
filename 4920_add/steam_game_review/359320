I was a huge fun of original Elite (on C64) I played a lot both parts of Frontier (on Amiga and PC) and I could never imagine the remake could go so well giving beatiful graphics and so many possibilities. But it's not a game for everyone (that's a truism I guess).\n\nElite puts us in role of a spaceship pilot. We are left there without any futher help. We can do many different activities as trade, missions, passenger transport, bounty hunting, piracy, mining or exploration. But in order to enjoy the game we need something which will make us play. We need to setup our own goals. I wouldn't call this game a sandbox as we are not to construct anything. It's just an open world and we decide what to do. If we can't make our own goals the game would become boring soon. Many call it just a grind. I don't have that feeling. Because the goals drive us. I had a goal to get a nice transport ship. When I got it I wanted to go out for exploration. Then I wanted a bigger trading ship. Then I wanted to do some combat action. Later on I wanted to do engeneering. Then powerplay came. I was faced with pvp possibilities and had to get better ship and equip it properly for combat against humen pilots. Then I wanted again to go out for a long range exploration this time bringing some fighters along with me to do better planetary scouting. This again required a proper ship. Of course getting money and ranks requires some repetitive things - some would call this grind. But as long as we have a goal it's fun to do it. So I was earning my money the same time thinking about ship configuration and planning my route.\n\nAs you can see I've spent more than 1000 hours in this game already and I can't really stop playing it. It's like my second life. Just get into my ship and do the usual stuff as in life. There are so many possibilities. Also bear in mind that this game is not finnished yet.\n\nIt is planned to be developed for at least 10 years. Every year we can expect a big (unfortunately we need to pay for it) gameplay update. There was one so far (called the Horizons), which brought planetary landings, engeeners, multicrew possbilities (we can have a friend in ship launched fighter to help us). Developement plans for the futer are really amazing, but how much of it will we get is still unaswered question. Still even at current stage this game has so much to offer.\n\nMany people compare this game to Eve or X series. Just remember that Elite prioritizes just pure fun of flying. Your main goal is just to hold the stick. Dock here, plot a route, dock there, fight a pirate etc. You can't build your own bases you can't hire other pilots (not counting ship launched fighter pilots). You aren't to build an empire. You are just to fly the ship. If you are not much into piloting and more into empire building it's not a game for you. \n\nThis games definately aims at a lone pilot experience. Still some cooperation is possible. We can form wings and do some stuff together. There is also much depth (definately not as much as in Eve though) in politics. There are minor and large fractions. We as a single pilot mean nothing, but thousands of others influence the galaxy and change it. Some fractions win wars and expand into other systems, some retreat. Many people find in interesting to boost certain fractions just for fun (even though we can't officially be a member of such a fraction). There is also powerplay, where hundreds of people coordinate their actions together in favor of their superpower. Again some people say it's plain simple and there is no depth in it but in practice people form commands, prepare orders, make sheets to detect enemy movementc etc. Even though the mecanics seems primitive it's people who make it fun.\n\nExploration is another thing which I could really call a game inside the game. When I become bored I leave the inhabited space just to explore the galaxy and see the views. And there is a lot to see. We have whole galaxy to discover. Billions of stars and planets placed according to scientific theories. The whole Milky Way is modelled in this fashion. Again some may say that these are millions of identical, barren and empty planets. But that is how our galaxy looks like. Tenths of hours of exploration pay off by finding one ringed earth-like world somewhere on the opposide side of the galaxy, which from that point will be marked by our nick as the first explorer. Some people will love it (I know pilots who play Elite only for exploration), some may say it's pointless and boring. For me the fact, that the sky we can see from the cockpit is real projection of the galaxy with all the features (nebulae, open clusters etc.) is just astonishing. It's not a walpaper like in other space sims.\n\nAlthough there is no scripted campaign in Elite, there is a story, which is happening in the background. A story of mysterious alien race. With every month we get more information about it, there are more and more activities to do. One of them was discovery of ancient ruins. Just like in real life people were looking for the ruins and some of them found them. Then people were studying their behaviour and interactions. Whole internet sites were created just to coordinate the study and share findings. It gives really an amazing feel to be a part of something bigger. It's everyones choice whether they want to participate in the story or not. It is just happening in the background and every one can join it an any stage.\n\nOn the end of the review I will just say - some may love it so might hate it. It's not action packed game, neither it's empire building simulator. It's just a flight sim, set up in space, with lots of realism and of course some simplificactions, to make it playable by ordinary user at all. I don't know if you will like it but I love the game and find it one of the most original and best games out there.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504838885, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504838885, "recommendationid": "34806702", "language": "english", "votes_down": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618195", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506666249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 21870, "steamid": "76561198019930511", "num_games_owned": 96}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 113, "comment_count": "9", "review": "I love this game, I love the universe and the lore, and when I first got it I wasn't sure how I'd ever play another game again. Visually the game is absolutely stunning. In VR even more so. David Braben's interviews and his excitement for the game and the lore are an absolute joy. The community, by and large, is fabulous and very welcoming. I've had a lot of fun in this game and I truly want it succeed.\n\nBut the more I play it, the more I feel that, for right now at least, it's about 100,000 lightyears wide and about 3 feet deep. You have no aim or purpose other than earning credits by grinding, grinding, grinding for bigger ships, no attachment to anything. Each system is a different dot with a mission board sometimes based around its randomly generated economy. You could just wander aimlessly forever, mission board to mission board, pretending that the randomly generated images and names and small set of scripted lines from 1 of the 7 contacts in that system have any value to you, or that each system is unique in some way and isn't a cookie-cutter of the others, but they're all just another menu in the end. The most fun thing in the game is dogfights with pirates in mining sites, and takeoff/landing. Other than that, there's just nothing to grab on to for me, and it makes the game lose its shine very quickly.\n\nI really hope that following 2.4, 3.0 has a lot of the QoL improvements that were discussed by Frontier. I think that's definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nI'll be watching Frontier Expo in October and very anxiously awaiting what they have to say about the future of the game, because I really, really want this game to succeed. FDev are fabulous and truly seem to care about the community.\n\nI'd love to come back to this review a year from now and brag about how much depth they've added and how easy it is to get lost in the world of E:D again, like when I first picked it up, and that I spend my time away from the game thinking about my home system, the issues there, the Federation/Empire cold war, etc. But for now it's a grinding, takeoff/landing, re-align your ship at the next jump and press \"J\" simulator, but I'm anxiously and optimistically holding out for the future.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505093922, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505094062, "recommendationid": "34874644", "language": "english", "votes_down": 47, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591177", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506867685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 119, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 39769, "steamid": "76561197983519483", "num_games_owned": 94}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 32, "comment_count": "4", "review": "This is hands down best game I have ever played.

Everything is locked behind ridiculous amounts of grinding, that are only reduced to a managable level if you visit third-party sites and find exploits/tricks to bypass it (it took me literal days to grind the money to go from a penultimate tier ship to a top-tier ship while using tricks, it would have been months with standard play, and that's ridiculous).\n\nI've held off on any kind of review since my feelings were so mixed about the game, but the recent serious of events from the 2.4 patch have pushed me firmly into the \"this is not a good game\" camp, so I have to give it a negative review.

There are definitely some very positive things about this game, and also a few negatives, and admittedly some of it probably has nothing to do with Frontier.  On the plus side, this one definitely gets top marks for realism and so far as I can tell, there is no Pay-to-win mechansism that can be exploited, and inside VR, it is definitely immersive, especially while trying to dock and match rotations.  But with all that in mind, there are a few things that have been gnawing at me.  First, and as I said, this may have nothing to do with Frontier, but I can only play this inside VR for about 30-45 minutes at a time before my Vive starts blinking out - usually when I'm in the middle of combat.  Seems like a hardware issue, but unfortunately, it ONLY happens when I play E:D.  I also had a hell of a time getting my HOTAS controller configured, but that was because Steam was getting in the way.  But as for the game itself - yes, the realism is very TIME CONSUMING.  Also, the UI feels way too monochromatic, with their pallete choice reminding me of the days I spent in IT staring at Amber CRT screens.  There is a lot to learn, and though I dont mind discovering on my own, and actually enjoy that part of the game, there still seems to be much I have yet to figure out. But I am thiunking of getting into the PowerPlay-related gaming this weekend and see how much it adds.  Also, it sucks that you lose all your data too, when your ship gets blown up.  Strange the capsuleer can be saved in a pod, but not the data.  For sure, I have not yet been convinced to cough up money for the Horizons season pass, and how found myself spending way too much time shooting lasers at rocks, in the end, I can't deny, at least in VR, the game has given me some very enjoyable and immersive moments.

In the past week, I've put 22 hours into it to see if anything's improved with \"The Grind\" and the overall experience... \n\nSorry Frontier, you've missed the mark here in so many ways and have failed to listen to your player base.  It once was a fun game even if it was a bit grindy.  Now?  Soul destroying sanity bashing grinding is all there is.  This game now redefines the term \"Time Sink\".  It's just not fun in any way I can think of anymore.  \n\nEarning enough credits to keep up with high value ships and insurance that costs 75m credits (or more) a pop...  And now it's impossible to get just the insurance cost in any reasonable amount of time, much less enough to buy another big ship and equip it.\n\nSo...  Sorry, I'll either remove the game entirely from my system or just hardly play it at all.  It's just not worth the soul crushing effort anymore.  Sad, too...  It was such a fun game.  I might see if the next patch fixes some of this, but I seriously doubt it will do anything to improve the \"time debt\" aspects.\n\nTo those considering this game...  Unless you actually enjoy smashing your face against a steel wall lined with 12 inch white-hot spikes....  Don't.\n\n\n-----\n\nResponse to some of the comments:\n\n320+ hours in a game for me isn't really that much.  It's enough to give the game a real chance, to see if it will hold me long-term.  I've given Elite Dangerous 320 hours to convince me it's worth my continued and future time and effort to play it.  I tend to put many (many) more hours into a game I really enjoy.  Case in point: ARK Survival Evolved.  \n\nI've had my issues with that game throughout Early Access as well - and that game earned a negative raiting advising folks they should probably wait after about 1500 hours until they fixed some of the REALLY broken crap.  Once they did, I removed the rating.  But you know what?  I do keep going back to ARK.  The 2800 hours I've logged in that game should be well enough to highlight what happens when I truly ENJOY a game.  Then again, I quit playing official entirely and went to private servers (I had a nice cluster of my own set up for a time), which changes the dynamic considerably.\n\nI couldn't tell you how many hours now I had in WoW before I finally HAD to put it down.  But...  The last time I recall looking at my \"Played Time\" in WoW it was edging close to a full year.\n\nSo for me, 320 hours isn't really that much.  It's enough to let me know that aspects of it are enjoyable, but if I don't feel like I can sit down and take an 8 hour stretch on it without feeling a twinge about it...  Then it's failed my \"long term enjoyment\" filter.  Many games I purchase don't make it past 10 hours, even more don't make it past an hour.\n\nTop Cat pretty much nailed it with his assertion.  Game time does not represent one's enjoyment of a game.   I also want to clarify that about 1/2 the time logged in the game was doing nothing but grinding for credits to get the previously mentioned ships (and more that weren't mentioned)...  If I'm forced to spend 50% of my time doing utterly unenjoyable CRAP to get to the 50% of the game I do enjoy?  It's not for me.  I don't mind putting in effort to get to a certain point, a certain level - but then, the grind needs to be done away with so I can enjoy the core of the game.  With Elite, the grind never goes away or even lessens/gets easier.  It just gets worse.  \n\nI did say, however, that I might check things out again after the next patch - which has since dropped.  I have not yet gone back in to see if \"The Grind\" has improved any or not yet (I suspect it's even worse with how mission boards work now)...  It'll probably be another week or two before I do, it's a big patch and with big patches come the nice bubbly bugs that can sometimes just break things.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505632980, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506630768, "recommendationid": "35016553", "language": "english", "votes_down": 37, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522917", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506920082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 901, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 4362, "steamid": "76561198054614970", "num_games_owned": 194}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "3", "review": "I do enjoy this game, and Im going to keep playing it, but I dont think it deserves a positive review for now.\n\nPros+\n\nVery pretty\n\nReally fun once you get a joystick, wasnt that into it until I got a HOTAS 4. the flight and docking procedures, as well as re-entry are very fun to me. \n\nYou have to outfit your ship for the job youre doing. Some may see this as a con, but I like that you dont just have a ship with seemingly infinite room inside it. Sure I would like a huge cargo scoop AND a huge Cargo hold in my Diamondback Explorer, but I like those decisions you have to make.\n\n\n\nCons-\n\nYou grind non-stop, as Im sure you see in all the other reviews\n\nEveryone uses the same ships, theres not really any reason to use anything else because some are just way, way better than others. If youre in midgame, youre in an Asp Explorer. Late game, either a Python or Anaconda, which look extremely similar.\n\nCombat, for at least half the part is very boring. You either win or lose because they're either infinitely better than you, or much worse than you. I've yet to have an interesting battle. Its fun getting the extra bounties, but its also very boring just flying around in open space. You could wait in an asteroid field for someone to come by, scan, see if they have a bounty, and then take them out, but that can get old quick.\n\nThere are microtransactions to change the color of your engine\n\nYou cant edit the body type of your commander, and as for now there is seemingly no reason to even customize your commander as you cannot walk around anywhere, in or out of the ship.\n\nTo change the color of the interface in your ship, you have to go into the game files and actually change the color code\n\n\n\n\n\nI only have 52 hours in the game, so Im sure there are more people with way better critiques, or who happen to know much more about the game, but this is what Im coming up with so far.\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505233315, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505233315, "recommendationid": "34904253", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503541", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507102096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1332, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 29970, "steamid": "76561198178434675", "num_games_owned": 11}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "5", "review": "A lot of annoying and broken mechanics that makes a good concept of a space sim frustrating and not worth the time.\n\n\nTake hi rez bounty for example, I've lost dozens of ships just because stray multicannon landed on a nearby police, or police simply flying right in front of me while I am shooting at a hostile.
