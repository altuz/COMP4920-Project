So I decided to buy and try it. Well... it was confusing at first, but now that I have the hang of it... sort of... I think it is a fine game.\n\nThe puzzles have all the pieces in squares (which depending on the number of pieces could be small or large). They are scattered across the puzzle, and you have to click on them to move them where you think they go. There is a place telling you how many pieces are in their correct place.\n\nIt can be enjoyable, but if you are not ready for the challenge, it can frustrate you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506488583, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506488583, "recommendationid": "35235746", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
