You're a robot with a broken motor trying to reach the repair shop to get your engine fixed.  You'll have to jump through hoops (literally) to get there, all the while trying to keep up momentum so you don't have to sputter along.\n\nI enjoyed playing this game, but it's a lot harder than I expected.  Controls are very responsive, but the amount of precision required to avoid accidentally braking uphill or perfectly land a jump on a small platform is far more difficult than I was ready for.  The game is clearly designed to encourage speed runs (and there is even a Time Trial mode for each level), but I wasn't able to make a fast finish on any of the levels.  I often crashed into a wall or piece of debris, causing me to lose nearly all of my speed, and the levels are usually difficult to finish if you don't maintain your momentum.\n\nThere's a lot to like here, but it may not be for everyone.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499484528, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499484528, "recommendationid": "33361902", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506957", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 67, "total_reviews": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
