This game would have been cutting edge in 1995.  Sadly it is about 20 years late.  I give them props for trying but this game simply does not deliver.  Buy it when it is on sale under $1 because it is barely worth that.\n\n[h1]The joys of bad programming/translation[/h1]\nI got a few hours into it and suddenly it crashed out of nowhere.  I loaded it up again and when I tried to load a game it just said leerer slot (empty slot in English).  I selected the English option at load but who cares if the entire game is in English?  Everyone knows German, right?  Of course an empty slot didn't load either and crashed the game.  Pfft, who would want an auto save?  Or simple logic not to load a null game?  That is way to much work.  If you get more than a few hours into the game it is already over, what the hell are you still playing for?\n\n[h1]Blue line \"features\"[/h1]\nRandom blue horizontal lines will show up out of nowhere.  Yep, cool feature.\n\n[h1]Cutting edge graphics/animation[/h1]\nHave you used paint?  Can you draw a stick figure?  If so you could probably create better graphics than this game in about 10 minutes.  These graphics are simply amazing... in 1995.  I can't draw but I could have found someone who could before releasing this garbage.  Simply lazy like most of the game.\n\n[h1]Don't do it[/h1]\nYeah all the cool kids say it is awesome but don't fall for it.  I love my German bretheren but there are standards and this falls well short of anyone's standards let alone German.  If only I can save one person from forking over their hard earned money on this garbage I will have done my duty as a citizen of the human race.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429349525, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429349525, "recommendationid": "15427964", "language": "english", "votes_down": 60, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685471", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436800050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 312, "steamid": "76561198027182660", "num_games_owned": 150}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 71, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This is nothing like legendary city-building games like 1602 A.D. or The Great Empires Collection. If you're hoping for a new age version of games like those, run away. It does not offer levels of difficulty, random maps or modes and it has minimal resources. It offers minimal settlement, resource and character management. Map customization or settlement decor options are severaly limited here. You can only play on a solo map that consists of the ability to add/remove palm trees, add/remove a dirt road, and... nope, that's it. \n\n    The short tutorial that's available in the beginning lacks an emphasis on the importance of building a wharf and having a fleet for raiding early on and the role raiding will play in the early development of their settlements.\n\n    You will start out with access to nine basic buildings with the ability later on to unlock a total of eighteen on your adventure. There are only three upgradable buildings which are key to how those aforementioned buildings get unlocked in the build menu. There are no other forms of upgrading available to resource buildings or housing therefor your settlement never shows change as it grows, nor can you increase production like other strategy-simulation builder games. You can only place more of the same buildings and choose what resource you want it to farm. Once you have a small thriving settlement, you expand land ownership on the island and repeat until you've filled your island with happy little pirates.\n\n    Raiding is an interesting addition to this strategy-simulation builder game. A level three wharf allots you the ability to build three types of ships, each with their own advantage. Types of raiding are broken down into two categories, land and sea raids. Each type of raid will allot you three choices for what you wish to raid. Each offer a different level of difficulty. The more ships and crew members in your fleet you have, the percentage for success in those raids rises. For a nice twist, crew members aren't recruited to be crew members only. You have to give your pirates a break from their jobs to go on a \"booty call\" which may compromise your entire production if you do it at the wrong time. \n\n    Which brings me to mention your population. Unlike most other games of this genre, you don't have an increase of population merely because you've built a home for someone to move in. Houses are used in this game to provide a place for the pirates to rest. New additions to your settlement are pirates you've picked up on successful raids which means if you fail a raid, *cue music* DRN! DRN! DRN! ...you may also lose a members of your crew. If you lose too many of your pirates in a raid, you won't have enough to run your settlement and therefor must start over.\n\n    The user interface design is kept simple and easily accessible. You will have a menu at the bottom that allows you to build, assign workers, worker overview, raiding, military overview, time adjustment and options. Not a lot of asking yourself,  \"What do I click to control or see the yadda yadda?\"\n\n    There's your five bucks worth of fun. The game is new and does have potential to offer much more. It lacks a few things you may have found in other games like this such as milestones, goals, trading with AI settlements, random acts of misfortune, different maps and a marketplace. But there's so much the devs can do with it from what we have here and they just may in the future. (Pssst. Tsunamis and shipwrecks would be off the chain, yo! *cough cough*)\n\n    At this time, the game quickly reaches a plateau where it no longer requires involvement from the player.

And since I don't have it, I won't be able to make a good comparison; but there are perspectives worth looking at.\n\n1. The graphic: Please, what do you really expect from a game that's just a little bit expensive than a smartphone game? Still a lot of room to improve though (e.g. the raiding scene with the ships leaving the port, instead of just having one ship model with different masts, it would probably be better to have different ship models for different missions to prevent boredom)\n\n2. The sound: Not bad, although it does sounds quite cheap, But again, for 5 bucks it is already a decent service.\n\n3. The gameplay: Very linear: gather resources, raid, repeat. You'd probably stopped playing after a couple of hours, BUT in comparison to big names like the Anno series (I've tried 1404 and 2070) or Banished mods, the production chain in this game are a lot easier to master; the tier 3 buildings rarely need a lot of tier 2 or tier 1 building to function properly, which makes the game easier to learn. \n\nProbably the biggest turn-offs in this game is the multiple repetition: You started on the same island, the same resources, the same starting place, and progress the same way.\n\nBUT, knowing how these small budget games work, I might predict the futureof this game: MODS. A lot of it. Yes, it might make the game more difficult, but if this game want to be much more playable, the developer DEFINITELY have to let ppl make mods for this game, ranging from small graphic changes to a new resource chain and new ship types.\n\nStill; a fast food meal set would probably cost the same (or a couple bucks more expensive) but it'll just fill your stomach for a short time; this game, because of its simplicity could be played again and again, even between short one-hour break. \n\nIn the end, this game really worth the 5 euro or 5 dollars spending, and I'd like to spend another 5 euro for more content, like easy misisons, more maps, more ship texture, and a couple of small extensions.
