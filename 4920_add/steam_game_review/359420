Except it was called \"The Journeyman Project Director's Cut\". From playing this version, I can tell that this is a bit more tedious than the original, for it has some quick time events and there's a little something extra at the end. The game works very smoothly on later versions of Windows, which is nice. \n\n       The Story on the other hand is timeless. The settings in 22nd and 24th centuries are two time periods worth revisiting and reimagining for this generation in the world of entertainment. Presto Studios may have been defunct for fifteen years, but that doesn't mean that this awe inspiring gem from the 90s will be long forgotten. Gage Blackwood is a very relatable character. He has a life to live, a high paying job in the Temperal Security Agency, how awesome can the future get?\n\n      Anyway, I hope they release the 2nd and third installments of this series on Steam soon.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498618587, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498618587, "recommendationid": "32906933", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509033", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
