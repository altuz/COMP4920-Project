A lot of this has to do with the way the game handles parties, and the moment that made me quit is when, to revive my party, I had to go into the menu, choose formation, move the party member to the front, and then talk to a person to revive them. While some might see this as a callback to older NES RPGs, this is the kind of stuff that should have been streamlined out while making this game. This isn't the only thing like this either, there are many circumstances where you have to move a character to the front of the party to perform an action on or with them.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498523872, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498523872, "recommendationid": "32836459", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525687", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503791152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2072, "steamid": "76561197991987797", "num_games_owned": 141}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you love oldschool RPGs like the original Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior then this game is right up your alley. And unlike how slow those old games feel (srsly going into the menu in FF1 is like a million years) this game is super crisp and fast. Almost a little too fast! But I don't mind that one bit.\n\nIf I could make one small complaint, it's not always clear who I want to give an artifact to until after I've taken it. I've reloaded the game several times now because I either didn't realize I was giving magic to a fighter with no MP or a utility skill to anyone who is not the lead character.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491728988, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491728988, "recommendationid": "31035765", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513533", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498757872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561197999730961", "num_games_owned": 3988}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Seems like a decent game, especially if you're hungry for a NES-style Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy game, but the game suffers from too many major inconveniences. Afaik there's no gamepad support or any way to customize your keybindings, inventories are per-characters and you have to move items around a ton just to equip your party, menus are kinda messy and too deeply nested...\n\nOn top of that, I found that there is a total lack of direction in the game. You start in a castle, are given a quest and off you go. Exploring around only had me run into creatures that were way too hard for my level, so I'd rather not be given the chance to wander off, get lost and die, but that's just my preference.\n\nLike I said, if you know what you're getting into and feel like jumping back into RPGs or the NES era with surprisingly _more_ inconveniences, this is for you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498758281, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498758281, "recommendationid": "33001825", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510639", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491850888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198043379143", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "4", "review": "I installed the game and my controller didn't work.  They game was in a tiny window and there was no obvious way to make it full screen.  So I googled and found that you have to hit alt-enter to go to full screen.  No problem, though I shouldn't have to google for this information.  So then I created a party and started the game.  I went to the menu and looked for \"options\" to configure my controller.  Nope, nothing there.\n\nSo then I googled and found that you can hit f1 to get to the options.  So I did that and.... it is all in Japanese.  I did find the section for configuring the controller but it didn't matter, because the game simply doesn't support my controller.
