That is exactly the reason I bought it.  The issue that I have with this game is that while this game works over steam-link, Gamestream, etc, it doesn't support multiple controllers over the link.  I am using Gamestream on a Nvidia Shield and only one controller works even when you select the settings for \"multiple controllers enabled\".  \n\nBeacuse of this issue, I will not be playing this game because playing with bots isn't fun.

Everything is here for a great 4 player vs game. Bots, varied ships and weapons, fast menu. \n\nThe game feels like some things were rushed. There are about 9 maps, each feels the same and most have background objects that seem like foreground obstacles to new players. You can't play on a map without obstacles, can't make your own maps, can't download new maps and can't adjust the variables on the map (besides choosing small, medium, or large map size).\n\nThere is a singleplayer training mode that feels more fleshed out than the multiplayer mode. I found myself wishing for a singleplayer challenges mode that is along the lines of Worms Armageddon with the interesting tricks you need to pulloff using what they equip you with.\n\nOnline multiplayer would really benefit this title. It's hard to get 3 other players who will play enough rounds to start getting into the depth the game could have to offer, if they could only keep you playing long enough. Bots are okay but even on hard they seem to move erratically.\n\nIf you've got 3 local buddies that are into this type of game (and would be willing to invest a few hours to become slightly seasoned) then this is great at around $2.50. It's not good if you have casual gamer buddies or would play mainly against the bots.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463207307, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463207307, "recommendationid": "22970037", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503887", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1473109176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 96, "steamid": "76561198001766745", "num_games_owned": 140}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "review": "[list]\n[*]XInput only. For a local 4 co-op only game. Yes, absolutely correct - the 4 players will all have xbox 360 gamepad. (nowhere on the store page it's says \"xbox 360 gamepad only\". Just \"full support\" or whatever. If you know what that means please call me.)\nYou with a keyboard and 3 bots. [b]Very[/b] co-op.\n\n[*]No way to turn off the garbage that's flying around. Controlling the ship is ALREADY challenging, and with debris flying around you have to focus on it just to stay alive and keep shooting around hoping that you will hit something.\n\n[*]Zero options for any map to begin with. 8 total maps. Each one slightly different. In color and some details. Like 1 map has asteroids flying around, the other one has that AND a black hole flying around, slightly draging you there. That's it. Yes, it's \"interesting\" but it just adds more garbage to dodge. The sole thing you would actually wish for is an option to turn ALL of that off, so that each of you could shoot each other. And actually play a game and not just dodge the space debris.\n\nPerfectly, there should be [b]at least basic[/b] options for each map  -\ndebris: on/off. Buffs: on/off. Wind: on/off. Warped space: on/off.\nBut instead you just choose [b]\"Location\"[/b] - which is the choise of a map itself, like \"Galaxy Core\" (which is near sun, because the sun is the center of a galaxy, yes) - which just changes the theme of a map, in this case a map being \"Sun thematic\".\nAnd then you choose from [b]3 sizes of that map[/b], so called \"Alfa sector\", \"Beta sector\", \"Gamma sector\".\n\n[*] Controls are bad.\nYes, they are \"simple to use\" -> wasd (and should be D-pad or left stick on a gamepad) to move in 4 directions, but it just lacks control and precicion. You press \"A\" (left) - the ship starts to fly left [b]in a curve[/b]. Whether fast ship or slow (like \"jugernaut\") - makes little help here, because with the controls designed like this - dodging the space debris is very difficult. (not [i]challenging[/i] but [i]difficult[/i] because of a bad controls choise).\nIMO this game could benefit controls mechanic from LUFTRAUSERS, or at least it could be an option.\n\n[*] Voice actors should be fired...\nfrom a cannon.\nIn options you can select \"Voice pack\" which will make that voice \"yours\" -> when someone from your enemys dies - \"you\" will say something. 90% of those voices (\"voice packs\") are just stupid and annoying, and treat you like a 12 years old. (The only one that was bearable for me was voice \"SZ 83-5\"). And why the heck would you even implement a voice lines in such a broken game? There's so many horrible gameplay decisions made, - many things to actually [i]improve[/i] and yet to stuff pointless voices in a game...\nWhen you respawn after being killed - you will have a hard time trying to figure out where you are, and someone saying something poitnless and annoying in a background is [i]not[/i] helpful.\n[/list]\n\n[b]In Space We Float.[/b] Desperately trying to dodge all that crap that's flying in our faces.\nAlso, the xbox 360 gamepad is the only gamepad in the universe.\n\nI actually refunded 1,79\u20ac.\nAt least fix first two cons that I mentioned above - [b]then[/b] this game will be worth something.
