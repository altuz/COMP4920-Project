Slow and steady wins the race[/b][/h1]\n\nHaving Rainbow Six Siege's multiplayer matches divided up into short rounds, there's often a pressure to rush towards the objective as an attacker. Even though the time restriction prevents a stalemate between teams, the 3 min. period is more than enough to take your time and consider the strategy behind your approach. Some of the game's greatest moments thrive off playing mind games with players, letting the tension if the moment throw off the enemy's insticts. Holding back and executing your strategy from afar can often contribute hugely towards this; making sure to pick off any lone wolves who venture away from the objective. When breaching the objective room, keeping your distance from an entry point is often a great tactic. Keep picking off enemies for as long as possible, until a final rush towards the objective once time begins to run out.\n\n[h1][b]2. Lean into combat[/b][/h1]\n\nPeeking is one of Ranbow Six Siege's main differentiators from other 1st-person shooters and contributes hugely to its unique gameplay. It provides the ability to ease around corners and be wary of potential threats. Leaning is an indispensable tool for all operators. Triggered by clicking in left or right stick while ADS, leaning can be quickly used on the fly when navigating around dangerous corners. This can be a great way to aim your barrel into hostile terrirory, without the risk of fully exposing your whole body. However, by doing so, you'll be exposing your head as a prime target to any skilled marksman. By using the lean ability in Rainbow Six Siege, you'll also be able to take advantage of a commonly used exploit referred to as the \"Peeker's Advantage\". Used by a majority of high-skilled players, this abuses the game's net code to give peeking players a small advantage when moving in and out of cover. To utilize this tactic, simply strafe in and out of cover while leaning, making you almost untouchablefrom an onlooker's perspective.\n\n[h1][b]3. Don't get attached[/b][/h1]\n\nIn many of today's popular 1st-person shooters, there's often a reward for finding a loadout that suits your playstyle and rolling with it. In Rainbow Six Siege there's often little drive to stay with a single operator, aside from amproving your personal skills with their unique equipment and weaponry. When getting started with Siege, it's best to experiment with a small selection of operators as soon as possible. Try to choose a varied range of operators when doing so, considering how they perform at different ranges and how they pair with other operators in use by your teammates. This also diversifies your in-game skill set, making yourself more adaptable on the field.\n\n[h1][b]4. The environment breaks for a reason[/b][/h1]\n\nEnvironmental destruction is in no way unique to Rainbow Six Siege, with recent Battlefield games taking the crown for large-scale demolition. However, it's rare to see this reflected so clearly in gameplay - carving out the fundamental flow of multiplayer action. Each of Siege's maps offers wide-scale destruction, featuring fully destructible walls, floors and ceilings. With operators available to counter any fortification, it's key to take advantage of these abilities and push through their defensive efforts. Taking advantage of destructible hatches and walls, breaching charges should be used as frequently as possible when entering fortified rooms. Reinforcedwalls can also be countered in a similar manner, using Thermite's exothermic charges. In a majority of multiplayer encounters, walking straight through the door is the most dangerous route. Make sure to consider your options before breaching, while considering the enemy team's placement. If you're not destroying the map, you're doing it wrong.\n\n[h1][b]5. Give your drone a second chance[/b][/h1]\n\nDuring the pre-planning phase, drones are a vital toolfor gathering enemy intelligence. Providing information on the objective's location, enemy operators and fortifications in place, this can give attackers a huge advantage when it comes to infiltratingthe building. However, once the action phase commences, all players are forced out of their drone's POV and encouraged to pursue the objective. Single press \"Deplay Drone\" button, you can easily jump back into your existing drone and continue where you left off. This can be used to continue scouting the objective room while the action is underway, without the need to use up your second drone. For some extra help with surveillance, remember to use the inbuilt security cameras for an extra angle of the battlefield.\n\n[h1][b]6. Defense from a distance[/b][/h1]\n\nTightly locking down the objective room is a common mistake made by new players, in an attempt to offer the best protection. You might be protecting the objective by barricading yourself inside the room with your teammates, but this leaves a single major choke point for the enemy team to exploit. When piling into a room like sardines in a can, a single grenade can instantaneously finish the round. To avoid this rookie error, try establishing a perimeter around the objective, potentially stretching to additional rooms to cover a wider area. Creating a more complex maze of barricades will give the attackers more angles to consider, making it easier to catch them by surprise. Barricades and reinforcements in certain locations can also be used as bait to lure attackers into an ambush.\n\n[h1][b]7. Slap a scope on your weapon[/b][/h1]\n\nEach of the operators on offer in Rainbow Six Siege come with their own unique equipment and weaponry, bearing varied performance on the field. While your choice of weapon has a huge effect on combat performance, weapon customisation adds a whole new level of fine tuning to your personal playstyle. Finding youe perfect setup for each operator can definitely take some time, with each attachment requiring a repurchase between different firearms. From my personal experience, I've found Reflex sights for Defenders; Red Dot sights for Attackers or Holo sights for both are among the most used attachments, alongside a grip for increased stability. Also make sure to add your own personal flair while you're at it, with a range of skins and charms available to purchase!\n\n[h1][b]8. Watch your corners[/b][/h1]\n\nSituational awareness is also a key skill to adopt in Rainbow Six Siege, with gameplay requiring more precision and addition to detail than your traditional FPS. While fast-paced twitch gameplay is still present, the varied pacing means you can easily let your guard down. From the moment the Action Phase commences, make sure to be on the lookout for the smallest movement on your screen. Between the game's quick time to kill and required precision, the slightest movement can expose your position, resulting in an instant death. Make sure to check every angle before pushing forward, while also looking into the distance for any potentional threats.\n\n[h1][b]9. Teamwork is key[/b][/h1]\n\nLike any competitive multiplayer title, teamwork helps hugely in Rainbow Six Siege's multiplayer mode. Strategy and forward thinking have the potentialto overthrow the strongest of players if executed correctly. Assembling a team of five helps hugely with coordination, with the ability to choose an effective combination of operators and the best angles to attack from. While true in any shooter, Rainbow Six Siege's reliance on tactical gameplay makes this much more beneficial than your average twitch FPS.\n\n[h1][b]10. Brighter is better[/b][/h1]\n\nBy default, Rainbow Six Siege's brightness settings make some of the game's darker levels almost impossible to play. While this makes for a more atmospheric experience, this is far from ideal in a competitive scenario. It might seem cheesy, but cracking up the game's brightness slider not only helps with navigatingdark hallways - you'll also get a clearer view of enemies potentially hiding away in the shadows.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505579607, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505579607, "recommendationid": "35001396", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562745", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506567826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 675, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5507, "steamid": "76561198036064591", "num_games_owned": 15}, "votes_funny": 9, "votes_up": 177, "comment_count": "6", "review": "A good game handcuffed to god-awful Ubisoft servers.

I started playing when it was released for like one month and to be honest the game was quite broken back then. Now, after roughly 1 year and 10 months, the game improved significantly both in terms of optimization and bug-fixing. The game just feels better over all, Ubisoft is now constantly adding new contents, bug fixes, balancing and overhaul for the game. Here\u2019s the patch note for the latest Operation Blood Orchid: https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-gb/updates/bloodorchid/index.aspx\n\nLet's start with GRAPHICS. Siege has a decent graphics, I mean it\u2019s not like mind-blowing or ultra realistic it\u2019s just pretty standard for a current generation game, but of course, there are still some issues. It was developed using the AnvilNext Engine (modified upon Anvil Engine) which was originally designed for Assassin\u2019s Creed: Unity. this engine is capable of rendering large open world and huge draw distances but it\u2019s not a perfect fit for a close\u2014range-combat game like Rainbow Six: Siege. You may run into huge sudden frame dips and constant low FPS on certain maps, which sometimes could put you at a huge disadvantage. There\u2019s also some problem with the ambient occlusions in the game. For instance, if you chose Nvidia HBAO+ (generally speaking higher quality) the shadows on guns, clothes and gadgets won\u2019t cast properly. On the other hand, if you chose SSBC (Ubisoft's in-house AO solution) some of the environmental shadows won\u2019t cast properly, so either way you\u2019re gonna lose a certain degree of graphical fidelity (I really hope they could fix this somehow). it\u2019s really just personal preferences. So like if you want your guns to look cool with all your shiny skins go for SSBC, it's also less demanding on your hardware. On the other hand, if you want to add more depth to the environment without a doubt just go for HBAO+. Or\u2026 you could just completely turn AO off so that you could get the best visibility possible and a performance boost, tho, the textures will look plain and lack of depth.\n\nSecond, SOUND. The sound in Siege is quite phenomenal, you can get a rough idea of where the opponent is just by listening to their footsteps, it also allows you to distinguish the exact gadget and gun that your opponent is using. I can\u2019t tell how many times I killed some dude just because I heard him puts a breaching charge on the wall (or a cluster charge on the window that's trying to \u201cFuze\u201d the s**t out of my team). Besides visual identification sound is your most crucial tool.\n\nThird, GAMEPLAY. Well, I think there\u2019s not much to say about the gameplay since the game is out for quite some time. You know how it works, 5v5 combat with 1 life if you get killed you wait for the next round, 3 PvP modes + 3 PvE modes: Secure area (or Classic terrorist hunt), Bomb, Hostage. That may sound a bit simple but it actually goes a lot deeper, you\u2019ll have to carefully plan your strategy and communicate with teammates in order to stand a chance of winning the round and even pull off some awesome stuff (flanks, wall-bangs, aces, etc). Siege is at its best when playing with friends coz you guys could have some serious fun together or do some hilarious s**t and just trolling around, plus it feels more natural to chat with friends.\n\nAt last, I\u2019d say Rainbow Six: Siege is the kind of game where \u201cif this is your type\", you\u2019re gonna love it despite its flaws and issues it got a pretty steep learning curve (a lot of maps, tricks, and operators to learn), it\u2019s slightly hard-core, strategy-based, and thrilling, you'll have to keep practicing. If you\u2019re more into that kind of CoD or CS running gun experience, buy with cautious coz it might just don't suit your gaming style.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504662844, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504789308, "recommendationid": "34767942", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530454", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505897887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 29390, "steamid": "76561198032149634", "num_games_owned": 127}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 82, "comment_count": "10", "review": "I don't know how it's possible, but this last update made the game run even worse than it did during Operation Health.

I regularly get shot after I have ducked behind cover or tried to peek an enemy only for them to see me a full half second before I see them. Not to mention the massive amount of exploits and bugs they introduced. I've been shot by people glitching in walls and Ubisoft hasn't done anything about it. No hotfixes, nothingThey also refuse to do anything about smurfing which runs rampant in this game. I feel sorry for the new players who have no idea how to play then get matched up with Plats on their secondary account. That's partially on how toxic the community is though. Not to mention the fact that they PULLED MAPS from a game that's had them for over 2 years now.  It's disgraceful how bad Ubisoft has mismanged this game. I'm glad I only bought the starter edition because there is no way in hell this game will ever be worth full price.

Oh well, here I go.\n\nSo, the actual game itself is, well, amazing.  It is hands down my favorite FPS of all time.....wait.  Scratch that.  It is hands down my favorite VIDEO GAME of all time.  I love this game\u2026\u2026okay, got that out of the way.....now I can get into the specifics.  \n\nThe first and most important thing you must understand about this game before you purchase - It is a team based game.  Are you looking for a run and gun game like COD, or a tactical shooter?  Siege is the latter, a tactical team based shooter, although some choose to treat it as a run and gun (Jager scum!).  You have to be willing to work as a team with other people to succeed at Siege.  No it's not as team based as Squad or Arma, but SOME team coordination is absolutely needed.  At least if you want that sweet elo. \n\nThe second most important thing to understand before you purchase - YOU WILL SUCK/THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN.  Yeah, you will suck.  Really, I mean you will hate this game.  You will get rekt for AT LEAST a month before you become DECENT.  This is part of the reason why personally I love this game, it has THE highest skill ceiling I've ever seen in a game.  I have been playing this game since the week it came out (early December 2015) on both console and PC, and there are STILL new tactics and things I am learning.....STILL.  I guarantee you will HATE this game for the first week you play, but you will love it at the same time.  Its difficulty will drive you to get better and better.  You have never played anything like Siege before.  \"I've played plenty of tactical shooters, thank you very much\" you might say.  Kewl bruh, but you've never played Siege before.  Siege does not abide by the typical FPS/Tactical shooter laws.  It abides by the Laws OF Siege.  Because despite what you may have thought, this game IS NOT an FPS.  This game is NOT a tactical shooter.  This game is Siege.  There is nothing like it.  Sure, you need good aim, but you must do much more to win.  You'll barricade and reinforce certain rooms and walls to slow the attacker's push.  You'll determine what barricades and reinforcements to destroy to push the defenders.  You'll setup flank routes, watch for peeks, drone out rooms, and lay traps in choke points.  You will not simply shoot people.  You will distract, bait, and outsmart people.  And occasionally.........well you'll get team killed by a toxic salt mine BUT HEY IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES.\n\nUnfortunately, Siege has some flaws too.  Well\u2026\u2026no it doesn\u2019t.  The GAME itself is perfect, at least to me it is.  But BOY does Ubisoft cause a lot of problems for it.  There\u2019s a really annoying bug that needs to be fixed?  Okay, just wait ten years, we\u2019ll fix it.  Aaaaaand done, bug is fixed.  Now here\u2019s 20 new bugs to accompany this bug fix.  Oh, you all want more/better servers?  Okay, we\u2019ll roll that out in 14 years, but look at IQ\u2019s finger nails now we\u2019ve improved their texture!  \n\nYes, it is sad, but this amazing game has a fair share of bugs and problems.  It runs fine, in fact (I think) it\u2019s one of the best optimized PC ports I\u2019ve ever played, but alas, the bugs.  Hit registration problems will make you scream HOW WAS THAT NOT A HEADSHOT?!?!?  Lack of enough servers will make you wonder why you have to play against Brazilian ping abusers. And for god\u2019s sake, ASH\u2019S HITBOX!  \nNow I don\u2019t want to exaggerate, with all the technical problems this game has, it is still probably in the best shape it has ever been in.  But still, the game is almost two years old now.  It should be (near) perfect by now, yet it feels like a new release that\u2019s still getting its kinks ironed out.  \nBut with all the frustration these problems bring, there\u2019s a reason why I have a $1,500 gaming PC capable of playing literally anything, but still only play this one single game and nothing else.\n\nSo in conclusion, GET IT.  NOW.   (Just please don\u2019t get the startup edition, it\u2019s a rip off)\n\nBang Up - Gaming  \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506918494, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506918494, "recommendationid": "35404758", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507561", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506802058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2076, "steamid": "76561198059691700", "num_games_owned": 85}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Very fun, enjoyable, and addicting game.

I originally got this back before I broke up with my Ex, and didn't play it that much but enjoyed it. After the break up, I got really into the game, as well as my friends. We at one point had a dumb clan, even though I don't do much ranked anymore. Anywhom'st've, I love this game with a passion, and am glad to see a lot of the problems fixed. Even though Ash's hitbox needs some tweaking, otherwise I hate that I love the game. It feels great to play, every character is unique and fresh, and I could never see myself really straying away from the game. Ubisoft, for once, let me say I appreciate the work you put into the game, and I hope to see it continue to evolve into something bigger, even though Opperation Health was cancer... But hey! We got Alpha Packs!\n\nAlso, a little note as to how much dedication I've put into this game. I'm pretty much Gold 4, I have 3 elite skins as of writing, and all of this topped off with I went through the grind of the starter version and I have never spent any money on a deafult op. Only the Year 1 Ops, and I managed to snag the season pass. I've spent maybe now 100 dollars on the game, counting the season pass, and I don't plan on stopping. I love the game with a passion, and I cannot see myself anytime soon stopping playing it. I HIGHLY suggest buying the full game though, less of a grind. Other than that, I hope all of you who read this enjoy the game as much as I do, and hey, if this convinced you to get the game, I'm glad ya did! \n\nTL;DR The game had a rocky start, but now feels great and plays great too. I've invested too much money into this game lol.\n-9/10, Not a perfect game, but a pretty damn good one.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505712362, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505712362, "recommendationid": "35039403", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506647", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505504062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 10068, "steamid": "76561198044623915", "num_games_owned": 668}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "8", "review": "i prefer it over cs:go but both have shitty community 4/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505504171, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505504171, "recommendationid": "34979679", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503299", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506650062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1253, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1253, "steamid": "76561198186940425", "num_games_owned": 88}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "6", "review": "[h1] DO NOT BUY STARTER EDITION [/h1]\n\nRainbow Six: Siege is an amazing and addicting game, every engagement, radio chatter, and positioning is something to learn from.
