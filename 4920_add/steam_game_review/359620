After playing Shadow of the Comet (I loved it! Read my review! http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/recommended/389470), I was looking forward to playing this. After ten minutes, my hopes were diminished, and after an hour, my hopes were dashed and by the end, I was a very very confused gamer.\nPrisoner of Ice went backwards in terms of so many things. Trying to blend 3dish/claymation looking characters in 2-D settings just doesn't work. The setting is right before WWII, and as far as Lovecraft goes, thats a little too modern for my taste. The story is an absolute mess, trying to loosely branch off of The Mountains of Madness, and serve as a kind of continuation of Shadow of the Comet.....within 3-4 hours (Steam says 6 hours, but I had long periods of being AFK). Thats right. Short. It's so short, there is no time to care about really any of the characters, and those we do know from Shadow of the Comet, it feels like they threw them in so we could kinda care about somebody! Maybe if they had made this game longer, they could have developed the story a lot better, but they didn't and we are now stuck with this. I honestly couldn't even really explain to you the plot. I had to go to Wikipedia just to find out what in the world I just played. For those who know my reviews and what I play, that should definitely tell you something. Pixel hunting is back!...and man is it annoying. Shadow of the Comet threw pixel hunting out the window, and the graphics were all pixelated. Now in this mixed mess of a game, good luck finding the key you need in a timed puzzle. Oh yes, this game is full of timed puzzles. However, if you do die (you will), the game does autosave so you have a chance to quickly figure out what in the world to do.\nNow, does this game do anything right? Actually it does. The cut scenes are actually pretty great. The music also sets the tone pretty well. Aaaaaand........thats it. \nShadow of the Comet is the superior game. Period. The only reason I can see anyone enjoying this game is if one is playing with nostalgia glasses. Otherwise, this game can be missed.  \n\nNote: The review feels more like a rant than a review, but I had such high hopes.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455270413, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1455351608, "recommendationid": "21147524", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524736", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478376980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 272, "playtime_forever": 274, "steamid": "76561197967229781", "num_games_owned": 425}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Call of Cthulhu: Prisoner of Ice is and old-school point-and-click adventure game starring Ryan, a young soldier who must solve the mystery surrounding strange creatures discovered near the arctic. As you would expect from the title, the story is based on works by HP Lovecraft and you will hear your fair share of \u2018f\u2019tangs\u2019 and \u2018kaa naamas\u2019.\n\nSurprisingly, this game hasn\u2019t aged too badly as far as games in its genre go, but there are a few gripes to be had. Prisoner of Ice breaks one of the most important rules of making a good point and click adventure: never ever force the player into a pixel hunt. If you want to be successful at this game, you will need to take some time to scan each screen with your cursor. The game also has some issues with the soundtrack freaking out in dosbox. The fastest way to resolve this is to turn the music off in the menu, wait for the music to cut off (it doesn\u2019t happen immediately), and then turn it back on. \n\nOnce you have those two issues tamed, the game is somewhat enjoyable save for one or two puzzles where you might have to go grab a UHS (par for the course for older PnC games IMO). That being said, Prisoner of Ice is not bad for what it is and I find myself more on the thumbs up side for this particular title. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1478378402, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1478378402, "recommendationid": "26443150", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506966", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451710995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 118, "steamid": "76561197984269843", "num_games_owned": 670}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Recommended?  Easily!\n\nThe game is loosely based on the Cthulhu mythos in the world of H.P. Lovecraft, though readers familiar with that universe will know that even in most Cthulhu stories the octopus god doesn't show up much.  But, still, this game has some twists and turns the way you might expect from a Lovecraft story.\n\nJourney back to 20 years ago in computer-game development, the days when MSDOS still ruled and many people were trying out Windows 95 for the first time.  Sure, the graphics are dated -- but at the same time they're kinda cool!  Isn't that why all of these retro-style games are in vogue now?\n\nLike many games from the time, I can't say much about the music or the voices other than I found it helpful just to turn them off.  Luckily, this was one of the games at the time that allowed you to have subtitles along with spoken word.\n\nHowever, also like many games of the time -- this game actually has a well-written plot and is accompanied with some detailed storytelling.  In other words, this game is from a time when graphics and sound weren't that good and so developers had to actually design a COMPLETE game in order to it to be considered good.\n\nOf course, one of the drawbacks is the point-and-click interface.  And, yes, this game reminded me of why I found these types of games so frustrating as sometimes you engage in the battle for pixel spotting.  The puzzles aren't that difficult, especially considering that you can interact with (i.e. take into your inventory) very few objects.\n\nWell worth the price I paid for it, and a great use of time and an afternoon of distraction.

The story is interesting and refers to your basic Lovecraftian deities and related tropes, though the way in which the story is told simply isn't very good.\n\nIf you're looking for a truly Lovecraftian experience I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

The story isn't that lovecraftian, that's true. But the game was still pretty cool.\nThe story gets really weird near the end and I can't say that I understood the ending. But the first two thirds of the game were fun - which isn't much, considering the game took me only 3 hours to beat.\n\nI read some of the negative reviews.\n\nSomeone says this game is just pixel hunting. Yes, I sometimes missed small objects. But I was also playing with a touchpad which makes moving the cursor (and therefore searching) quite difficult. I guess most people play it with a mouse, so I see no problem here. The areas are usually really small, so if there's a missable item, there are usually very few places to search at.\n\nOthers say that the puzzles are illogical. Well, sometimes you try to click an enemy with a \"weapon\" and it doesn't work, until you find out that you have to click yourself with the item. Makes the action scenes trial & error. Other than that, I don't remember anything illogical.\n\nThe game saves automatically before those \"action scenes\". Makes the game very comfortable because you don't have to worry about losing your progress if you haven't saved in a while. I didn't even know that's a thing in old P&C games.\n\nIs the game worth 6\u20ac?\nNo, definitely not.
