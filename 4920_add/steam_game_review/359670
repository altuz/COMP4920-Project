It still has the problem of enemies that are easily paralyzed, stunned, poisoned etc. I did not see any spells from the last 5 boss fights including the final boss since I could stun them and kill them in 4-5 turns with poison. If by any chance you dont want to poison and paralyze the bosses so that the game becomes somewhat enjoable the boss characters will either one shot you or paralyze, posion, confuse your party like you would do to them. You would have to grind a lot to withstand their spells, but it really isnt worth your time imo. There is no middle ground here and since the story is much shorter and worse that the first game, I can hardly recommend this game not even to Jrpg junkies.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499696735, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499696735, "recommendationid": "33432180", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503546", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
