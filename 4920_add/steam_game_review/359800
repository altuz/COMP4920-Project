Heck, the cars even sound great. Think of it as HIGHLY polished content for rFactor. Purely by driving experience, I'd say it's pretty neat.\n\nSo why the thumbs down? The game's accessibility is downright terrible. Even Assetto and rFactor are better in this front. Every racing sim, free or not, must come with atleast one of the following - Racing Line, Minimap or Co-Driver. I'm not familiar with any of these tracks, and that is in fact a good thing as it brings up fresh content to drive on, but this becomes a bane when you don't have navigational assistance on the track. This is a major putoff for a casual player like me.\n\nPS - If there really is a Racing Line/Minimap feature, please let me know and I'll update this. TIll then, I'll get my kicks from  rF and NR2003 :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485429163, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485429163, "recommendationid": "29499626", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489688", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431174159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198221988600", "num_games_owned": 8}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Terrible", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485173896, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485173896, "recommendationid": "29441514", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483487", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456007216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198171698438", "num_games_owned": 7}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "controlles are rly bad", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486861496, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486861496, "recommendationid": "29861509", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470699", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
