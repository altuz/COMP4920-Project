Secondly the puzzles have no instruction whatsoever so you're supposed to just guess as to how to complete it. To make things worse if you click on the 'skip' button it doesn't skip the puzzle, instead it crashes the game and takes you to a webpage telling you not to use the skip button if you want to complete the game!\n\nI've played better escape games on my phone, and those ones were free!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499553718, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499553718, "recommendationid": "33387910", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499887582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 175, "steamid": "76561198052358331", "num_games_owned": 361}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "No settings on this game whatsoever, not even an option to view control mapping. I am unable to move puzzle pieces. The only thing this game will allow me to do is single-click on things. I've tried a variety of mouse and keyboard actions, such as the typical hold-click and drag. None of the guides helped and I am not inclined to jump through hoops to play a simple puzzle game. I have had to hard quit multiple times because the game becomes frozen (probably from all my clicking attempts at moving pieces/playing the game). \n\nFeels a lot like paying someone $2 to frustrate and annoy me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499881829, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499881829, "recommendationid": "33485042", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500706", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "total_reviews": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 33}}
