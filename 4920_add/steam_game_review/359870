Bought the collectors edition for it. Bought a PSVita when I heard it was out for it as well. I have all of the kotobukiya figures which are not cheap. Have FFX jewelry, and an LED glass sign, and Kotobukiya Wallscrolls. Point is I'm some what of an authority when it comes to FFX. Well I recently built a custom PC and bought FFX for it as well.

(You can change it in the Config Menu)\n+ New \"Expert\" Sphere Grid.\n+ Monter Arena\n+ Lots of Party Memebers (7 in total. Can be swapped out during battle)\n+ For a Remaster this looks pretty damn good. \n+ It can run Lower End Hardware. (Intel HD 4600 and close to Max Settings @ 900p)\n+ The Port for this game(s) comes from PS4 and  HOLY SH!T SQUARE ENIX  DID A GOOD PORT!\n+ Locked @ 30 FPS / 60 FPS in Menus. (Please Read Cons)\n+ Ongoing debate on how to pronounce \"Tidus\"\n+ Tidus Laugh in HD! (It's a Meme. Google it.)\n\nCons for FF X: \n\n- Locked @ 30 FPS (Can be troubling for some or even a deal breaker.)\n- You have to fight the same boss FOUR TIMES. (Just in different forms)\n- Slightly Linear. (But there are some branching paths to explore)\n- Cloister of Trials. (These things CAN GO AWAY.)\n- The Sphere Gird can be intimidating (and a massive grind) when you realize how big it is.\n- Bit of pain to get Japanese Audio (If that is your preference)\n- Lots of Cutscenes.\n- Dont get an Airship until VERY late game.\n- Major Exploit in game to get Sphere Levels INSANELY fast. (Don Tonberry Exploit / Glitch)\n\n\nVerdict 8 / 10\n\nFF X is considered to be one of the last \"Good\" Final Fantasy games by some people but can also be considered a good starting point by others. All other Final Fantasy games after this one was either an MMO (FF XI, FF XIV) or left the Turn Based Combat behind for a more Real-Time-ish Combat style (FF XII, FF XIII / XIII-2, FF XV) \n\nIf you a fan of the Final Fantasy games I would say pay the full $30 for this game but otherwise I would say get it half price (around $15.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506363370, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506364170, "recommendationid": "35208013", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502274", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506505924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1061, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2662, "steamid": "76561198025661822", "num_games_owned": 212}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "PLAY THIS GAME.
