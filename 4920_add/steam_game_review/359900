The Director's Cut \"definitve\" edition is based on the gameplay of the third installment, which is the very game this review is for. Fans were divided upon release whether the changes made to gameplay, skills and classes were to the benefit of the series or whether they were not, which is partially a reason for the mixed reviews.\n\nWhile not being an AAA title, the Van Helsing games deliver quite a lot of content, good gameflow, interesting side characters as well as quests and are more than able to hook players into classic loot-spiral-addiction.\n\nIt play fast and unforgiving, doesn't look too shabby and can be considered a good addition to anyones library, really, although I'd rather recommend the Director's Cut, which is spanning all three games with one consistent gameplay model. (Although arguably not necessarily the best possible version of it).\n\nAll the same, didn't regret a single hour of time put into this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504303984, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504303984, "recommendationid": "34670506", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509077", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 131, "total_reviews": 248, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 117}}
