The art style reminded me of banner saga which is a plus in my book instantly. Even though the chapters with capture points get pretty snowbally after you secure your resources, the first few turns are enjoable. The chapters without capture point and taverns are top quality. Nice little game to blow off some steam.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504410626, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504410626, "recommendationid": "34701693", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504714", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 79, "total_reviews": 104, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 25}}
