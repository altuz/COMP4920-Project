The game control is terrible. It is extremely clunky and the levels are not built great. Moving around is awkward and combat is really bad. However, this game has one of the weirdest storylines I've ever encountered. The first part of the game led me to believe I was dealing with a certain thing/group, but it quickly changed and I found out it wasn't what I thought. (I won't spoil it). Look, this game is not great as far as graphics and control, but the story is actually unique and the ending is pretty cool. If you love games and want to spend 4-5 hours with something unique, I recommend this game for $5 for most players, or $10 if you don't care too much about price. Don't spend more than this because there's no replay value other than getting 100% achievements.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505782608, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505782608, "recommendationid": "35055667", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 33, "total_reviews": 50, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 17}}
