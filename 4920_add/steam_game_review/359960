These include: Weapon type, jump type, enemy type, buff, magic, etc. The viewers vote by typing in the desired choice and the one that has the most votes will win. There is an adjustable timer where viewers can vote.\n\nNow you may be wondering, what about the stream lag? Choice Chamber has accounted for this, the game has an adjustable setting in its settings menu and you can make the timer wait up to 30s to account for delay.\n\n[b] Price [/b]\nIs the price worth it? Yes. Though this game is primarily for Twitch broadcasters, there is an offline mode where the game picks your choices randomly, the game can also be played with local players making it a great party game!\n\n[b] Optimisation [/b]\nChoice chamber plays well on any average pc, though I have encountered a few small spikes of lag this is a small price to pay for the overall enjoyment. Lag may vary depending on viewer count.\n\n[b] Customisation [/b] \nThe character can be customised by importing pictured of the legs, arms, head and body. There is also an option for mods, I have not used this.\n\n[b] Replayability [/b]\nThe game is different each time you play however the choices do get old the more you play. There are a variety of choices though! Generally, this is the only problem with this, the base game is similar but if you play live on Twitch then the people you meet and the choices they make make it well worth it.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\nChoice Chamber is a well made game for Twitch Streamers, if you dont stream, the game may get boring and repetetive fast. Unfortunately, I dont see many people playing this on Twitch, so if you do stream, give it a go! It is only \u00a36.99, compare it to how much you may spend on other stuff and realise this is forever, picture the people laughing as you fall into a lava pit from their pogo jump choice. Its brilliant. A well done idea with a twist.\n\n[b] Rating [/b]\n[b] 7/10 [/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497796862, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497796862, "recommendationid": "32539439", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 32, "total_reviews": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
