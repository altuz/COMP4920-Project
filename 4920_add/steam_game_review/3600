Actually, there are quite a few Popcap games that are pretty much just pure HO scenes with little to no story. Such is Escape Rosecliff Island but I prefer this game over all the rest. I've played this a few times. I didn't REALLY need to buy it on Steam but I wanted it with my \"steam HO set\" and also wanted an excuse to play it again. I wouldn't say there's anything remarkable about the game. There's no story other than \"escape the island\". There's no scare factor - you're just searching for items that will help you leave. There's not much music to speak of. The game is just many HO scenes with puzzles here and there (jigsaw, memory tiles, match 3, and word search). There are 25 scenes that you repeatedly visit but there are so many items in each, you're always looking for something different. Find 50 locks in those 25 areas and you open up 2 Bonus Games. One is Unlimited Match 3 and the other is Unlimited Hidden Objects. Just as in The Lost Tomb, you can clear each hidden object scene completely (when you find an item, the word is crossed off and another pops up in its place). So afterwards, you're left with a thoroughly bare room. It's an extremely fun thing to do! No, this game is not for everyone. You need to be an HO fan and be in an HO mood. If you are, I definitely recommend this game."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1416679039, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515661", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13043194", "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198106127826", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1416677833, "num_games_owned": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1151}, "timestamp_updated": 1416679039, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I wish I could recommend this game, but I can't.

There is no explanation as to who the previous resident(s) of the island were, or why the island is now deserted. There is no dialogue with NPCs, no narration, nothing. The gameplay consists of you bouncing from one hidden object scene to the next, and as you finish a \"level,\" you complete a simple \"puzzle\" game such as a word search or matching tiles. Upon completion of the puzzle games, you are rewarded an item to assist in your escape, such as a bucket or a stack of wood. As you progress along, you begin to see the same hidden object scenes again... and again... and again. As much as I enjoy hidden object games, even I found myself overwhelmed with mind-numbing boredom.\n\nOn the plus side, the artwork is nice, with the hidden object scenes not being overly cluttered, and the items were often cleverly hidden.\n\nVerdict: Don't spend 5 dollars for this game unless you happen to enjoy visiting the same hidden object scenes over and over.

There's 25 levels, and on average, you'll have to go through 4 or 5 different places to look for objects.\n\nOne small highlight, however, was the finding of all 50 locks, which would then permit to play the bonus games, as well as looking for all the objects in every of the 25 pictures.
