The battle system rocks. How it works is that each character can use every element spell, but they have innate abilities that only that person can use to power up the other's spells. So one person casts their power up (like making it more powerful or hit all enemies) and then the other casts the damage spell. It makes the characters actually work together and need each other whereas in most RPGs, every character does their own thing. \n\n2. The music fits with the theme of the game (It's an eerie castle that you have to explore). \n\n3. The characters have a good chemistry. Even though the main character doesn't talk, her friend still communicates with her and during their short time together, forms a love relationship that works. In the outside world, each character has their own abilities (The main character can play music to unlock doors and her friend can jump gaps) which helps develop their personalities. \n\nCons: \n1. The game is short (I finished it in 2 hours). \n\n2. The two endings that aren't the \"good\" ending seem pointless because there is no substance to them (they just have the respective character walk off the screen with \"ending 2 or 3\" flashing). \n\n3. The game is a little easy. \n\nI enjoyed it and I'd recommend it for people who like RPGs. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430621672, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430621672, "recommendationid": "15663273", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546901", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432743632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 357, "steamid": "76561198054962950", "num_games_owned": 122}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "2", "review": "This game is a short RPG that had almost no flaws for me. There are two negative points which I want to point out (but don't be fooled, they're compensated by the positive points I mention right after)\n\n- Theres not too much focus on the story and huge parts of it are gathered through notes (which you may find or not, depends on how much exploring you do)\nBUT: The characters are very likeable, even though one of them can't speak. The relationship between the two main characters is heartwarming, which is pretty surprising regarding the fact that you spend such a short amount of time with them. \nThe atmosphere is phantastic and very mysterious - the music is largely responsible for that. The soundtrack is awesome and supports every mood presented in the game.\nSo yeah, if you are able to connect to the characters and atmosphere, you will have a great time and get more out of the story than you might think.\n\n- Exploring the different parts of the dungeons can be tedious, although every path has its own design. But the riddles there are so easy that you really do nothing else than running and fighting.\nBUT: The battle system is great. The characters have skills which can be combined to have different effects. And you really need those. I didn't think the game was too easy, in fact I had to prepare a tactic for most of the fights. I really enjoyed that.\nI also think that the short playtime benefits the gameplay. Yeah, its a little disappointing to see the ending after 3-4 hours, but otherwise the dungeon exploring would've become too annoying. \n\nSo, is it worth it? I'd say yes, definitely. But you have to keep in mind that the game is short and may want to wait for a sale. I didn't regret buying this game at release at all.

The central conflict is over whether or not people can find meaning in each other and deal with these problems and, less importantly, whether folks can escape a giant magical dungeon full of well-rendered megabosses. \n\nThe art in RoI is really quite good, provided you limit your definition of \"art\" to strictly the character portraits and the monsters you encounter in battle. The tileset seems to be largely stock, and looks about as interesting as a slug on pavement. \n\nMusic is overall better, with what seems to be a custom soundtrack and decent stock effects. However, the Chrono Trigger victory noise is the soundbite that ends every battle, and I have no idea how that snuck into the finished copy. I'm realtively confident that it still belongs to Squeenix, although maybe it has somehow been opened up for indie developers to use.\n\nCombat is nearly engaging. Your party consists of two characters, each of which has spells and also abilities that amp spells used on the same turn. So, you'll have one character attack with an ability that makes the other character's spell hit all monsters, and then you'll cast fire for AoE damage. Battles still feel grindy, but there's at least a little more substance than mashing your strongest abilities to win.\n\nIn summary, this isn't an abominous travesty like Data Hacker is. It's not a sleeper hit like City of Chains or an actual quality title either. It's just okay. Not bad for a first effort on steam, but not particularly worth your time either, even if it is priced accordingly for the content it delivers.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1471380857, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1471380857, "recommendationid": "24961166", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507533", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453017392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 242, "steamid": "76561198081765836", "num_games_owned": 76}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Remnants of Isolation is a beautiful game, not only in its stunning visuals, but in it's emotional atmosphere and moving narrative. It has themes of love and working together that did more than just bring a smile, but also marry them to its core gameplay mechanics.\n\nPlaying a lot of RPG Maker games, Remnant's of Isolation's combat system felt like a slight breath of fresh air. The way mana works in this game and the unique spell chaining/combo system allows each battle to feel way more engaging than in typical RPGs. Both party members really feel like they are dependent on each other, and it hits you even harder when they get seperated. This is less a nusance and more of a welcome change of pace, however.\n\nIf I can name any true flaws this game has, it's mostly technical. There are some areas where the game's framerate drops, though it's not bad enough to impact the experience. I was also personally irked by the lack of fullscreen support.\n\nRegardless, this is nice, short little gem of a game that truly deserved its golden IGMC crown.

After some exploring, she meets a boy called Melchior who was recently threw into the prison and is thrilled to meet someone who isn't trying to kill him and together decide to find a way to escape. \n\nOne if the interesting things about the the story is that the only voice for most of the game is Melchior who tries to be optimistic with his new friend but those feel the dread and is only holding on because of his friend. And while Celesta doesn't talk(either because she's a mute or she doesn't know how) I do like that shes doesn't fully understand whats happening and immediately gets attached to Melchior because he the first person shes ever met and I love her expressions she makes, my favourite is when she looks confused or curious as it just looks cute. \n\nThe relationship between the two leads is very sweet and is clearly the \"heart\" of the story.I mainly see it as true friendship with Melchior telling her about everything he knows and wants to show her and shows and wants her to have a life and Celesta helps supports him and stops him falling into despair and would give her life to make sure he can be happy. This is also seen in gameplay and I'll wait til I talk about gameplay before I explain \n\nAnd one final quick point is that I really liked the Sentinel but wished the other bosses were had a personality like him mainly his motives and goal made him an interesting anti-villain and his last moments were nice. \n\nGameplay: \nLets get this out of the way. Yes the game is very short. There's even an achievement for speed running this game in a hour and a half. I don't have a problem with that. \n\nThe main feature in this game is the spell fusion and its a very good system and fits with the whole partnership. Just use a characters innate ability followed by a magic card and then watch the fireworks. I would admit this makes the game a tiny bit easy...if it wasn't for almost every enemy hitting like a truck and aren't shy about poisoning the two. I see it as one of the more balanced combat systems I've played as its more about strategy: weaken and attack when possible and turtle and heal in an emergency. And that's the simple way of explaining. I admit there was one boss that was ridiculously easy but I just exploited his weakness. Another was easy for story reasons. \n\nBut what shows how hard this game can be is when your alone because even the first fight in the game is brutal by yourself before you get your partner and learn magic. Some people might say this is a bad thing but I like to think of it as Story-Gameplay integration showing how powerful you are together but alone, your as weak as a biscuit in tea. \n\nPresentation: \nLets start with the music. There no doubt the music is beautiful, but I eventually got bored of it. The music Celesta plays on her piano is a lovely song but when I realised the dungeon song was the same song, I just stopped paying attention. Its not bad, just not my kind of music. \n\nThe art is pretty good. The two leads and the bosses are all look lovely and are very colourful which contrast the monster which are mostly fleshy things that came from Silent Hill. I liked the character portraits but I wish they were bigger since its just the two of them and Celesta mainly communicates through her expressions and I feel that they were too small for her. \n\nVerdict: \nDespite the length this is a nice short story and a pretty good battle system and I don't regret buying it. \n\n9/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491686058, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491686058, "recommendationid": "31026681", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "total_reviews": 12, "num_reviews": 12, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
