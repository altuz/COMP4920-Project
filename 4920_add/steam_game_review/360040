I finished the game with 300k wihout anything to spend on.

General premise is that you're trying to get your freedom back by mining asteroids for a corporation. And, as it were, that's the extent of the story.\n\nActual gameplay is pretty okay. Controlling the ship can be a bit annoying at first as you can essentially only thrust forward, so you have to spin yourself 180 degrees and thrust to stop yourself. As others have said, tool upgrades and ship upgrades are pretty pointless beyong a certain level.\n\nIf you set your mind to it, you could finish this game in under two hours.
