Personally, I'd recommend a mouse and keyboard as peripherals.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very repetitive, especially on the higher levels - the enemies do not really change, you mostly face the same few enemy types the entire game.\n\nWhile the base building is admittable a rather fun part of the game, the building system and building health / repair could've done better as aiming and placing buildings down can get crowded and confusing quickly; especially if you are building a lot of defenses if you're playing by yourself. The unadjustable cameraview does not aid this issue as traps can be hidden behind your walls.\n\nAside of these issues the graphics are done fairly well, although they can be a bit confusing in cities or doors can be a bit hard to spot; aside of this they are done decently.\n\nRegarding the sound - could've been better, could've been worse. Average at best. The Assault Rifle sounds like a popcorn machine, to be honest.\n\nThe gameplay, as aforementioned, is rather repetitive and gets boring rather quickly after a few missions; the enemy AI is rather straightforward and in most cases not very intelligent (although they're zombies so you might argue that this hits the spot). \n\nIf you are into zombie survival games, I can recommend you try this game, but do not expect too much.\n\nFor anyone else, this might not be the best choice.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504587426, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504587426, "recommendationid": "34749889", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509681", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505228994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 340, "steamid": "76561198017146491", "num_games_owned": 329}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Was expecting something comparable to the first one, which I enjoyed quite a bit.
