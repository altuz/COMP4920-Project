It shows, but I believe if he keeps updating this game and listening to feedback from customers, it can be a really cool little game.  I love the idea and concept of it.\n\nI will make a video soon and post the link, mostly with constructive feedback for the developer.\n\nRight now, my recommendation is a \"NO\" because I think most people will just refund this game within five minutes.  If the developer puts some patches in and listens to feedback and takes criticism well to make this game better, I will definitely come and change this review and likely give it my recommendation.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498255767, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498256402, "recommendationid": "32700192", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522957", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499036681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 106, "steamid": "76561198045226883", "num_games_owned": 682}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I like it!\nIt needs a bit of trimming.
