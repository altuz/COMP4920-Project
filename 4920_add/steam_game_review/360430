Unless the shrubs in the bayou are made of concrete, my car should be able to drive over them, and I should be able to sneak through them. Lazy lazy lazy. My other big gripe is that often the cut scenes would show Lincoln with his base outfit on, despite the fact that I had him wearing a snazzy suit, or sporting a dashing moustache during gameplay. Why bother allowing outfit changes if you're going to be lazy about cutscenes?\n\nPros:\nThe voice acting was probably the best part of the game, along with the atmosphere the developers created. They managed to do a great job at portraying the racial tensions of the time without being overdone. Driving was okay, but not stellar. Gunplay was pretty good, but fistfighting was lame. Graphics were decent even on my toaster. Some of the missions were excellent, but the majority were boring and repetitive. Go here, kill this, interogate that, rinse and repeat.\n\nCons:\nThe storyline had the potential to be great, but they made it dull and uninteresting. The three bosses that work for you were whiny and irritating. I ended up not wanting to give Cassandra any territories because she would whine too much. Vito Scalleta was a badass in Mafia 2, somehow turned into a little bitch. Burke was the stereotypical drunk Irishman, but the dev somehow made that boring too. There was no variation in the enemies you fought. There were maybe 4 kinds of mafioso, and similar with the rednecks, how about some costume changes? Even just changing the colors up a bit would have been nice.\n\nI finished the game purely in the hopes that it would get better...it never did.

At first I was imersed and really into the story. Although their were bugs and sometimes the game would freeze. I understand the repetition of gameplay. Although growing up I loved The God Father where you pretty much do the same thing. \nComing back to this game on the PC I did'nt lknow what to expect. I bought the deluxe edition to add variety. The graphics look different on here. I don't have the best graphics card as it is just a GTX 750. Also only having 8gb of memory. I have everything on low. The game still looks great. oddly to say it looks even better at night. The frames are consistant. Somes drops, but not an eye sore. Theirs new animations on executions. Also as well as racing. I am very addicted to this game as I was before. The environment is different than any other game. People would want to compare this game to Grand Theft Auto. But why? It is nothing like it. Besides cover base 3rd person shooting. They are not at all alike. Also comparing this game with mafia 2. They are both different games. Although Mafia 2 was open world. It felt linear to pushing you to go through a certain linethrough the story. While Mafia 3 you choose how you want to go about it. Having 3 underbosses and the potential to kill one of them is not something I have found or heard in any other game. This game is not perfect.
