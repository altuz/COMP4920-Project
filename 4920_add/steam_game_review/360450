There are no players playing Kiai Resonance anymore, you can wait forever for a multiplayer battle.\n- That also means that you can't get all achievments, because many of them you can get only in multiplayer battles.\n- Game gets verry repetetive after few battles, there is nothing like level system, or upgrades, customization, not even \n  difficulty settings to make the game more challenging, you can just fight with the same character with the same sword \n  over and over.\n+ But the challenge missions kinda save it, they are well made and fun, and also challenging.\n> Overally, I like the game, you can have few hours of fun for a verry little amount of money.\n> So if you like samurai themed games, or maybe you just have few coins spared from last purchase, I totally recommend \n   Kiai Resonance.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498643033, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498643033, "recommendationid": "32923763", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516908", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449589317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 255, "steamid": "76561198001780420", "num_games_owned": 163}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game and love the art style , I would like to see a sequel though with more depth and skill needed.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492089850, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492089850, "recommendationid": "31116318", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505180", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492264372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 105, "steamid": "76561198278323138", "num_games_owned": 90}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "For me, this game is the most realistic 2D fighting game. The combat system is just Whooah, it's really epic. The art style is beautiful and the control is really simple. The only problem is the multiplayer mode. It would be better if dev fix it as soon as they can. So, I'd recommend instead of multiplayer, use the local player mode.
