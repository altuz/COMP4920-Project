Put simply, I don't think it is quite up to the price it is asking ($10 American at full price for me) but it is very close. Firstly, It is a good game. The artwork is really quite nice, which surprised me, because my initial reaction was to not like all the blue. However, as you go along, instead of getting sick of the artwork, it has enough variety to be interesting. Another factor is that everything is very clear. your character, the enemies, and all the projectiles stand out very well against the backdrop, and the backdrop is dynamic enough to not become boring. as of where I am currently (at the second boss, who I have versed but not beaten yet), I have only seen a few primary colours, or variants of them, but this isn't neccessarily a bad thing. Like I said before, the environment is dynamic enough that having little variance in colour isn't really a bad thing here, and it does have the benefit of making the game very clear. As for the sound, it's just like the graphics. There are several tracks in this game, and they don't really differ very much, at least from what I've experienced. However, they do set the mood for the game as a brooding, tense (but not dark) game. the music is perfectly sufficient for this game. \nNext we have the controls. and there is nothing to complain about them.  They are crisp and your character will stop on a dime. I haven't yet experienced a moment when I said to myself \"I didn't want to go there\" unless it was my own fault. Now i must mention the game mechanics here, because they are directly related to the controls. The main game mechanic is that your character, instead of having a gun, has a sheild, and he/she/it will be shot at by a variety of enemies. Using the sheild, you can then bounce the enemies projectiles back at the enemies and kill them if you so desire. Aside from the bosses, there is absolutely no need to kill anything. The sheild you carry spins around your character following your mouse. It works fine, and again, I have yet to had \"What was that?\" moment that wasn't my fault. But aside from making things easier, there is absolutely no need to kill the enemies. Your entire goal is to get to the end-zone without dieing (its a one hit kill mechanic both for you and your enemies, except the bosses). You can run through the levels without killing a single enemies. the only reward for killing enemies is the (occasional) powerup, which give you temporary abilities like being able to shoot, invulnerability, or causing an explosion that kills enemies around you, but not you. In my experience however, the powerups seem to be a little to short to be much use and not worth going out of your way for. Very occasionally they will save you, but usually they aren't worth to much.\nAnother thing to consider when buying this title, is that there isn't a story. All enjoyment is to be found in the game itself, and there is quite a bit to be found there. In my experience I have had a quite a few moments when I've been pumped to get to the end of a particularly annoying zone, or blocking a shot i didn't quite see coming, and of course some very frustrating moments when i would mistakenly bounce a projectile into a wall and it would bounce straight back at me.\nA final note when considering this game, note that at first you are restricted to moving in only two directions. However, after the first boss, the levels open up and you are able to move in four directions. The path is always linear, and you will always know what direction you need to go.\nTo summarise, I think this is a good game, everything is sufficient for what it does, and I cant find any major faults for this game. However, I do not think this game is quite worth $10 American. In my opinion it appears to be worth around to $6-7 mark, any lower and I would be happy to grab it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429869716, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429869716, "recommendationid": "15515760", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532612", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453204074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 97, "steamid": "76561197978290786", "num_games_owned": 249}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": "1", "review": "When I first started playing this, I save it a solid \"meh\". The graphics are excellent for the minalist design, the soundtrack is good albeit a little shorter than I'd like, the controls are intuitive, and the gameplay's core mechanic (navigating a fixed path with a shield) is simple but solid.\n\nBut there's not much more than that. Or so I thought.\n\nOnce you're deep enough into the game, once you think it's nothing but being on a fixed-path with a shield, there's an actual *boss battle*. It'll be frustrating, and you'll get past it, and then the game changes its feel again. It's refreshing, and I would have missed it if I didn't stick through the first hour of somewhat repetitive gameplay.\n\nThere are lots of mechanics this game could do with: achievements, time-trials, shared high-scores with friends, and some customisation. But it's still a fun game without those things.\n\nProbably worth $0.80 if you're looking for something to distract you for a few hours, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $7.99 list price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453191090, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1453200680, "recommendationid": "20620068", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532363", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468284560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561198170139205", "num_games_owned": 32}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Horrible game for the high price!
