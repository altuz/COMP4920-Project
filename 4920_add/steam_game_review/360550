You are a slave. As such, there really isn't much of a good ending coming for you. In fact, three of the endings are bad, and one is... not so bad? I mean, there is a good ending for someone you care about, but... not for you.\n\nIt is an interesting experiment, if nothing else.

However, its not enough to make a good game.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with this game was the writing. It was choppy and inconsistent, especially tonally. The protagonist was very annoying, and his commentary on everything was pointless. The first portion of the game before any choices in particular was very difficult to get through-it was way too long and boring. The story is weak, and I didn't care at all for any of the characters.I was really determined to stick it out and get all endings, but it really wasn't worth it. This game's writing really needed some major editing, all across.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497420750, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498887709, "recommendationid": "32404413", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502577", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 87, "total_reviews": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
