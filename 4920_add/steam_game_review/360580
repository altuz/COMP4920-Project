End of each level you have to press X to progress to the next level as well, so I think that this is a VERY lazy port that hasn't even bothered to change the inputs from XBox! \nI tried an XBox controller as well, foolishly thinking that it might be a better way to play... \nNope, no response at all using a controller!\nIt goes to show how truly lazy a port this is when, in the options menu there is a setting for controller shake and next to it is a message \"Not on PC\"!! So why is it even in there???\n\nThe gameplay is mildly amusing briefly, but only consists of picking things up in your abduction beam and either abducting the defenseless, dropping enemies to their death or dropping rocks and crates to kill or damage enemies. That's pretty much it.\n\nFor a mere \u00a31.35 I suppose it's ok value, I got just over 30 mins for mild entertainment out of it.\nBut it could have been so much more!\nEvery level is the same, a flat plane with a very basic background image and a bunch of crates, rocks, civies and enemies.\n\nA bland and disappointing game, rather than a bad one, and a lazy port indeed.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441535524, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441535524, "recommendationid": "17909440", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509158", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445155039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 68, "steamid": "76561198164306900", "num_games_owned": 2861}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I knew this game would be cheap and Dumb when I bought it, but still even knowing that, I still bought it because I thought it would be fun and enjoy it for what it is, this is no Destroy all Humans, but its still funny and fun.\nWish it was longer tho", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441609596, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460495191, "recommendationid": "17924030", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498001", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469665805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 94, "steamid": "76561198008114001", "num_games_owned": 848}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Actually pretty fun!
