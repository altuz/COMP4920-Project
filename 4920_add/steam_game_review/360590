What is really bad i think about it is that they say the new game is their \"Dream come true\" and the only thing i can think of is wasn't this supposed to be the \"Dream come true\"? \n\nPlus if one looks at other successful indie studios they have a single game they focus all their attention on and build a stronge base around that one game and make a name for themself on that one game and not go from game to game to game every few months.\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/darkday/final-breath-ps4-pc-xbox-mac-and-linux\n\n=\nI originally got this game because I loved the art work you see on the games store page and the backgrounds that they did are all very good I think and done by a very tallented artist.\n\nHaving said that nice art work and backgrounds for my Steam profile, is not enough and while I also honestly hate to give negative reviews mostly cause I like to give developers a chance, plus the assets they licensed are really nice ones, but after playing the game for four (4) hours now I can say with certainty that its not worth the $5 and I can't say that I recommend it either to anyone.\n\nOne thing to watch out for is that number of things stated on the store page, that were available in the early alpha demo and that you see in the video are not in the game. For example right now you can play the police officer and the fireman, but not the other characters that you see playing in the video. Also, other than the jeep, you can't drive the other vehicles, like the van that you see being driven in the video, you can't drive it. Which is a bit of a disappointment and I hope they add back the stuff they remove as soon as possible or at least change the video to reflect the game that they do have.\n\nAlso, the game needs a lot of work, right now its just shell of a game and little more than money grab and a whole bunch of pie in the sky promises...\n\nFor example, the game presently does not do many of the things that are said on the store page, which is very misleading. The game does not appear to support 100 players, only 32 players as with UnitZ. The game does not let you pick from one of 15 different characters, so far only 2 characters can you play. The game does not have 50 different zombie types, it has 10 different zombie models from Simple Zombies asset pack and different skins that comes with it, but all of them like using the same UnitZ zombie logic. Also, the game does not appear to have 50 weapons, only around dozen from UnitZ. Nor does the game have 100 craft-able items, only the half dozen from UnitZ. Also as far as I could tell the game does not do split screen, at all. I think much of what we read from the store page comes from the original KickStarter / Greenlight description and appears to be in need of editing to reflect what we actually are getting.\n\nWorse the thing looks to have been shoddily done in a  short period of time by hurriedly throwing a handful of packages from unity asset store together and little else.\n\n$50 UnitZ game demo from HardWorker Studio (that is what you really getting and doing the game logic) and around $100 worth of models from Synty Studio (and those are the models your playing with) and one of those cheap $10-$20 cartoony GUI skin.\n\nSo there you have it, not much else to it...\n\nWorse the GUI is horribly integrated and not fully functional. I actually can't figure how they thought it better than the one that UnitZ came with, at least in my opinion that one looked and worked better.\n\nAlso it does not look like they made a single change to UnitZ game template and have left all the bugs, including using its horrible network code. So I dont see how they can say it will ever support 100 players because it does not support a dedicated server, does not do any caching/pooling of game objects to keep the garbage collector at bay and the game logic is all running basically on a single native thread.\n\nWorse is the fact that nobody is playing this game and playing solo becomes boring really quickly. Even worse is the fact that UnitZ demo is available completely for free and lots of people are playing it. \n\nSo I cannot recommend this game or give it a thumbs up until the time that they make major improvements to the original UnitZ code and add missing functionality like they show in the video trailer and like they had in the original early alpha demo, but for whatever reason do not include in the release that they give to us. Like being able to drive the vehicles we see in the game video being driven and them giving us more than just the single jeep that comes with the UnitZ demo and until they add the ability to play all the characters that they have which we see them playing in the video on the Steam store, and that were again in the original early alpha demo, but we are not able to play in the release that we get. And not until there are more people to play it since it's really not worth playing by yourself. Basically I want the game that is shown in the Steam store in the video and in the feature list, not the release I was given. I'm actually not sure why they removed stuff like driving the van which looks like it was working well enough in the video and the ability to play other characters which might have been removed cause the GUI they sort of kludged is unfinished, but who knows...\n\nunitz\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26912\n\nsynty studio 3d models\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/publisher/5217\n\n\nI'm not going to look for exactly which gui skin they used but im pretty sure i seen it in unity asset store.\n\nIf your interested in a cartoony zombie open world suvival game of this kind then just get Unturned for FREE instead\n\nAnd if you want to spend $5 then get Unturned Gold which helps Nelson the 17 year old developer of Unturned out...\n\nAt least that game plays, looks, sounds and runs great and is not something that was thrown together using stock assets and at least with that game you get what is on the store page.\n\n\nFinally if anyone is interested in playing completely for free the original UnitZ demo here is link\nhttp://www.gamekak.com/unity/uz/2/", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431985465, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436553660, "recommendationid": "15891320", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649252", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437528101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11, "steamid": "76561198056858731", "num_games_owned": 59}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "nothing to do in the game\nno content", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437528231, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437528231, "recommendationid": "17165711", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505576", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467923452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 379, "steamid": "76561198106071682", "num_games_owned": 996}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you are looking for a game that makes you cry?\nThis is the perfect game for you!\nBesides that online dead is, there are almost none of the features they promise you and the zombies are very very easy to kill/walk around, the only thing you can do is collect achievements, which I did, and even that was fucked up.\n\n5/7 would uninstall", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467938805, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1467938805, "recommendationid": "24170746", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502770", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436390046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198237504084", "num_games_owned": 82}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "sucks willy", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461452459, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1461452459, "recommendationid": "22598536", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498092", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1455572073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 288, "steamid": "76561198213384664", "num_games_owned": 28}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this no good game once bitten twice dead i cant ride car:(", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486085045, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486085045, "recommendationid": "29660187", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480198", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436365471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 48, "steamid": "76561198139029720", "num_games_owned": 11}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The im it self is great and idea plus i like the gameplay!\nBut theres a lot to fix!\n1.
