These guys get it and I truly believe I will buy from them again if I keep seeing games like this. The graphics were gorgeous, animations were smooth.

This can have a snowball effect in that against the advanced enemies it is harder to survive with weakened weapons.

It's fun, and while it starts easy enough to warm you up (or to be OK to pick up for a young kid who's early to games) it gets more and more swarmy with each wave. I like that it's challenging enough for me to enjoy but that little family members who can't do major games can play something out of this too.\n\nNote that I had the benefit of playing it with a gamepad where I used both sticks - I haven't looked at what the mouse/keyboard controls are, but with a two-sticks gamepad you move with the left stick and fire with the right stick. Like if you push the right stick to the left you're firing to the left, even if you're moving up and down. For those who haven't played two-sticks shooters, be aware that if you're moving down to get away from an enemy (for example) you'll want to adjust the direction you're pressing on your right stick as you go since the enemy is not on your left now but above you. (I realize this is a given to anyone who has played this kind of game before, but this is for those who haven't.)\n\nI like this game. For the price, it's great.
