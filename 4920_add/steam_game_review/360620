If you get a kick out of watching your friends burn to death in a pool of lava, or if you're a fan of the twitchyness of mobas but not the farming and item management - this game is for you.[/b]\n\n[b]The good:[/b] [i]Gameplay is disgustingly addictive. Spells are unique and gameplay changes as strategies evolve and spell combos are discovered, countered, and re-invented. The aesthetic and feel of the game is cute too. Devs are responsive, respond to feedback, bug reports, and put out regular updates. Spells recently recieved a complete overhaul as just one example of their continued dedication to the project, and although the game is still in early alpha it's very competent at what it does. The Devs have big plans for additional content and functionality for the game, but it already looks promising.[/i]\n\n[b]The bad:[/b] [i]Game population is very low at time of writing, due to being an indie title in early access, without much in the way of exposure. You wont find a game through matchmaking with that being the case, so if you're looking to fling spells at strangers, you're S.O.L. \nHowever, if you've got 2 or 3 friends to play with, you'll still have a blast. If you don't you'll have to be satisfied blowing up bots for now.[/i]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500759648, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500766146, "recommendationid": "33730437", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 53, "total_reviews": 64, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
