If you have 5-10 minutes only you can always go for a level and finish it. Its not hard, not require special focus or following specific strategies, you will likely finish all levels easily just by playing it and having a common sense.\n\nIn the game you need progress through levels. The road usually blocked by obstacles and their removal required. Removing these obstacles usually costs you food, wood or other resources. To get these resources you need the help of your friends, whose collecting these items or building farms, mines or other buildings. As you progress in the game you will unlock other, mythological helpers whose will aid you in your journey by killing other mythological enemies like minotaurs.\n\nDont wait any longer! Help Hercules tame the cretan bull!\n\nThe game is on sale quite many times each year, but the full price also worth the 6-7 hours gameplay this game offer.\n\nAs your Average Achievement Hunter ill write some infos about achievements aswell:\nThis game has 22. While you will get almost all achievements just by finishg the game some require additonal tasks. Each level has a hidden puzzle piece what you need loot up and on one random level you need shoot down 10 birds what flying through the screen. There are one \"harder\" achievement in the game, which require to beat developer time on 10 different maps. Its not that bad as it sounds, there are quite few level where the developers time easily beatable. Levels replayable, so even if you miss out something, it could be easily acquired. Easy perfect game in 7-8hours max.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501665796, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501666021, "recommendationid": "33967112", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500718", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502220946, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3166, "steamid": "76561198245837576", "num_games_owned": 1293}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "TL;DR - If you are not yet tired of all the resource-management frenzy in the market, definitely play 12 Labours of Hercules II: The Cretan Bull. Still like the first game, it includes new & amazing levels and improvements! 7/10\n\nThe game is just like what you have expected; it is not revolutionary nor very exciting. Each level required you to complete tasks by collecting resources dispersed on the roads, building stations and clearing the path. Our friend, Hercules is also as lazy as he had been since the first game. He's basically useless unless you count moving that one big boulder work. \n\nMuch like the first game and a lot of others of its kind, 12 Labours of Hercules II: The Cretan Bull does not have much story going on - rather it focuses on the gameplay and other aspects of the game. There is nothing spectacular about the graphics; they are bright and clean, not too fancy or anything. This goes the same for the music, suitable and relaxing for a casual game.\n\nThe levels in the game get trickier as you progress, making the achievements a tad harder. Also, it gets very challenging to manage Gold medal in time. That is if you play on Casual or Expert mode; for those who want to keep their slower-pace, the Relaxed Mode is also there as an option. The developers have added a couple of extra features in this sequel; annoying robbers (which really shouldn't exist) and puzzle pieces for instance. The puzzle pieces are Collectibles, you can put on your eyeglasses and spy each of them in every level \u2013 they can be assembled every so often. Mainly collect them for the achievements.\n\nOverall, I give this game a mediocre 6/10. Is it different than the first game (or even the rest of the series), no. Buy this game if you really like the gameplay mechanics or the achievements. I still say its worth the money for hours of gameplay.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502302937, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502598096, "recommendationid": "34130338", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451442640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561198231124652", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I bought this as a meme", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500660990, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500660990, "recommendationid": "33702492", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498589", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504030104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 343, "steamid": "76561198033876350", "num_games_owned": 998}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1]Cretan Clicking![/h1]\n\n[b]Overall: 66% (158.0 / 240)[/b]\n\n[code]\n---------- [b]Aesthetics[/b] ----------\nAtmosphere    7.5/10\nCinematics    5.4/10\nGraphics      9.6/20\nInterface     3.9/10\nLevel Design  3.3/10\n-------------  50% (29.7 / 60)\n\n---------- [b]Audio[/b] ----------\nSound Effects 6.3/10\nMusic         8.5/10\nVoice         7.2/10\n-------------  73% (22.0 / 30)\n\n---------- [b]Functionality[/b] ----------\nPerformance       10.0/10\nStability         10.0/10\nSteam Integration 5.0/5\n-------------  100% (25.0 / 25)\n\n---------- [b]Gameplay[/b] ----------\nBalance       8.2/10\nControls      6.4/10\nMechanics     6.2/10\nRewards       4.5/10\nTutorial      4.0/5\nVariety       4.2/10\n-------------  61% (33.5 / 55)\n\n---------- [b]Story[/b] ----------\nCredibility\t\t7.0/10\nPlot              \t5.0/10\nScope\t  \t      \t3.0/10\n-------------  50% (15.0 / 30)\n\n---------- [b]Writing[/b] ----------\nCorrectness   5.0/5\nDiction       4.4/5\n-------------  94% (9.4 / 10)\n\n---------- [b]Others[/b] ----------\nCost-Benefit Ratio  \t4.1/5\nReplay Value  \t\t5.5/10\nSystem Requirements \t4.8/5\nUser Rating\t        9.0/10\n-------------------  78% (23.4 / 30)\n[/code]\n\n\nWant to read more reviews like this?
