No Steamworks features, it's a quick and sloppy port over from iOS, there's even a iOS Gamecenter button still present. Hell, there's not even any way to exit the game if you're playing in full screen, you need to ALT+Tab out to the desktop and close the window from there. Only four bucks though, and there appears to be about 100 levels of increasing difficulty, so it's hardly the worst deal in the world. I just have a hard time giving a thumbs up to a game you can't even exit from properly.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432786237, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432786553, "recommendationid": "16034252", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627870", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464299867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 49, "steamid": "76561198306988704", "num_games_owned": 6}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "cute little puzzle game, i wan't sure how long I would play this game, but it looked itnteresting. I thought when I watched the videos that the game might be too easy, how wrong i was. I could play it fine and got through the first couple of levels with no problem. Things quickly ramped up by the time I was a level 5, I was doing everything I could to finish the levels the first time. After a few tries, I was able to get a hang of pattern, and I finished level 6.
