Downwell is a game you must play in short bursts every now and again to truly appreciate, and while some people deem it addictive, I don't see it. Luckily, the game is fun enough to be able to play for tens of hours, however there is not much keeping you attatched to it. This is actually a good thing, since the fast paced repetitive action is indeed very repetitive, by the millionth run in a row it starts becoming rather dry. \n\n8/10 Fantastic Timewaster, not too engaging on on any deeper level.

It's super fun to pass some time or hunt the achievements.\n\nGraphics are simple, clean, and it doesn't distract you from focusing the enemy. The color pallete can be changed/unlocked by playing more, great if you have specific color that give you the most attention to it.\n\nThe game itself is hard, can be frustrating if you barely missed the top of the enemy and hit their side instead (which damages you) but that's your fault XD\n\nDifficulty curve is kinda... weird? The very first two stages are nightmare compared to the last one. You'll probably start to hate bats from this game. Various playstyle to choose. From average default, gun modules lover, free fall guy, easy combo mode, and I-continue-to-live-through-shopping (aka hardcore) style.\n\nI recommend you to buy this.
