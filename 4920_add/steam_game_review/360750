Imagine a game where you place turrets, like a tower defence ... game but then you must manually fire them in an arcade fashion. That completely ruins it for me. I was expecting much more of a compromise between a shooter and a tower defence game. StarFence is essentially an arcade shooter where there's no movement, just shooting and using power-ups. Using the power-ups is also awkward.\n\nOverall I wouldn't recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459934541, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1459934541, "recommendationid": "22265950", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499009", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490246391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 134, "steamid": "76561198031485735", "num_games_owned": 123}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This beautifully crafted\u00a0defence game should keep you busy for a while. Enemy ships have been designed by a detail artist. The actual gameplay puts your base at the center of the screen and enemies are appearing around at random spots and closing in on your base or defences.\n\nYour defences are made out of turrets that you place around the map. Just keep the mouse button pressed and target everything brown :) As you'll find out later on there's little skill or tactic involved since EVERYTHING is TOTALLY random, which will discourage some people.\n\nThe upgrade system is what you'd expect; each level you start crappy but you can spend upgrade points acquire during previous maps to give you an edge. Upgrade points are currency based and must somehow be farmed during each level so you can spend more of them later on.\n\nSuccess in each map is MOSTLY depending on your luck which is made up of powerups that defeated enemies drop. If this game had no powerups you'd be dead.. period. Powerups type and amount are also random and theres a ton of them. \n\nThere are bosses... extremely well drawn giant ships that will eventually be very hard to kill unless you are lucky. If there is a small amount of strategy involved in this game you'll find it at bosses where you will want to keep some turrets and walls that you'll deploy once the boss enters the map... cant prepare in advance since its spawn point is RANDOM :)\n\nTo sum it up this game will entertain you, even stress you at some point. The gameplay is kind of explosive but slow/sluggish.. which is a feature, not a bug. Finally... the effort put into this title by the dev is remarkable, precise... masterful.
