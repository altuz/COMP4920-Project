There is just so much filler. Half-baked, interchangeable activities, giant spaces, copied and pasted enemies. This was like having your favorite 90s band announce a new album 20 years later, only now they've decided to loop a lot of the instruments and recycle a lot of lyrics to save time.

But it is a modern platformer with a heavy focus on mixing classic Rare tropes and level design with new ideas. It definitely feels like something that could be slotted into the late 64 catalogue easily.\n\nEveryone will want to immediately switch to the manual camera. Having played it through on the classic and gone back and played around with the manual camera, I can guarantee that the controls will immediately feel much tighter with this option enabled.\n\nPlaying through the game I never had trouble finding remaining quills aside from the well known Shovel Knight single quill, they were all along the path to the pagies one way or another. On the other hand, there were a few pagies that were quite hard to find, but what kind of collectathon would it be without a couple of those here and there?\n\nWhile the levels look pretty and the platforming is grand for the most part, it quickly becomes obvious as you play through that very little in the levels connect to each other. Each pagie is plopped on the map somewhere and are equally fast/easy to get to, with the only barrier being the expansion. There are very few minigames besides the hoop race which has a heavy presence. \n\nAll-in-all, a lot of the elements of the game feel like they were rushed. Lack of minigames, odd characters being reused between levels, few characters in general, lack of connection between level parts, and a couple easy to reach holes in the overworld where you can go out-of-bounds. Sacrifices were apparently made during the making of this game, here's to hoping that a sequel will have enough dev time and hours to make up for it.\n\nI give a firm recommendation to anyone wanting to have fun with a classic-style platformer without expecting it to be Banjo-Kazooie wholesale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506690601, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506690601, "recommendationid": "35293307", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502051", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494817118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 823, "steamid": "76561198061721720", "num_games_owned": 43}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Still a great game to this day", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506341719, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506341719, "recommendationid": "35201505", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497672", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506191396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 271, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1907, "steamid": "76561197961167133", "num_games_owned": 146}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "For starters I played the Linux version on Ubuntu 17.04 with the Open source Radeon Drivers.

Perhaps most glaringly, the later levels are designed as a bunch of branching paths with one or two things to do down each, instead of having a cohesive level to roam around in. The first level pulls this feel off in spades, but every level afterwards feels less and less inspired. I've heard other people say this, but it feels like Banjo 0.5 more than anything. \n\nNow this doesn't sound like a glowing reccomendation. BUT if you are into this genre or were an absoute fan of Banjo-Kazooie, you will enjoy this game most likely. As I said before tho, if you are unfamiliar with the era of gaming Yooka is refrencing, I'm not sure you will get a ton out of it. I'm in my mid 20's and loved both BK games to death, so I'm in the camp who got something out of this.

I usually play other FPS games, that are usually competitively spirited, and this game takes me back to the old days of platforming. Collectathons, quirky and funny characters, and a vibrant world.
