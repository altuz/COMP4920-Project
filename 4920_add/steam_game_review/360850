The video clip shows you the gist of the game play, so I won\u2019t try to explain it. It\u2019s actually not an original concept, but a port of the old UNIX based puzzle \u201cNet\u201d. The difference being Electric Circuit\u2019s interface and nice looking graphical front end. This alone is worth the low price tag. It\u2019s also customizable, so you can play on a small easy level, or challenge yourself with larger grids and wrap around connectivity.
