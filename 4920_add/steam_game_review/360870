I find myself spending countless hours playing alone against the perfected AI that is the computer. If somehow that wasn't enough to convince you then just try the multiplayer; it's incredibly intense! Possibly my favourite game perhaps just behind Unturned. Definitely worth a download!\n\nAnd now for the pros and cons:\n\nPros\n \nCrystal clear audio\nRefined graphics\nIntense and intricate design\nBeautifully complex\n\nCons\n\nQuite beefy on the storage side\nLong download time\nRequires expensive setup\nSpelt \"Noughts and Crosses\" incorrectly  in the title\n\nOverall this is just a bunch of fun for free. Also the developers announced that there will be no season pass or paid DLC for this game which is amazing! I honestly believe that other game developers could take example from this masterpiece in all aspects.\n\n0.00483/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486141476, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486141759, "recommendationid": "29673421", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500308", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488001258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 19, "steamid": "76561198121992725", "num_games_owned": 33}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "9", "review": "I expected a game with easy to earn achievements, and I got terribley programmed AI.
