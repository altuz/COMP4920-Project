The big problems are all game design related. From  terrible performance issues, to bugs and glitches. Several of the puzzles are bugged leading to frustration. And the save system is a pain, meaning you end up retreading large sections of the game you have already completed. \n\nThe controls feel floaty and imprecise making boss battles a chore. And even the AI can end up killing you even when they really should not be able to. \n\nStill on the positive side, the hand drawn cutscenes are well done, the audio is decent and the voice acting okay. Also the monster designs are nice, and the death scenes very well done. \n\nSadly it's not enough to really salvage this game overall. Maybe if you see it on sale and want to know more about the phillipnes ghost lore. Otherwise you may want to save your money for something better.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505160204, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505160204, "recommendationid": "34889400", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
