At least there are some nice sceneries. There's also a very annoying issue when clicking the left mouse button: the map immediately restart at the beginning. The options menu not work correctly sometimes. \nI saw a lot of better games build on the CryEngine!\nIt's not worth the full price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506270964, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506271063, "recommendationid": "35185349", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499542", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 19, "total_reviews": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 37}}
