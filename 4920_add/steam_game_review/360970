There's just not much to do.  You explore around.  You find these scrolls.  You're supposed to pick up apples, mushrooms, and clovers, etc.  The scrolls just say some vague stuff about life and death.  \n\nMovement controls are not very smooth.  The scenic landscapes, while imaginative, have low textures.  You really just aimlessly wander around until you find items.  \n\nOn the positive side, it is very low priced and can make you sleepy.  \n\nRating 4/10 only buy if you're into this kind of experience", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506755461, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506755461, "recommendationid": "35326147", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5}}
