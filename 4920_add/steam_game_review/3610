Here, your agency sent you to find a lost movie in Los Angeles.\n\nThe main core of the game is to clear 25 levels, which can contain from 1 to several scenes, where you're finding items in your list, as hidden ones that can unlock the unlimited scenes, make you gain 1.000.000 points or other bonus. Because Mystery P.I. is based on high scores, which means the more you're scoring, the more you're going to climb up the ladder of ranks. At the end of each level, you'll have a minigame (words, pairs, jigsaws, etc..).\n\nAfter a little town, Vegas and New York, it's time to visit movie studios, beachs and red carpets. That's for me the only thing that changed. I mean by that that Lost in Los Angeles isn't innovative at all, it's just another application of the same recipe that made Mystery P.I. a loved series. I know however that the next in the series had a new element, can't remember it though.\n\nAnyway, you'll be disappointed if you were waiting for something new. The soundtrack is still the same, the core too, as I've said, it's just a change of scenery.\n\nI'll recommend it because I liked it but I prefer to do so for HO hardcore gamers, that will not be bored after a few scenes."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1449285457, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503118", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "19491416", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197988040892", "num_reviews": 52, "last_played": 1497234326, "num_games_owned": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2313}, "timestamp_updated": 1449285457, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's a hidden object game. It's a fantastic game to shut down and relax to so don't come here looking for an amazing plot line or game mechanics that are revolutionary in any way. You go to a scene, find the objects, move on. And for that, it's worth 5 bucks as its a game I can repeatedly come back to and put some hours in. And I'll also admit that a few of the items on some of the levels are hard to find so it really does give you a little bit of a workout for your perception.

The story is perfunctory background stuff that isn't going to add much to the experience.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are the key to the game, and they mostly are fine - no real issues with translations gone awry I can remember, the scenes are at least slightly naturalistic (if extremely messy, but that is the nature of the genre), and the graphics are good enough for the purpose.\n\nOverall a fine and perfectly playable entry in the series to spend an evening or so going through, probably only for fans of the genre though."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1421531282, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504511", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "14038372", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198103717424", "num_reviews": 42, "last_played": 1421530732, "num_games_owned": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 501}, "timestamp_updated": 1421531282, "received_for_free": false, "review": "So, I just finished Mystery P.I. - Lost in Los Angeles, after about 8.5 hours of playing this game.\n\nWould I recommend it?\n\nNot necessarily. It is too repetitive for my taste to be a game worthy of recommendation, and overall, it reminded me a lot of Escape Rosecliff Island, which I finished a few days prior to this game. The game concept is pretty much the same - search for hidden objects, then do some mini games in between, like match 3, memory, and looking for words in a mess of letters - and overall, it doesn't feel all that innovative.\n\nThe story with the search for the lost film, as a private investigator, is just a little flavor for the game. Not more, not less.\n\nOverall: if you get this game, buy it at a time it is a lot cheaper than usually. For giving me less than 10 hours of gaming time, it doesn't feel like this game is really worth a lot. \n\nI purchased this in a bundle of Popcap Games, which also means I still have three more Mystery P.I. games to play.

It's a single screen puzzle game, where you view a scene, and then try and find (and subsequently click on) the objects listed on the side of the screen. If you don't like this type of game, you won't like Lost in Los Angeles. I do like these games however, and thought this one was great. The only real thing I didn't like so much was that because it is an older game, the scenes you view aren't as high res as what I would like (they are a bit pixellated), which I think artifically makes it harder to find some objects.
