The classic Tradewinds is just that. A classic. Many an afternoon was spent playing the classic version on my mom's computer at work after school when she was away. Legends builds on this by adding flying ships, different types of ships, ammo, upgrades, and better graphics. Tradewinds 2 is the black sheep. Don't bother installing it.\n\nUs: Tradewinds was great! We love building up a massive fleet and claiming the seas as our own!\nDevs: Oh, well then you'll love Tradewinds 2! You get a ship that you can upgrade to do the same thing, but with better graphics!\nUs: Cool! Better graphics is good. Can't wait to set sail with my fleet and wreak havok!\nDevs: Well we have a great surprise for you! What do people like even better than lots of ships? Just one!! Why bother with the hassle of managing a whole fleet? Too much work. We made it easier and better by just giving you the one ship to manage and upgrade!\nUs: And you are charging more for this one?\nDevs: Yes.\nUs: Yeeeeeeaaaaaaah, thanks but no thanks."}]}
