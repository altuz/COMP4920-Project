Since you can only use each card ~10 times before they break you're almost required to take 3 offensive cards (double so as there is no basic attack- no attack card means you're screwed). End result is that all the interesting utility cards are a total waste of time- adding in a 4th non-attack slot or giving a basic attack to fall back on would greatly help this game use what it already has...\n\nOverall a solid little game if you can pick it up for the right price", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503518067, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503518067, "recommendationid": "34445593", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 14}}
