And then the first video - BARF! super cheesy. But a reference to Card Hunter (dig it) caught my eye, so against my better judgement I gave the game a proper look. The game \"sounded\" solid, and the second video seemed to like it, so I honestly don't know why, but i bought it.\n\nI'm shocked. Halfway thru the campaign and my impression is that It's good. It doesn't appear to have the same depth or polish as Card Hunter, but it's a worthy comparison. For me it captures the same engaging strategy thinking in ~15 minute chunks without being punishing or tedious.\n\nPro's:\nPrice - It's well worth $4\nUI - Easy to grasp and efficient. Adding extensive mouse-over text would take it from good to excellent.\nTutorial - Sparse but effective. The \"pass\" mechanic (npi) seemed gimmicky at first, but now I see at as important to the flavor of this game.\nQuality - The writing and card descriptions are sharp. No major bugs. Only one crash and it even told me why (failed to adjust resolution) and crashed gracefully.\nGameplay - It's deep enough to not be casual, and simple enough to not be hardcore. I'm fine with the amount of  RNG so far.\nPvP - Haven't tried it yet, but if anyone else is playing, i look forward to it.\n\nCons:\nMarketing: The first impression (before buying) was so bad that I'm afraid not many others will buy it.\nGraphics: I'm not a fan of the overall appearance. It doesn't detract from gameplay, but I find it amateurish. Reminds me of Dungeons of Dredmore which I also liked despite disliking the visuals.\n\nCard Hunter fans should enjoy this, it's better than it looks,\n\nOther dumb looking games that are fun:\nSrututu (RPG/board game - not on Steam)\nBravada (Battle of Tiles/TBS)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441487152, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441487152, "recommendationid": "17900824", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519977", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442806569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 3424, "steamid": "76561198050379221", "num_games_owned": 657}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I was surprised there weren't more reviews for Steamalot so I decided to write this in support of this small game. This game is quite fun despite being a phone port. Gameplay is simple square grid turn based strategy, which can be difficult at times though never overwhelmingly so. There are a few things I would like to point out that I don't think have been said already:\n\n1) Deck sizes are 20 cards which seems to limit some of the possibilities for customization (though it probably also keeps the levels from going on for too long)\n\n2) Card packs are purchased with coins that are won from battles or won from completing certain battles. You can buy more expensive packs with guaranteed rarer cards, but I found that just buying the cheapest pack with 5 random cards provided enough uncommon and rare cards to be a better purchase, especially since the extra common cards can be sold for coins or used to level other cards.\n\n3) The developers have posted all the card creation combinations on their website. If you want to create cards, check out the list there. The combinations would otherwise be too difficult and time-consuming to figure out on your own.\n\n4) Leveling cards is not necessary to beat the game on normal mode. Leveling more than a few cards to their max seems like it would take too much level grinding for coins unless you want to sacrifice some of your uncommon and rare cards that you only have a single copy of. Only recommended for completionists and extreme PvP players. \n\nOverall, Steamalot is a fun, short strategy game that can be played in small bursts. I'm already hoping for a sequel.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441859554, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441859554, "recommendationid": "17965140", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507252", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
