It's an interesting game / series, maybe more appealing to a niche market interested in microbiology, and it can be a bit charming in that it's relaxing to swim along as whatever parasite you are. You occassionally have to \"save eggs\" and such by swimming into or bouncing various abstract objects around, but beyond pointing your head forward and running into things there's not much to the gameplay. There's an upgrade system which seems to initially be explained as way more complex than it actually is, with the option to upgrade your health or make you go faster (along with a third additional stat I don't remember at this time.)\n\nIt's a relaxing game but it looks very simplistic and the gameplay of just swimming along pretty bland, repetitive environments gets old very quickly. I got my fill of the game pretty quickly and have no interest in playing any more of it. If you're really into science or microbiology and / or just looking for a simple, relaxed pace game then maybe give it a try but I think there are many other better games to choose from around its pricepoint.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503272019, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503272157, "recommendationid": "34384425", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515080", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499860994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1363, "steamid": "76561198083610274", "num_games_owned": 89}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I was thinking for a while, spent some time on this game, gave chances, and finally i came to my final conclusion.\n\nThe reason why i am not recommending this game is because mainly, you'll be facing challanges where there is no way of avoiding/skipping it. There are some places where you will get tied up (For example the challanage where you have to cross the road avoiding spikes which tides/force or whatever is pushing you towards it, making you to fall into spikes and thus you will have to start all over again.) And worst part of all, if you do end up in spikes, there will be no check points or a way to get back to that same place where you failed. You'll have to spend hours and hours into endless agony trying to pass that challange. I personally passed them and know how to do it. But it takes time till you'll get the hang of the control and pass the challange.\n\nAfter all that struggle of mine i gave soo many chances that i have lost the count. I wanted to enjoy this game and like it, but sadly the reality bested me. I would liked the game if it had some minor changes but i guess thats not gonna be the case so....\n\nWhile playing i was hoping i will see different... sparkle evolution. By that i mean literally becoming something else rather than being a long worm. Unlike Sparkle 2. it was abit different, but this time all 3 of them are just one long worms or how would you call em... Sausages.\n\nIn conclusion: If you are patient type, can tolerate the struggle, have spare time like i do or.. did, then this game might be for you but if you dont want to torture yourself, dont buy it. I mean it. Or do if you're ready to test or lose your sanity.
