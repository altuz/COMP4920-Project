The CONCEPT of the story is very cool.\n\nAll that said, I am kind of offended as to how little research the developers did into the actual Coast Guard. I was in the Coast Guard. Its nothing like this. This is more like the story of the most well funded, die hard auxilarists the world has ever known.\n\nAlso special mention has to be given to the script and voice acting. I think the developers voiced this themselves in their house and had to keep their voice down because the kids were asleep or something. It's \"Jill Sandwich\" bad.\n\nAll that said, I'm enjoying the game and am impressed with the branching storylines (complete bullshit as some of them are) So this gets a tentative thumbs up, only if it is on sale.\n\nIf someone took this and threw a heapload more time and money towards it, we would have an exceptional gem\n\nSemper Paratus", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445565796, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445603375, "recommendationid": "18633059", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613305", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446440384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 525, "steamid": "76561198054449144", "num_games_owned": 112}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game was awesome, I loved the gameplay and the story. \n\nYou have an option of a gun the entire game, I never used one.\nI was stuck on two parts for probably an hour each, so not including that, I don't really think 19$ is worth 7hrs of gameplay.\n\nI wish the game was longer and had more to it, thought it was going to be a heavy simulatiton game but it is alot more of an investigation/puzzle game.\n\nPros: Great idea, great story, fun gameplay\nCons: Short story, don't actually use a gun when its in the manual, glitchy at some points, more of just an investigation game than driving boats", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445554437, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445559115, "recommendationid": "18631412", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525791", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446073824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 47, "steamid": "76561197970695975", "num_games_owned": 226}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Around an hour I spent on the first mission, the ghost ship. No denying I enjoyed the majority of it. The game has real potential, and the different elements mixed together do work very well - sure, the first person sequences are rough and require work, and there's bugs galore, but there's the essence of a great game in here.\n\nUnfortunately the simple lack of a basic save system meaning you pretty much lose everything once you stop playing unless you're lucky enough that you passed a (unidentifiable) checkpoint means the game is basically alpha and not fit for public release.\n\nDoors which don't actually work properly, to interface elements which simple haven't been playtested properly, this is a game in early development which has evidently been released in borderline alpha state.\n\nShame really, it really is a good game underneath the hood, but unfortunately it's rather broken and stops you enjoying it as much as you'd want to.\n\nPolish it more and this is a definite yes, but as it stands it's just too rough to justify the cost - if it had been early access I'd have been infinitely more forgiving.\n\nCome back when you've done more work on the game, fellas.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446137607, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446137607, "recommendationid": "18745103", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517626", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478176781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 978, "steamid": "76561198029846902", "num_games_owned": 221}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "There are some games which move your spirit to tears.
