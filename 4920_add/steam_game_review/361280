Gets really boring, really fast. \n\nI like the whole vibe of the game but the sense of progress isn't really all that strong in the game.  Sure you can upgrade your buildings which helps that along a little bit.  The act of bidding on land, once you figure out why you should care about one plot of land over another is interesting and could of been matured.\n\nI would of enjoyed a little more interaction with the NPC you drill against.\n\nIt's a lot of fun at first but it very quickly turns into to just these things. \n- watching your money\n- watching your time\n- watching how much oil you have stored up\n- watching how much oil you have left in the ground\n- watching the current price of oil\n- wandering why you're not jerking off to something.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505013067, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505013067, "recommendationid": "34851998", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497650", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 890, "total_reviews": 990, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 100}}
