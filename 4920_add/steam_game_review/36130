However, the port to Steam has caused a lot of problems. First off, the games don't even have a basic resolution setting, so you can pick between a full screen where the mouse disappears, or a windowed screen that is way too small too see anything. Odyssey especially has problems with rendering the mouse after a few minutes of gameplay.\n\nIf you're picking up this game because you want to try it, I can't recommend it either. Caravans is the worst game of the series as the new travel system was not fun at all. Odyssey is one of the best as it has all the quality of life changes that the series picked up along the way, along with the humor the series is known for. However, with the mouse problem it's basically unplayable."}]}
