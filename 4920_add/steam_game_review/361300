It looks and feels nice animation-wise. But the 3 dimensional aspect is terribly executed, enemies move around like they're seeing the game in 3d and can hit you diagonally, while you have to line yourself up within the pixel to properly connect to a target or pick something up.\n\nAll of this can be mitigated by changing up your playstyle or trying again, however where the shit shines in this game, is when they decide to mix up the beat-em up mechanics and force you to change up combat, things like constantly holding on to a walkie-talkie or having to constantly hit the enemy in the back, but also be lined up so that they run into a wall once you've hit them enough and then of course on top of that have your coin ready to see if it lands on the side that means you won't be stunned and forced to take a hit, which is either out of your control or possible to negate, however the game does nothing to communicate, it's controller breaking trial and error for you.

The visuals are appealing to me, the character designs are well done, and the overall atmosphere was executed nicely. Everything else is terrible.\n\nAll 4 characters play exactly the same; zero variation besides different animations for certain moves. The only other difference is the stats for each character. You have a balanced guy, a fast girl, a strong guy, and a whatever guy. They can't do anything the others can't. \n\nCombat is boring. You have punch, a launch combo (which can only be followed up with a single air attack or an air throw, that's it), a move that sends enemies flying backwards, a standing grab, and attacking downed enemies (which leaves you wide open to get attacked by other enemies). No special attacks, no command moves...nothing. Just boring uninspired movesets.\n\nWorst of all is the level design. Each level has some kind of gimmick that makes it a chore to get through. Rats that jump on you which stuns you for a bit or trains that come from the top or bottom of the screen; to name a couple. Enemies are easy to handle at first but then they get annoying later on. They get guns to shoot at you from afar (which does crazy damage to you), slide kick enemies, and ones that block your attacks. The game likes to throw lots and lots of baddies your way so they can gang up on you and beat you up. If you want to play with others, the game shoves even more enemies on-screen because the developers don't understand how to properly balance their game. \n\nMy friends and I gave it one last chance a while back and then decided to never play it again.

(Ohhh, the soundtrack.) But the gameplay doesn't feel right. There's very little depth perception, so when you think you're about to punch an enemy in the face it misses them and then they knock you down.\nEnemies also have the habit of attacking right after one another, giving very little chance for the player to avoid getting hit even on lower difficulties. There's also no online coop, which I think was a missed oppertunity with the dealer edition. The dealer edition gives you an extra copy of the game and the fact that whoever you give it to can't play with you online kinda defeats the point of having an extra copy. Wouldn't it be better if you got the dealer edition, then give your friend the extra copy so that you can play online? Right now there's only local coop, which I like, but the fact that it's ONLY local coop seems like a bad design desicion.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506869414, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506869414, "recommendationid": "35384296", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500421", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482725067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 135, "steamid": "76561198215297341", "num_games_owned": 66}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The music, gore, visuals, and the concept are really good.
