However, it's simply unfinished, even after leaving early access.\nI understand that it's only 5 dollars, but a repetetive set of challenges, options that keep reseting by themselves and a deathmatch with bots that are LAUGHABLE even at hard is not worth 5 dollars.\nIf it had online multiplayer then maybe it would even be worth 10 bucks, but as it stands right now, it's a waste of money and will just rot in your library.
