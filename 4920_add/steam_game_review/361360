This game is actually pretty lengthy and it is a tough game to finish. Well it is not that punishing but the puzzles on this game are a little bit tough. This game not only brought up some nostalgic joy inside me but it also scared the heck out of me (Yes this game has jumpscares if you are wondering about that). \n\nAll in all, this game is pretty nostalgic and awesome! I highly recommend playing this game if you want to relive your childhood from reading those classic Goosebumps books! Also I recommend getting this game while heavily discounted. :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501722939, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501722939, "recommendationid": "33982725", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507995", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 46, "total_reviews": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
