You do not have the ability to build a base and produce units, however the units you receive mostly get multiple tasks or actions they can perform.\n\n[b] Gameplay & Story: 5/10 [/b]\nThe story is somewhat adapted from WW1 history books. There are some details that would not fit, but if you dont care for historical details, then it wont disturb you. The company is split into different factions, each faction have multiple missions, that dont depend on each other besides that you have to finish one to be able to play the second. Besides that, there is no connection (like which units get transfered to next missions / map; or actions having influence on following missions; etc.). There are some videos showing some of WW1 footage, it is not connected to the story either and is just to feed you some eye candy. The missions have mostly different touch, but sadly are really repetetive in itself - take a point & hold a point.\n\n[b] Combat & Challenge : 4/10 [/b]\nThe combat in WW1 is simple and in most campaign missions no serious tactic is needed. The armored units go first if the enemy has soldiers and heavy MGs and soldiers should go first if enemy has anti-tank weapons waiting. Basically this is enough to progress in this game on hard more. Fire fights do mostly take some time, but luckily there is a speed up (and slow down) function that you activate by pressing + or - respectively. \n\n[b] Graphic & Interface : 3/10 [/b]\nThe game was released more than 10 years ago, so the graphic are quite dated. The landscapes do look fitting, but are mostly repetetive. The units are not that distinguishable as one would wish them to be - the soldiers are mostly with squads while the tanks and armored vehicles dont have any details. The interface is old and clunky, offering not many choices. Menu sometimes offers duplicate settings, ingame you have small icons that you have to read first to be able to know which order performs which action. Sadly with a higher resolution the text gets small, so its not making the interface look any better.\n\n[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 3/10 [/b]\nThe progress is simple and linear - finish one objective, you will be given the next one. Finish all objectives on a mission, you will be given then next one. If it is compared to more modern strategy games that do actually leave you choice how to finish a mission or give you multiple optional objectives to change the course of the battles, WW1 definetely lacks in terms of progress. Few points are given for the \"rank\" progression that you receive after completing missions. Depending on how good you performed, you will receive points. Since there are no mini-games or other activities in WW1 besides missions, this rating sub-point is not taken into consideration.\n\n[b] Audio & Immersion : 4/10 [/b]\nThe videos do help the immersion a bit at the start, but sadly it gets broken by the clunky main menu interface and ingame speed. You do not really feel immersed into World War 1 scenarios, instead it feels more like boring history lessons where your teacher is giving you a text to read and time to comprehend the actions performed. The audio in WW1 does not help the immersion much, but you get some voices in languages of different factions. The sound does its purpose - you know when someone is shooting and mostly based on the sound what type of unit. The music is not something remarkable overall.\n\n[b] Side-Notes [/b]\n[list]\n[*]This game is single player only.\n[*]This game contains no achievements, nor ingame neither steam.\n[*]This game offers none to minimal replayability. If you played it once, you will most likely never touch this game again.\n[*]This game is fairly short, if you speed up the combat regularly.\n[*]This game is often sold in bundles or being discounted.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Summary [/b]\nIf you do enjoy Blitzkrieg or older C&C games, if you like seperated missions with clear tasks and limited amount of units to perform your tasks, this old strategy game might be for you. \n\n\nI hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game.
