ASTRONEER, a unique space exploration game where you can build, collect and even reshape the terrain itself. The game has a lot of potential and it might lead to really creative plays.\n\nPersonally, I love this game. The art style is gorgeous and the sound is quite good BUT there is something that you should consider. The game is still in pre-alpha and that my friend, spells bugs and most importantly, [b][i]lack of content[/i][/b].\n\nIf you take a look at my play time, you can see that I've only played the game for 10 hours and in that 10 hours, I've unlocked pretty much all of the content. So does that mean ATSRONEER is a bad game? No, of course not.\n\nAs I said, this game is still in pre-alpha so there is going to be a lot more content in the future. A person posted a question on the Steam community page and on Reddit that lead to Joe, System Era's comms guy. The last paragraph of his reply was this:\n\n[quote=Joe]\nWe also know that we are up against a clock. (This is the first place I am saying this but f#k it) Our next update (not this week's ;) ) is going to introduce completely new game mechanics and content, as will every one after that going forward. I am super excited. Our gamble is paying off, and now the game will be in a much better state to keep going for a long long time.\n[/quote]\n\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Astroneer/comments/6zuhrw/whats_up_with_negative_reviews/]^Source[/url]\n\nSo, the devs are not just sitting there taking your money for nothing. There hasn't been huge new content in the past months precisely because they don't want to release anything until there's a good base for it all to sit on. Once that base (which includes Terrain 2.0, Research 2.0, Modularity, etc) is securely in place, the new content will start to flow again.\n\nAlrighty.
