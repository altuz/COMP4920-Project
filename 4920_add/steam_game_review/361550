Seriously the end of the game builds a nice climatic feel that something is about to happened and you are about to figure out something or be presented with smothing earth shattering. However the game just kind of ends into a movie clip that leaves you guess as to what actually happened.\n\nI feel like this game was made by someone who wanted to write a book, write a song, film a music video, film a movie, and make a video game. All of that while trying to be an artist. The strong points in this game being the art and the story.\n\nSeriously ther story was great and would make a fantastic book but as far as google is concerned as book was never done.\n\nIt isnt that this game was left unfinished. It isnt that this game needed mroe time. It is that this game tried to do to much at the same time.\n\nAll of the above is without addressing the puzzles which were simple. The puzzles were built more like a extremely basic. Some of the puzzles were even just mini games that were more annoying to play through. Filler almost. I got that they were more about adding to the story. According to the story though they should have been fun.\n\nI also encoutered multiple glitches and errors on windows 10 when I first picked up this game. I found after trial and error that this game does not have support for high resolutions. So if you are running into graphical errors or UI issues. Lowering the games resolution settings.\n\nIf you only play myst like games. You will enjoy this game when you get past the graphical glicthes. Just dont expect this game to be hard. Also expect a lack of proper ending.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502045152, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502045152, "recommendationid": "34066325", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519201", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500158505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 342, "steamid": "76561198080185543", "num_games_owned": 35}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game has it's good and bad moments. The story telling and world are setup really nice. Both of these kept me going through the bad voice acting and annoying, unneccecary, block mini games. The graphics are nice, altough it looked like they didn't have enough money to fix the clouds, which look weirdly off compared to the rest of the surroundings. \n\nThe reason why I don't recommend this game is because the ending is terrible. Some open questions in the end is fine, but this ending didn't solve anything. It is like the devs just didn't know how to end the story, cut the game at a point just before the ending and put some random cutscene instead.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500159718, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500159718, "recommendationid": "33571846", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506234", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499630364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 364, "steamid": "76561197989969436", "num_games_owned": 342}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is ridiculously short and there's zero replay value. The only reason I got 6 hours of playtime was because of all the times the character got stuck somewhere or was unable to pick up objects for some reason. There's a story and it's kind of interesting, but it never takes off. The mini-games are TERRIBLY boring, but fortunately skippable.\n\nThis game is also very poorly optimized.

There are much better things to waste your time on.\n\nThis game is not worth a full-blown review. Let me do a breakdown of those 7 hours instead so you can understand why:\n\n- 5 hours: searching for objects in a messy environment (half an hour of which was spent on the EXACT SAME actions of gettng up the lift, jumping a gap, clipping through the other end, falling and repeating)\n- 20 minutes: listening to dialogue\n- 20 minutes: googling the location of objects\n- 30 minutes: seeing how far you can go on the game's empty map\n- 10 minutes: seeing an infinitely looping loading screen upon reaching the the edge\n- 50 minutes: playing the game's decent cube-based puzzles\n\nSo the 50 minutes of the game's cube puzzles I consider to be sort of ok-ish (dunno what the hate is all about - they are an interesting idea, play well, I liked them), the minigame is fine. Voiceacting is painfully unprofessional, the only well-acted character is the tram driver, and ultimately a game that wastes one's time as much as this one does is not worth one's time. It takes a great deal of frustration and lack of decent pacing to make me ragequit the game entirely. So far there have been only 2. That this is one of them is saying a lot.\n\nIf you can get the soundtrack alone, get it.
