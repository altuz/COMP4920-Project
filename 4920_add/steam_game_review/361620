I'd suggest playing your own music in the background for the time being. It takes awhile to explain itself, but have patience, as it becomes fairly complicated later on.\n\nGames like these are valuable in so many ways. I had a concussion last year; Mountain was the only game I really had that was laid-back enough for me to play without having a headache. This game fills that same niche.

At 5 bucks, it looked cool, so I took a chance.  I have played up to 15/84 in the \"Journey\" and most of it is trivial tutorial stuff, but some of it is very poorly presented and it takes way too long to figure out what you are supposed to do, even though it should be easy.  \n\nRight now, I can't recommend this game.  But with some clean up, properly written tutorial, and better controls (or option to set key bindings), it could be interesting.  I just don't have the patience to play it further while it is so clunky.\n\nThe \"focus\" level, for example, was very confusingly presented.  Without zoom out or pan screen (which come later in the tutorial), you are bound to lose track of where the cursor is in relation to the \"maze\" and you will never figure out where you are.  It also wasn't explained why the draw tool did not start working until you got the cursor into the yellow box.  I just figured that out with trial and error.\n\nOne of the problems is all the poor English in the tutorial.  Whoever wrote this obviously has a very poor grasp of the English language, and the phrasing is very awkward.  He needs some help from a good English writer.\n\nNow for a few nitpicks.  The key bindings are horrible.  The arrow keys rotate in 3D space, but the num-pad arrow keys pan the screen.  Using the num pad just sucks.  Also, the screen pan is WAY too fast.  WASD should rotate in space, right click-and-hold should pan screen, and the mouse zoom should zoom in and out (currently done with Z and X).   Also, the R key is meant to reset all transforms, but it does not reset the zoom transform.  \n\nOh, I almost forgot.  You may wonder, what is the objective in this game?  What is the goal?  It's not that clear cut.  It's stuff like \"connect these two things in space using the tools I gave.\"  It's usually not as simple as drawing a line because there are built in physics.  For example, a cursor will move on it's own in the screen.  You can select \"draw\" and when you hold down the left mouse button, that cursor will draw.  However, you don't control the cursor.  It has it's own momentum and is simply \"attracted\" to wherever your mouse cursor happens to be when you hold down the left click button.  If the cursor gains a lot of momentum in one direction and you move your mouse pointer in the opposite, it will take a lot of time to reverse the momentum.  So you have to deal with those physical problems.  There is more to it than that, but that gives you an idea.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432590285, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432590353, "recommendationid": "16003715", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545554", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481691750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 138, "steamid": "76561198075677366", "num_games_owned": 41}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Love love love the calming factor and little quotes that make ya feel like you did a good job when in reality it was simply. This game really takes the geometry factor and pushes into another dimension, really. I recommend this discounted and at full price not only to show the creator he did a good job and to support him, but because we need more games like this. So in my opinion it so far has been one of the best \"calming\" games there is in the genre if that genre really exists.
