Game have graphics are comparable to let's say Quake 3 (dont get me wrong - they are very nice looking and artsy) but performance is simply AWFUL. On Arma 3 or Pallandins I'm able to get 60fps on average-high settings, but on this game im unable to get 30fps at MINIMUM settings.\n\nPLEASE OPTIMIZE THIS GAME. It should run at 120FPS on Pentium 3 as graphics are super simple.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485207776, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487125235, "recommendationid": "29450545", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485437", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471744892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 15, "steamid": "76561198320641350", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It was extremely glitchy", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488069951, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488069951, "recommendationid": "30182181", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485110412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 49, "steamid": "76561198149903142", "num_games_owned": 63}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Its a short but fun game and I recomend it and its message", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485110450, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485110450, "recommendationid": "29428311", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498734282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 308, "steamid": "76561198088411502", "num_games_owned": 56}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is very nice.\nit's a parkour simulator.
