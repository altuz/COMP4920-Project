Although this title can be rather difficult it offers many hours of intense combat. Whether it be fighting through swarms of enemy starfighters, helping to ambush Imperial convoys or daring rescue and escort missions. You won't be disappointed in picking up this classic which, surprisingly, has aged very well.\n\nThe graphics are antiquated but due to the nature of the game you typically won't even notice awkward textures at close range to other ships and static objects. Voice acting is a low point as well but nothing that cannot be overlooked when you're neck deep in the action. A controller or joystick is needed to play this game as well as a bit of quick thinking as you will need to periodically adjust your ship's power levels to get an edge over your competition.\n\nFeatures of note include a 'combat simulator' where you may create your own rudimentary battles and fly one of dozens of available ships alone or with a few friends through IP connections. There is also a training room where you may test your skills in various 'races' where crack shots are needed to disable obstacles.\n\nAll in all this is a solid title which holds a special place in many a gamer. For the $9.99 price tag as of the time of this review it's well worth the investment and I highly recommend it for players new or old.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501974727, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501974727, "recommendationid": "34048444", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 81, "total_reviews": 103, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 22}}
