Great single player campaign as well. The steam version seems to have issues running on windows 10, however the GOG.com version works perfectly. Returned this and bought it on GOG.\n\nConsidering the 3d hardware mode wont work on new hardware, the graphics actually look good. Everything looks legit, and the soundtrack is 110% legit.\n\nThis was one of the games I obsessed over as a kid growing up. Played the original floppy disk version of X-wing on my 386 and even 486 for years until this game out and the family treated ourselves to a new IBM Aptiva pentium 120mhz system with a whopping 32 megs of RAM. This game was one of the first to be installed and stayed on that machine right up until its death.\n\nSo for all you poor suckers who we're born in the 90's and 2000's, jerking yourselves to the modern offerings of such games... Do yourselves a favour and get the original X-wing series remakes from 1997/98. Play them, enjoy them. Experience the difference between the hand holding arcade feel of todays flight sims vs the gritty sims of yester year.\n\n\nEnjoy ;)\n\n10/10, would go back to grade 6 again lol.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495119878, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495120199, "recommendationid": "31823180", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514191", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499978751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 984, "steamid": "76561197969000107", "num_games_owned": 47}, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I can't see anything when I play the game... \n\nToo many tears of joy in my eyes.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498915925, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498915925, "recommendationid": "33083887", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512525", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448257169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 333, "steamid": "76561197999423205", "num_games_owned": 258}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Dude, buy this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495870818, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495870818, "recommendationid": "31990743", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502634", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 55, "total_reviews": 71, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 16}}
