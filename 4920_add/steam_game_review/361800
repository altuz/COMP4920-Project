We started the game, and the tutorial quickly told us to chop down some trees.  We were instantly yelled at by several people in game for \"not replanting the trees.\"  You can replant trees?  The game said nothing about replanting.  We were told we were going to be reporting for being bots (which we clearly answered back that we were not), and proceeded to be stalked by several people in game while we were trying to learn what was going on.  \n\nEventually, after some time, we managed to finish the tutorial only to find out that our own self-made guild tree (your own Tree of Life) would EXPIRE after 6 days if you didn't pay in-game funds for \"rent.\"  What does that mean?  Did that mean all of our in game assets would suddenly become public if we didn't log in enough to pay the rent?\n\nOVERALL...\nIt seems like the game could be good, but it has a built-in system designed to force you to have to play in order to keep any progress you made.  There is a series of micro transactions which can increase your travelling speed and/or inventory slots, which is annoying.  Money is required to keep your guild alive, but takes up actual inventory space...  The tutorial is HORRIBLE...  Badly worded...  occassional horrible misspellings (\"survey\" is not spelled \"suvery\").  Swimming is slower than just jumping across the water's surface...    Many resources seem to be more limited than they should be, and as a result, players tend to yell at each other for doing things the game tries to tell you to do.

However, that's only how the game advertises itself. In reality, it is a game caters and rewards hardcore players who join large groups while inadvertently punishing guilds in small numbers (3 or fewer). The game revolves around constant deterioration of equipment and supplies, in addition to a mandatory tax that is paid weekly in real time, which makes it too time consuming for solo/duo players to keep up.\n\nThe game provides 21 skills (called masteries) to gain up to 50 levels in, while allowing 320 total levels spread between economic (living) and combat. This means you can max out 6 skills only and combat will require you to level 2-3 of these skills, leaving you 3-4 economic skills to choose to max out. While this sounds like a great thing to encourage interaction and a living community, it means soloing/duoing is essentially impossible. Arrow/Cannon towers require carpentry to build and blacksmithing/tinkering to maintain. Your armour and weapons will require blacksmithing, tailoring, and tinkering. Those skills alone means solo players will have zero combat skills if they wish to build their base, and that means they can not kill the enemies required to get the materials.\n\nWeapons and armor constantly break, which is a good thing to keep the economy moving. However, because they break so often and quickly, you will likely go through 2-3 weapons in the process of gathering materials to make another 5, not including any hits you take to your armor and bags. Armor is difficult to maintain and you usually can only afford to maintain the lower level suits, and sometimes not even those. As you level up to higher levels, you will be able to maintain them  better and longer, but will still find yourself farming 5-6 hours to counter maintenance in order to have 2 hours of actual fun playtime.\n\nThere are three factions that you choose from when making your character. These factions can attack other factions, but can't attack their own. There is a faction chat in game, but even on the American server it is usually dominated by French or Chinese and getting a response to a question or discussion in English is actually a very rare thing. If you're a small guild or group, don't expect to  rely on help from others in Faction chat as they likely will not understand you, or you will not understand them.\n\nThe game has a heavy advantage to those who are willing to pay for in-game items in the premium store. $25 will get you a mount that you never need to maintain other than feed. You can get a mount in game, however it will not have the built-in light source that premium mounts come with and will die after a set number of uses, forcing you to gather materials for another one. If you're not a rancher player, then you will never make your own mounts. Bags can be purchased for $10-15 and provide extra inventory space that doesn't break. Bags crafted in game will degrade just like armor and weapons. What makes this dangerous is if one breaks while holding items, all of the items spill out. This is not a concern for the player who pays real cash.\n\nOverall, Tree of Life is not a game I can recommend. I have put in a great number of hours hoping the game would get better as many online games do.

I have multiple accounts for this game so I have more hours between accounts. But let's start with the people bashing this game with negative reviews. Firstly people complain about their bases being destroyed by enemy factions. In the novice area (Noob Zone) your base will not be destroyed unless it's a BIG raid. There are guards that walk around in the novice area that protect your loot and base. But if you are outside the novice area there are no guards out there so it's the wild. DO NOT move out there without being near allied factions. It's like Rust you will be raided if you are not online or don't have many members in your guild. The best choice is to group up and build next to other guilds in your faction out of the novice area. And yes this game really isn't a solo man game you have skills that you need to level and you only can max out 6 skills. That's why I bought multiple accounts so I can do more and not rely on guildmates that are offline. And also when you are in the noob area and you only have stakes as walls you will get raided by an enemy of one person depeding where you place your base if there are guards near by. Just be smart about it and don't play dumb like the people that gave negative reviews.

Then I came back and played it for 10h this week after its official launch.\nFrankly, I was quite sold by its trailer. Crafting, Practice-based EXP, Great Graphics. If you look at how many hours I spent on Factorio and Terraria, you will see why I was excited about this game. \"3D TERRARIA! Combined with RF Online Skill system\" \nSandbox Crafting and Building with friends. That is what the trailer and game description promised.\nI played during Early Access, Loved the graphics. Enjoyed the fact that I am (very slowly) putting together a base, building by building. Saw the potential in the game. Hated the chore I have to go through to get anything and everything done. I was very disappointed and since it is Early Access, I was hopeful. \nWhen it was officially launched, I came back to see how the finished product is like. It is still the same. Clumsy, unintuitive UI. Tedious chore of building anything. \n\nThis is not a game crafters and builders will like. \n\nTL;DR\n*Crafting UI is clumsy, unnecessarily complex and unintuitive.\n*Building is monotonous, tedious and boring.\nFallout 4 is a better base building game than this. Do I need to say more?\n\nLong version\nMinor\n- The UI was clumsy. Very clumsy. The only way to use items in your backpack is to equip it to your quickslot then select it then RMB. Can you imagine in real life, you are thirsty and decide to drink water from a bottle in your backpack. You take the bottle from your backpack and put it in your Batman belt pouch and only then you can drink and put it back to the Batman belt pouch. Then you keep it back in the backpack. Realistic? Yes. Unnecessarily tedious? You decide after doing it 50 times. \n- Interact with almost everything using RMB is creative. I like that. But why do you have the RMB menu for food when the only option ever is to eat it?\n- Leveling up takes very long and gets longer. \n\nCRAFTING\n\nCrafting UI is non-intuitive and very difficult to use. This is the part that annoys me the most. Especially when crafting is a major part of the game. If you want to craft Raw Wood at a Workbench, just follow the following simple steps. \n\n1.Walk up to the workbench, RMB and select Interact. Look for the recipe for Raw Wood from a list of all recipes highlighted red. They are red even though you have all the required materials with you. They are highlighted red because the required materials are not in the workbench and it doesn't matter to the workbench if they are on you. Oh, as you get better at crafting the list will get longer. Did I mention that all the recipes are highlighted red for no good reason other than the workbench is empty?\n2. Look at your backpack for the items required as stated in the recipe. If you do not have enough, go and get it now and then return to the beginning of Step 1. Put all the required items into the workbench.\n3. Look through the list again to find the recipe. It is highlighted green now. How nice. Click on the recipe name and boom. You have one Raw Wood. Click 7 more times if you need 8 Raw Wood. If you run out of materials along the way, go and get it now and then return to the beginning of Step 1. \n4. Rejoice in the crafting experience. The crafting UI is specially designed to be extra tedious and unintuitive and unhelpful as possible to let the user enjoy the thrill of being able to craft something despite all that. What a nice sandbox crafting game. \n\nBUILDING\n\nBuildings are SUPER tedious to build. I have a feeling that this is specifically designed this way to prevent players from reaching endgame. Because there is no endgame. There is nothing to do when your skills are all maxed and your base is nice and big, other than trying to destroy another guild's base (which involves a lot of running around since everyone is out of stamina.) Please follow the following steps to build one wall section. I repeat one wall section. Not that kind of wall in AoE where the game will give you walls in between when you put down 2 columns. You need 20 wall columns if you want to build a wall 20 squares long. Let's do just one together, shall we? Then you can repeat 19 times by yourself for the North wall. You can work on the other 3 walls the rest of this week. \n\n1. Get a wall upgrade pack at a Drawing Table and carry it to the position you want (at a snail pace. The reason why a piece of building plan is so heavy escapes me. But it is alright. Bases are specifically designed to take up as little space as possible. This means the wall is not far from your Drawing Table. And your vaults) and unpack it. Make doubly sure that it is in the correct position. \n2. You have just laid the plans on the floor. You wall project has just started! Let's see what we need.\n3. Rock and Log. Hmm... They are not in your backpack. That's right! They are not. These items are dropped when you mine big rocks and chop trees respectively. You carry them at a snail pace, one at a time back to your wall project, which can take 2 mins at a time because big rocks and trees don't like to spawn near your base. \n4. (15mins later) You have completed moving the rocks and logs. Good job! Now you just need to add Firewood, Stone etc to the wall. We have them in our backpack. Move the firewood to your quickslot, RMB and put firewood into wall project. Move firewood out of your quickslot, move the stone to your quickslot, RMB and put the stone into the wall project. You get the idea. Repeat as required for other materials.\n5. For higher level buildings there will be a stage 3 for the building. Not for this wall section! We have our wall! Completed!

I guess its just not thier cup of tea. They should have done some research before they buy something. \nI like this game because its what I'm looking for. \n\nThe only problem is that it relies heavily on having a guild and a group of friends you can play with, if you want to advance or make a huge progess. Its kinda a mini version of the mmorpg game Albion. You really need to be on and need to be in a guild. \n\nPlus the idea of paying the tax to your tree to update the expiry date is good idea, because it help declog the traffic in the game and reset the space if people leave for like 15 to 30 days and doesn't even log in once. Imagine , if you joined the game and there's no space for you to build and these old building no one been using for months or years just laying there, plus it's pretty easy to earn money 2 silver isn't that much. \n\nIn this game you can become whatever role you like. Even thieves , so People complaining about robbery and stuff well what do you expect ? \n\n the graphic, its simple and its a game that feels casual and can feel competitve, depend how you go about in the game. \n\nAgain you can play by yourself but it really is heavily relied on Guild / group of people or friends that you need to play with to actually advance really far. Just like Albion. \n\nTrue there's a grinding process, but that's almost what you hear in alot of Crafting / bulding  , survival type of games. Those that plays alot of crafting survival and crafting game should be familiar or shouldn't be complaining because its not as bad as the other games thats in steam and the price is reasonable. \n\nTo me this game is chill, casual game where i can relax and chat , play with friends. \n\nAlso they are dtill updating quite frequently and adding some stuff and changes  so thats a plus. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506125735, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506125735, "recommendationid": "35140473", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506082", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1158, "total_reviews": 1695, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 537}}
