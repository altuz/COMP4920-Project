In one mode of the game you need to destroy three or more of the same coloured shape to get your defensive line to move back. In another, you have to time your shots and destroy ships in rapid succession  to get it to recede. \n\nThis mechanic is really cool and nifty and makes the game fun to play.

NOPE, unless you are really an expert on predecting movements and on what gememy to shoot since it keeeps goin forward.\nThe match three mode throws that to the window and makes it slightly better, as the name says, it consits of shooting 3 gememys of the same color to avoid the barrier to keep goin forward. The thing with this mode is that it keeps the air flowing since sometimes you might have 2 of the same color, lets say blue and the incoming ones are only reds and greens. So you need to sacrifice 3 shoots just so you need to continue and prevent dying. \nI might make it sound as a boring game, but trust me when you actually play the game.
