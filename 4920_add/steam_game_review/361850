I thought they did a better job with the animations than most of these types of games I've played to date. I especially liked the more subtle animations in the still scenes (and even a few in the hidden object puzzles). I found the art in certain scenes to be quite beautiful. Although I don't recall seeing anything new introduced, the gameplay, story, and voice acting were good and there's plenty of game. The hidden object puzzles' difficulty was challenging without being annoyingly difficult and the mini games, although standard fare, were presented nicely.\n\nI wish all P&C/HOG's were at least as good as this one. There are many out there by much more popular developers/publishers that aren't nearly as good. This is the first of this type of game I'm recommending without qualification as I enjoyed it more than most. Played well for me on Linux Mint 18 (Wine/PlayOnLinux).\n\nPS I almost exclusively play offline. I typically only play online long enough for Steam to allow me to write a review.

Decent enough story line, good graphics, got a good 4 hours of play out of it. \n\nOnly issues I had with the game were: \nA lot of the puzzles that required combinations could have beeen guessed easily, but the game wouldn't accept the code and let you progress until you actually found the combination written somewhere. I realise this is to force the player to play the story in order... it's just incredibly frustrating when the \"hero\" finds it impossbile to \"solve\" a code with less than 50 possible combinations...\n\nAlso, the game glitched on the skull puzzle and wouldn't actually let me move the skulls.

With nice graphics. \nOne thing is new : reverse HOS where you don't get a list of objects to find but you get a set of objects that you have to put back in the scene at the place they're supposed to be. It's not bad. Not only for the change it brings but also because it encourages using imagination. There is a mix of classic HOS and reverse HOS. \nAs many HOS games the storyline isn't interesting, nor plausible (especially when you end up [spoiler] moving a huge boulder blocking an entry with some kind of stick and a hammer ! [/spoiler] I know it's a game but come on! it's not realistic at all! at least it made me laugh). Weird things are happening, quickly a dark atmosphere covers it up, with rain and thunder, strange beasts, evil and so on.. \nBut it's a HOS game and we're used to enormities in the genre.\nNevertheless puzzles are fine, ranging from easy to vaguely challenging but never tricky enough to go mad. Only once I had to compel myself not using the skip button. \nThe map is a goog thing to save useless back and forth throughout the game, it's some sort of useful shortcut since you'll often have to obtain an item here that you'll need to use there in order to open some chest or door and then go back to whatever other place. This map is your friend. \nI'd like to add that it's pleasant not having to watch all the cutscenes to get a 100% achievements. I thank the dev's for that. The story of this kind of games is rarely intriguing enough to incite you to immerse fully in it so I appreciated being able to skip them all !\n\nI recommend getting it while on sale because it's quite short to beat the main story + bonus chapter, including to get all the achievements.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505921606, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505922050, "recommendationid": "35086510", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499802431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 274, "steamid": "76561198277771100", "num_games_owned": 74}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is truly an excellent game.
