Lakeview is nothin' but bare-bones pixel graphics. However, if you have even an iota of imagination to fill in the grisly details that the game often mercifully omits, guess what?\n\nThis is easily one of the single most hinder-clenchingly, sick, twisted, and terrifying games ever made.\n\nIt's a work of macabre genius! This game goes places that no triple A title will ever dare. It's stuff that'd make Clive Barker blush. And the minimalistic visuals only help the horror, inviting your mind fill in all the gorey details. The well-placed musical stings perfectly accent the aural ambience that gives every part of this collection of micro-terror titles a constant sense of dread and suspense.\n\nMy only gripe is that the original flash game, which inspired this anthology, is not available in this set.\nIt's freely available on any number of sites, but its absence is still something of a bummer.\n\nFun-sized morbid morsels for your next spooky gaming binge of Haloween horrors.\nDig in.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505096787, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506835124, "recommendationid": "34875224", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504670661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2209, "steamid": "76561198212032571", "num_games_owned": 7}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I will admit, this is definitly one of the best games i have ever played.
