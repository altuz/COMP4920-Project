Zuma's Revenge is a very intriguing puzzle game that anyone can enjoy regardless of age or interests. This game is a puzzle game about blowing bubbles and matching 3 or more colors. Your goal is to fill a gauge located in the top of the screen while the balls roll closer into a skull's mouth. If the balls reach the skull, you've failed. Getting point bonuses helps fill the gauge faster. Once you fill the gauge, new balls stop rolling in, and you'll most likely finish the stage shortly after. Because there is so much to cover in this game, I'll review the game modes individually.\n\n[h1]Adventure Mode[/h1]\n\nZuma's Revenge offers a great adventure mode. The game starts out straightforward and simple, but it continues to get harder as you progress. The difficulty curve this game offers is done very well. As the game gets harder, the generated balls go from 4 colors to 5 up to 6 individual ball colors. Making matches becomes harder as you progress in the game. The bosses you fight along your adventure are really enjoyable.\n\n[h1]Challenge Mode[/h1]\n\nChallenge mode will add plenty of hours of enjoyment to your experience. Instead of filling a gauge in challenge mode, your goal is to score a certain amount of points in a limited amount of time. Multiplier powerups show up while you play, so aim to acquire those to increase your score. Taking on these challenges is not only challenging but really fun to play.\n\n[h1]Heroic Frog and Iron Frog Gauntlet[/h1]\n\nThese two challenges are both unlocked after completing adventure mode. Heroic Frog is a more difficult replay of adventure mode, and it will occupy you for plenty of time.\nIron Frog Gauntlet consists of 10 stages, each requiring a lot of skill and patience to beat. Play at your own risk!\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nBe sure to get Zuma's Revenge; it's a great value and only costs $4.99! You won't regret playing it!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498907842, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33079285", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004369903", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1499576002, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 384}, "timestamp_updated": 1499334351, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I played an earlier version of this in the mid 2000s, and I was very happy to see the newer version here on Steam.
