I haven't played through long enough to know whether this will ultimately affect the ending, but it gives me incentive to play again, and make choices to decimate my army to see what happens.\n\nFor those interested in romances, this game has several to offer of both genders.  \n\nThe biggest complaint I can give is that I would have liked to see more battle scenarios, and a little more time devoted to the romance interests.  This is just a personal desire to see more such things, and not really a complaint at the dev.\n\nThe only other minor complaint I have is that some of the CG art is a little rough, especially when compared to the game's character sprites.  The dev might have been going for a specific style in the CGs, but it felt a little out of place.\n\nA final sticking point might be the price.  At $24.99 (regular listed price), some people might think this is a little high, especially with no demo.  While I didn't mind paying that much, I can understand others finding it a sticking point.  \n\nHowever, if you are curious as to whether this might be something you want, there is a demo up at itch.io\nhttp://aqualuftgames.itch.io/queen-at-arms", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454601253, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454601253, "recommendationid": "20951434", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571583", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495645898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 789, "steamid": "76561198275705766", "num_games_owned": 78}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really like this game.
