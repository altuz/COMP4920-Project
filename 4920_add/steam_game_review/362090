It harkens back to older titles like those from the Shin Megami Tensei series and Dragon Warrior Monsters in particular in its collection, customization, and creation of monsters for use in your party. These creatures have a variety of abilities which can interact in fantastic ways. Having a max of six creatures with you at a time allows you to exploit these interactions and create a huge variety of strategies! \n\nWhere Siralim excels is its procedural content. Every level is randomly generated, with rewards and dangers increasing as you delve to deeper realms. This procedural content extends to a gameplay options that randomize creatures' abilities and the order in which you can obtain them. The random elements greatly enhance replayability.\n\nSiralim is easily recommended, but consider purchasing its sequal Siralim 2. It expands upon all areas of the original with additional content and a enhances the customizability and basic mechanics with some interesting new changes and additions. Siralim 2 also provides more narrative and a greater sense of progression if those appeal to you or prevented you from enjoying the original.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505787263, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505787263, "recommendationid": "35056452", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 111, "total_reviews": 122, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
