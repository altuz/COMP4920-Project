As it is at the moment you will need to have friends to play with locally otherwise you likely wont get much playtime out of it, it currently has very limited single player and no online multiplayer. Also I would reccommend you use a controller if you can as I'm not so sure about the keyboard support at this time. \n\nThe positives:\n\nThe current playable characters are awesome and fairly well balanced, plus the developer has stated that he has plans to add more and more characters as the game progresses.\n\nThe multiplayer is quite competitive and loads of fun, game modes such as 'capture the flag' and 'capture the point' aren't too common in RPG style games but they work extremely well here.\n\nThe art style and animation is very well done, pixel art isn't for everyone but this game does it well and if you give it a chance I'm sure you'll come to like it.\n\nA few things I noticed which need some attention: \n\nFirst up - ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, this is a big one, this is a great game which could really strive but in my opinion a game like this NEEDS online multiplayer otherwise it could potentially die off very early. If this game incorperates some sort of online matchmaking/lobby system where you can play with your friends and/or randoms it could really take off.\n\nNext up, the keyboard supports feels a bit weird, I almost immediately switched to controller. Giving access to the options so we can remap keys will mostly fix this I imagine however my biggest problem is that it just doesn't feel right, the menu scrolling can be laggy and sometimes pauses if you scroll too fast, i.e. you can't mash up or down to quickly select things because it will stop registering key presses or something. This isn't noticable while using a controller as far as I could tell.\n\nAnother thing that I noticed is the free play mode could do with a bit of work, I tried playing on level 1 and was just getting mauled and dying instantly as soon as I respawned because it seems like the monsters don't scale to your level or anything like that. Free play isn't a big focus of the game and you can set your level higher to make yourself stronger so this is a minor issue but more options such as difficulty or number of enemies couldn't hurt.\n\nHopefully I can improve this review over time but overall I'm really liking the game so far, I just hope that online multiplayer is implemented soon, the developer said he's open to it just as long as there is a demand, so get on it people, let him know you want it! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437722251, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1437722251, "recommendationid": "17200332", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503170", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441245662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 376, "steamid": "76561197998167880", "num_games_owned": 459}, "votes_funny": 16, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Dungeon League? more like Fungeon League.
