The reason that there's a pause while the heroes are moving through each room of your dungeon is because it gives the other players about 3 seconds to decide if they're going to interfere with your dungeon and play cards against you. Spell cards and certain rooms can only be played if certain conditions are met, so sometimes you need 3 seconds to realize your room can activate. So it's not a flaw of the port, it's an inherent rule in the gameplay.\n\nThat said, this port is not perfect. I have not experienced UI issues like others have mentioned, but I might also be less annoyed since I've played the card game and know my way around after a few runs with the AI.\n\nBottom line is - if you enjoy the physical card game then you will like it. If you're looking for a fast paced card game, this isn't it. You need to think through your choices, try to tailor your dungeon to attract certain heroes, mess with your opponents and try to stop them from scoring points, and try to setup combos and place rooms optimally.
