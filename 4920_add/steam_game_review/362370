It is very casual, fun, but still requires a bit of skill to play.\n\nthere are 4 modes:  free for all, team free for all, chase the rabbit, and invasion. \nIn my opinion invasion mode is the bread and butter of the game.  The objective is to fight waves of enemies and survive as long as you can.  As you advance higher in waves, the enemy count and difficulty gets higher as well.\n\nThe gameplay in my opinion is pretty solid, i use a xbox1 controller, you fly automatically, there is no acceleration or stop button.  The other button is to shoot.  The skill part comes into play here in that your bullets travel slow, so you have to predict where your enemy might end up at and shoot in that direction.  Or here is where the dog fight comes into play and you chase the enemy and shoot them from behind point blank-ish.  Both ways are viable.\n\nAnother interesting mechanic is that you can fly off screen and end up on the opposite side, for example: you fly towards the left of the screen and then you end up on the right side.  This brings in some tactical play because as you progress higher into the levels you will need to utilize this tactic.\n\nThere are occassional item drops as you play that grant you weapons and shields.  So this gives you some variety in gameplay.\n\nAs for cons, the gameplay is a bit slow for my tastes, but is kind of necessary for a game like this.  Would like it if there was an option to increase gameplay speed.  Not much in the variety of weapon drops either, I would love to see more.\n\nFrom a singleplayer standpoint it is a fun game, but can get boring, this is somewhat remedied with AI allies.  This game was really meant for multiplayer because I can see a lot of fun and excitment with friends.  \n\nAs for pricing, id say it is a bit high if youre playing by yourself, id wait for a future sale.  But for multiplayer it is definitely worth the price.\n\noverall game is very fun.

You are just a sitting duck flying around in circles.\nCould have custom controls, or controller support as it clearly says. But no.\nAlso how is it that a typical win 8 system with 4GB RAM cant handle this game unless it is on the lowest setting.\nAnd yet, Tomb Raider works swimmingly. Steam needs to get rid of these scam games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454287149, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454287149, "recommendationid": "20884657", "language": "english", "votes_down": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462108", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
