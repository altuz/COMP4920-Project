Terrific party game. Good for 2-4 players and an audience. Lovely, clean aesthetic, great sound design, great music, great humor.\nThe main mechanic is that you can stretch or shrink your tube-person to control the ball or your opponent. The more you stretch, the more ball control you have, but the less pushing power you have. By shrinking, you sacrifice some ball control in exchange for more pushing power. You'll frequently be switching between offensive and defensive tactics during a match, so adjust your tube-person accordingly. (That's a sentence I never thought I'd say)\nMultiple game modes, and if you find the secret, you can play as weiner dogs. :-)\n\nLovely thing. Can't recommend enough.

Why not?!\" And there are some laughs to be had, for sure. The downside, however, is that the gameplay really doesn't last long. You'd be hard-pressed to get more than an hour of enjoyment with this game, even as a \"Noisy party\" game setting like description suggests. \n\nThe goal of the game is to simply hold the ball in the middle of the round arena on your side until you score a point.
