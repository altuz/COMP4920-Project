This is unfair use of Unreal Engine. Would never recommend it, even hard-core spelunking fans should avoid this game at it's full price. \n\nGame is awful, very buggy, not funny, unbelievable narrative (yeah, The Holy Book references do not save you here devs), even so-so graphics are not that charming + bad voice over and short short game.\n\nSo if you really want to play this, wait for bundle sale or use a coupon.
