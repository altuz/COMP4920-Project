An excellent feel to each swing, completely potentially decking an opponent in a single blow, or just giving them a little love-tap depending on how well you move with it. Parrying isn't an end-all-be-all damage stopper, just slows the opponent's attack, and your shield arm gets tired at a reasonable rate, not within a few scrapes. Armor feels the best of all - you really feel the difference between cloth and leather, chain and plate. In full plate mail, battles can really feel like a total mess of \"who can slowly beat the other tin can to death first\" as it really should. Attacks aren't simply directional as you can get in Chivalry or Mount and Blade, you can pull any angle you like if you're good with the control scheme. \nSpeaking of which, whereas I've seen plenty of complaints about it, Exanima's controls aren't that hard to pick up. To perfect, perhaps impossible, but within an hour I was slugging my way into fights, if about as graceful as a little bebe. Now, I can confidently say while outmaneuvering and beating the snot out of my foe that \"that -is- what I meant to do,\" not just flailing about wildly, hoping something happens. Well, most of the time. I'm not great with action games. You could certainly turn battle entirely into an art form as beautiful as any in here, with proper practice.\n\nAside from that, just about everything else works pretty well, too. The AI isn't broken, it acts about as imperfectly as a player. Perhaps slightly too... rigidly imperfect - I could see getting \"too good\" for the NPC opponents. But they're respectable, and can hold their own in a fight. \nThe weird sort of unspoken, passive diplomacy with the hall-wanderers of the adventure is pretty good, too, feeling a little unpredictable and unstable, as if navigating your way around a variety of wild animals. Like a bear, back away slowly. Wait, that was bears, right? It isn't too complex as of now, though.\nThe backstory seems interesting, though it really raises more questions than it answers. That's kind of part of the allure, though. The Arena is pretty solid, progress feels good, rising to the top is a pretty solid climb, not without peril.\nGraphics are beautiful. Darkly beautiful. You don't get awesome landscapes or breathtaking flora or fauna, nor are the characters particularly anything to write home about (well, unless you, ah, \"lose your shirt,\" perhaps, but that's a certain audience only), but everything you see is plenty realistic and the lighting is truly excellent. I honestly have no idea how the game runs so smoothly, either. Or perhaps, if it's no mean feat in reality, how any other game might run poorly...\n\nUpdate progress, apparently, is slow - I just picked this up about a week ago, though, so I haven't felt it and in any case, pulled thirty entirely enjoyable hours out of the game within that time and don't plan on stopping now, haven't even seen all it has to offer me never mind gotten tired of what I've already seen. I could probably pull a good five hours out of dueling with basic cloth-and-quarterstaff alone. Actually, I think I did? Whatever. Five more, then. \nWhether or not Bare Mettle completes this game, it's already a perfectly worthwhile purchase and experience at any price. But it's fifteen dollars. That's a pretty low price, just saying.\nAlso, I've got a decent idea why there hasn't been quite enough progress for some people. I'll bet a lot of the devs' time is being drained into playing the game themselves. I don't blame them. I would probably ditch everything and just play, too, if I'd created something this excellent through so much hard work.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505979281, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505979334, "recommendationid": "35099461", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518292", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506846968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 636, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1570, "steamid": "76561198032840593", "num_games_owned": 193}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I hesitated buying this due to the mixed reviews.... but I have to say this is one hell of a game.

TLDR at the bottom.\n\nPros:\n\nExanima is mechanically unique, to the point that the controls would throw anyone for a loop at first. Once I got the hang of the controls however, success in combat was sweetly satisfying, and exploring my environment left me in a constant state of wonder and eager anticipation.\n\nExanima is beautiful. The space around me in the dungeon felt appropriately full of objects to examine and knock around, and physics applied to almost everything I saw, from broken chairs and dining utensils to keys and weapons.\n\nCons:\n\nExanima is incomplete. I know that this goes without saying, as it is still in \"early access,\" but i must point it out, as it is one of the only things i can find wrong with the game. Once i beat the latest level in story mode, there was nowhere for me to go, nothing for me to do, accept play arena mode, which is quite fun and challenging, but repetetive and ultimately not as interesting as the story. There is a small element of randomness to story mode runs, in the form of different loot inside containers, but that is the only variance that gives it some replayability.\n\nThe last patch was seven months ago, which is a bit long to wait for new content, in my opinion. The patches that have come always seemed to include very noticeable additions and changes, so there is that.\n\nThere is a compass, but no map in-game.\n\nThe game does not inform you in any way when you reach checkpoints. The only way to know if you have reached one is to die and realize you didnt have to make a brand-new character.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nExanima is hard to master, but it also beautiful, unique, and fun. Right now, it is not complete, but it does have a fair amount of content. If you want a brand new Adventure/ Role-Playing Game experience, Exanima is probably a good purchase for you.

Yeah there is a huge learning curve but if you take the time to figure it all out it becomes such a rewarding experience and incredibly fun to play.  I wish more RPG's would follow suit by making games that rely on the players skill/knowlege of game mechanics instead of how lucky they get in RNG or how much loot farming they do.  Although the game is in Early Access and still pretty basic I've still never seen another game like this and it is worth checking out.  I look forward to seeing how the actual storyline plays out and how skills will be applied to the combat when they impliment them.

Devs should focus on the melee and less on running around mapping out mazes...with no map. \n\nI love melee games, if Arena was expanded on I would continue enjoying this game. The combat system, while clunky, is very fun and satisfying to learn, HOWEVER, its terrible for a dungeon crawler.  Its a system that works great for open spaced dueling, and horribly for tight corridored dungeon crawling.\n\nThe single player mode of this game is terrible, a game that should focus on its melee system, has you running around mazes with tight corridors. I love the melee combat in the Arena mode, in the single player campaign its just bad, swings constantly getting stuck on walls\\objects, oft times its better to avoid a low level zombie in a corridor. While i do enjoy the high stakes combat, and when you get good at it, you feel godlike. Then you go from Arena to campaign and get spammed in a corridor by a naked zombie. A game that requires such footwork, oft times forces you to fight in such tight spaces.\n\nMistakes and learning curves in combat could be completly forgiven, its nice to play a game that punishes failure then rewards you for learning from your mistake. But the clunky combat in tight spaces is not what is truly putting me off playing. Theres nothing more for me to do in Arena, it took me some time to get a full team of fully equiped Masters, and I enjoyed it, but every time I try the campaign, it puts me off playing this. Ive owned the game for some time, tried the campaign multiple times. Ive got to level 2...maybe once.\n\nTHE NUMBER ONE THING I HATE ABOUT EXANIMA: CARTOGRAPHY\nI am a Knight, not a map maker, you have a really great combat game slighty hampered by lack of open spaces, no biggie, your very first map is a massive maze...a bit frustrating, but not game breaking...no map. Really?\n\nSo, a clunky combat system meant for dueling in large open spaces, puts you in a maze...with no map. And volla, suddenly your target audience of melee gamers is comprised of a very niche group that actually enjoys running around for hours memorizing layouts or even worse...MAKING YOUR OWN MAP. \n\nOne of my favourite games of all time is Ultima Underworld, its a game that throws you in an underground abyss full of mazes. It starts you off with a compass, which, unless you have a grand memory, is pretty useless for a game with so many twists and turns, many corridors and intercetions looking exactly the same. If not for the map you find early on, I wouldnt even bother with it.\n\nWhich begs the question, why doesnt Exanima have a map? Even a crappy map that forces you to explore, and open it and write down landmarks, and constantly recheck it to make sure your going the right way. Having a journel is useless if your descriptions match so many other places. Thats exaclty what a maze is, a large group of twists and turns, all connecting with similar looking intersections.\n\nExanima needs a map, im not gonna lie, been trying for ever to get to just level 2. The highlight of your game should not be the overwhelming sigh of relief when you finally find a place you have been searching for, for hours, not even sure how you find it. That was what put me off playing last time, and I quit for like 2 years. Its 2017, gameplay feels exactly the same, and while its fun to play arena again...I just speant way too much time running around level 1, mock me for my lack of memory, I mock the game for demanding such memory in the first place.\n\nOnce again im put off this game and dont feel like playing, there is not enough to do in arena, a mode I feel your combat was designed for, as the clunkyness of it, while enjoyable and intense, is not showing its true potential with such tight corners you can barly use footwork in.\n\nAnd i would STILL play it, for all these minor flaws, IF IT HAD A MAP, its simply not fun to run over the same spots over and over trying to remember an ENTIRE MAZE. Like I said, one of my all time favs being Ultima Underworld, your game should be right up my alley, a good mixture of fun combat, exploration, puzzle solving, level\\stat\\gear progression, throw in a maze to figure out here and there, and you have one grand adventure!\n\nExanima STARTS in a maze...a maze with no map. As if mazes arnt hard enough to figure out even with a map. Such a simple thing, should really not be the deciding factor in who the target audience of your game is. You want your game to be hardcore? IT IS, so well done. But map making is not hardcore, its lame and frustrating for those that dont enjoy it. Infact I cant think of anyother game like this that doesnt have a map, the expectation of such a memory, I dont know how many runs it would take me to completly memorize the entire layout of the maze, Im done trying\\caring, its not hardcore, its not skill demanding, its not fun.\n\nTLDR: You sold me on the high learning curve and skill required to effectivly play your demanding combat system.\nAfter realizing the campaign mode requires more skill at cartography than skill at arms, I can no longer recommend this to fellow melee lovers, a lack of a map is unacceptable for a game whose level design is one massive maze.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505019463, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505019463, "recommendationid": "34853391", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504682", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500241596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2312, "steamid": "76561198046260726", "num_games_owned": 257}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": "4", "review": "Exanima is a really special game - or could be some day, maybe.
