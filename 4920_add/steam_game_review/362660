You play as Lena, a Templar of the Blue Rose, which is basically an order of paladins. Sent to guard a VIP with a group of other Templars, they are ambushed by a dragon and Lena is badly injured. When she comes to, she finds herself in a secluded village. There she finds four men and one woman who... interest her. Through your choices you can win the heart of the one of your dreams (though one is only unlocked after finishing one good end), and solve the mystery of the town.\n\nA bit fun and an interesting concept.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494361637, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494361637, "recommendationid": "31653889", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507376", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499219307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 394, "steamid": "76561198394790584", "num_games_owned": 15}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "After reading the other reviews I was a little skepticle about buying this game . But it was on sale so I thought what the hell . I didn't expect much , but I enjoyed the game overall . The art was nice and the soundtrack was fitting , and the story was intriguing enough that I finished one play through in one sitting .   \n\nI liked the main protaganist , even though she was inept at some things ( like most humans ) and she actually seemed to grow as a person through the game . The other major characters were also likeable ( besides the guy who saves you because he was annoying AF and I don't even care what his name is ) \nThere were a few plot holes , but they didn't really seem to bother me during game play .\n\nIf you like fantasy , you may want to check this game out . \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499286177, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499286178, "recommendationid": "33289685", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505090", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
