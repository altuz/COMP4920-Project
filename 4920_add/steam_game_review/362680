It's about Fran, a mentally ill 10 year old little girl who is treated in a mental hospital after witnessing the brutal assassination of her parents.\n\nGiven a new experimental drug, named Duotine she is eventually uncovering Osvald Asylums horrible truths, while trying to find out who and why killed her relatives slowly sinking deeper in to insanity to a point where she can't tell the difference between reality and imagination.\n\nThe base story and the atmosphere is already things i would have gladly given my money for, but what comes next is something every one should play through at least once. To witness the world of a tormented little girls subconscious thoughts, the way she sees, looks, and treats things that aren't real, and  understanding the meaning of the little references hidden in front of your eyes, are the things a point and click horror game rearly does to a player.\n\nIn the 10 hours of playing the game had me hooked up, always thinking, always trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together, learning to think like a 10 year old girl, while at times playing 2D ingame-minigames, hanging on to the grip of what's real, and what is not, while seeing realitys converge together, leading to a startling and confusing conclusion.\n\nThe game lacks voice acting, dialogs only exist in a textual way, but it's not a bad thing, for this game, it's the best mechanics they could come up with. Puzzles are what i would say medium-difficulty, there are not always instantly obvious, sometimes you have to think more, or look up a walkthrough, realising afterwards the answer was in front of you all along.
