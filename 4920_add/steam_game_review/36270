This game is (to me) is mostly nostalgia, being why I bought it. But now onto why I was fond of this series from the beginning:\n-It is very original, and is more of a \"lol\" than a \"chessy\"\n-The level design is unique, and every level is different (some require some thinking, some are just \"run and gun\" with a frying pan or something similar\n-In the game's menu (all titles in this collection have this) is a level designer, the same used by the developer who was in charge building these unique levels (each title has at least 120 levels)\n-This \"Level Editor\" offers you the exact same functions the developer had; no disadvantages\n-It can be fun and slightly addicting (what I do is play a number of levels of one title, then move on to the next title and so on\n\nI hope this review was helpful to an extent, and I learned yesterday (if I recall correctly) that the company that made this franchise is defunct and has been since 2012 which means this is \"as is\" and \"will be\". I like this franchise."}, {"votes_down": 17, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1327897082, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511759", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 22, "recommendationid": "4260913", "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198034663705", "num_reviews": 89, "last_played": 0, "num_games_owned": 6724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 0}, "timestamp_updated": 1408502786, "received_for_free": false, "review": "You'll need thicker glasses than Super Granny to be able to play these games since the newest one's resolution is locked at 800x600, with the older ones being even lower.
