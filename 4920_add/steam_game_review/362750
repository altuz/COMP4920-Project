(I think marmoset tb1 does, which makes it weird that tb2 doesn\u2019t).\n\nA feature I would appreciate (but I didn\u2019t expected) is if you could expose substance materials in the web viewer so that people could play around whit the procedural properties.\nOther than that marmoset tb2 is a very nice program for showing of your 3D assets.
