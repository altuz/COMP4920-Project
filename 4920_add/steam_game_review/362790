This is a fairly decent game, easy to learn but with some interesting strategy.  I'd definitely call it more of a strategy game than a game that tests one's word knowledge.  It reminds me most of Puzzle Quest, since nearly all of the gameplay consists of fighting battles using a standard casual-game mechanic, but this game is simpler.  \n\nIt's a small thing, but after the first level, you can choose to play a male or female avatar, an option I always appreciate.  You're on a quest of some kind, I don't know.  The art style doesn't stand out, either.  \n\nYou battle against a series of AI enemies, and you place words alternately on a game board.  You're trying to get your opponent to do things that will benefit you.  Upwords and Wordox are the word games which this one most resembles, but again, this game is far simpler.  \n\nThe enemy AI really needs improving.  It's easy to dominate most of the enemies just by making more than one word at once (e.g., CAT is on the board, you play DOGS, making CATS).   You can also rack up a lot of energy (spell points) and skulls (which harm your enemy) just by stacking two-letter words.  I don't know what dictionary this game is using; it isn't one I've seen used in word games before.  But there's no penalty for guessing, so it doesn't really matter.  Mostly, the game is a little bit too easy for a word game junkie.\n\nI just started the \"second round\" thing where you can go back and replay old levels with challenges.  This mode seems like it's going to be fun.  The first challenge is that you lose health for making less than three letter words.  There's another set of challenges, too, but I haven't gotten that far yet.\n\nThere is also a board that you can buy tiles for and try to get as high of a score as you can, which gives your character more health and spell points.  I really like this version of leveling up a character.  It definitely makes me want to get the best possible score.  It's very much like gearing up in an RPG.  There are spells and potions, also, but I haven't needed to use them much.\n\nI would really like to see achievements added, as well as multiplayer.  I could see this as a fun, fast multiplayer game.  But overall, the price is low, and the mechanics are different enough from other word games I've played to keep my interest.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462494950, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1462507134, "recommendationid": "22819425", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530373", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431892691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 50, "steamid": "76561197975831685", "num_games_owned": 6097}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": "1", "review": "It's alright, probably better to pick it up in a sale as the price is a little steep for what it is.\nIt's an enjoyable word game, one done quite a few times over, only the plot line seems to change.

Those players who are looking for an extra layer of strategy will find much to enjoy here.\n\nFrom the very first level, it's clear that Word Wonders:The Tower of Babel started its life as a tablet/cell game. Once the expected tappable bonuses appeared on the main map screen, I very nearly shut it off, convinced it would be dull and slow. I'm glad I didn't, as it quickly becomes much more than expected. \n\n[b][i]What it is:[/i][/b] WW:TToB has a simple storyline that takes the player through 50 different battles, similar to Puzzle Quest. Just as in that game, energy can be collected and used to cast offensive and defensive spells. The difference here is that instead of matching gems, you'll be creating words on a board, building them off of the previous word(s) placed. Unlike most other word games, space is extremely limited, and only word(s) placed in the most recent turn remain on the board. You have a typical rack of 7 letter tiles; each tile has up to 4 lightning bolts (spell energy that works like mana) or skulls (does direct damage to your opponent) or a combination of both. Placing a word activates those elements. When it is your turn, you may activate as many spells as you have energy for (spells are used on a turn cooldown system). Likewise, enemies can also use spells  (such as Paralyze, which removes half of your tiles for a few turns). There is, thankfully, no time limit for turns.\n\nThe game is made up of 5 tower \"floors,\" each containing several boards. Starting with floor 2, branching paths appear, although you will still need to complete all boards on the floor before progressing to the next floor. Each board can change as the round progresses, adding letter modifiers or coins (collected by creating words over them). There also may be stone pillars in the way (breakable with a specific spell). \n\nAs the game progresses, components can be obtained to create unlockable potions, and letters on the man map can be collected to place in a \"Boost Board.\" The Boost Board is a solitaire Scrabble-like game in and of itself: placing your collected tiles in the best way possible opens up additional points that increase your overall health and spell energy levels, and unlocks new spells. An in-game shop allows you to buy power-ups for your tiles and alterations for your board, as well as potion ingredients (if you don't feel like waiting for them to appear on the main map). All real-money purchases have been removed for this version.\n\n[b][i]Thoughts:[/i][/b] There are a few things that could have been better implemented. The game does seem to favor difficult racks; it's not uncommon to see racks such as QWZWSMX or OUOUJKX, particularly on Boss rounds. If exploits are your thing, you can end a round by simply casting a damage-causing spell instead of playing a word, and you can restart a level as many times as you'd like until you get the rack you want. US players should know that the game seems to use the UK Scrabble dictionary; thus words such as \"soho\" are acceptable (a word that does not appear in the North American dictionary), but this really hasn't been a problem for me yet (3 floors in). A more surprising find is that there is no way to resize the screen; whether you choose Windowed or Fullscreen mode, the playing field is the same size. One final strange note: Once you reach level 7, an on-screen message informs you that Duel Mode (a local two-player battle mode) has been unlocked. As there does not seem to be any way to access it, I assume this is a holdover from the tablet version of the game. \n\nOverall though, if those things don't bother you, this is a pretty fun,  unusual word game, and the genre mashup works pretty well. If you're willing to get past the early hand-holding, there's a fair bit of fun to be had here.

It isn\u2019t multiplayer and this game would just be peachy for multiplayer, it would go right off.\n\nThe story is that the protagonist has decided to try and climb the Tower of Babel to try and find the original language and reunite the world again. To do this he must battle against various Gods using his skill of words, basically scrabble. The word scoring does not work the same way scrabble does, instead each letter tile has a unique number of skulls and lightning bolts awarded to it. The lightning acts as your power ups to cast magical spells to change either the board or to affect your nemesis direct in some way. The skulls is the hit points you will score against your enemies health bar. So the more skulls you combine on double word scores or triple letter scores, the more health you will hack away and vice versa when he attacks you. \n\nI'm not actually sure how the developer ( http://www.chimera-entertainment.de/games.html ) has made the game to accept words as personally I found that the game did not accept some words that are definitely in the English language for instance the word 'false' and on the other hand it accepted words that definitely isn't part of the English language such as 'cpu'. The game itself even had several spelling mistakes in certain speech bubbles which made me cringe since the whole game is about spelling. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=860370862\n\nThe secret to being good with scrabble and word games is that you 'need to know' all the small words, the two letter words so that you can run words parallel to words already put down making every letter a double letter score. This is something the ai can't do and the secret on how to easily defeat them. The second tactic you need to do is magically enchant your letter tiles to be more powerful as you hit those double word score places to really slay the health off your enemy.\n\nIn the end you have to defeat the real evil behind it all which for me ended up being a 50 hp VS  125 hp battle. Personally I found it very challenging and had to use practically everything in my arsenal to destroy him, but even the last boss has a major flaw, he can't regenerate his own health and as soon as you work out how to stop him from performing a serious attack on you, then the whole thing becomes a relative no brainer.\n\n\nThere are 50 levels with 3 difficulties, every boss has a unique attack and defence and the board changes shape the higher you go making it slightly that more challenging at times. The speech bubbles often try and deliver a tongue in cheek view of boss battles and when you eventually get to the top the game will try and deliver a twist to the ending which personally just did not work for me and found it to be both corny and inaccurate as I know any Gods associated with Babel in the official version of the story were NEVER GOOD Gods, they were only FALSE, but again the game doesn't accept the word 'false' so maybe that is why they think their good.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QeMAQa3CMow\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486698364, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486698364, "recommendationid": "29815652", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504379", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507155236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4699, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 32132, "steamid": "76561198208369303", "num_games_owned": 28}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really recommend this underestimated game.\n\nIt has 5 levels with a lot of opponents to beat with 3 difficulties, normal, hard and heroic.\n\nCollecting money is needed to buy ingredients for making potions which you can use for example to lower the life of your opponent.\n\nThere is also a sort of scrabble board where you can make words with letters you bought in the shop, or sometimes dropped after a battle.\n\nthe more words you make on the board, the more your life increases and your energy which you need to use spells\n\n\nThe game looks simple and childish, but it's absolutely a game for adults.

Definitely not your average create a word game as there is actually a bunch of extra stuff to do along side all of that. It offers your standard levels where you are battling your enemies taking turns playing words off each other but only the last word played stays on the board and there can be obstructions on the board as well as different shapes the board can take. then on top of that every level has 2 challenge levels to complete it and get all the stars for said level. The stars then contribute  your level ups and give you more coins and items to use in the store and hero submenu. In the hero submenu you have a boost board where you can lay out the letters you collect (and purchase) to increase the overall value of the board for added powerups. There is also an alchemy section in there where you can mix different potions and items to help in the tougher battles. All of these extras, while nice become (at least for me) a bit tedious after a while but honestly necessary to complete the game. \n\nSo overall I did enjoy the game and do recommend it. I picked it up on sale but it's easily worth the 5 bucks also. 20 hours on record as of this writing and I'm about 85% completely done with the game. I'll finish it eventually but sometimes gets too tedious to continue playing lol.
