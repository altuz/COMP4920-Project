I bought two copies of this game, one for myself and one for a friend and unfortunately it doesn't have online capabilities :(\n\nEDIT: As far as the game mechanics go, they are a little flimsy and the \"handicap\" white lines on the first 18 holes are a bit intrusive. As others have stated, Hole 11 has a spot where the camera is obstructed, which results in having to take a blind shot at an attempt to move your ball.\n\nThe reason I recommend this game is due to the fact that it works well for their intended audience. Their tagline states \"Mini Golf for the whole family\", incinuating that the game is local only (which was originally stated as Co-op) and it works well in a family environment. Their target audience can be hit dead on with this game, however it wasn't originally marketed that way.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing the game solo but none of it was entirely challenging. If you like Steam Achievements and don't mind dropping a couple bucks, then go ahead and buy this game. But if you're a serious gamer and enjoyed the unrelated 3D Ultra Mini Golf game, then I don't recommend this game for you.\n\nHope this helps :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432959598, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433815847, "recommendationid": "16070378", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500839", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481487162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561198152999339", "num_games_owned": 91}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ok, I didnt played the game...

Maybe it can still happen?\n\nPros:\n- The graphics are pretty good.\n- The layouts of most holes are reasonable. I've seen mini golf games that have holes that ramble on and on, this game generally does not suffer from that.\n\nCons:\n- Alt-Tabbing out of the application causes it to freeze and makes it unable to be switched back to. It then has to be killed through Task Manager. This is the most annoying flaw with the game and pretty much makes it unplayable as a casual game where I am switching back and forth between playing and doing something else.\n- Par for each hole seems rather arbitrary.  A hole of a particular difficulty may be presented as a par 1, but a later hole of similar difficulty will be par 3. I wasn't even sure why the par existed until I reached the second course, because the first course had all of its holes at par 1 (which made it the most difficult course to attain 100% gold medals).\n- The game was way too easy/short. I gold medaled all 54 holes in under 2.5 hours.  That's an average of less than 3 minutes to master each hole.\n- The physics are occasionally glitchy, especially around hills.  When a ball moves from a slope to flat ground or vice versa, the ball tends to skip unnaturally along the ground, killing momentum and spamming the ball collision sound effect.  Also, sometimes a ball can take several minutes to come to rest (this was most noticeable on course 3, hole 5, right at the tunnel exit where 2 downhill slopes seem to meet).\n- Each course only has a 5-second loop of music, occasionally fading to... the same 5-second loop of music.  This gets very annoying after a few minutes.\n\nOverall the flaws tend to cancel out the good things about this game. If I could give it a neutral rating, I would, but since there are better mini-golf games out there, I'll say meh to this one.
