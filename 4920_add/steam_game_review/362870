This release also fixes a few things, and it works a bit better on newer versions of Windows compared to the original fan translation. \n\nOne thing that I'm a bit dissappointed about though, is that this release is entirely incompatible with special plugins such as DynRPG, and Disharmony. There's also no support for looping streamed audio, although I guess this issue can sort of be forgiven as the original source code is no longer available to the developers of this release.\n\nRPG Maker 2003 is simple enough for anyone to easily make a simple game, yet if you know how to use it, you can make something really cool.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505640903, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505641957, "recommendationid": "35018871", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 108, "total_reviews": 120, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 12}}
