Most remakes tend to be ports to newer consoles with higher frames per second or slightly-better graphics, but Black Mesa goes above and beyond the minimal effort that companies put into their re-releases. It shows that, sometimes, a fan project can surpass AAA games of the same genre.\n\nIf you've played Half-Life, you already know the story of Black Mesa. An experiment gone awry results in an alien invasion at a New Mexico research facility, leaving you to escape the disaster area and figure out how to set things right. Not much has changed in terms of pacing, but some improvements over Half-Life's level design have been implemented. Annoying sections like On a Rail's maze or We've Got Hostiles' vent tunnels have been heavily cut down. The mod has a better overall \"flow\" to it than Half-Life, though a couple levels like Apprehension still drag on.\n\nThe graphics are stunning. Crowbar Collective has pushed the Source Engine to its limits, and it shows. Everything in the facility feels vibrant and real. The game has pretty good optimization as well, meaning that lower-tier computers should be able to play it smoothly with reduced settings.\n\nBlack Mesa's gameplay feels fluid. Quality of life changes, like sprinting and infinite flashlight battery life, make navigating the levels less of a chore and more of an adventure. All of the classic weapons return looking sharp and mostly unchanged. Enemies from the original game are less sluggish and far more deadly than before. Don't underestimate anything, as even the simple Headcrab Zombie poses a far greater threat than you'd think. \n\nThe Steam version of the game has some features that the 2012 mod lacks. There is a multiplayer mode and support for Steam Workshop. Weapons look and animate better. Most of all, the HECU Grunts no longer have their cheesy Solid Snake voices like they did in the mod! Now they sound like soldiers caught up in an unpredictable conflict, not canned voices from an action movie.\n\nJoel Nielsen did a great job with the game's soundtrack. I would recommend checking out his website after you've beaten the game. My personal favorites from the album are \"Questionable Ethics 1\" and \"Forget about Freeman.\"\n\nAll in all, Black Mesa is a solid first-person shooter that harkens back to the old days of save scumming and exploration. I would recommend buying it if you're a fan of the Half-Life series. Even at full price, it's worth every penny.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506983144, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506983176, "recommendationid": "35429821", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523482", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506892695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1216, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2460, "steamid": "76561198268040384", "num_games_owned": 119}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "1", "review": "What they did here was take a game that was already a masterpiece, and turn it into even more of a masterpiece.\n\nThis has got to be one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nI just hope Crowbar Collective or a team as talented as them can make a Half-Life 3/Half-Life 2: Episode 3.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506207608, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506207608, "recommendationid": "35165849", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517577", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505857503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 844, "steamid": "76561198244713938", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is a visual orgasm, I adore the detailing done in the environments.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505857745, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505857745, "recommendationid": "35072901", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513244", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499707971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 643, "steamid": "76561198052716484", "num_games_owned": 153}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "you can kill remodeled headcraps with hd textured crowbar, when enjoying new soundtracks. 9/10 still waiting to kill the giant alien baby and get imprisoned by the g-man.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507068151, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507068151, "recommendationid": "35457567", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507063929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 222, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1836, "steamid": "76561198079468807", "num_games_owned": 107}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you want to experience and old classic with a fresh coat of paint, this is the way to go.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506294559, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506294559, "recommendationid": "35192563", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506404", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504989988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2437, "steamid": "76561198067292617", "num_games_owned": 72}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "review": "This game is ultimately one of the best games I have ever played, considering that this was a remake of 1998 Half-Life and that the team at Crowbar Collective added more to the base with their own creative vision and freedom. This is what Half-life is supposed to feel like. Horrific and dreadful with a terrifying atmosphere, you play once again as Gordon Freeman and you come across hordes of zombies, unsuspecting alien attacks and the relentless HECU marines all in an attempt to stop you in your tracks, as you witness the aftermath and death of several innocent scientists and security guards that were caught in the crossfire of hostiles that come their way. \n\nThis game, the Half Life games in particular, probably a few even more is not like any other mainstream shooters. It doesn't hold your hand and you have to figure out things the way you are supposed to be as a scientist. Minimalistic hud, no dumb texts or messages floating around your screen telling you how to play the damn game and pointers telling you to pick this up, pick that up, press that button, pull that lever, go here, go there go the f*ck where the game wants you to, [b]no[/b]. This game is gonna make you scratch your head as you figure out a puzzle, and you are meant to get stuck at levels and it is only up to you to figure out how to achieve such an objective. It's brilliant. It's no CoD. There are no cutscenes, and there are no QTE's to ruin the flow of your game. It's all up to you as a player, to play the game as you want. Of course, the game is linear, but the best part is this game makes you feel like as if you're exploring a huge world, and it is designed that way. You have to look for clues, look for ways here and there on how to reach or get to a particular spot. And I tell you, this is what makes a true game. It's all by yourself to figure things out. Perfect.\n\nIt's about time that I've let go some of these mainstream shooters. Of course, I still love some of these particular games, they're probably designed to be causal and all for fun, but this game is one hell of a beautiful experience. Thank you Valve for making such great games in the past, and thank you Crowbar Collective for making their formula even better. \n\nOutstanding mod.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504754641, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504754641, "recommendationid": "34787400", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496375947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 856, "steamid": "76561198225746716", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1] General Information [/h1] \n\nTitle: Black Mesa\nDeveloper: Crowbar Collective\nRating: M\nGenre(s): FPS, Suspenseful Horror, Sci-fi\nSingleplayer: Yes\nMultiplayer: Yes\nLength: 8 to 12 hours (I did it on Hard in 10)\n\n[H1] Ratings [/H1] \nAI | 6/10\nAtmosphere | 7/10\nMechanics | 9/10\nStory | 8/10\nGraphics | 8/10\nGameplay | 10/10\nEnemies | 9/10\nSound | 10/10\nSoundtrack | 10/10\nCharacters | 6/10\nFinal Rating | 83/100\n\n[H1] Final Thoughts [/h1]\n\nThis is unequivocally one of the most classic FPS games remastered to be arguably better than the original.

The spacing and originality of the bosses is amazing. The gunplay and rate of gun upgrade is awesome and rewarding as well. The sound is spine-tingling and the soundtrack is fast-paced and adrenaline pumping.
