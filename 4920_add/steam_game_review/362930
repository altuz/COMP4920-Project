The fact that it runs so sluggish on PC is cleverly indicative of the Garfield character himself, so its obviously a deliberate artistic choice, perhaps even a commentary on the PC platform and userbase itself. In contrast, Mac users might not tolerate this decision, seeing how it flies in the face of our modern conventions, so clearly the devlopers left the slowdown feature out for them. In doing so they provided the public with more options to enjoy this masterpiece, which they should be commended for.\n\nGarfield Kart may, at first glance, appear to be basic and somewhat derivative... but there is much more here than what lies on the surface (again emblematic of the title character), and I encourage those seeking truth in this world to delve further. You may find more than you bargained for. Yes, as simple as it all seems, upon deeper examination, I found this game has changed me. Changed my being, changed who I am, MADE me who I am... Enlightened me... I only wish more people could have such an experience with a piece of \"software\".

Oh, boy.. [/h1]\n\nLet's start with the plot.. I like it a lot, although I don't like them retconning Garfield dropping the nuke on Hiroshima. That was an intruiging plotline from the original comic strips and now they've changed it to make it so he was the one who killed Hitler. Besides that, the plot is strong. Odie becoming the villain was surprising but still wonderful, as well as Garfield and Jon's love story. All around, the game had a great plot.\n\nNow for the meat.. The gameplay..\n\nMany people claim that the game is a copy of \"Mario Kart.\" What they fail to realise is that this \"Mario Kart\" thing was actually a rip off of the splendid game \"Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties\" on the Nintendo DS. So, no, this game is no copy of the trash that is \"Mordio Kort.\" but yeah gameplay is splendid. Truly innovative..\n\nI could go on for hours about the graphics, characters and tracks, but honestly, all you need to know is that this game is truly perfect in every way, shape and form. \n\n-The Biggest Garfield Fan", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505621182, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505701140, "recommendationid": "35013613", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504713859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 60005, "steamid": "76561198357267457", "num_games_owned": 64}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[drumroll]\n[rousing orchestral\nfanfare playing]\n[fanfare ends]\n[birds squawking]\n[wind blowing]\n[grand, royal orchestral\ntheme playing]\nNARRATOR:\nOnce upon a time,\nin an English castle\nfar, far away,\nthere lived a pampered\npersonage by the name of...\n-[yawning]\n...Prince.\n[bell ringing]\nAll right,\neveryone, he's awake.\nHurry!
