As you all can probably tell from the screenshots. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes narrative game experiences combined with unique gameplay. The game is pretty much bug free, which is rare for an Early Access game. Some minor annoyances here and there, which will probably get fixed later (see cons).\n\nThis is not a hack 'n slash dungeon crawler so if you are expecting to massacre hordes of enemies and gather insurmountable amount of loot, this is probably not the kind of game you're looking for. You have projectile weapons and bombs (probably even more variety in later stages) but they are very limited and you're just best off trying to avoid enemies rather than waste bullets.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game is your magic torch, that keeps the enemies from charging towards you. They will still hurt you if you get too close to them but at least they won't run towards you from the other side of the room to eat you. You have a limited amount of power in the torch so there's a pressure to conserve the fire in order to make it through the level. Trust me, you don't want the torch to run out of juice..\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics are gorgeous. Especially the lighting effects.\n+ Great atmosphere.\n+ Gameplay forces you to plan ahead, conserve your resources and to thread carefully.\n+ Bosses are fun and challenging.\n+ Sound effects and ambience works really well.\n+ Interesting story and setting. Makes you want to find out what happened. Dialogues/monologues are also nice touch.\n\nCons (aka. minor nitpickings):\n- The checkpoints only activate once. I went through a level where I finally beat the boss but still wasn't done with the level. I died after that and had to start from a checkpoint before the boss, even though I returned to the checkpoint after the boss fight. Would've liked a save after the fight too.\n- Not too much variation in the gameplay for what I've played so far.\n- Dialogues would benefit from professional editor's touch to make them less clunky. They are not bad by any means though.\n\nAll in all, I'm loving the game so far. It's very good for an Early Access game and the developer seems to be working hard on the game. It's definitely worth a buy even at it's current stage.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436258411, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1436258411, "recommendationid": "16922824", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503386", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460669169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 57, "steamid": "76561198147746863", "num_games_owned": 289}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is super fun, you don't even need to play it for that long to realise this, it is ever so fun with its pixel graphics and classic gaming.
