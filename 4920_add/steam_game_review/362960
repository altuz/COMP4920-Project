Maybe?[/b][/h1]\n\nWhenever I boot up an Obsidian game, I always do so keeping in mind the fact that it is likely I will be dissapointed by some simple begginer mistakes that sometimes break an otherwise intersting and awesome experience. They did it with KOTOR 2 with the missing content, they did it with Alpha Protocol and even though people can't stop singing its praises, I feel they did it with Pillars of Eternity. And yet Tyranny not only makes me recommend it without any reservations, it is also the first game since the Witcher 3 to make me want to play it again right after I finished it.\n\nNow, Tyranny has been the target of some recent controversy, what with Paradox putting shady price tags on it and with the questionable DLC. This review won't take any of these into account as I want to judge the game on its own rights. Also, I don't have the DLC and don't care much for it.\n\nHaving said that, I'd like to start this Recommendation of Tyranny by addressing a few cons (some I've seen mentioned in other Steam reviews as well):\n\n[h1]CONS or SO CALLED CONS that you need to be aware of[/h1]\n\n[*][b]The abrupt ending[/b] - is not really so abrupt. I actually have a feeling that this commentary is from hardcore RPG fans who feel games you can complete in under 50 hours are beneath them. The game is fairly short for an RPG, yes. But then again so was KOTOR... nuff said. The ending, could be considered a bit abrupt, but I don't really think so. I feel it ends things nicely, tying everything up without dragging it along unnecessarily, leaving a door open for a sequel, yet giving enough closure to be satisfying.\n[*][b]The dumb AI[/b] - this is actually a valid piece of criticism and applies mostly to your own party rather then enemies. Enemies are quite effective, even on normal (even though towards the end of the game on normal you start to stomp them). The problem is your Party AI is dodgy and has trouble pathfinding in combat, getting stuck, canceling your order to do something else based on their set behavior. The set behaviors themselves are not particularly great either. You can turn Party AI off fortunatelly, but be prepared to micro-manage a bit more.\n[*][b]Loading screens[/b] - just like in Pillars of Eternity, this game has no right to have loading screens this long. I mean come on Obsidian.\n[*][b]Few side quests[/b] - now, I understand that the latest DLC adds sidequests for Party Members. If that is the case, shame on them for not having them in the first place. Party memebers are cool and interesting even without sidequests, however with a severe lack of sidequests in general, I think having those in there from the start would have made this game even better AND saved it a lot of the shit it is taking now.\n\n[h1]ON TO THE GOOD STUFF[/h1]\n\n[*][b]It's FOCUSED[/b] - the game sets out to tell a particular story... and it does. The Lore is enough to quence your thirst, but not too much so that it gets in the way of the story, unlike other games *cough* Pillars *cough*.\n[*][b]The Story is good[/b] - now this will always be a question of prefference and some people may not like it, which is fine. But this game has a well put together story that sees you start from a being a fairly standard agent of justice, to a total badass. Additionally, it makes your journey feel epic and impactful, without having an \"end of the world\" stake.\n[*][b]There is replayability and your choices have some weight[/b] - don't expect too much here, but there are a few ways to play this game which I think offer a sufficiently different experience and enough incentive for someone to play this game a second time. In fact, this is what I am going to do after I finish writing this review.\n[b]The Spell Crafting System[/b] - yes, you can craft and upgrade your own spells in a very interesting and easy to pick up system.\n[b]Leveling up[/b] - you level up by doing things. So for example the more you fight with 2 weapons, the more your dual wield stat increases. Furthermore, you get an asortment of ability trees based on the 2 specializations you select, so you are not necesarily locked into any 1 given playstyle. Although, given the fact that the game is just about 30-35 hours long and you will likely end it at around level 16, you probably should focus on one. Having said that though, the game is designed in such a way that everytime you havel up you gain an Attribute and an Ability point, plus you have trainers to train your skills, so at each level you feel that your characters are gaining strenght.\n[*][b]Combat in general[/b] - the combat in general is pretty solid. It takes a lot from Pillars of Eternity but makes it a bit more dynamic and involving. You also get special combos you can do with each party member based on your loyalty/fear with them. As in Pillars and other games like it, some abilities, like said combos, are locked to once per rest or once per encounter, however most regular abilities and spells are not. Encounters are sometimes challenging, even on normal difficulty, although they tend to become pretty manageable once you move past level 10, with very few exceptions. However that is exactly what I expect from normal difficulty. It is a bit tricky at the beginning, there are some fights where you will have to give it your all to win, but towards the end it rewards you by making you feel like a badass at least when fighting hordes of regular footsoldiers.\n[*][b]Party members[/b] - I know I just said that they could have benefited from a sidequest each, but they are interesting and diverse in their own right and they have their own personalities, some being more stubborn, some being more easily swayed to one side.\n\nIf you are unsure about this game, I think that the first two hours (until you can refund it) are a pretty good representation of the game, even though you won't have access to all of the features yet. Just make sure you skip the Conquest phase at first and select a predefined Conquest story, as it saves you about 15-20 minutes, time spend seing if you really like the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505040939, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505041298, "recommendationid": "34858975", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515858", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503334959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2269, "steamid": "76561198025027569", "num_games_owned": 341}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Having gown up playing Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and the whole collection of Spiderweb's Exile/Avernum series I had this game to be very enjoyable.

The intro is full of exposition and flavor. If the game kept this aspect up it would be a different game entirely.\n\nThe Bad: The combat system is bland. At harder difficulties, it just gives enemies more health and damage so it turns into a heal and grind. There is very little strategy involved. Tank, heal, pew pew. There is really no unique classes besides the Siren character (she is a bard I take that back lol). \n\nThe Ugly: This game feels constantly like it is unfinished and that it was rushed to sale. Voice overs outside of exposition are very limited. For example, you companions will have voice for some dialog options and not others (with not patterns it is just random). This game is divided into 3 Acts with the first two being fine and the third one ending very abruptly (like it just had to be finished quickly to get it out of production). This is inexcusable for the price tag Obsidian Games is asking for.

After the first act, there was noticable change in atmosphere in the game. In the first act, actions and events reacted and flowed with each other naturally. The rest of the game felt incredibly disjointed and fragmented. The second act felt somewhat rushed, with certain sections feeling lengthy and fleshed out, while others felt like I was just forced through them. The third act was more of an epilogue than anything else, and probably only took me a few hours to complete, which was fine, if the game had more than three acts. Looking at other people's reactions, it sounds like the game was rushed out and delivered before being fully cooked.\n\n*Something to note, there is a quest with a game breaking bug very early in the game.* I figured I wouldn't have to worry about this since I bought the game almost a year after release, but I was wrong. Luckily the game saves after every zone transition, but having to re-play a dungeon with a particularly not fun enemy was...not a great experience. Also, there are multiple instances where dialogue choices have programming errors like \"character_dialogue_choice123\".\n\nI did really enjoy the atmosphere of the game, and I feel like I only saw the tip of the iceberg. I may replay the game eventually, but now that I know how short the game is, it really ruins my expecatation of going through this epic, dark-fantasy game.\n\nI generally enjoy playing lawful good in these morality type games, so the encouragement to play as a more \"evil\" character was interesting.

If you are new to these type of crpg games I highly suggest this one being a place to start.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505247636, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505247636, "recommendationid": "34907951", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494652", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506341041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 526, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1747, "steamid": "76561197988039425", "num_games_owned": 485}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "In Tyranny, you play the role of a Fatebinder, a servant of Kyros the Overlord, in a world where the epic struggle between good and evil is over and you're tasked with overseeing the takeover of the last free area of land on the continent of Terratus.\n\nTyranny is a modern CRPG by Obsidian Entertainment with tight gameplay mechanics and an intriguing world.\n\nPros\n- Gameplay mechanics are fun and well designed (honed to perfection from Pillars of Destiny?).\n- The setting of Tyranny is unique and fun to play in (perhaps due to how your decisions impact the world in a meaningful way).\n- Companions are interesting and each has their own unique abilities and skill tree (no generic classes).\n- Choices you make are meaningful and have a big impact on the story, your place within it and what you'll experience in the game.\n- Magic system consisting of combining various sigils to produce \"custom\" spells is interesting and fun to experiment with.\n\nCons\n- Voice acting is so good that it hurts you a little bit when a character loses their voice in middle of a dialogue.\n\nIf you enjoy CRPGs, especially if you've enjoyed more modern RPGs such as Pillars of Destiny, then you can hardly go wrong with Tyranny.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506359513, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506359513, "recommendationid": "35206892", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504998979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1062, "steamid": "76561197971521675", "num_games_owned": 221}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "\"It's like nipples on men.

I don't want to say that the game is bad because of this BUT it's definately not a game for light-hearted RPG gamers which after playing this realised I might just be such a person myself.
