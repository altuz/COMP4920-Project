These games are similar to the Big Thinkers Games as they are entirely on learning rather than adventure. However I found the Junior Field Trips Games to be better than the Big Thinkers games cause these games are more informative and features a character named Buzzy the bug who is on par with Spy Fox, Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish, & Putt-Putt. There wasn't a particular order these games go by as all three of the games were released in 1995. So I decided to play this one in it's entirety first which is about Farms. The game give you the option to either explore the area or play a series of quizes or games. The exploration option takes longer as there's a lot of ground to cover in the farm area while you have various option to either hear Buzzy's remarks on the location or select an object to learn what it is with a dictionary page. This game can prove to be useful for school work as kids will be amazed how much work is done at a farm.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466752877, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1466752877, "recommendationid": "23747385", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500278", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430881641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 259, "steamid": "76561198035643084", "num_games_owned": 672}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An Instant Childhood Arcade Classic, in which you get to learn about the Farm with Buzzy the Knowledge Bug in this Second Installment to Junior Field Trips Series.
