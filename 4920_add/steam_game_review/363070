Making this the most explorable game of the Junior Field Trip games when it's expanded on three different continents. It's also the most informative with the wide variety of animals and plants can come in handy for grade school learning.

Humongous had a knack for hiding fun clickpoints and surprises in their games, but the Junior Field Trips ran with that idea and made exploration its focus. There's plenty of colorful, exotic creatures and plants to click on and learn about immediately, but others require either patience and waiting for them to appear on screen, or manipulating the surroundings in order to uncover them. So, it can take a kid a long time to find everything in the game, and even as an adult, I found a few animals that I never knew were in the game. There's also a suite of mini-games for a fun diversion from learning about the jungle. \n\nObviously, this game was intended for young children and they will get the most out of it. The game's easy to navigate, has dozens of different animals and plants to learn about, and Buzzy optionally narrates all of the game's text for pre-readers. There isn't really any reason for an adult to play it (other than with their children or out of nostalgia), but even so I bet anyone who does play it will learn about some new animals and spend at least a solid hour or so just exploring the fun environment.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503911894, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503911936, "recommendationid": "34548400", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 8, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
