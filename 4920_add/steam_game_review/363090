First, press win + r, then enter regedit,\n open files  by this way HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\KoeiTecmo\\Nobunaga12PK\\Configs.\nin the left side, find width and leagth bar. change the value to your current resolution. because the game is old, so it doesnt support high resolution. when the game runs, there should be a cg at the beginning, if you still can't see it, change the value of texture depth to 32, it might help.\ni successfully run this game in my new win 10 system, so the game definitely can run in win10. so don't worry about it. if you have any problem that i didnt list ,

helped me . \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAojyBPCjs8\n\n\n\nThe game is nice , if you played Iron Triangle , the English version of this ,but with no Power Up kit  you will be familiar with this one ,and you will not face any problems at all , you will memorize everything in a short time . \n\n\nThis is my experience with the Power up kit so far . \n\n\nThe AI has been improved , I didn't see any attacking ports stupidly , but I think you can use cheap tactics , like letting one of your castle empty ,so that the AI attack you and then come back with a massive army and destroy him .I really don't use like these kind of cheap tactics .\n\n\nAlso the AI has been a tough challenge on hard difficulty , I restared the game twice until now .Although I am 100% understanding the game and I have beat the English version more than 20 times on hard difficulty . \n\n\nYou can trade with western people in order to  teach you some tech , also you can ally with bandits , ninja clan , merchants , and pirates , each have a special usefull thing when allying with them  .\n\nAlso you can change the amount of troops ,food ,money ,tech for you or the AI .\n\nAnd 3 new scenarios including battle of Sekighara scenario . \n\n\n\nI really like this game and I do recommend it of you are a fan of strategy games .", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448235308,

characters, therefore it's not even friendly to Japanese learners who knows only kana.\nThere is a English version of the same game available on Amazon or some other online store, but I don't know the quality of translation since I've not played that version.\n\nThe best side of the game for me is its rich and interesting presentation of the history. Although that's not the main theme of the game, the short story in the personal view of a charater gives you the background and the personality of the historical figures, and the interactions between them. On the top of all these, you can shape the future of the country and the people all by your own hand.\nIts control is intuitive as a strategy game since almost all the command and options are made via a textual menu with explanations, as long as you can read the language.\nThe battle is not so exciting in the later game because you should always have overwhelming troops with super powerful generals, but in the beginning of the game, the battle is thrilling, especially when you win your first siege.\n\nOne negative feature is mentioned that the battle in the middle or late stage of the game is easy because your superiority against your enemies. Second, the build, develop, expansion loop of all strategy games is somewhat boring, you do all the same thing for all cities.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463375741, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463375741, "recommendationid": "23014592", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478515142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5324, "steamid": "76561198007419701", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great Game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457436259, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457436259, "recommendationid": "21705122", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.997918", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
