So first the positives: A lot of the flavor of the source material comes through in cut scenes and art. The game fits somewhere between Total War and Civilization in complexity with the unique element of putting the player in the role of a single individual who must build relationships with other talented individuals to succeed.\n\nNow the downside: The tutorial \"Hero Mode\" crashed so often that I almost gave up on the game before finishing the mode. When it wasn't crashing, there were graphical glitches. This issue is even more frustrating given that the level of in-combat rendering is significantly less than other Real-Time Strategy games. Thankfully, the \"Main\" mode was much more stable. \n\nEven after completing the tutorial, the game has a steep learning curve. The benefits of various building improvements are not presented intuitively, The Great Farm \"allows you to buy provisions\", the Chicken Farm is \"a place to gain provisions\" and the Granary's effect is just +7. Plus 7 what? The manual doesn't say, and there aren't tooltips to help. The user interface also isn't terribly user-friendly. When events pop up in the log, you can't click on location names in the log, nor can you type in the name to search for those locations in the index to find them. Worse, some small towns share names with bigger cities, so an enemy advancing on Wu could be fortifying a small town in the west or moving on a capital city in the east.\n\nBoth the debate and duel systems are modified rock-paper-scissors formats. While the debate system has a novel mechanic that offers bonuses for staying on topic and prevents using the same tactic twice in a row, the duel system gives a significant advantage to the character with higher WAR stat and then requires players to set all 5 actions at once. I've never seen the hero with a lower WAR stat win (even with a skill difference of one point), although the Unbalance option is marketed as offering outplay potential.\n\nFinally, the diplomacy system is very limited, which is a particularly glaring shortcoming in a game that invests so much focus on relationships and so much of the story on coalitions and shifting alliances. When an NPC calls for troops across the nation to join against a common enemy, it's not going to be easy to send troops if you have to pass through other factions' territory to get there. It would make the game much more interesting if a character could make an appeal to their fellow lords to depose the usurper controlling the emperor or to come to the emperor's defense.\n\nOverall, it's an intriguing approach to the genre, but one that has made pretty small improvements in gameplay relative to RoTK 8 released on the Playstation 2 in 2001, which itself wasn't so different from KOEI's original Nintendo game \"Bandit Kings of Ancient China\" released in 1989. Bandit Kings was a good game for what the technology allowed 28 years ago, but RoTK 13 feels more like a game that should still be in beta testing than the culmination of three decades of refining games based on generally the same design.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504672558, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504675065, "recommendationid": "34769464", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517032", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506753710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 740, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17036, "steamid": "76561198197904393", "num_games_owned": 20}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "When I first got the game quite a while ago, the bugs such as the crashing and whatnot that everyone has talked about already were definitely present. For example, the Zhao Yun Side Story tutorial mode for Hero Mode more or less crashed everytime I tried to get past some of the objectives. However, now I have no problems with the game in terms of bugs.  In my view, the technical issues that plagued the game at launch are pretty much gone. However, from the reviews on here, it seems that some players are still experiencing those same bugs. \n\nThe majority of my review will be about the Expansion version, since it's almost essential to really enjoy the game.\n\nThe new dueling system is better than the old one in my opinion. Even though it leaves more up to chance, the old system made it predictable, since the higher WAR stat would always win. However, with the new system, the underdog has a better chance of winning, and if you plan it out right, you just might not die against Lu Bu or Xu Huang (in the base game I reloaded a save a bunch of times since Xu Huang always challenged me to a duel and killed me instantly). Sometimes in the middle of a battle, I would get something like \"Guan Yu is dueling Niu Jin, do you want to watch?\" Then, I say no, because obviously Guan Yu will win, but then I get a message like \"Guan Yu was crushed in a duel by Niu Jin\" and it's a welcome surprise, especially when Niu Jin was on my side.\n\nThe debate system is much better than the old one, since the old one was the same as dueling from the base game. The introduction of subjects and other things also gives lower intelligences the better chance. It's always embarrising when I'm playing as someone with INT in the 80s but then get schooled in a debate against some random bandit guy from the market whose INT is barely over 50, and then I lose all my hard earned gold because he bumped into me and dropped his stupid cup.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it definitely sacrifices some of the kingdom building aspects seen in the last game of this series I played, which was RTK XI, in order to add more RPG elements. I think it does this successfully, and the Expansion Pack definitely expands upon those elements, adding more quests and the comrade and prestige systems, which definitely added more to the replay value.\n\nThe game may seem daunting at first, but playing as a ruler definitely gives you the advantage for a swift playthrough, since as long as you time your counterattacks right, you can definitely finish a playthrough fairly quickly. However, playing as an officer, especially as a lower ranking one, may seem frustrating, as sometimes your ruler will move you around to some of the weaker cities before you even finish building up the one you're currently trying to strengthen. However, it's not hard at all to rise through the ranks, especially if you pick higher goals in your missions, so it won't be long until you reach the rank of governor or viceroy if you started from rank 9. So in my opinion, the learning curve is pretty kind. \n\nOne of the biggest problems I have are the minister recommendations. Sometimes a minister will recommend expanding the domestics of a city that is already in High status, wanting to 100% all of its stats, while completely ignoring cities in their jurisdiction that are still in Low or Ruins states. This means that these extra commands under ministers are completely wasted on already well-off cities, and you end up spending the two commands you have as a ruler or viceroy on those cities instead of your ministers helping you out with more commands. I think if they made proposals to enhance the weak cities, they would be much more efficient at their role in the game.\n\nA smaller problem that I have/had is the balancing of some officers. There are many officers in this game, like Li Dian or Zhao Yan (not Yun, he's overrated enough), that I would definitely give better stats. This was a problem in the original base game, but now that you can directly edit historical officers as well in the expansion, this isn't a problem anymore. I still left the terrible stats for Xiahou Mao though. He deserves it. \n\nThe Event Editor is always welcome, since a bunch of events are missing from the base game. Still hoping for a Scenario Editor even though I know it's almost guaranteed we won't get one. Gotta get them monies from the DLC. \n\nStill, the game is severly lacking in late-game, 260AD-and-after scenarios. You barely have the chance to see any of the later officers like Du Yu and Sun Hao unless you play the game like a civilian just visiting officers and holding banquets for sixty or more years, then dying and choosing a successor, after which you do that for another ten years or so. And that's not fun at all. Then again, I never tried playing as Yuan Shu on the expert difficulty so maybe that game will take long enough to get to those later officers.\n\nAll in all, I do not believe this game is worth getting without getting the Expansion Pack as well. At the same time, I don't recommend buying the entire bundle at this price and suggest waiting for a sale. Still, I think this game gets a lot of flak, and in my opinion it's still a good game, especially if you're new to the series and don't have any attachments to the older RTK games.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506126017, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506126017, "recommendationid": "35140535", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503327", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505084959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11037, "steamid": "76561198011630363", "num_games_owned": 5}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "One of the best games I ever played was ROTK VIII on PS2.  It's the only ROTK game I played; I never got into the others so it is the only one to which I can compare ROTK XIII.  \n\nGive me ROTK VIII over this anyday.  The game if full of great features and the ability to role play a historical or original (player created) character is a great idea.  This game fails because of one reason only.  The AI is severely unbalanced.  Dong Zhuo blitzkriegs the map in the anti Dong Zhuo Coalition campaign.  I had to basically start myself off as the ruler of a province to win this campaign.  If you actually enjoy the role playing aspect and want to spend time as a free officer and then as a subordinate officer, you will find that once one of the AI factions gets even the slightest leg up they become unstoppable.\n\nI enjoyed ROTK VIII because I could actually start out as a free officer and eventually work my way up a faction and take over as the ruler and conquer China.  Unless you're a super strategic genius you're probably not going to have a shot at doing that.  If you choose to be a subordinate to another ruler you will find yourself incredibly frustrated at the fact they constantly change your orders on you.  If I had to guess, I'd say I've managed to complete less than 5% of my domestic tasks before I get a message from my leader telling me I have to participate in an attack on a strategically meaningless town that is going to suck away all our manpower and leave us susceptible to counterattack.  \n\nEven more frustrating is being close to finishing a task in which you have achieved enough for a reward only to be told to go to a council meeting where you may or may not get to decide on an important issue affecting your faction.  \n\nNow, those who have played it will say, \"Well, you don't have to do what the leader says.  It's actually just a request.\"  That is correct.  You can ignore the leader's request and continue performing your tasks, but I just prefer to maintain a healthy relationship with the ruler.  \n\nIt really makes this game unfun.  Even when I go into settings and set expansion progress to \"slow\", it seems one of the AI factions basically says, \"Fritz your settings; I'm a gangsta\" and starts taking everybody over.  And once they do that, your only hope of winning the campaign is to declare yourself a free officer and go join them.  Which is really just the same as putting in a cheat code.  I haven't used cheat codes since A,B,B,A in Ikari Warriors (just dated myself... whatever).\n\nIf you're new to ROTK, I recommend you try it just to get a taste of what it's about.  but then go find one of the other ROTKs and play that one (ROTK VIII was way better, not sure about the other eleven).  But, in general, and especially for experienced ROTKers, I'd say this one is a bust and as such have selected the thumb down.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505084510, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505084510, "recommendationid": "34872886", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501226", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506742079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 935, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1782, "steamid": "76561198312706224", "num_games_owned": 86}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The Game is bugged.\ni cant enter my fame screen, in any of my saves.\ni can when i start a new game, but after half an hour or so it brokes down again.\nits a shame, cause its one of the key points in the expansion.\nnice game, but don't buy until its fixed", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505763304, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505763304, "recommendationid": "35051723", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502949", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505961273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1260, "steamid": "76561198007501294", "num_games_owned": 118}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Don't normally leave reviews but this deserves one.
