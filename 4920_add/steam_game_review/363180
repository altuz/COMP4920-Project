You also will have just enough time to react.\nStrategy logic is simple and yet, the key factor is how fast you respond.\nI would recommend this game if you whant to kill some time without noticing.\nGood product for the first day of steam release.\nGood luck!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449002378, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449002378, "recommendationid": "19422131", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534741", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469794308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 798, "steamid": "76561198055829634", "num_games_owned": 179}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's not RTS.

To be honest, I'm writing this review just after this masterpiece crashed once again.\n    [*] It's not even a game. It's a parody to a game.
