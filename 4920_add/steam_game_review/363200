There's something satisfying about firing off multiple spiked balls at once and watching them tear through the waves of viruses. The NES-style music and deliberately silly story are a nice touch as well. It's a little on the simplistic side, but if you're in the mood for a puzzle game I'd say it's well worth its price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430944046, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430944046, "recommendationid": "15717701", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497044", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439164569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198134706370", "num_games_owned": 53}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I love this game, the quality is HD and my kids enjoy watching me play it.
