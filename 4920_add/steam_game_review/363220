Throwback to NES platformers, you can run and jump. \n\nRUN AND JUMP! \n\nTo address the haters in this thread. Yea, the monochrome color scheme is 'iffy' and you might have problems if you are colorblind, but I did not feel like it detrated from the game. I thought the hitboxes were fine; reminiscent of playing Megaman and having to creep your toes over the ledge to the last pixel.    \n\nThe game starts ez enough - and ramps up slowly, increasing the challenge as each level adds new puzzles and obstacles for you to overcome, constantly thinking and adapting as the levels advance. I'm about an hour in, and maybe completed half the levels, but I'm also very bad at these kinds of games.

Each stage is comprised of timed doors/locks, bear traps, treadmills, spikes, pistons, jumps, and climable walls. The creators play with these primitives to make some unexpected challenges. Sometimes the doors run horizontally and must be walked on to near the end before the door opens again dropping you into deadly spikes. Sometimes you must jump from climable wall to climable wall to platform to piston in a seemingly unbeatable gauntlet of spikes and bear traps. Each stage presents a unique challenge, requiring you to grow in skill before ever overcoming it. I highly recommend giving this game a shot if you like unique and exciting challenges.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448652444, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448652591, "recommendationid": "19315914", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496202", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429809840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561197976634548", "num_games_owned": 149}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Awesome game with great music highly recomended.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429809850, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429809850, "recommendationid": "15506166", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488388", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490813361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 331, "steamid": "76561198053450550", "num_games_owned": 32}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is sadistic. Like, if that old \"Super Mario Frustration\" ROM hack and Dark Souls had a baby on the Virtual Boy, it would be this. The game was originally made for a contest in which the theme was \"unforseen consequences,\" hence the recurring theme in the story and the tunnel vision. Controls are crisp, music is awesome, aesthetic is amazing, but only buy this game if you have a CRT that can withstand your fist. LCDs are out of the question, you'll break one on the third level. Do not use with a CRT that cannot withstand your fist; you will be horribly mamed by flying shards of glass.\n\nAnyway, ever get stuck on a level of a game like Donkey Kong Land and just have fits of rage after dying on the same level for months? This game summons the same amount of rage, but unlike DKL, it's not because of janky controls, confusing graphics, that horrible GameBoy screen, or a sadistic saving system. It's because each level requires a whole lot of trial, error, death, and inhuman precision. It's simultaneously beautiful and horrifying.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1490813973, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1490813973, "recommendationid": "30819348", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
