Very hard, you won't be flying through the levels like in other physics racers. After the first few tutorial levels are finished, you'll have to work hard, just to get to the finish line on most maps. \n\nThe first thing that stands out in O3DX is the fact that although you can only move your vehicle on a 2D plain, all the levels are rendered in 3D. This gave the developer, the ability to add things like tricky, slow corners and dynamic camera views. \n\nMastering the levels requires a mix of leaning forward and backwards as well as clever management of the brakes and acceleration, as you progress through the levels, the game also throws some quite tricky puzzle elements at you, these portions of the game can't be solved with horsepower, only brainpower.\n \nIf I would have any criticism about the gameplay at this point, it would be that each level forces you to use a particular vehicle, whether it's a big heavy 4x4 or smaller ATV style vehicles. Some customization options would go a long way, not just on what vehicle you can use, but also livery's and other options to alter the appearance of each of the vehicles. At this point in time, they come how they come, like it or not.  That being said, each one feels distinctly different and are very fun to drive.\n\n[h1][b]Graphics:[/b][/h1]\nFor the most part the graphics are amazing, the actual levels themselves are beautifully crafted, with great textures and animations throughout, light shafts illuminate the environments and sometimes you can't help but give the environments more attention than the task at hand. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the majority of the vehicles, while some look OK, others look a little low-res and somewhat stand out (I'm looking at you Jeep.) That being said, the game is still in Early Access and I'm sure that at some point,  the developers will give the vehicles the same love they have given to the beautiful environments.\n\n[h1][b]Controls:[/b][/h1]\nControls are fully redefinable through the launcher, which is always a nice feature. The default keyboard controls are simple but very intuitive, responsiveness is nice too, I've crashed and blown up many vehicles during my time with O3DX, but at no point did I feel the controls were to blame for my demise. At the point of writing this review, I have been unable to use my Xbox 360 controller, this seems to be a known bug that has been acknowledged by the developers, according to a forum post, a patch to fix this issue will be published in the very near future.\n\n[h1][b]Summary:[/b][/h1]\nO3DX is a very well realized point to point physics racer, it offers some new and interesting innovations to the standard formula and they have executed these innovations very well, Easy to get into, but very hard to master, perfectionists will spend hours mastering each of the games levels and even if that's not your thing, O3DX will still consume plenty of your time, The graphics although a little substandard at times, will completely wow you for the majority. If you're a fan of games like Trials or Joe Danger, O3DX is right up your street. I'd have no hesitation in recommending O3DX even at this early point of development. It's not quite there yet, but even now, it's more polished than other games that have already reached the end of their development. \n\nAt this moment in time, I'd give O3DX a 7.5 / 10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440523481, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1440524969, "recommendationid": "17712074", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547917", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481666010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 360, "steamid": "76561198024440722", "num_games_owned": 2142}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "2", "review": "seeing this game in the new releases list, i snapped it up immediately (i'm a sucker for any off roading type games)\n\nwhat struck me immediately about it (aside from the control issues which i'll touch on in a moment) is that it wasn't at all what i expected in terms of gameplay, though. that's not entirely a negative thing. just a different thing.\n\nthe gameplay is rooted in the tradition of things like elastomania, trials, joe danger, and other games of the like.  you have no control over steering and such, just acceleration, braking and the forwards and backwards angle of your vehicle.  that said, however, this game is much, MUCH harder than those it shares elements in.  i initially found myself just flooring it to the end of the level, and while it worked fine in the first tutorial level, the 2nd one put me entirely in my place and i had to rethink how to play, entirely. \n\nthe whole puzzle element of this game seemed a bit weird and even unlikely, at first but it works very well and the whole thing is a lot more about being careful and planning your approaches and rethinking things several times over before taking off, than other games of it's type.  it's actually fairly clever and often maddening. \n\nthe graphics in this game are really nice - the terrain and lighting are well about what i expected. the vehicles themselves seem a little toony in contrast with the environments but are perfectly workable. as another review pointed out, it's still early access and it's quite likely those are still going to be fiddled with, some.\n\nnow, the controls: well, it's an early access game and they are actively working on this problem and apparently have a fix coming out very shortly, but if you want to use an xbox controller or the like, you'll have to remap everything before playing as it's entirely set up wrong and you will not be able to get your truck to move using the default layout - keyboard control works just fine, though and given the simple controls, work perfectly well.\n\none thing that has REALLY struck me about this game is the developers, themselves.  i had initially left a negative review citing the controls and a couple other issues and was contacted fairly quickly. the devs seem very receptive and concerned about the opinion and issues people who have purchased this game have and remedy any issues, which in combination with a fair bit more time in the game since my initial review finds me rating this positive, now.\n\nfun game. would play again and am anxiously awaiting their next.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440168643, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1440539384, "recommendationid": "17645410", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503207", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494783617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 944, "steamid": "76561198114171705", "num_games_owned": 48}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I've got mixed feelings about this game. On one hand I love the concept and simple controls. On the other hand it's hard to play a game that crashes all the time, and doesn't let you control the camera.\n\nThe first level pack is fine, but even on sale it's not really worth $8.49... maybe $4.24.\nIf the second level pack worked like it's suppose to, then it would be worth $8.49.\nAnd if I could get to the third level pack, then it would be worth $12.50.\nAnd if I could finish the game and feel satisfied, then it would be worth $14.99.\n\nI also noticed the store page is slightly misleading. It attempts to present the game as a new release for 2016, but this game has been in Beta since 2014, Alpha since 2015 and STILL is a Alpha product. But, I also have to keep in mind it's an Indie game with lack of help. And since they don't have much help, the developers are not seeing their bug report messages either, which makes matters worse. It's hard to find good help these days.\n\nThe game uses the Unity Coding engine, which is not so forgiving with slouchy logic code (so I've heard). Don't get me wrong here, so far it looks like they've done a great job, but obviously it needs more tweaking and optimizing to be done to it before it's considered a finished product.\n\nThe vehicles and terrain look really nice even on the lowest graphic settings. I find the vehicle crashes to be hilarious, but sometimes you crash for no apparent reason and have to reset the track, which is not funny at all.\n\nSound FX are pretty basic, you get what you pay for. But I would like to give the devs kudos to the handbrake SFX, because it sounds exactly like somebody is parking in your driveway outside. I've already fooled 3 people with it so far.\n\nMost of the music rocks! I'm digging the soundtrack to this game. Big kudos on that! - But I would suggest the music to continue playing during a track reset instead of restarting the music. That gets kind of irritating after a while, especially since you do have to do a lot of resets while learning each track.\n\nThe game certainly has a challenge to it. Many of the tracks have intense situations where you MUST successfully clear an obstacle exactly right, or else suffer another reset to the beginning. So prepare to see a lot of loading screens. I sort of wish the game didn't have to do a reload for a track reset. There should be a way to do a simple recovery to the beginning and just set particular variables to zero again... but I'm sure the devs had their reasons for doing it like they did.\n\nIDK... over all I think I'm going to sit on the fence with this one 50/50. It has big potential... it just needs more work done to it.\n\nIn the game's current state, I can not honestly recommend this game. At least no further than the first level pack. I guess I would be recommending 1/3 of it ???
