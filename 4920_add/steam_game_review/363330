I believe I was initially attracted to the art, so I decided to purchase this on sale and give it a try.  The game starts out very well and I was quickly addicted.  I played five hours straight, beat the game, and obtained all the achievements.  I thoroughly enjoyed this experience; however I do have a couple gripes.  I feel like the developers simply gave up as they designed the last level.  The last level is essentially re-used, and extremely easy compared to previous levels.  Also, the game ends all too abruptly and leaves you scratching your head.  \n\nBeing relatively new to this genre, I started on Casual.  I quickly found that the game was too easy, so I bumped it up to Expert.  If you\u2019re not playing on Expert, your map will be marked with places that you have available actions.  This pretty much tells you exactly where you need to go, so I suggest you play on Expert from the start.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game.

I found the Story to be interesting, yet rather bland for my liking. At the start of the 2nd Chapter I started to feel more attuned to it, but then shortly after it just dropped off again.\n\nThe Puzzles were moderate, I didn't get stuck on any of them and some did make me think a bit more than others, but nothing complicated. \n\nThe Hidden Object Scenes seemed rather pointless most of the time. I really couldn't see any connection with the items I had to search for, to the item I recieved afterwards. As this is only my second HOG I have played, I'm not sure if this follows the traditional ways of Mechanics or not. Either way, they are still nice to do, and can be very relaxing.\n\nThe Art style was nice, and the Music was ok. I felt that the Voice Acting was overdone in parts, but it was acceptable. \n\nThe Ending was a bit of a let down to me. It just didn't feel finished. Instead of leaving me with a sense of accomplishment with having everything in it's right place, I was left with a sense of disappointment.\n\nI don't think the Game was bad at all, but I just felt that it could have been polished a bit better in certain area's.\n\n[b][u]Genre[/u][/b]\n- Hidden Object / Adventure\n\n[b][u]Game Elements[/u][/b]\n- Hidden Object\n- Puzzle\n\n[b][u]Average Playthrough[/u][/b]\n- 3.5 Hours\n\n[b][u]Liked[/u][/b]\n- Nice Puzzles\n- Great Art style\n\n[b][u]Disliked[/u][/b]\n- Found it hard to get into the Story\n- Pretty poor Ending", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446512170, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446635767, "recommendationid": "18848860", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535315", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444092259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 200, "playtime_forever": 315, "steamid": "76561198035054806", "num_games_owned": 531}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 27, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Once again a great hidden object game from Artifex Mundi.\n\nThis time you are Alice with a broken mind trying to figure out what happened last night.
