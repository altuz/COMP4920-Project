(Piracy, Trading, Production, Mining) but there is still a serious lack of any REAL IA in the game. Yeah, yeah, sure there is the stations and the drones, but is ships that attacks players are indeed great and needed, there is something that is really missing on the gameplay of this game.\nA playing IA, not a piloting firing IA. Like crew members, (affiliate by faction) that would be rented at station of special faction (black pit, or so...) and would drawn a pay until the players that pay them is bankrup, or they are dismised, and then they go away at the next station.\n\nthe game is really good, but lack people.\nWe read mission from many peoples on mission, but never see any of them. it's like hearing ghost at a certain point.\nthe crafting is a really good point of this game, many minerals and resources, feels real most of the time, and keep the player occupied.\nBut this is also a bad point of the game, because Everything we do is meant for expanding our ship or credits or resources. the game have factions, we do we never see anything of a fight ?\nOh, and PLEAAAAASE, skrills are cool, but there are everywhere, kill it with fire ! the game need to replace some of the skrills by something else.\n\nI'm also kinda sad we never found any abandonned place, or space ships, that would be scraped by anyone who want, or re-used. (hacking it one time for it to become our ?)\n\nSooo ! the game is good, and the first 100 hours u will pass on it will be delightfull, but the game is clearly not finished yet, and we need some \"filling the void\" and \"giving a purpose\" update.\nI understand that we may have to wait a long time for this, I just hope that thing of this idea will come ont day.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504698892, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504698892, "recommendationid": "34774035", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516469", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505073735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3017, "steamid": "76561198049638050", "num_games_owned": 182}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you are simply waiting to play Star Citizen, this game is probably the closest replacement until Star Citizen does come out.\n\nShip Construction and Decoration\nCrew & Fleet Based Operations and Management\nResource Grinding, Asteroid Belts, Mining, more Mining, big asteroid mining!!!\nMissions, Diplomacy, Drones, Aliens!!!\nDid I mention hacking?
