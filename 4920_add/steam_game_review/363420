The games difficulty only gets higher with the higher you progress. Unlocking new classes does not mean it gets easier .. its quite the opposite. Each class comes with its own advantage and disadvantage as well as a tougher difficulty. \n\nThe only thing i absolutely hate is the hardcore aspect of the gameplay. Having to restart after death for those that dont know what hardcore means. \n\nGraphics are good and the story is ok .. but the action is fast paced and enjoyable! \n\nYou get dealt a set of random cards in a pyramid shape and once you complete these cards the ones below them unlock and so forth revealing another random card until you find the boss. Once you find the boss you can fight him and end the level or you can continue to uncover the cards in your pyramid. \n\nThe character progression is pretty crazy and you can end up with all kinds of buff and skill combo's which bring a really unique experience into a game of this type. I recommend getting this game while its on sale .. though it has pretty good replayability it shows no mercy to new players of the genre.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494469587, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494469587, "recommendationid": "31675984", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494652", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490921872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 169, "playtime_forever": 30, "steamid": "76561198002124849", "num_games_owned": 655}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Twin-stick arena shooter roguelite.

It plays like a mix of Hand of Fate and Enter the Gungeon, but it's levels don't have as fun of a risk/reward ratio as Hand of Fate, and it doesn't have the same charm as Enter the Gungeon (which, to be fair, came out after this). The game has solid level and enemy designs on their own, but none of the floors feel connected by any real theme, making them easily forgettable. The characters themselves are uninteresting, but they all play uniquely different from each other, so you don't get bored with them fast.\nDespite any flaws it may have, it's gameplay mechanics are still really fun. Blinking about a room is a blast, and the semi-randomized skill tree keeps the gameplay from feeling too stale. It really just suffers from being a good game in a sea of better games. So while I would definitely recommend it, I would hold off on it until a sale or until you've exhausted your list of other rogue-lites.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499384546, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499384546, "recommendationid": "33327808", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493215667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 605, "steamid": "76561198042883126", "num_games_owned": 417}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Only rogue-like i acctually enjoy on steam", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493686080, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493686080, "recommendationid": "31497607", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495820", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 90, "total_reviews": 93, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
