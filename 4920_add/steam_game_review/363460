I'm glad I got this game on sale, because I wasted $1.01 and no reason to waste $2.99.  I did not have fun playing this at all.  This gameplay is just boring.  \n\nFirst of all, I get it, this is a joke.  It's good for 1 ha when I saw it on YouTube for the first time.  But I guess all those positive reviews are from those YouTube let's play or Twitch streamers, you know the type, they want to get paid for being loud and obnoxious and they intentionally get games that are in any way controversial to get views.  So I imagine PewDiepie and all this fans are rating this piece of junk up.  \n\nI wouldn't mind if the game were half decent.  But this is not.  The gameplay is clunky.  The controls are way harder than they have to be.  I don't understand why sperm wouldn't need continuous movement to propel forward and be able to control where you want to go versus the whole momentum thing.  Having to look where you want to go and pressing W is about the worst way you can have locomotion in VR.  Why does this game not have controller support?  \n\nSo you get enough cash to get an upgrade. Okay, but you only get the upgrade for 1 try.  You have to keep buying upgrades each time.  So this just artificially increases the time of gameplay.  \n\nWell, at least the shooting is consistent.  Yes it is, but there's not really much else going for it.  And the VR environment is very bland with low textures and cartoony.  This game wasn't going for realism and it wasn't going for pleasant.  Also, game opens up a command line for some java BS that Phroot loves to do in games\n\nSo it's only 1 dollar on sale.  Yes, that's the best thing about this game.  But when you spent 20 minutes playing the game and your'e just bored and frustrated and not having fun.  Well, the jokes on you as the consumer.  Please stay away from this POS.  And please stop marking positive reviews.  This is the worst \"VERY POSITIVE\" game I have ever bought on steam.\n\nRate 3/10 at least it didn't crash and at least I kind of knew what I was going to get (although it was a lot more boring to play than the videos I watched led me to believe)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505868972, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505868972, "recommendationid": "35074999", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511386", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 194, "total_reviews": 223, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 29}}
