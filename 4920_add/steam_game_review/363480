I strongly advice you to read this despite the low price of the game.\n\n+ Good animations despite low budget\n+ Good voice acting for the protagonist\n+ Very good dark industrial/ambient and orchestral score\n+ Several areas has their own death-scene\n+ Good cutscene cinematography!\n+ You'll feel sorry for protagonist's death...... because she wears glasses\n+ Challenging combat gameplay\n+ Game controls similaire to a Japanese PC port\n\n- Game controls similaire to a Japanese PC port\n- Extremely low quality backgrounds\n- No key remapping?\n- Think i noticed a Husk model from Mass Effect......ehm, copyright???\n\nREVIEW:\nClearly rendered in DAZ 3D, this challenging platformer action-horror game takes place in a Silent Hill like town called Prosperity, and just like the protagonist says \"ironyyyyy\". Upon exploring a hotel in the town, the world turns into a hellish version where monsters pop out. The starting seconds are very stylish. First i expected it to be a quirky slick Japanese game with bad quality for the sake of humour, wich i would definately have supported.......if it was the intention. The protagonist is very well voice casted, wich just like the soundtrack, wich sounds like Diego Stocco's score for Chernobyl Diaries, came surprising as the visual quality was low.\n\nUnfortunately the game had so many flaws wich prevented me from living into the game and fully enjoy it. First of all,\nour heroine can only be seen from two angles even when you can move upward and downwards, this is seen as sloppy work and it looks weird when she is sidestepping in and out of the image. The backgrounds for this game is the biggest flaw i think. The backgrounds are clearly 3D at core, but they have been inserted as 2D image files and given a corny unclear look. This collides with the clear and solid look of the 3D models. The proportions of the background objects such as doors also collides, with some doors for instance being three times bigger than the models. Who lived in this town, descendants of Goliath? This is absolutely not needed, the game would have worked fine with 3D backgrounds!\nI also happened to become disoriented because of this. However the inventory display is stylish and well composed.\n\nWhen entering combat, things helped ease up the pain a bit. It was fast, furious (still platformer though) and challening. It also grants you Experience Points you'll going to use to upgrade your character. And yes you will be able to sprint later in the game. I also noticed something absolutely amazing imo, wich completely came surprising since i was so disappointed with the overall. Several areas had its own death scene! These cutscenes have not very good, but solid cinematography, who the hell are these guys?!\nIt was sad to see this cute woman with glasses die though :<\nHowever, i also often experienced enemies not following me over to the next screen \n(image changes when reaching end of one platform), wich was......weird. Oh well, good for my health i guess!\n\nThis would have been a beautiful game if the backgrounds and controls were much more better and comfortable and \nif the combat design would have been a little bit more stabile. Many of the pros i have given does not really affect the gameplay and the gameplay is what separates a game from a movie.\nIt's extremely hard for me to not recommend this. I wouldnt feel comfy with recommending it, but it has a\nsolid potential. This game, deserves a remake or a fully 3D remake with over-the-shoulder camera.\nI would love a open-world horror game with the Dark Souls difficulty!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429307415, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429307415, "recommendationid": "15421320", "language": "english", "votes_down": 53, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555601", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431650263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 51, "steamid": "76561197983684753", "num_games_owned": 1749}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Grave Prosperity and I have an... interesting history, to say the least. Back at the last site I worked for (VGU.TV), I was given the opportunity to review the original form of this game given my history with streaming horror games, and presumably because I was the new guy and no one else wanted it. So I accepted, and... let's just say it wasn't great. Clumsy combat, awkward controls, unforgiving enemies, brutal bosses, and basically anything else you could think of to infuriate a player was present.\n\nBut this is the \"Redux\" up here on Steam, so let's not dwell too much on the past. I was genuinely surprised a new version had emerged at all, so I decided to give it a shot out of morbid curiosity. And, in fairness, things improved... slightly. I'm sorry I'm using so many ellipses in this. Anyway, a lot of fat had been trimmed from the game's initial version. Shorter intro, with some of the more ridiculous bits (like suriviving a sledgehammer to the head) cut out. Things felt a bit more navigable, and finding your way around wasn't quite as much a chore. At the same time, combat felt even more frustrating and impossible, and those ridiculous death animations still felt excessive and repetitive, especially given how often the game likes to kill you off.\n\nI've never been a fan of the visuals, either; the enemies, whatever they are, mostly feel like generic \"mutants\" or \"zombies\" with no real appeal, and our heroine looks like a commission job from a Poser or Blender fetish artist on DeviantArt. Not feeling it. Despite all this, I made it to the end of the Redux version, which stops a great deal sooner than the first iteration. I'm guessing things are going to be more episodic this time around, between that and the \"Part 1\" designation. At least it didn't end on an impossible boss battle this time.\n\nDespite my multiple fronts of frustration with Grave Prosperity, I give the developer some credit for stubbornness in sticking to its baby. Clearly, they believe in this property, and want to find a way to make it work. Whether it can, I can't say, but hopefully they at least take some lessons away from this and apply this to a different game or find a new format to tell the tale they want to.\n\nAs the game stands right now, I can't recommend it. I'm curious what the \"major update\" in the game's description will bring, so I may give it one more chance once that's done and released. If so, I'll update and amend this review accordingly.

First was the size ratio for the enviroments. I do somewhat like the old timey look of the game and the emphasize on creepy enviroments. However there is some inconsistancy in terms of how big the character appears (sometimes normal size, other times she looks like a giant) Another small grip comes from navigation. Many times I find myself pacing around because I can't tell that moving in a certain direction leads to a new room. While a map is not truly necessary their should be some indication as to what rooms are linked to the room I'm currently in. Keep in mind I'm just explaining these small issues in hopes that developers can make some small adjustments to make the game more enjoyable.\n\nAs for the pluses of the game:\n-Nice enviroments: Love the creepy look of the surroundings and the haunting enemies\n-Good voice acting\n-combat that is challenging but fair (at times, the random teleportation has become annoying at times since you have such little time to react)\n- Death Scenes :Probably my favorite aspect as I was a fan of Dead Space was the numerous death scenes that played with the game. It provided some sense of entertainment which is good since dying is quite easy and at times I wanted to see what the effect would be from losing to a certain enemy in a specific place. Hopefully this delightfully grim aspect will be expanded even more in future installments. \n\nSo overall I do enjoy the game and say if you would like a fun distraction with a nice dose of creepy mixed in I say pick it up , especially at such a cheap price of $1.99", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430346878, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430346878, "recommendationid": "15616452", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504863", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444791871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 100, "steamid": "76561198012772630", "num_games_owned": 254}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I wish there was some kind of inbetween button for this game, because I can't recommend this game but I did enjoy the game. It was bad i will admit but it's really trying to be a videogame and some very hilarious things happen even though they should not be funny at all. I don't know. I like the game and for two dollars I wouldn't say I regret spending that money on this game and not on a TF2 key or somethings stupid. Pick it up.

I'm now wondering if this may be the first 2 dollars I regret spending (and I've spent money on some pretty pitiful stuff! Think Shaq-fu... classic). The game is very broken. Not like just difficulty either.\n\n-Hit detection is god awful\n-Counter system is useless and usually leaves you taking a hit right afterward\n-When enemy decides to spam teleport just put controller down and enjoy the death scene\n-No ability to skip death scenes (which is what half your play time will be composed of anyway on any difficulties past easy, believe me I know)\n-Terrible navigation, I've actually managed to teleport back to rooms I had just been in while moving in the opposite direction of the room.\n-Glitchy checkpoints, my checkpoint on the first enemy had me stuck getting hit and taking damage before the game actually loaded.\n\nI'm hoping I'll have a reason to remove this review or correct it in the future, but as it is, I'd say it's about as fun as trying to beat ninja gaiden 1-3 with your feet, blindfolded, and all while having yourself castrated with a cheese-grater. The combat is even more awkward than trying to drink spaghetti out of a bendy-straw. Having Diahreea leak out of your eye sockets is less painful than having to play this game. Congress is contemplating an end to waterboarding criminals as a torture technique and instead implementing hours of \"Grave Prosperity\", so long as it remains unfixed and unpatched.\n\nI recommend this game to \n-those who are insanely masochistic, \n-your worst enemy\n-those who acquire stiffies from death scenes in vidja games.\n-those contemplating suicide but feel there may still be beauty in this world worth living for\n\nNow if you'll excuse me I'm going to play some more since I'm a complete and utter masochist.

Most of the time thats a full of shit statement.\n\nI'll be honest though, the textures and models in this game are dated, and it looks like it was originally a Xbox Indie game but there's something about this that hits me, where I live. I'm not sure if this was a 1-man dev team but going through the game I get the feeling that they've done everything they can with what they have. So I have to respect that.\n\nThe gameplay itself? The controllers are awkward if you're using a keyboard, with A for action, B for Cancel, P for pause, and using the arrow keys for movement. Later you'll get the combat controls which keep arrow keys for movement, A for the Attack, W for Guard, and the S & D keys for a evade. The combat is actually real-time which I hadn't expected and it's surprisingly not that bad. The layout of the controls for the gameworld however is awkward and it isn't helped by a lack of sprint, the main character walks everywhere and theres a lot of screens to go through.. especially at the beginning of the game before the game picks up.\n\nWhen it does pick up, my expectations were passed. I bought this because its a horror game and it reminded me heavily of Silent Hill: No Escape, a fan movie for (you guessed it) Silent Hill. It was done in a similar style and I really enjoyed it so I hoped to gleam some of that from this after looking through the screenshots. And it delivered, once you get past the intro the first room of the 'otherworld' in this game managed to make me feel tense and while it does have jump scares I found the atmosphere to be more chilling which is exactly what I wanted.\n\nCurrently, I have no regrets about the money I spent for it and despite it's shortcomings it's managed to entertain me.\n\nI just REALLY want a sprint button.\nUPDATE: Sprint has been added!
