The storyline chugs along eventually but I really love getting to a new and map and forgetting all about the storyline so I can find new parts for my Goliath and get achievements.\n\nAs you can see from my hours played, I didn't just give this game one chance, but several.\n\nThe framerate is abysmal.  Inexcusably so.  My PC's not a monster, but it's not a potato either.  And I'm not the only one with this problem.  People with better setups are having horrible stutter problems -- I mean, I was dropping down to LESS than a frame a second in really bad areas.  (for reference, I'm running an Nvidia GEForce 1050 Ti)\n\nI was so upset that I tracked down a customer service email and left them a complaint.  At first, I got a copy-n-paste 'sorry, use your refund' automated response.  But a couple days later, I got a real response, from a producer.  I was surprised, and really pleased!!  I was told that they were aware, and working on it!  He said I should refund my game (too late, I'd played it too much), but here's another key to use once the update comes out.\n\nExcited for the coming update, I back-burnered this game.  I gave the extra key to my gf.  The key was a duplicate.
