It was a decent game except there were so many bugs, glitches, the game crashed a few times but the worst was that when it needed to update it quit updating part way through and so I had to uninstall it and reinstall it just to try and play it again. Don't get this game. It's a waste of money but if you do get it stay under the 2 hour limit and refund it if necessary.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506008956, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506008956, "recommendationid": "35107658", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 61, "total_reviews": 190, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 129}}
