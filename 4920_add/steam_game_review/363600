I know I haven't played much of it, but that's also because it got kinda old. It's not a clicker-game per say, but it has that feel to it. It's not too fast or slow, just limited. I wouldn't buy it for its price right now, if we're being honest. I'm not recommending this game mainly because of these reasons;\n*The price is a bit of a rip off. When I bought it, it was 15 dollars, so, for what my experience was like? Not worth it. Maybe 5 dollars?\n*The game is limited. It's fun, but it's missing something.\n*The story is not really thought out, at least from what I've played.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506548573, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506548573, "recommendationid": "35249945", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502134", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505074821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1953, "steamid": "76561198035629407", "num_games_owned": 54}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Make a fresh starch, and kick bake and enjoy a potato smith shop.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504815415, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504815415, "recommendationid": "34801896", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 357, "total_reviews": 472, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 115}}
