It is a good thing because the controls are not overwhelming like DCS World and it is very forgiving if one were to make a mistake, which promotes the mellow feel to the game.\n[*][b]Fun arcade feel[/b] - This game is by no means a Flight Simulator, X-Plane, or DCS World, and it clearly plays like a casual game. I do enjoy the realistic flight simulation games, but it is nice to play a mellow flying game.\n[*][b]Relaxing atmosphere[/b] - Do you remember Microsoft Flight? If not, it was a based in Hawaii and had a relaxing atmosphere. This game has a similar feel, in that it is more tropical and worry free.\n[*][b]Walk around[/b] - You can actually get out of your plane and walk around the airfields in this game, which is a nice addition. It is not much, but it certainly alleviates the cramped feeling as if you can never leave the plane.\n[*][b]A lot of missions[/b] - The game has many missions, but they all have the same premise: go to this island, pick up a product, and deliver it to this island. This game spices it up with the ability to transport legal and illegal products; for the latter, you could risk getting caught by the police or getting cheated by the seller and not getting paid.\n[*][b]The fart sound[/b] - I seriously think that the player's character walks around naked (or maybe flies naked) because when you get in and out of the plane, there is a sound of a flight suit being zipped which sounds strangely like a fart.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]What I Do Not Like[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Easy to play[/b] - This is a good thing and a bad thing. It is a bad thing because the game feels too easy when flying. For example, you can hit the runway pretty hard and not suffer the consequences.\n[*][b]Bugs[/b] - In the version that I am reviewing this game for, which is likely 1.0, there are many bugs. The bugs are not very game breaking (or at least I have not come across any), but they are noticeable and could be annoying to some players.\n[*][b]No joystick ability[/b] - When I first bought this game, I immediately took out my flight joystick (Logitech Extreme 3D Pro), but I was severly disappointed to find that there is only keyboard and mouse controls. You cannot use game controllers or flight joysticks in this version. I hope they add it later.\n[*][b]Lack of controls[/b] Similar to the first point, this game is too easy. There are very little controls, so do not expect to have flap adjustments, air drag compensation, or anything like that. There is a landing gear button, however.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, the game is certainly fun, but it has several bugs and lacks features. (No joystick support!) You can probably squeeze a good ten hours out of this game before shelving it, so it is somewhat justifiable at $20. I do admire the team's ambition in creating this game, and I wish them the best of luck in this game and their future titles. I love the first mention in the \"special thanks\" ;)\n\nRating: 6.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429269483, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429269483, "recommendationid": "15412947", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593133", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451925859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561197972781107", "num_games_owned": 645}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 27, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is hardly a simulator.
