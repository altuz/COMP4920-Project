Ironically, that\u2019s how it feels to play Battlefleet Gothic: Armada. The controls are so fluid for naval combat that you can feel the ship rotations in your walk and the rumble of engines in your sleep. For that, the game gets a massive recommendation. 40k games often work like that. They have this wonderful quality where the scene setting is always perfect. The voices are on point, the UI is appropriately gothic, and the music makes you feel like you\u2019re charging into the final battle of the 13th Black Crusade. \n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s where the exceptional for this game, at least for the campaign, ends. The AI for this game does not have the same rules as the player. As in most RTS, the AI is not effected by fog of war. That\u2019s a massive hit as a fair number of skills, upgrades and rules revolve around stealth. At the start of the match, each ship appears as a red blip. There are also a few ways to enhance stealth. Every ship has an ability that causes the blip to disappear for 45 seconds. Additionally, clouds of space gas will make red blips disappear. So why is having the entirety of the stealth mechanic and the associated thrown out the window for campaign and skirmish a problem? \n\nOne of the game types revolves around either driving three weak transport ships across the map OR killing all of the enemy ships while protecting the transport ships. The problem is that from the moment enemy AI spawns, it makes a b-line for the transport ships. This means your only real chance of succeeding in this scenario is to annihilate the enemy or create a wall of ships and hope you don\u2019t get rammed or shot at from behind.\n\nStealth is just one horrific aspect of the enemy AI. Most games increase difficulty with better AI or more damage and more health. In Battlefleet Gothic, the game just cheats and it cheats badly. Lets say you\u2019re playing on Heroic (hardest) difficulty. In your first mission, you have 300 points to distribute between (2) level 1 light cruisers with 6,000 unit range and escort ships. The enemy might show up with a level 5 battle cruiser with 12,000 unit range, a level 4 light cruiser, and an envoy of escort ships. Not only that, but the enemy has a FAR greater critical hit chance on Heroic, to the point where nearly every hit causes a fire or a weapon, engine, shield, etc to temporarily or permanently become disabled. Even a master of naval strategy can only do so much against such overwhelming odds.  Worse, \u201cBreakthrough\u201d missions give the enemy AI (4) 12,000 unit range stationary guns with perfect accuracy spread evenly in a straight line across the map. After destroying all 4 turrets, you then have to get your line ships all the way across the map. Or... you would, if the game worked. Breakthrough is bugged so that when you destroy all the turrets, the objective doesn't update. You can only win by killing the entire enemy fleet. So it's cruiser clash, but with only half the map in use, and you STILL can't use stealth. The game explains how you can make sneak attacks and ambushes, then gives you no tools to actually accomplish such feats. There\u2019s difficulty and then there\u2019s madness. Battlefleet Gothic: Armada pits level 1 admirals against an armada of level 5 ships with extensive upgrades. \nIn addition to breakthrough, there's another mission where you have 120 seconds to destroy an enemy flagship before they warp out. The problem is that Battlefleet Gothic is meant to have a slower pace to it. Killing ships isn't easy and it takes 90 seconds just to cross from the middle of the map to the edge (which doesn't make sense since we're in space, but whateves. You need to destroy a flag ship in 2 minutes or you lose. The tutorial explains how you can stop a ship from warping out, but it's not 100% effective. So its perfectly possible to use the \"stop warp skill\" on an enemy 3 times and still fail to stop them. This was an incredibly poorly thoughout game mode with very little balance. It's only an insult to injury that another game mode did it right. In data collection, you use boarding actions to get onto the enemy's ship, steal their harddrives, and then be the first one to warp out. That level DOES work because the only action needed to steal the plans is some kind of boarding, either teleportation, boarding pods, or assault boats. You have lots of options and just landing the boarding action is an instant objective switch. \nThe point of this lengthy exercise is that the game has glimmers of brilliance, followed by long hauls of boredom and poor balancing. \n\nSo let\u2019s talk about those previously mentioned stealth upgrades. One skill causes ships to completely disappear until they fire their guns. So long as they\u2019re far enough away, ships can make a clean breakaway in this manner, repositioning or escaping off the map. Another skill dramatically reduces the detection range of enemy ships. You\u2019ll see AI abuse this skill and another that causes your ships to freeze for 15 seconds. Enemy AI will close in on you, board your ship, then use the sensor disruptor skill to disappear for a few seconds. They will continue to fire, but you are unable to target them as they have the hidden status. Since player stealth is completely ineffective against AI, you can\u2019t pull this same trick. I tried it numerous times. At a range of 6000 units, the enemy AI still fired on my ship after I used the sensor disruptor. \n\nSpeaking of firing on ships, its very clear Battlefleet Gothic should NOT have been an RTS. Why? Well your ships don\u2019t fire indefinitely. Every single weapon has a reload time between 4-17 seconds. Why is that a problem? Because you don\u2019t know when your macro-weapons and lance weapons will fire. There\u2019s no charge timer for your standard weapons, which severely limits your tactical input, which is all the more crippling when you can\u2019t use stealth skills. Take for example, the lances. Lances have a perfect accuracy, reduce armor to 25 on hit, can cause either temporary or permanent critical damage, can be upgraded to cut through shields, but have a 12+ second reload time. A small unintrusive timer, even a refill bar on the weapon\u2019s profile itself could have made all the difference in determining your next move. As it stands, your captains are flying blind while the enemy has 20/20 vision. \n\nI could go on and on and on about this game, about the critical hits and gamebreaking glitches but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already growing tired of the complaints. I will say this though: Battlefleet Gothic Armada does not respect your time. How so? The campaign is turn-based. You get 2-3 battle deployments per turns. If you don't use them all or if you fail a mission, the enemy becomes more powerful and invades more planetary systems (ala Dark Crusade's world map). HOWEVER the game only saves after you end your turn. Why is that a problem? Because a single mission in Battlefleet Gothic takes 12-20 minutes. So in order to reach a save point, you have to play and win a full hour of combat encouters, then end your turn. Aww what's that? You have to leave your precious computer because something important is happening in the real world? Well we'll have a good long hour to talk about it as you attempt turn 8 for the third time this week. \n\nI would recommend Battlefleet Gothic for its excellent gameplay and multiplayer. I would, but multiplayer is dead and Tau is OP. The only enemy left is a cheating fiend who knows where you are at all times, is always stronger than you, and arrives in far greater numbers than you can possibly deploy.

The art is beautiful, the voice acting is good(a rarity), the music is perfect, the sound effects are impactful and meaty, the UI is functional and straight to the point.\n\nSo it's just a shame the contents don't quite measure up. The issue can be summed up in three points:\n\nFirstly, a lack of feedback. In the interests of a slick UI, the game gives you very little feedback on your actions, in terms of, for instance, damage done. Sometimes attacks will do tons more damage than others, and it's hard to tell if it's down to how you executed them or a random roll of some sort.\n\nSecondly, speaking of the random rolls, the game is PAINFULLY random. Most missions are down to your deployment vs the enemy's deployment. Whether you can gobble them up piecemeal or end up in a painful face-to-face slog. Whether you can corner the assassination target, or whether it has a chance to run... and you deploy without being able to have any idea where the enemy is deploying. So success in missions is often down to deploying, seeing where the enemy ends up, and restarting if their deployment is completely unmanageable.\n\n(Oddly enough, while you can restart a mission as many times as you want while it's still going... if the loss conditions actually roll up, you're barred from trying again. Strange design decision.)\n\nLastly, the AI is boneheaded. Well-designed for a couple of factions(Orks, mostly), mediocre for some(Traitors and Chaos) and terrible for a few(for instance, the poor, poor Eldar. Ramming and knife-fighting range does not work as well with Eldar ships as it does with Ork ships!). This is mostly an issue when some missions split half your deployment points with, for instance, Eldar, who waste all of their points on suicidal rushes in the first thirty seconds of the game, leaving you outnumbered two to one(points-wise) against the enemy.\n\nEventually it just rolls up pretty unfun to play. \n\nI wouldn't recommend getting this unless it's REALLY on sale and you've got a LOT of patience.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505185222, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505185222, "recommendationid": "34894135", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504843", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1461882209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1469, "steamid": "76561197970916475", "num_games_owned": 460}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game, great campagin.

So... This 'review' is fairly mixed. Also, this is based on my experience of the campaign ONLY. I've not touched multiplayer at all, nor the Elite Mode, though I look forward to giving them a try.\n\nOn the plus side, it's nice to finally play a WH40K game that takes place in space, and the game itself plays fairly well. The campaign is fairly lengthy, but it doesn't overstay its welcome. There's also minor potential for replayability due to some choices you can make along the way. It definitely captures the grimdark of the setting as you play as the Imperial navy beset on all sides by Orks, Eldar, and Chaos, and having to choose which world you're going to defend [rarely having the resources to aid all of them]. I enjoyed myself pretty consistently throughout the campaign.\n\nNow on to the cons... Every mission you run is of a certain type, Cruiser Clash, Assassination, Breakthrough, Convoy, Data Retrieval, etc... A lot of my decisions about where to deploy were based entirely on what type of mission it was. Some of the mission types just aren't fun, imo. If I had to defend a convoy, I wouldn't run it. I'd do Assassination missions but I didn't like doing them if I was the attacker. Likewise for Data Retrieval [though I don't recall being the defender on that ever].\n\nThe reason for this is, partly because the enemy AI cheats, and partly because of how those missions are handled. I'll get back to the enemy AI cheating in a moment, but for the Assassination and Data Retrieval missions, you have to destroy a vessel, or run a boarding action on it to get the data before it warps out. You have about 3-ish minutes to do this before the warping out ability is off of cooldown. The enemy ships will spend the entire time running from you, which, okay, fair enough. You can also force an enemy's warp out to be aborted by performing a boarding action, which IF IT SUCCEEDS, will cancel their warp and put it on a brief cooldown. These missions are doable, but they're frustrating because you end up spending the whole mission rushing towards the enemy ship just so that you can get there in time to be in range to MAYBE succeed in cancelling their warp out.\n\nAs for the enemy AI cheating? Aside from them always knowing where you are, even though they shouldn't, there's fleet limits. Each mission you can field a fleet of 300-700 points-worth of ships. So for a 300 point mission you could bring 2 Light Cruisers, and 2 escort vessels. Or a Light Cruiser, and 5-6 escort vessels. There's other various combinations you could bring, but the cheapest non-escort vessel you can bring is the Dauntless Light Cruiser at 105 points each. Ships get more expensive as you move up the tiers. The point is, because the cheapest non-escort vessel you can bring is 105 points, on a 300-point mission you can only bring 2. But the enemy - who should be on the same points-limit as you - will bring 3 Light Cruisers, and some escort ships. Or some other combination of ships whose points exceed the limit. I'm not referring to missions where it's stated you're fighting a superior force, or you're aiding an ally. I'm referring to missions where it's explicitly stated that you should be on equal footing with the enemy's forces.\n\nAnd finally, the cost of the DLC factions seems a bit high to me. It's not as bad as the DLC factions for say... Blood Bowl 2 [whose faction DLCs are technically cheaper, but there's more of them], but I dunno. They seem a little pricey. My opinion here might be coloured somewhat by there being Space Marines ships already in the base game, though of course you can't play them. This point is, more than the other points I've made here, pretty subjective.\n\nI know this 'review' seems overly negative, but really, it's easy to focus on the negatives, since they'll stick out at you more than a good thing. I'm still clicking the \"recommend\" button, because I *did* enjoy this game. Quite a bit, actually.
