They focus on what's fun for them to develop rather than actually tackling issues and really useable features. So you are left to find a weird way around these issues or find some plugin that is still hopefully supported. \n\nThere are a ton of issues that I could list, but I think it's best summed up with this: The developers have come to rely on the community as a crutch and an excuse not to turn RPG maker into something insanely powerful. They lack the foresight to see that if they would just make thier engine more powerful, they wouldn't have to hurry and push out crap addon-DLCs to try and pay thier bills. \n\nIs this program worth it? Not at full price. Yes there are plenty of awesome games that have been made in RPG maker, but not without an INSANE amount of modding to the main client with plugins. \n\nIts not meant for large scale projects as the variable, switch, and event interface is really only built to be readable and usable when those items exist in small numbers.\n\nSome might read this and say that if you want to make a game you should learn to program and using plugins should just be expected. If that's you're reaction, you've missed the point here, I agree, that is true, but it is also true that without the support of those that make the plugins AND DONT GET PAID FOR IT, RPG Maker would sink. That's not a sustainable model, that's not very fair, and relying on others to make your program usable isn't very good programming. \n\nUnless you are ready to:\n-Hope and pray that there is a plugin that does what you want it to AND is stull supported\n-Learn or already know JS and then study the API(which has been compiled by the community, again...lazy)\n-Jerry-rig most of the advanced features you want into working,\n\nthen move on to another engine.\n\nNow as a little note here at the end, I feel that I am obligated to state that I enjoy this program a lot and will likely continue to use it. Not because it's amazing, but because I enjoy a challenge. Much like kids who have banded togehter to survive under the oppressive overbearance of unfit parents, the community here has banded together to survive and accomplish something great. The shitty parents will likely take the credit for their kids accomplishments, claiming that without them, none of this would be possible, which is true....but not to the extent that we owe them anything for the hard work that we put in. \n\nBottom line?\nThe community is fucking amazing, I love the support, encouragement and involvement from them.\nF the devs, they're garbage.\nDon't pay full price, they don't deserve it.\nGiving a thumbs down to be honest and to provide some reason for potential buyers to read through the reviews.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504895120, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504895317, "recommendationid": "34820332", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776096", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1474989798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 832, "steamid": "76561198045468592", "num_games_owned": 564}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you're looking for a tool to make a basic RPG than this is for you.

I will make several comparisons with VX Ace, the only other RPG Maker I have used, but you don't need to have used VX Ace to understand this review.\n\nRPG Maker MV allows you to make an RPG through the use of a few major tools. The first and most obvious is the map-maker, wherein one simply draws on a grid to make the map. Different types of tiles can be used, as well as background objects such as rocks and pillars. Passability of tiles (both absolute and directional) can be altered, as well as making damaging floors, and those that partially obscure your body, akin to bushes or water. Unlike in VX Ace, it is possible to layer multiple objects on top of one another without using events, though this sometimes happens accidentally. The aforementioned events can also be placed on the map, taking the form of intreractable characters or objects, or invisible spots that cause other things to happen. The event system, while not all-powerful, is fairly robust, and can do quite a few things without any coding knowledge whatsoever.\n\nNext up is the database, which stores all of the data needed for the game, such as party members, enemy types, attack animations, skills, system settings, and more. All of these things are fairly easy to use, though making custom attack animations still takes a bit of work. Unlike in VX Ace, preset battle and menu text (e.g. [enemy name] emerged!) can be freely altered from the database. Like VX Ace, however, enemy A.I. is still somewhat simplistic. This can likely be remedied through the use of plugins.\n\nPlugins are another major component of game design (unless you simply choose not to use them). There are numerous plugins made by the community, and I'm pretty sure that a few come with the program itself, though all of them should be free to download. The functions of plugins are so numerous and diverse that I cannot possibly cover them here. Basically, if there's something you want to do, and the base program isn't capable of doing it, there's probably a plugin somewhere than can bridge that gap.\n\nUnlike in VX Ace, one thing you [i]don't[/i] need a plugin for is a side-view battle system. Side-view battles are supported by default, and you can opt to use them instead of the standard first-person view.\n\nLike VX Ace, however, RPG Maker MV features a character creator. This can be used to create new sprites and face graphics for characters in your game if you don't want to use preset ones. It also lets you export sprites for use in side-view battles. The character creator here has more options than the one in VX Ace, including more precise coloration (you can often color different parts of an outfit separately) and much better looking face graphics.\n\nIt should be noted that you can always import custom character sprites from outside the editor if you want to make something the character creator can't, as well as outside assets for map tiles, music, sound effects, attack animations, enemy battlers, and pretty much everything else. If you're willing to put in the effort, you can make a game using none of the default assets whatsoever. Of course, that assumes that you can actually find/make custom assets for everything, but there are some free-to-use assets out there on the internet for those of us who can't make them by ourselves.\n\nOn a technical level, MV has a higher resolution than VX Ace, and uses larger sprites. If you want to use sprites from VX Ace, you'll either have to carefully resize them, or use a plugin to alter the default tile size. Another technical aspect where MV differs form VX Ace is performance, Unfortunately, I cannot say that MV performs particularly better than VX Ace; despite how slow Ruby can sometimes be, the coding for MV seems to be even [i]slower[/i] and, in my experience, has [i]more[/i] lag than VX Ace. Perhaps this lag only occurs during testing, and not the actual game, but it seems that the lag, at least on weaker computers, is a noticeable drawback.\n\nIn terms of preset assets, the music is numerous and varied, though it seems that not every tune is loaded into a project by default, so you may have to manually hunt those down. Many of them have a less video-gamey feel than the music from VX Ace; whether or not that is a good thing comes down to personal preference. The graphical assets for maps may actually look slightly [i]less[/i] appealing than those of VX Ace, despite being fairly similar to them. Character assets are of decent quality, though nothing mind-blowing.\n\nOverall, RPG Maker MV is a fairly powerful tool, though plugins will be needed to achieve the full extent of that power. Also, because MV provides virtually no preset database entries (whereas VX Ace had numerous pre-designed skills, weapons, and enemies) you will need to have ideas and the ability to balance the game around an arbitrary starting point in order to actually make something. Playtesting is key; if you test it enough, it will eventually work out all right. There is a little bit of an initial learning curve to master the event system, but once you figure it out, it will be easy to use. The only real inherent weakness is that gameplay will experience lag on weaker computers. Any other weakness or shortcoming can probably be overcome with the right plugin.\n\n[b]TLDR;[/b] RPG Maker MV is fairly strong and versatile, just don't expect to start churning out high-quality games overnight. It doesn't quite work miracles, but it can still do quite a bit if you're willing to put in the effort.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506653700, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506881764, "recommendationid": "35280350", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506335", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506663797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1088, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1135, "steamid": "76561198145846100", "num_games_owned": 16}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So I've been wanting to develop and make a game for a while and I can do it thanks to this.

This shows that the engine is capable of making commercial quality games, despite the limitations.\"\n\nNow for the limitations. One of the main issues with RPG maker is that every single RPG maker game looks the same. People can say how different the graphics are until their faces turn blue, but when a game is made with RPG maker you just know. The lack of resources and the overpriced content are enough to force the realisation, that their product feels and very much so is incomplete. Often times the dlc doesn't even work or run as they seem to forget to test the products they are pushing on the market place. \n\n#2 The dlc you purchase has to be added in pain stakingly into any project you create which can take a whole hour just draging and dropping the files into the correct folders, and even after you've done this often times the DLC doesn't work or show up in the editor leaving one to figure out whats gone wrong.\n\n#3 It does support the mobile platforms. However creating and running a project \"IE compiling it to get it to run properly is a giant headache in itself (often full of errors or exceptions that lead to crashes or an un-responsive game or even missing content)\"\n\n#4 It feels like a glorified map maker, but not very useful for anything else other than traditional top-down, side view rpg's, Theres no ability to use or create 3D or realtime combat games. Again this falls mostly on to the limitations of the engine and the content which is very very lacking for the price.\n\n#5 You need photoshop or G.I.M.P to create tilesets due to lack of resources or you find yourself correcting or even improving the resources supplied with the Maker itself. Although yes you can use resources from VX you'll again find that everything looks the same unless you are capable of spending hours in photoshop to create your own tilesets and character sprites. \n\nmy finaly thoughts are, its a great entry level into game design, and gives you an adequate idea of what you need to create a basic game with very minimal work. But it's short comings are that every game, feels just that basic and you'll spend more time and effort creating scripts or content than building a game or creating a story plot, even on sale it feels lacking and unworthy for its price range when you consider other engines like Unity 3D, or even ren.py for simple graphic novels \"which is free and open sourced\" it feels like a pushed unpolished engine that has potential\nbut was rushed on to the scene without being finished.\n\nSorry but it's maybe worth 10$ at most and i mean that including the dlc which feels like it should have been released with the engine.
