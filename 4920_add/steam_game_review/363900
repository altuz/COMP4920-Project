I found the map confusing to navigate and wasn't sure where I should be going. I just got too bored to try and work it out. I only paid 36p ($0.5) for it but I knew I would never play it again so I asked for a refund. \n\nI would definitely try before you buy though, especially if you like colourful puzzle games. That's what is so good about the refund policy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499645506, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499645506, "recommendationid": "33418295", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507573", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
