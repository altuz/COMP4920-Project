I was surprisingly wrong. It does get repetative after a while, the same sequences unfold over and over; you find a survivor, they become part of your group after they rest, they send you on some insane mission. The characters each have a different personality. The storyline is okay, they put effort into making it enjoyable. I haven't died yet so I didn't experience the permadeath starting over but that would probably make this feel worse.\n\nPros:\nChoices affect the storyline\nBattle system is enjoyable\nUpgradable people and gear\nHaven't ran into any bugs or issues\nAchievements, controller support (although navigating the menus and everything are so much easier without a controller), and trading cards\n\nCons:\nGets repetative (They offer a variety of different missions, enemies, weapons, and areas but they all start to blend into the same things)\nOnce you get a group of people leveled, going through all the areas becomes a cakewalk\nIt's definitelty a phone port, and it's over 3 times the price on steam (I bought it on sale so I got my money's worth)\n\nIf you like turn based rpg's, are a fan of zombies, and have time to kill then this game is definitely for you\n8/10 will continue to play \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506736884, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506736884, "recommendationid": "35319222", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503091", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489979557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 416, "steamid": "76561198010493357", "num_games_owned": 555}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "tl;dr: Not great, but it's good, and I don't regret buying it.\n\n---------\n\n10/10 would laugh hysterically at a high-level enemy with low health using Clamp Jaw and killing itself without dealing damage again.\n\nFor real though, this is a pretty solid Survival RPG.\n\nThere are plenty of annoyances:\n-Enemies that get a first strike in combat and like to use it to stun a party member.\n-Thieves that steal large quantities of resources (like roughly 50% of your stock of them), forcing you to chase them through numerous areas, possibly into areas too difficult for you to handle.\n-Only having six slots for healing items, and not being able to just use a new healing item if you don't have space for it (Carrying six medkits, no party members under 80% health and find a burger? Too bad, leave the burger to rot).\n-Speaking of your healing item capacity, sodas, cake slices and burgers stack 50 to a slot, but other items don't. So basically, a single syringe or a small medkit takes up the same amount of space and weighs as much 50 cans of soda, 50 slices of cake or 50 hamburgers. Uh... huh...\n-Character that has no skill with rifles gives you a difficult side mission (though thankfully not time-limited, like 99% of the missions) to get a sick-awesome AK, then insists on being the only one who can use it, and if you give it to someone else, she throws a hissy fit and leaves forever, keeping any items she had equipped.\n\nHowever, I do like it enough that I also bought it on mobile (It costs a fraction of the price on mobile, but does have some technical issues the PC version doesn't, such as chugging pretty bad before and after battles, and apparantly crashes on some devices, though I haven't personally had any crashes), and I don't buy a game on multiple platforms unless I find it very enjoyable.\n\nI do think that, provided they iron out the wrinkles, it's kind of better as a mobile game than a PC game. Still, I consider this a good example of why it's generally better to make something for PC then port it to mobile, rather than the other way around. I mean, there's a reason why most people say 'mobile port' in a voice dripping with loathing. Okay, probably not most people, but still, you get my point, yes?\n\nIt may not be as grand a project as something from the Final Fantasy series, nor as brilliantly written as the Telltale Walking Dead games, but as a turn-based RPG with a twist of survival that tries to do something with zombies that isn't an FPS... 's pretty good.\n\nI do kinda feel that being 3D maybe hurts the game a bit, I think it might stand out more if it was 2D with an interesting artstyle. More variation between enemies and party members would be appreciated, since several enemies are are basically just reskinned versions of previous ones (or, in the case of a Rager variant, with a fire particle effect on it. Also, sad you didn't call it a Burning Rager, because, y'know... just do it. Just Burning Ragers!).\n\nScratches my TBRPG itch without being so long that I'll probably never finish it. Not sure if I'd say it's quite worth $15, $10 or so seems more reasonable for what you get, so maybe buy it on sale.\n\n... But seriously, let me use newly found healing items without needing to stuff them in my limited inventory first. I don't even care if you balance it out by making food items not stack, I just don't want to have to leave things behind just because it's a waste to use what I have.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506618021, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506618592, "recommendationid": "35266324", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500610", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506935264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 495, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 495, "steamid": "76561198064267583", "num_games_owned": 551}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very addictive, nice balance of developing your characters and progressing the story.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506925747, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506925747, "recommendationid": "35406769", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500487", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506740419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1053, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1373, "steamid": "76561198324741415", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "fun if you like grinding enemies. really difficult until youve died a few times and upgradeded your start", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506010445, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506010445, "recommendationid": "35108188", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500317", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506118133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 840, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 840, "steamid": "76561198009901970", "num_games_owned": 453}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm enjoying it, yeah.
