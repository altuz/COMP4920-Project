Enemy patterns are very repetitive and static, while small ships quite often have A LOT of health and won't die unless you hit them with both missiles. Which means in most cases you just eyeball a safe spot on the screen, and just stay there for a minute while holding fire. Game has health system but there's no visible indication that you're being hit, so while you stay in your safe spot you watch the health bar instead of the screen. There's no scoring system or anything, enemy ships drop credits for weapon upgrades, small enemies drop the same amount of credits as the large ones do, so there's no point in killing larger enemies.\n\nBosses aren't fun either, they're just huge potatoes floating on the screen, shotting in fixed directions. It feels like they just don't see you/don't care about you, and the only challenge is not getting squished by the aforementioned space potato.\n\nPlayer controls have some small inertia, it wouldn't be much of a big deal if not for the gimmicky Shifter mechanics this game has. Basically, you can teleport to one of the four fixed points on the screen by pressing shift and corresponding movement key. Except that if your ship is moving while you press shift, it'll teleport instantly based on your ship's movement direction, even if you released all movement keys and ship is moved by intertia. Because of that, it often makes you teleport into enemy fire or ships and die, so there's no reason to use it, unless you really have to.\n\nCamera keeps chaning angle, messing with your perception of where the enemies and their shots are. Your ship is confined to a 2D rectangle in space, so most of the time you can't even use the whole screen to dodge/move because camera angle tricks you into thinking that you have more space.\n\nOverall it's just not fun, I can't be bothered finishing the whole thing, but I assume it's also very short. There's no replayability or challenge since there's no scoring and game is generous with checkpoints. One could try and do the achievements for no-damage runs, but it's basically fighting game's camera and controls instead of actual challenge.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491656480, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491658362, "recommendationid": "31017096", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503922", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 8}}
