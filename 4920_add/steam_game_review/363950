I will also use The Legend of Zelda as a good reference point in several aspects because that is what the game wants to be like.\n[h1] TL;DR: \t[/h1]\nIt is a gorgeous game with great exploration and ideas that are ruined by flaws in combat, effectively no way of interacting with your environment or obtaining new items to allow you to complete puzzles or interact with your environment and exploring the world with too much walking especially in the desert area of the game. \n\nI have seen lots of reviews saying that this is like a 3D like Zelda game with exploration and good combat. Honestly, yea i can see it and I enjoy the art style and the overall feel of the game. It just isn't polished or really fun and loses its charm after the first dungeon. The dungeons honestly are the most fun part about it.\n[h1] The combat [/h1] \nThe combat gets repetetive and although you feel the impact of your swings it all turns into circle the enemy and charge your attacks, swing, and repeat until it's dead. The first boss was challenging although somewhat too difficult until I found out you can just pause the game, eat food or chug potions, and run around while your health regens. The food isn't difficult to make because with enough time you can just run around the main character's home and makes stacks of infinite food. Then one boss was literally wait around until its weak point comes out, but he doesn't let his actual attackable spot out of his body until a repetetive cycle of move a quarter around a circle and shoot a ball of arcane magic literally about 7 times in a row and it takes forever. It took nearly 4 to 5 cycles of this just to defeat this boss. It was by far the most boring fight and easiest because you literally just stop and when he shoots the ball, you move to the side. \n\n[h1] The exploration [/h1] \nI am going to give the game and the devs huge props on making a gorgeous world that you want to explore. I am however, going to complain that it takes forever to walk to places and this is most noticeable in the desert. Literally dunes of sand and lots of walking back and forth which is just unecessary or can be resolved by adding a horse or faster method of travel. You have a sprint, but you sprint, stop to let it charge back up, sprint more, and repeat. When your stamina runs out you walk slower than you originally were walking. Traveling in this gorgeous world is painful and takes so long. Then, after completing your objective you have to walk slowly through the same area to get back or sometimes you compelte the objective, walk back to get your next objective and are told to walk through the exact same place you just were at. Another idea to fix this issue is maybe let the player teleport to totems or waypoints from the map after discovering and saving at one. This would eliminate walking through the area you just got done walking through for the 3rd time.\n\n[h1] Crafting and Equipment [/h1] \nCrafting is cool. Until you make iron stuff then everything else is useless until gold which again makes everything else useless. There are only 3 types of magic and they all do the same thing except do a different type of damage and there is literally just a weak and strong version which do the same thing and look the same except maybe adds a new visual effect. 4th magic spell that acts like a grapple hook, but you only use it in the final dungeon and is only useable on these weird blue squares instead of being able to use it anywhere like the grapple hook. So pretty useless\n\nAlso, in the Legend of Zelda you had items that let you interact with your environment or even use them in combat. You don't get that in this game. You don't have a boomerang, you can't use ice magic to freeze water and make platforms. You can't get a sand wand that builds up blocks of sand to climb to higher platforms. You get your same basic fighting with simple magic that is effectively another method of killing your enemy instead of circling around them with your sword you will shoot magic, run back some few feet and shoot magic and rinse and repeat. \n\nTHE GAME IS NOT DONE (That or I ran into a game breaking bug and I am assuming it is the former) -  I Know it is early Access but it has been released for a year and there are only like 2 areas mainly and the Desert isn't even done. With no indication to this,[spoiler]  you get to a part where you go to a pyramid with some ancient key and go to each corner of this big ass pyramid to get 4 artifacts and then run back to the guy in front of the pyramid for him to not say anything new or let you in the pyramid. \t[/spoiler]\nEDIT: IT IS A FUCKING BUG WHERE THE KEY IS REMOVED FROM YOUR INVENTORY SO YOU HAVE TO RUN ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE OTHER FUCKING SIDE OF THE GOD DAMN MAP TO GET THE KEY. THEN YOU RUN ALL THE WAY THE FUCK BACK AND OPEN THE PYRAMID NOW. WHY IS THIS STILL NOT FIXED???!?!?!? GUESS WHAT THE FINAL BOSS IS. YOU WALK AROUND AND CHARGE YOUR FIREBALL AND SPAM IT AND WIN EASILLY. I AM REALLY PISSED BECAUSE YOU TALK TO A FUCKING ORB AND THE DIALOGUE SOFT LOCKS YOUR GAME AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PROGRESS. SO IS THE GAME DONE?!?! I DON'T FUCKING KNOW!\n\nOverall, it's beautiful and somewhat unique at the begining of the game. The combat gets boring, the puzzles are simple, the exploration is fun and cool until you get these unecessary long distances that bore you out of your mind because most of the time you are back tracking or going to this area with no purpose whatsoever except to look nice. ALSO, THE END IS BROKEN. IS IT THE END? I DON'T KNOW STILL\nI would hold off on this game until further development is made or some of it is ironed out. Or maybe until the game is done. It is a one man project though, but I don't think the game is worth its asking price right now.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500525180, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501692407, "recommendationid": "33665032", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505306", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 40, "total_reviews": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
