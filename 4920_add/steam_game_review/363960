After a google search it turns out this is an app ported like I suspected. \n\nAs it is it definitely feels like a ripoff when the game is free on mobile. The hilarious part is they've kept the bits of the game that were clearly meant to get you to pay money to make the game easier and now they are just there as either a really dumb mechanic or an unreasonably costly character that was clearly meant to be purchased in the app which has microtransactions while this port does not. This healer character is available from the start for 25k gold...which isn't really feasible unless you opt to not upgrade your guys. Honestly though you won't require the upgrades the combat is ridiculously easy the only reason I died once was because I wanted to see how the death system works. This is it: your character dies on the field and a gravestone drops there, you click on gravestone whenever you want and pay gold to resurrect him instantly....The game still has the exact same pay2win mechanic of letting you instant resurrect characters mid-battle for currency even though it is ported onto a pc without any microtransaction system, they clearly couldn't be bothered to give it any semblance of a challenge but just throwing away the resurrection in battle option completely.\n \nOnto the game itself:\n\nGeneral gameplay: Bad. Abilities are dull and damage values make no sense, your monk has a healing touch ability which damages enemies or heals allies. Now this ability is somehow able to damage regular humans but does less slightly damage than his basic staff attack, this would be okay if the holy spells annihilated the undead they are meant for. In reality when you do use holy abilities on undead enemies you get a slight damage increase that a lot of times is completely unncessary. \n\nThe UI is clunky, it's clearly designed for a phone and the friggin bottom part doesn't even fit the screen properly. The gold counter at the top during battle areas is halfway offscreen so you can only see the bottom half. Oh, did I mention the game feels a need to throw up a loading screen every single time you end your turn for no good reason? It's doing nothing but calculating the enemy's next move so why can't it just have a little animation saying loading at the corner like every other game? Especially when two thirds of the bottom of your screen are available because the ui is so badly placed. \n\nAudio is just as bad, there is an attempt to make the game stereo but barely, characters and sfx are either in one audio channel or the other. When a character is walking and the camera is following him while he talks this results in the audio literally jumping back and forth between both sides a couple times in a second while the other side's dialogue disappears completely. \n\nGraphics: Again, not good. It looks like your standard facebook fantasy game, a background and then a sprite laid on top which looks out of place. The sprites are admittedly not bad lookingt but they are very, very low resolution. If you even zoom in a little you can see the blur which is fine because I play zoomed all the way out to avoid the ugly.,, that is until the game forces me to see it. Sometimes when your enemy attacks it zooms in to show them, why? The models are blurry as hell why on earth would you choose to zoom in and show the low resolution models along with the glitchy animations?\n\nWhich brings us to the glitchy animations, for starters all the characters in the game float. Not because of magic but because it's easier than a walking animation. Even characters that say they are walking clearly just glide across the floor while their feet drag behind them liike they were either sliding on ice or a puppet getting dragged along. Now for attacking, when units shoot at each other instead of just shooting directly at each other the game decides to throw in the animation at whichever one of the six sides makes the most sense to it. Half the time this results in the arrows coming in from a completely different direction than the person who shot it. Okay, that's somewhat tolerable, now here's the kicker: the game makers couldn't be bothered to flip the sprites when they move or attack. This means in a firefight you can have the two guys literally looking and firing away from each other while arrows are doing sharp 90 degree turns to hit enemies, \n\nThe plot is dull and lackluster and the one saving grace is the narrator that does the major cutscenes is decent but the devs even manage to screw that up by screwing up the timing between audio clips and creating awkward gaps of silence in order to show off some ugly animation that bears no relevance to the plot. \n\nDon't buy this game it isn't worth it right now 40% off and it definitely won't be worth it at full price, if you really want to play it do it on mobile for free.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444372605, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444372864, "recommendationid": "18391979", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671825", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444275661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 60, "steamid": "76561197970807880", "num_games_owned": 530}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I like turn based strategy with action points, in fact XCOM is one of my favorite games. Although Devils and Demons is in this category it failed to capture my attention within the first hour. During my play time the units I controlled vastly overpowered the enemies to the point where just going straight in without strategy will still win every battle. I understand it being like this for the first battle, but not after an hour into the game. In one random encounter I was faced with two enemies against my two heroes. The loading screen lasted longer than the battle. Even in encounters the enemies came in waves and did not usually outnumber the heroes. I might have been more patient to see if things picked up, but the animations play out too slow, and I felt the spells, abilities, and story were just not interesting. Also, there is no way to scroll the camera and sometimes you need to - either the camera is not centered on your unit so you can't see where you are going, or the camera does not cover the area you want to go. This last issue made the game unplayable for me, because even things later work out I won't be able to play without being able to control my units consistently.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444277093, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444277093, "recommendationid": "18378303", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518843", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478458444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 617, "steamid": "76561197982893207", "num_games_owned": 1410}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Know what to expect (a light turn-based hack-and-slash game) and it's great :)\nIt's been ported but there are no extra purchases or ingame store or anything.\n\nThe enemies are nice and varied and actually pose a challenge.\n\nSo far for me the amount of gold you find is balanced just right so you have to make choices on what skills to upgrade.\nThe story is entertaining enough but nothing special (yet).\n\nThere are possible side-quest and a main story, with random encounters during world map travel (which is automated).\n\nEvery character has 3 different skills, and there are quite a number of different characters.\n\nAs I said, I am enjoying it.

This game is so booring that I feel wrong recommending it.\n\nOriginal Review:\nThis game come as close to not passing a recommendation as it gets for me. 4/10 is my rating, but with an upwards tilt for nostalgia.\n\nD&D most closely resemble the old Hero Quest boardgame (and its computer adaptions). You walk around on a small location with 2 action points per hero per turn that can be used for attack or movement. Tactics is a matter of positioning and whom to attack with what hero. That's the whole game, really. The most appealing aspect of D&D, like hero quest, is the props. Atmospheric bookshelves, old descs filled with vials and recepies, and other pieces. Some of them can be looted, which was is an upgrade from the boardgame. There is also a very minimalistic character building system, that only have any relevance because the resource you use for the few upgrades available is scarce (atleast at the start when you may want to pay a fortune for the extra character).\n\nMy biggest gripe is the pace of the game. With a rather time-consuming search-system, I spend more time walking from tile to tile just to see if there is something there than actually playing out the scenario. The dialogue between the heroes consist of different ways of formulating the scentence \"Let's go get the bad-guys\".\n\nOtherways it's a cute, simplistic and relaxing little game. If you don't get as bored as me playing it, it may be just up your alley, which is why I recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444365517, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447496515, "recommendationid": "18391217", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498259", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496080300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 296, "steamid": "76561198060473189", "num_games_owned": 165}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I enjoy this game very easy to play and entertaining.
