At first it is very easy to progress and it becomes much faster once you get a couple of Hero Souls by Ascending. There is alot more strategy than one might expect from a free game. You must decide who to upgrade, which skills to buy, which things to spend you Hero Souls on, which things to spend your Ancient Souls on, when to Ascend, when to Transcend, which heroes to Gild, what missions to send your mercenary, to revive or bury your mercenary, which clan to join, and much more! A great game to just waste some time without spending money. It's free, why not give it a try?\n\n[b] This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: [/b]\n[url=]http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\t[/url]\n\n[b] Once we have a 100 followers on our group there will be a game giveaway, but only the followers have a chance to win.

However, if you decide to be so open-minded as to actually play the game before judging it, suddenly your a** will be glued to your chair, you just can't stop playing. Seems familiar? Can relate?
