Those customers' stories are usually both dark and funny.\n\nAs in CAVYHOUSE's previous game, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/320090/This_Starry_Midnight_We_Make/]This Starry Midnight We Make[/url] (which is also a very interesting game with a strange concept, taking place in the same universe, that I should have reviewed earlier if I was not so lazy), the artwork is somewhat average, but the colors and visual patterns really enhance the atmosphere despite (or thanks to?) their minimalism. All in all it contributes to the whole \"doujin\" feel of the game (even though it might not look like it, this was a compliment, not criticism).\n\n+ Weird concept used as a basis to weave strange tales\n+ Patterns and colors straight out of an acid trip\n+ The true ending. There's a plot twist in it. It's hard to say more without spoiling it.\n+ The lizard sound. You'll hear it a lot. Either you'll love it like I do or it will send you to the brink of madness.\n\n- Extremely grindy (since it's a clicker game, that's to be expected)\n- Animal sounds can turn into a real cacophony. I didn't care, but if you play with someone else in the room, you may end up murdered.\n\n7/10 Generic gameplay, great setting, trippy visuals.

Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE sucker for those games. Can play them all day every day without getting bored. The click based system is one that isn't a stranger to us all. We've all dealt with a game that had to deal with sitting and feel like you are bored to death, but in reality it starts to become a relaxing time.\n\nYou aren't feeling rushed, and you can go at your own pace on evolving the storyline or not. Seriously, if you wanted you could probably just stay on the first chapter to get all the achievements in the game - well some of the achievements. The color palette that's used for this game aren't overbearing on your eyes, they are bright, but also toned down to the pastel kind of deal that still catch your attention, without making you wanna gouge your eyeballs out. The artstyle is simply well done to the point of having the different gradiant variations down to the T. I am a sucker for that too. Theshadingtoo!\n\nThere is enough tasks for you to do that will keep your attention, but as well you get so lost in going at your own pace you end up forgetting what task you were on anyways. The music is quiet enough that it becomes background noise, but enough that if you tune in hard enough you can hear it and just resets you back into a zen like state. The different characters that you come across all have something that you can relate to, and make your emotions swell just a bit with each time they come around again.\n\nGameplay is pretty straight forward and when something new comes along its really easy to understand. Not to mention this game deals with harvesting organs, like what game can you play that actually involves this stuff. None that I can think of. Again, as much as the game is repetivie you just start getting addicted to it - just like with the Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing franchise. Where you tell yourself you will stop playing and before you know it, another five (5) hours have gone by. It starts becoming addictive without you fully realise it till the hours go by.\n\nI've just recently finished going on my first playthrough and I'm about to do another round when I get the time to do so. The game is highly addictive despite the repeating nature. The different storylines keep you on your toes, as well with all the seperate tasks and achievements at hand. You will have enough to keep you occupied for a long time now.\n\n10/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501299163, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501299163, "recommendationid": "33871568", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501989558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1355, "steamid": "76561198269286031", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Best clicker game, the achivements are easy, and story is well written.
