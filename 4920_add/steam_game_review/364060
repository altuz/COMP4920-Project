I'm a fan of the indie platformers and willing to try most things under $20 if they are justified. I honestly hoped to find more to this local multiplayer game but after under an hour on single player mode I'm having a difficult time.\n\nThe missions are similar to early smash brothers target practice modes, 'avoid getting hit' speed runs, general control testing and advanced versions of target practice. Beating modes with ranks C or above means moving onto the next set of missions (eventually resulting in alternate stage layouts), B and above means alternate costumes, A and S rank means concept art. Beating all mission types and levels unlocks hardmode and credits.\n\nIf this game goes under 60% on sales and you host video game parties comfortably with steam then pick this game up for variety, otherwise I can't reccomend this for single players who require online multi-player more often than not.\nThe art style is very cute and I greatly support the people at the previously mentioned podcast.\n\n1 Anime/5 Animes", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457282888, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457282888, "recommendationid": "21668894", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493111", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482201412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 314, "steamid": "76561198074476689", "num_games_owned": 21}, "votes_funny": 23, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this game is absolutely amazing, it is a great party game but i wish it had online multiplayer. 10/10 would play intead of do homework", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440547144, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440547144, "recommendationid": "17716963", "language": "english", "votes_down": 48, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452483", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500675569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 123, "steamid": "76561198087236236", "num_games_owned": 322}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game is very fun, but it only has local multiplayer that you need controlers for and the controls don't work very well on pc.
