I was dead wrong. (Get it? Zombies.) The developer actually made 1000 amps, a game I fully recommend along with this game, but let's talk about SRSZS game already.\n\nSpace Robot Samurai Zombie Slayer is the best combination of mindless clicking and fast thinking. The game has two parts to it, a user friendly movement system that any newcomer can get used to and a high paced skill oriented score system that any competitive soul could get involved in. The way certain enemies attack is frightening to new players but can be utilized by veterans to max out combos. The game doesn\u2019t throw any new weapons, upgrades or DLC cheats your way. It\u2019s just you, your skill, and zombies. The addictive gameplay and price tag along are worth a look. \n\nDuring my time reviewing the game, I eventually found myself on the top 10 worldwide. So tell me fellow gamer, how many zombies can you kill?\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434752238, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434752238, "recommendationid": "16536673", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498524668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 22, "steamid": "76561198306303230", "num_games_owned": 84}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This Game is Very Simple Click to Click Gameplay, I recommend it for Younger Children as its not to Violent and very easy to learn how to play my Nephews play this game and are 4 and play it easily even a 2yr old can play this game its simple play though is why i recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499284738, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499284738, "recommendationid": "33289008", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
