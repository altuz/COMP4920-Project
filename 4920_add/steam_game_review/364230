Enjoy :) [/quote]\n\nLucius Demake is a game developed and published by Shiver Games. Lucius Demake is what it says in the title, it is a remake of Shiver Games' mediocre game Lucius, but instead of remaking it into something better, they decided to make it into an 80's/90's game which I thoroughly enjoyed\n\nOverall, the game is not bad. The game does have its moments but behind those great moments, it did have some major flaws. The story, its okay. It follows Lucius' storyline to the book with no additional changes to the story\n\nIt's basically about Satan's little devil helper Lucius who kills everyone in his family to reap the souls for his actual \"father\", whilst all these accidental murders are happening the family starts falling into despair and the experts baffled by all these occurences. Its something like the classic movie 'The Exorcist'\n\nGameplay, its okay. The game focuses on puzzles, with a little stealth thrown into the mix, the puzzles are okay but nothing ground breaking\n\nThe subtitles... oh, the subtitles. Now, when I play games, I like to have subtitles on, just to see what the characters are saying in case I can't hear them, but, what really pisses me off is when a developer does not check the spelling mistakes and the punctuation fixes! It makes the game look unprofessional!\n\nOverall the game is not bad and is actually better than it's sub-par original game Lucius or it's awful sequel Lucius II\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499994120, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499994120, "recommendationid": "33525435", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456091", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 27, "total_reviews": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
