When I edit in photoshop I have to manually go back and fix noise, and sharpness. The auto feature in photoshop just makes it this disugsting white and grainy photo.

The speed changing barely works, and it took me a while to even get it to do anything. I then decided if I cut the video and then exported it, I could change the speed in the new one so the music would be synced. I figured doing thta would make it so I can edit the song right. I shouldn't have had to, though, because everything was synced, just slower. Then, when I spent 10 minutes to export it to my edited videos folder, since my computer is extremely slow and could barely do anything, it exported to a folder a deleted a while ago, so it basically was doing nothing. I had tried to change the folder multiple times, and this time it even asked me where I wanted to put it. I told it where to put it, and instead, it put it in the folder that didn't exist, so therefore the file did not exist. I am not at all satisfied with the speed editing not even really working right. Please do not buy this software if you plan to edit the speed of videos. You also should have a computer more powerful than they say you should. I have a two core 1.9 GHz, so I would recommend mayber just a 3 GHz or higher two core, but 4 core would help. I am very unhappy, since this is money that I could have spent on something that worked.
