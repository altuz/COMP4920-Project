This is only the 2nd game I've ever refunded: the first was because it got much cheaper. The devs have done a day 1 (2?) patch and supposedly addressed some of the issues in the review, namely volume of sound effects, facing issues and bump to destroy barrels. This is not an early access game and I stand by my initial review: I don't think they would have fixed these issues without my bad review. Even with these fixes the game would still be bad and I don't recommend it.\n\nI have done them the favour of mentioning these fixes in my review but like I said, this is not an early access game and it is fair to review the game as it was launched on steam and I shouldn't feel obligated to not refund it and to bear with it while they fix or don't fix any issues I find.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444453319, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444526630, "recommendationid": "18405891", "language": "english", "votes_down": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636851", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504390753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 5564, "steamid": "76561198011891156", "num_games_owned": 758}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Update of Review on Oct 19 (after 50+ hours of play in 9 days)\n\nI post a positive review of the games on Oct 11, but I also promised that I will keep playing a game and give a more detailed review. Here is my detailed review after more than 50+ hours of game play.\n\nI love Rogue-like dungeon crawler and have more than 20 such games from steam. This is one of the better game in this genre among the many games that I have played, and is definitely worth the money spent. Let me provide more details.\n\nWarlord's Citadel is a great game which has a lot of depth and replayability. Although the game control is easy, the mechanics of the gameplay wonderfully complex. There is also a learning curve which requires many hours of gameplay, especially at lower levels of the dungeons. This is because many of the unique bosses at lower levels of the dungeon require you do use different strategies to beat them. I was playing on the Easy Level which give me 8 lives (5 from start and 3 from minotaur) but I lost 7 lives in one of the boss fights. I was both frustrated at the difficulty and also delighted at the challenge --- in the end I decided that this is the kind of difficulty dungeon crawler that I really like because it require a lot of strategy and understanding. It is just not a blind hack-and-slash game; rather it is more of a strategic 2-D, turn based game that needs a lot of thinking. \n\nAfter about 50+ hours of gameplay, I have only reached the bottom of the dungeon ONCE, and have only unlock 1 of the 12 unlockable classes. So, what this means is that I can expect a lot of replayability in this game, and it will give me many many hours of enjoyment. !!!!!!!!\n\n\n----------------------- earlier review on Oct 11 -----------------------------------------\n\nI enjoyed this game and love it because of its simplicity.\n\nOriginally, I was going to complain about the lack of tooltips, as many of the stats are just shown in terms of a simple icon teach, with no words or explanation. However, later on I found that I was wrong. I just need to click on the icon and it will show a description of what each icon is. I am not going to fault this game for the lack of tooltip, as I realised that it might just have a different design from what I am normally used to.\n\nAnother thing that was missing was perhaps and Help Menu that explain the various control keys. However, I just press all the letters from A-Z and see if any of them activate anything.... and solve the lack of Help Menu problem easily.\n\nNow that I have talk about the shortcomings of the game, let me say WHY I LIKE THIS GAME.\n\n1. I like this game because it is simplistic and yet very interesting. When playing roguelike dungeon crawlers, I like it to be relatively simple so that I can play at a fast pace --- that is just my playstyle and this is the style I like.\n\n2. This game is hard.... and it's a good thing that it does not have a difficulty level setting, otherwise I will be tempted to lower the difficulty, and spoilt the challenge.\n\n3. There are lots of things to unlock... lots of unlockable classes which means lots of replay value. Also it seems that each new character class will have totally different abilities, so I wont get bored for a while.\n\n4. Lots of achievements to unlocked too... and these achievements are not easy to come by. So, I know that I will be playing this game for a while and it will probably give me many hours of fun.\n\nI will give an update once I played this game for a few more days.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444581022, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445299287, "recommendationid": "18430509", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505905", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445656002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 223, "steamid": "76561197986609104", "num_games_owned": 149}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I don't normally buy indie games for some mysterious reason, but on this one I was at least mildly interested.  What really sold the game for me was the video showing that there are unlockable classes (a feature that I love for some reason).  Once I bought the game and got into it, I was shocked to see that there is a pretty hefty list of extra characters.  To my embarassment I saw later that they actually revealed the number of unlockable characters in the game information; Ooops.\n\nPros:\n+Simple and easy to get into.  Nothing is too terribly complex (both a good and bad, really).\n+A pretty large amount of diversity and replayability, especially when compared to the cost.\n+The UI is functional, and the devs did a good job of avoiding a bunch of useless clutter.\n+The devs have responded very quickly to suggestions and complaints, and have improved the game accordingly.\n\nCons:\n-Admittedly the keys used to navigate some of the UI could be more transparent in-game.  I knew to press H to see the controls from a post on their store page, but in-game (as far as I could tell) there is no indication of this.\n-I personally hate the rage bar, which I will explain and suggest improvements below.\n\n><  Rage Bar ><\n\nHow I hate thee..  Okay, so as far as I can tell the rage bar is supposed to function as the non-magic user's resource (or something like that?).  While magic is gated by max mana and mana pots, rage is instead gated by time spent in combat.  It is free as long as you spend time fighting; I've yet to completely identify what all causes it to go up, as it seems to fluctuate randomly at times.\n\nAnyways, Rage abilities spend rage.. there in lies the problem.  Every rage ability that I have seen so far cannot be used until 100% rage, and then it completely drains the bar.  Not only that, but if you get to max rage and decide to save the ability for a more optimal time to use it (even within the same combat), you will very likely lose the opportunity for some reason because your rage will go down, seemingly random.\n\nSuggestion for improvement to the rage bar idea:\n1. Get rid of the degeneration over time OR reduce it to the point where it will only punish players who are not in combat for a good amount of time.  Right now it just feels like it degenerates far too quickly, especially given all of it's other downsides.  I've been in combat using the Cleric where I hit 100% and could use the Vampire attack, but I didn't need to yet.  Within 3 more strikes, I inexplicably lost rage and could not use the ability anymore.  That unexpected behaviour is not intuitive to the player.\n2. Give rage abilities a rage cost; no more 100% cost!  Right now the value:cost ratio is pretty far off, especially for the abilities that automatically cast at 100% rage, which completely removes control from the player.  I don't mind the auto-casting abilities in theory, but they need a buff in effectiness if it is to be worth the point investment.  Those types of abilities could lead to alternative playstyles if they are done smartly.\n\nOverall I like the game in every way except the current rage system.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444957225, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444957225, "recommendationid": "18494144", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500145", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491606672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4050, "steamid": "76561198028286659", "num_games_owned": 243}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is magnificently difficult, and you either learn quickly, or you die.

I was pleasantly surprised to see so many unlockable classes, and as of yet, I have only unlocked the Ranger. You have to have a working strategy early on, including identifying potions and leaving potions behind for later use. Various enemies require different tactics to defeat, and learning where to put your experience points is a must for survival in the later levels.
