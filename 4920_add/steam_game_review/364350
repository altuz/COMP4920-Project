If it would'n have been for my love for point and click and, at times, funny dialogue, I would have probably abandoned the game halfway.\nHaving two characters between which you can switch could be a very entertaining approach, The Unwritten Tales and Technobabylon come to mind, but in this game it becomes a dreary must of clicking on everything twice with very unsatisfying results.\nOf course, those games are 5-10 times more expensive, so if you really love point&click, it could be worth buying, if only to support the trend for this type of games.\n\nWhat I hated most about the game is the way it takes the least endearing features of P&C and make them nerve-grating. And I am refering here to:\n- The pixel hunting. the backdrops are very dark which makes it hard, at times impossible, to spot the objects you have to pick up\n- Big inventory - you will pick up a lot of junk objects you will never need to use, so you'll have a big, mostly useless inventory\n- Artifical, random puzzles - That I consider the worst of all. 90% of the game you will go about not knowing what you are supposed to do and why you are doing it. Many puzzles can only be solved only with the walkthrough, because there is no logical connection you can make. The whole game is mainly a string of not story-related puzzles which are neither smart nor entertaining to solve. One, for example, is all about clicking at random with both characters. Figure that...\n\nIf a game is not entertaining, then it loses its purpose and that is why I cannot recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437074058, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437139740, "recommendationid": "17080691", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607114", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437648091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 203, "steamid": "76561198012462732", "num_games_owned": 182}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great story, good messages and ideas about the alien civilizations, and funny characters; yet the puzzles have usually no clue (lotsa trial and errors) and some objects are hidden too well.

The game is a bit harder than it appears to be at first, because of how it's meant to be played.\n\nIn this game, two agents are controlled (it's up to the player to switch when desired/needed).\n\nIf one forgets about this, it's easy to get stuck (happened to me!).\n\nIt is advised to let both characters interact with the environment and examine any gathered items so as to progress.\n\nGathered items can also be handed over back-and-forth between the two of them when necessary.\n\nSome objects can only be picked up by either of them, so it's important to be thorough! \n\nAccording to the game logic, this is because both agents have their own speciality and personality (as in; one being more thorough in some way than the other).\n\nAnother thing I found really neat, was this 'follow' option, where one main character (automatically) follows the other, when this command is clicked (if this isn't activated, what happens is whichever character isn't controlled at that given time, stays behind).\n\nSome elements of the game are a bit confusing (especially story-wise). It's just that I'm very keen on logic & consistency, so I really had to do my best to keep an open mind while playing this game.\n\nIt did however make sense, so I found it somewhat satisfying.\n\nThe music was quite fitting. I enjoyed the minimalistic, yet atmospheric effect. \n\nAlso any sound effects in game were very basic, but good enough. \n\nThere was one puzzle involving portals and 2 control panels that I didn't have the patience to solve without the use of a walkthru due to the lack of sound in game. \n\nThis puzzle is of the trial-and-error type, where you keep trying and trying till you find the right combination to unlock several portals (without any sound to confirm whether you got any of the combinations right, and that means running back and forth...).\n\nAs for the intro music... well I guess that's always a personal thing ey? I wasn't too fond of the vocals (classical, opera-style, quite dramatic), though I did like the music. It was a bit over the top for my taste.\n\nAnd this goes for the voice-acting as well. Especially the female character (i.e. agent Penelope Barker), had me wanting to scratch my face in agony at times (I unfortunately found it rather mediocre, but not the worst I've heard).\n\nQuite an odd accent as well, and the intonation was really off at times.\n\nSome words seemed to be mispronounced (even Apotheosis). That was quite a downer. I have to admit though, that I found the voice-acting sounding a lot more natural as I progressed further. So it might have been a matter of the actors needing time to 'adjust' to their role.\n\nOn the brighter side; I did like the portrayal of the male character a lot more (i.e. agent Aaron Reid). I enjoyed his sense of humour. Quite dry. Just my thing :).\n\nI guess these kind of details are a hit-or-miss. Either you like it, or you just don't. The game did seem to lack a bit of visual finesse. It seemed a bit rough. It was good enough for me, despite the fact it looked outdated for a game that was released in 2014. I was quite surprised by that.\n\nkeywords: sci-fi, government, agents, ancient mysteries, secrecy, paranormal ability\n\nNB definitely great for conspiracy theory enthusiasts!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1481026611, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1490898608, "recommendationid": "28218263", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504249", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460387114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 135, "steamid": "76561198006096953", "num_games_owned": 528}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Only play this if you are a huge fan of p&c adventure games.
