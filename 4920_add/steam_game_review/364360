It plays like most of the other Total War games in the series, as well as keeping the trend of including one or more unique features. For example, in Total Warhammer, there is an extensive hero skill tree, as well as alternative modes of map travel, unique gameplay mechanics and more. After choosing the race to play, the game is open to the player. There are some initial battles to bring new or rusty players up to speed on this games mechanics. Winning a campaign is achieved through either long or short campaign goals, though whether this is a true victory is up to each player. The real draw to Total War games is the commanding of massive battles, some of which have upwards of five thousand units. If sieging a city with three thousand troops, breaking down the walls and defeating the enemies that lay within sounds interesting to you, this game may be for you.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n+ Extensive hero skill trees\n+ Large battles are exhilerating\n+ Runs well on high settings, even in huge battles\n+ Rich atmosphere and lore through both events and characters\n+ Numerous races to play as, all with different playstyles and unit rosters\n+ Visually appealing, even on lower settings\n+ Workshop support, numerous mods to improve your experience\n+ Sprawling map with polarizing biomes\n+ Very long campaign potential (due to map size and race choices)\n+ Replay value is intense, each playthrough is diverse\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n- Questionably long list of [i] expensive [/i] DLC\n- AI sometimes makes questionable plays or army compositions\n- Initial tutorial does not always explain everything to new players\n- UI errors, and sometimes does not display tooltips or a UI window does not close\n- Diplomacy is very weak, as is with most Total War games (somewhat negligible)\n- Story is not the strongest (somewhat negligible)\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nTotal War: Warhammer is USD $60, as are most AAA titles. This price is very fair for the amount of replay value, the length of campaigns, and the learning curve. Currently, I have 110 hours in this game, and haven't completed more than six campaigns. For fans of the Total War series, it is a great buy. For fans of the Warhammer universe, it is full of content you may enjoy seeing in a strategy video game. For fans of both, why are you still reading for a reason to buy? You will most definitely enjoy this game. While the base game is only USD $60, the total price of the DLC is just under USD $75. Some of the DLC content is very extensive, like the Wood Elves or the Chaos Warriors. Some DLC, like the Blood for the Blood God or the Grim and the Grave, are small content packs that affect only two races or change a few mechanics. Due to this, I cannot recommend all of the DLC, unless it is on sale or you believe you like the game that much.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506090164, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506092311, "recommendationid": "35128965", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524754", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505073025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 5965, "steamid": "76561198007554470", "num_games_owned": 106}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I waited so long for a warhammer fantasy total war game.. since I was a child playing my first medieval total war I was wondering: what if they made a warhammer game?\n\nI've played warhammer fantasy table top for years (not age of Sigmar) with a Dogs of war army, it was a really complex game with deep strategy. Formations, different weapons with different purposes ecc. \n\nFor example my pikemen could attack from 3 ranks and striking first if charged (but only with front charges). We saw this mechanics in all old total war games, but now everything disapeard. Forget all the stuff that made total war series the best, forget the long epic battle that could be win only with preparation and strategy.\n\nThe new system is faster and easier, the battles will long only few minutes with the rock paper and scissors system. This means that you'll never win against a bigger army, you can have all the bonuses but at the end you will always get a pirric win or a onorable defeat. \n\nWhat a shame.. I really wanted to do battles against hordes of enemies stopping charges while the artillery stike, like rome 2.

That pretty much sums up my experience of this game. By far the best total war game in the series. Stunning visuals and fantastic variation in the factions means every battle is breathtaking. The campaign was honestly a real struggle for me. I slogged away with faction after faction and game after game to complete any of them. I found it a real challenge which just meant the replayability was there in spades. Certainly not for the faint hearted. Nothing can be overlooked. Treaties, trade deals everything is essential for your success or can cause your demise. So in depth that hours pass and i wasnt even aware. AI really plays the game. Not to be scoffed at as 3000 skeletons rain down upon your meagre garrison because you thought theyd never go AROUND the mountain so your army is in the pass playing tag bloodbowl as your city is turned to ash. Great UI really easy to pick up and play especially for the veterans of the series. Forgiving enough in the early game that new players can learn on the go without too much payback. My only criticism is that of combat. Seems to be over very quickly unlike previous titles in the series where battles could be drawn out affairs with huge tactical gains being made. This game keeps it simple and quick with basics (flanking and the such) playing a part but mostly involves right unit at the right place at the right time to hack down your foes. Oh but how they do it with style ! Combat may be simplified but thats fine by me as it means I can watch the heads roll and limbs fly as the carnage ensues. Stunning visuals and fearsome combat leads to a gory scene playing out on your screen. If all that isnt enough then dont forget its WARHAMMER ! Brings your own tabletop armies to life in a way like never before ! Now you can watch the giant tear your tiny spearmen apart before your great cannons find there mark and pound it into the ground. Who doesnt want that ????\n\nNow I have all of the DLC and I can understand the complaints of many saying that the cost is ridiculous when all added up. Its very expensive there is no denying that and you could make the argument it was unfair that some bits werent available to players from the off. To me it was all worth it. Every DLC added masses of content and doubled replayability as new camapigns appeared on my screen and new play styles were adopted. New units marched to war and new foes fell upon me. Add to this that an awful lot of content was provided free aswell I have no issue with it.\n\nBuy this game. Get the free content and play through a campaign. Make your own decision about DLC (woodelves own everyone) but dont let that keep you from enjoying the base game. \n\nLife consuming game. \n\nClearly released by Chaos.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506592623, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506592623, "recommendationid": "35258511", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502738", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507063276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 589, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2187, "steamid": "76561198310910875", "num_games_owned": 7}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nice Game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506685049, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506685049, "recommendationid": "35290479", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500026", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506575917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1593, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10386, "steamid": "76561197990446930", "num_games_owned": 79}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "With the Change from historical battles to the fantacy world of Warhammer totalwar moves in to a world better suited to the style of the gameplay.
