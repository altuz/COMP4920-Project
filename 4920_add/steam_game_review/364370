I found myself abandoning it rather early on for one simle reason, and that is its save points - or rather, lack thereof.\n\nTheres one save point in this game. One. While this might not seem like so much of a problem at first, since its easy to duck the basic infected enemies, when you come up against regular deaths such as The Gauntlet boss, this makes you want to tear out your hair.  Being of an old school RPG style, you don't exactly wander around the map at high speed (seriously dude, do some cardio - jog once in a while!), and so it takes a while to get back to your regular death spot where you'll have to destory your spacebar tapping through all of the text speech (AGAIN) to make limited progress before dying once more. \n\nBesides this frustrating cycle, the game showed a lot of promise. The moral decisions looked interesting and - while i was regularly walking back and forth to that b*st*rds lair and dying - I found myself seriously considering who to save and who to leave behind.  I also really loved the music, which  added intensity to the action scenes and avoided becoming an annoying background loop. \n\nHowever overall, I found the gameplay just much too fidgety and frustrating. When I took a break and tried to follow a different path, I found myself lost in a  system of caves which (after the gauntlet ordeal) I hadn't the patience to traverse. \n\nPerhaps this is all down to personal preference. Maybe if youre a fan of this genre then you'll find the game wonderful, but this was not the case for me and so I wouldn't recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429876290, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429876290, "recommendationid": "15516827", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545975", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429850148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 292, "playtime_forever": 28, "steamid": "76561198053422627", "num_games_owned": 955}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So far, so good for a simple old school RPG style game...\n\nI also like the theme and plot, even though it's not exactly original.\n\nHere's a link to my first 20 minutes or so in the game, it should give you a good idea of what to expect without spoiling anything for you:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fzw4J61EPc\n\nI need to finish this game before being able to score it fairly, but so far, i'd say it looks like it's well worth it's asking price!\n\nTwo Thumbs Up... and a full fledged review coming soon...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429851813, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429851813, "recommendationid": "15513663", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500076", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430181218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 538, "steamid": "76561198019690744", "num_games_owned": 36}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The Sheltered is a game that will frustrate you sometimes, but this is good.

The game has a striking lack of save points and when I say lack of, I mean that there's just ONE save point. ONE.\n \nGenerally, a lack of save points doesn't condemn a game to being unplayable. However, when faced with events like the Gauntlet, where multiple deaths are unavoidable, this becomes a major problem. Particularly when the Gauntlet is obviously meant to be a trial-and-error point of the game, meaning you are MEANT to die. The only save point in the game is a good 1-2 minute journey from the Gauntlet. \n\nTL:DR, if you don't enjoy leaving running back and forth between a save point and an almost inevitable death multiple times, don't get this game.

You're not the first user to comment on it either.\n\nThe Sheltered is not meant to be an immensely difficult game of trial and error. Rather, it should be a game of decisions and exploration. The single save point system is meant to add challenge, not frustration. \n\nThere are multiple puzzles with multiple solutions - including The Gauntlet. If something is proving too difficult, you're probably missing a key to the solution. I'd love to encourage you to keep playing and exploring other areas of the game.

You can literally complete the game in under 10 minutes, and feel like you threw your money away, or you could attempt to find everything and save everyone, which ends up delivering some surprises and a lot of satisfaction.  For me, I thought that this has actually been the most underrated title I've played thusfar.  I really enjoyed the mood, the dialogue, the puzzles, and exploration required to really get the most out of the game.\n\nWith that being said, it isn't perfect and it won't appeal to everybody.  There is only one save point, which can cause a lot of frustration as you have to replay or backtrack when you die or want to save.  There isn't a lot of direction, which appealled to me, but can really put some gamers off.  There is not a lot of action or constant activity to really keep you enthralled second-to-second.  So, if you are looking for an action-packed title that doesn't necessarily require a lot of thought, then this really is not going to be your game.
