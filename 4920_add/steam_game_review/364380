There are a few things that need to be done before this app is really ready for prime time. \n\nThis is delivered as a folder.  In the folder, there are two separate Unity executables for each of six environments.  And then there's an additional batch file to support DirectX 11.  It requires installation of a specific CODEC pack from GitHub in order to operate, and overall is at a quality similar to the Multiplayer Theater demo that is available for free.\n\nAt the very least, take half an hour, write a launcher.  Put a button to download the required CODEC pack, have Steam launch that by default.  \n\nUse Environment.GetSpecialFolder and ask for videos -- look for the movies there.  If you're not going to do that, then at least use a single movies folder for all the environments.  But using the folder under Steam versus the user's Video folder (or any user specified folder) is something that is going to annoy users.\n\nThink about if you really need 12 separate executables here -- that cannot be pleasant to maintain in Unity.  Those scenes can all be in a single executable, and you can use LoadLevel to load the level you want.  So instead of separate executables, make one executable.\n\nAt that point you need a menu -- there are a lot of good Oculus-enabled menus in the Unity asset store, and the default Unity UI is workable as well.  Basically, if you're going to ask for money you need to be a cut above the tech demos in the forums, for free, at the Oculus forums.\n\nKeep in mind, Oculus is currently a developer only club -- developers are going to hold you to a higher standard than traditional users may, usually, and are going to have seen the various demos on the Oculus site most likely.  I know it's the first thing that I did after I unboxed my Oculus -- install the SDK, look at what people are uploading, see \"hey, I should do that.\"\n\nThis is not currently ready for prime time, and needs some work before it will be.

I enjoyed it if not for the hard to read text, and the stare-at-options UI was acceptable for such a simple device. That said, the app hasn't changed its UI from the phone to the Vive, and that's where it suffers the most.  The UI requires the user to stare at options to click them.  That both shows down the user and makes the scene a little cluttered.  The user should have better interactivity options in such an app on the Vive, but unfortunately, Cineveo does not even try to offer options.  I hope they add controller support and the ability to disable the stare-at menu controls sometime in the future.\n\nThe video playback is also very hit-or-miss.  It plays some videos just fine, but other videos seem to play at double the speed.  I tried slowing it down but could not find the option in the playback controls.  There's no playlist option for setting up the playlist before entering the theater.  You simply drop files into the app's videos directory.  That makes me slightly disappointed considering I have a ton of videos categorized into folders in my \"My Videos\" folder in Windows. I would prefer not to have to move files around just to choose which videos to have the app default to.  It does not play videos in sequence, either, forcing me to open a menu screen to start the next video.  SBS 3D did not seem possible, but I have no SBS 3D videos other than Sintel, so I'm fine with that.  The MKV update was very welcome as I was not \n\nThe visuals of this app are very immersive... if not for some strange scenery choices.    The plain theater mode offers a nice theater room, similar to something out of an actual theater... except there's a bright hallway right behind your seat!  I don't understand its purpose, and it looks totally out of character for the theater to have a hallway of posters sticking right out of it with no doors and no stairs.\n\nI'll probably give Cineveo another try in the future, because it shows a lot of promise.
