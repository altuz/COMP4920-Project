Downfall takes place in the same universe as The Cat Lady, with some common characters and happening almost in parallel to the events of The Cat Lady. Here the story revolves around Joe and Ivy Davis, a couple who have decided to take a weekend getaway in a nice hotel to rekindle their romance and fix their marriage. Except things quickly start going south and the place appears to be full of creepy and disturbing occurrences. When Ivy goes missing, Joe decides to do whatever it takes to find and save her.\n\nThe game is full of disturbing scenes and dark themes, a lot of the time making us ponder about the morality of what we're doing and whether what we're seeing is real or just a twisted figment of the character's imagination. The atmosphere is absolutely superb and immersive, often successfully creating tension and horror, and all this without using jump scares. The visual style is really great for a game like this, where even by the mere look, something can appear to give a chill down your spine. This is of course accompanied by a great soundtrack as well and some pretty good voice acting.\n\nMost of the gameplay consists of solving simple environmental puzzles, exploration, and making choices, particularly during dialogue scenes. So it's very story-driven and casual as far as gameplay goes and should satisfy anyone who likes interactive stories. Most puzzles are pretty logical and straight-forward (though I did have to refer to a walkthrough at one point).\n\nYour decisions have an effect on the ending you get, and there appear to be 3 endings in total, though the very good and the very bad endings are pretty hard to achieve and might need a walkthrough at hand or consecutive playthroughs.\n\nDefinitely recommended for anyone who likes darker stories that explore serious themes. If you liked The Cat Lady, you should enjoy Downfall too, and likewise if you enjoyed this, check out The Cat Lady too. As far as I've heard, there's another game in this universe currently in the works, so I'm very much looking forward to trying that out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505318166, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505318166, "recommendationid": "34922152", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517336", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 143, "total_reviews": 154, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
