If you dont plan on playing with friends... the reason being of setting up your own server or downloading himatchi ( serving hosting software ) in order to make a quick sever. If the game added via steam support it would be tons better and could be a good time with the m8's\n\nOn the other hand. It is INCREADIBLY hard to start if your new to games like magicite (other game faily simmilar) or any permanent death games. The custom ship option is a great idea if i was able to customize more with furniture or decorations. Love the idea of unlockables when you die, allowing you to not completly freak out all the time when i do die. But all in all great game! Once you survive and work with the right stats to survive a couple of levels you begin to understand more! crafting is a little off.. but good thing theres a wiki on how to make things!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504763334, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504763334, "recommendationid": "34788784", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508923", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506940812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 921, "steamid": "76561198030906347", "num_games_owned": 317}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Roguelands is pretty fun, at first. The roguelike system makes progression hard, and it's fun to level up your characters to actually get somewhere with each character.\nHowever, after around 10 hours, you get to the point that it becomes too much of a grind. The jump between early game to end game difficulty is massive, and you kinda need to farm quite a bit in between. This wouldn't be much of a problem, seeing as the core gameplay is pretty fun and the mid-range bosses are pretty challenging (only reason I don't farm them much is usually because I'm scared of my character dying) but it gets REALLY boring to have the same maps.\nWhich is the main problem, repetition. The maps don't change, they are all an unoriginal bland combination of rectangular areas with a 6 block or so wide tunnel connecting to the next one. There are no real environments to take in, so its always the same. Enemies are more varied, but you get so used to how they work that having the ONLY difference being the number of enemies spawned and where they are makes it not that big of a change. The big selling point of 'procedurally generated worlds' is pretty fucking useless if your procedural generation system doesn't provide any variety at all.\nContent is all that is needed to make this a great game. Better environments, maybe some more mid level quests to do, and more clarity on the quest system itself; you eventually get it, but the home ship is so damn confusing.\nMultiplayer, which is probably what a good chunk of players will buy this for, may be fun, but hell if I know, because it won't work properly. After going through port forwarding and all that fuzz it still wouldn't work, and apparently the sure fire method of making it work is Hamach. If a game requires another software to make its multiplayer work, well, then its multiplayer doesn't work. And despite players asking for it, there is zero feedback on whether or not multiplayer will get updated in the future. There are even still items and drops left that have literally no use (droid fuel, for example) that look like they will remain useless pixels for time immemorial.\nUnfortunately, you can kiss of your hopes of updates goodbye as well, because it looks like the dev abandoned this game, just like his earlier game magicite; there hasn't been an update in months, no response to the community asking for some sort of feedback, and he has gone on and made another game already (which is thankfully being kept updated because there's one more dev working on it aside from just Sean). And according to discussions he's already gone on to make another mobile game, so don't pin your hopes on an update.\nI'll edit this if the dev actually puts out a content update, but don't waste your money on this until it's apparent that he's willing to put more work into this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505563957, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505564390, "recommendationid": "34995369", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508059", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499924989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 695, "steamid": "76561198027638241", "num_games_owned": 259}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Release Date: Nov 6, 2015\nLast Updated: Feb 13, 2017\nAn okay game overall, but is not finished, and I doubt it ever will be.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507068408, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507068408, "recommendationid": "35457639", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495644457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2607, "steamid": "76561198097860626", "num_games_owned": 419}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "\"Wait...is this really all there is??\"\n\nThats was my reaction after playing it for what seemed like a long time to get nowhere. \n\nGame is unfinished.
