Supposedly some abilities that you use gems to cast. In practice though you get no Xbox 360 controller support. Control scheme is madness... arrows. S for jump and A to push crates. The screen does not scroll and instead just transitions from area to area forcing you to do a ton of blind jumping. The game hides spike traps inside scenery and they are invisible basically one-shotting you very cheaply unless you memorize where they are. The writing is pretty weak. The platforming involves long loose jumps with dubious amount of granular control.
