The little RPG addon to the rules is quite cool, sometimes it feels forced and you might need to grind for loot and levels, but well just a bit. Nice graphics, nice music = overall great solitaire game with twist. So definitely buy it with a coupon or when on SALE : )", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506034671, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506034671, "recommendationid": "35115587", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520343", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 61, "total_reviews": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 15}}
