Rotating the pieces is incredibly awkward. The UI is tiny. The puzzles have only one solution by giving you only the necessary pieces to use.\nI highly recommend Prelogate if you think this game might be for you. It has achievements, and you can finish levels in different ways with challenges (least pieces used, least space travelled by lasers, and one other I think).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429301917, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429312449, "recommendationid": "15420048", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592913", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1429888178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561198043330923", "num_games_owned": 744}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Awkward interface.
