Unfortunately, there's not much to it.\n\nGranted, the game [i]is[/i] in Early Access, but it looks (and feels) like it's the developer's first game. Much of the game is unbalanced, especially in the enemy projectile patterns and character skillsets. The artwork is all pixelated, but it lacks the charm and polish of other games in its genre. Furthermore, the developer doesn't seem to be too invested in updating the game. \n\nTo be fair, for $3, it seems like the kind of game you would expect at its price. However, you'd be better off playing the multitude of other arcade shooters on Steam. [i]Vintage Year[/i], for instance, is more polished and interesting, and is only a couple dollars more. [i]Nuclear Throne[/i] is still the best in its class, even though it's also in Early Access.

The controls are pretty tight, and the initial slow movement of the characters is offset by some of the items' effects. I'd say \"think of this as a stripped-down and still in early development Nuclear Throne,\" but they seem to fill different niches, at least to me.\n\nThere are some ui and graphical issues, like the lightning effects not leaving the screen in some cases, or the player character and some static objects changing size (very minimally, perhaps because of how they are rendered?) when moving the cursor while standing still or moving slowly. The main menu and in-game pause menu need to be worked over (as the dev has said he plans to do in the next update).\n\nOverall, I feel it's definitely worth the money (whether full price or on sale) to pick this up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449101085, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1482200079, "recommendationid": "19448579", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503232", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435596851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561198097454672", "num_games_owned": 356}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game isn't ready yet.

The multi-player for example will notify you that it will likely crash. So keep that in mind if you're considering purchase.

This doesn't mean it's bad, though it does seem like a possible Unity asset flip (I don't know personally if it is or not). It's got plenty of pretty colors as well, three different classes categorized by their special attacks, and a score that is catchy at times, but also can be barren or non-existent. Hopefully the audio is just due to being early access 1.1.\n\nI have no idea if some of the things I think are glitches are meant to be there though. There's no options menu or anything that explains the controls over than a quick explanation on WASD and how the mouse works in the game. I hit O and P at times, and random things happened, as if I were using special items, not to mention sometimes hitting Z or T and teleporting to the next level.\n\nIt has potential, and I'm anxious to see further builds. I don't regret the purchase and suggest it while it's on sale if this is your kind of thing.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435264444, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1435264444, "recommendationid": "16706118", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496746", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442373387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 65, "steamid": "76561198175105167", "num_games_owned": 124}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Have played very little so far but it is a great game so far even for early acess.\n\nPs: ADD AN EXIT BUTTON!!!!!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442270532, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1442270532, "recommendationid": "18036958", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495149", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
