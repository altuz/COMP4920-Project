I know now what I\u00b4ll be playing this winter, when I\u00b4m supposed to plow snow for real outside! :D\n\nWhat makes the game interesting is, that the steering is everything but precise. Sounds weird? Yes. But when you start to master the controls and the plow truck goes where you want it to go, then you feel like Mr. Plow himself!\n...until you crash into the next car and get fired.\n\nFor anything about the graphics or the sound: Just watch the trailer and you know what there is to know.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446554204, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446554204, "recommendationid": "18855804", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513773", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475360042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1846, "steamid": "76561197993744544", "num_games_owned": 57}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Brilliant due to it's simplicity.

It satisfies a primal urge that we, as humans, have to move large mounds of things.  If you find yourself lying awake at night wondering what it all means, this game is for you!\n\nAt first I was having a lot of trouble controlling my plow (I've never driven a plow before), but once I started driving on the roads instead of through the snow I had a much easier time.  I think I'll apply this lesson to my real life driving techniques as well.\n\nLove the music too!  Good variety of tracks to keep your ears happy.  The humming of your beastly plow motor can be a bit harsh at times, but not so much that it ruins the experience.\n\n10/10 would plow again... wait, that's not how I meant it... I- ...  I will play this game.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447258694, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447258694, "recommendationid": "19014932", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497977", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507037155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 613, "steamid": "76561198296946126", "num_games_owned": 112}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "https://tenor.co/ru5B.gif", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488665845, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488665845, "recommendationid": "30324658", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500413", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1455330944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 45, "steamid": "76561198167669766", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Graphics too intense, computer could not run", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458434494, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1458434494, "recommendationid": "21935109", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462639", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
