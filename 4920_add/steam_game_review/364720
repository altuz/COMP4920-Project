You control 2 characters Ronald Reagan , 40th president of the United States of America and Mikhail Gorbachev, the 8th General Secretary of the Soviet Union with plenty of flavour text and political digs throughout the in between level 'cut scenes'. \nYou are both abducted during peace talks in Iceland and must work together to escape the terrorists and foil their plot with Gorbachev's KGB know how and Reagan's action man heriocs. There are some nice game play interactions, your currently unused character can be called over as a sentry who auto shoots after you unlock/hack doors and some stealth elements requiring carefully timed switching between characters. \nKeep in mind you get one shot at each level, if one of your characters dies then you immediately start the level from scratch. The levels are a good size and offer a variety of different challenges with most of the guards weaponry randomised giving you unique options on some playthroughs. I haven't played the co-op mode with another player yet but I imagine it would be even more fun strategising on the fly to overcome the enemy. I recommend [b]Reagan Gorbachev[/b] to players interested in a politically themed twin stick shooter with puzzle and stealth elements.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456321899, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456496405, "recommendationid": "21424929", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569300", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456619826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 180, "steamid": "76561198119603056", "num_games_owned": 198}, "votes_funny": 22, "votes_up": 29, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Reagan: \"How can I trust a commie?\"\nGorbachev: \"How can I trust an actor?\"\n\n\n\n\n999999999999/999999999999   Best roasting mechanics 1986\n\n\nGetting past the silly part... \n\nReagan Gorbachev is a fanstastic game based off hotline miami (but you probably know that.) \nThe basic plot goes like this: Ronald Regan and Mikhail Gorbachev were meeting in Iceland but then got kidnapped by terroist extremists and the duo have to team up using their particular set of skills (reagan gets a katana and lockpicking gorbachev gets a blow dart filled with neurotoxin and hacking) \nBesides what I just mentioned there are also a bunch more weapons.\nLong story short this is a fantastic cold war era game great for those who liked hotline miami and trivia (as there is a trivia question at the end of each level.)\n\nAlso this game may be twice as rage inducing as hotline miami.\n\n\n\nLike for example: being shot from across a massive gap in the ground by an enemy about a mile away who you can't see", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456486062, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506813098, "recommendationid": "21472586", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525770", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484701685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 45, "steamid": "76561198105837778", "num_games_owned": 138}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game is decent enough for a play through but only with co-op as playing this by yourself is as difficult as hard mode on hotline miami.

This game has trading cards and a load of achievements which are easily earned if you were to put extra time into this game. Don't let the two-player playstyle discourage you. This game makes it run very smooth. Just play it for yourself, and you'll see. Honestly I just want to go on and on about all the positives, but I can't. It'd take too long. So let me leave you with this.\nSurprisingly great playstyle, good backstory, nice game.\nIt's gonna be a very solid 9.6/10 from me.\nWhy not 10/10? I have to deduct 0.4 because unfortunately the 'Sabatoge' achievement is basically impossible without a controller. With just the mouse, you can't do it. Also, the backgrounds for this game include two with Gorbachev only and three with Reagan only. I'd love to see one with both of them. After all, this is a two-character game.
