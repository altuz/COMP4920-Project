Earning even one of the few achievements will be demanding on your arcade skills. Mage battling mage, variety of spell casters with strengths and weaknesses, special abilities unique to each caster -- all good. Spells organized into four categories; choose your poison. Learn what the stats mean as you level up and choose what to raise and which new spell to learn. Develop a winning battle plan that may not work on every opponent. With all the spellcaster types, special abilities, stats and spells, you can easily sink hours into making different combinations that may or may not work. Game is fast-paced and experimentation is essential. Graphics are simple, but the explosions are colorful and in every battle you are treated to a light show. Main problem is that there is no standard save system, which means that if you fail a tough battle, you cannot repeat it. The game simply moves on to the next opponent, which sucks if you want a second or third chance at defeating the final opponent, DEATH INCARNATE, and earning a tough achievement. Might be worth it to some at $9.99. A steal if on sale. If you always wanted to be a spellcaster and battle other spellcasters, you should get this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501905280, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503862526, "recommendationid": "34029731", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505034", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
