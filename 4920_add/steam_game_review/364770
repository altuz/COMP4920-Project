What you see in the store page video is pretty much what you get: run, jump shoot. There are a few limited-shot special guns along the way but I didn't think they added a whole lot to the game play. \n\nThere were a few parts that took many tries to get through but the HP and life system is forgiving. And if you run out of lives you only start that level over.\n\nIt is very well done. The graphics and music are very nice. I'd like to see a sequel with more weapons, maybe some skills to upgrade, etc.\n\nMy Logitech controller worked fine. \n\nMy only issues are:\n\n1) When I switched levels, it leaves full screen, makes the mouse visible and puts it in the center of the screen.\n\n2) Sometimes when you fall on spikes or off the bottom of the screen, it puts you on the edge of where you fell off, hanging by your 1-pixel toenails. It's very easy to fall back off again.\n\n3) The boss health does not reset when you lose a life, so you can just keep going back and wear him down. It does reset if you get \"Game Over\". I'm not sure if it is better this way, but it made the bosses seem a bit too easy. Most of them still gave me a \"Game Over\" at least once.\n\nI beat it on normal in about 3 hours but I did not go down any of the optional paths for gems or extra lives. There is also a \"Professional\" and \"Childrens\" difficulty but I've not tried them yet. \n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429728502, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1429728502, "recommendationid": "15494283", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530398", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437373101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 247, "steamid": "76561198025301599", "num_games_owned": 4253}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Remember Commander Keen ? this game is very similar. its a 2D run and gun platformer and a very solid one for sure. the controls are tight, the difficulty and level design are great. boss battles are fun and great soundtrack too. the game can be completed in a short time depending on your skill level and there are options to choose the difficulty level that suits you. there are some hidden secrets to be found which adds more fun to the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437362720, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437362720, "recommendationid": "17134625", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520964", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430323460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 144, "steamid": "76561198078627698", "num_games_owned": 109}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game!!!

It is not for platforming newbs. I had a bit of trouble getting the settings right. Going into full screen wouldn't work and this led to many alt+F4 closes before I could even get to play the game. The best option is to stay in windowed mode and increase the size of the window in the settings. Overall the gameplay is smooth and is as you would expect a high-quality platformer to be.
