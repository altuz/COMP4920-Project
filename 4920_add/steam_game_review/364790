Yes, it's ugly as sin. I could say \"at least it's not pixel art\" but that's just damning with faint praise. And the music is even worse.\n\nBut this captures the heart of Mystery Dungeon style games so well.\n\nFor those who don't know what that means, Mystery Dungeon is a brand of Japanese roguelikes dungeon crawlers (You may have seen the Shiren, Pokemon, or Etrian flavors). What makes them stand out is how simple they are compared to the western brand of roguelike. There are not six fiddly stats and 40 rings, scrolls, and wands to manage nor are there 40 fiddly tricks to have to cover like keeping a wand of fire to scribble galadriel at opportune moments. You do not have to memorize 40 pages of spoilers and have \"blessed +2 gray dragon scale mail\" tattooed on your forearm.\n\nIn exchange for all that, the genre focuses more on gamey style abilities. The wands and abilities you find control enemy pacing, placement, movement, etc. And when there is a horde of monsters bearing down on you with a monster that can paralyze you and another that can drain your levels, your brain will be tested just like the best of roguelikes.\n\nSo what MD offers is something more innately intuitive and accessible than the overwrought and overfiddly roguelikes you may be accustomed to, but one still quite difficult. If the western flavor is an enormous wargame run by steely-eyed grognards with fearsome neckbeards ready to debate tactics from the galactic wars of the far future to the Civil War, MD is closer to chess.\n\nVoyage to Farland is almost a straight reskin of the DS Shiren game. Every ability, every trick is there, with its own spin on balancing. If you can get past the atrocious art style, you will find an excellent homage to a roguelike flavor that just is not well-represented on PC. Complete with Shiren's love of secrets and inventory management, but with different enemy design, pacing, and balancing, it is a wonderful homage from a fellow who is clearly as moved by Shiren as I am.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434305464, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434687356, "recommendationid": "16395487", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538713", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472904585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2012, "steamid": "76561198049733975", "num_games_owned": 463}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a terrific game. I haven't played the Japanese Mystery Dungeon games this takes it's inspiration from. I guess I've been missing out.\n\nVoyage to Farland is a turn-based roguelike. It's very bare bones. There are no classes, skills, stats, gold or shops. You are just your level, hit points, and whatever you pick up in the dungeon. In exchange for all that Voyage to Farland focuses more on consumable item abilities. The items you find control enemy pacing, placement, movement, etc. There is very little direct damage. Gameplay is focused on tactics, exploration, and inventory management. \n\nThere is a good variety of enemies, enough to keep things interesting. The enemies all have leveled up versions, Sometimes they will level up during a fight when they kill one of your companions, or when you trick them into killing one of their allies.\n\nThe items are where this game really shines. The variety isn't huge, but it is all useful. No clogging up your inventory with useless junk to sell later. There is just enough so that you can learn what it does, and how to use it effectively. Then you can finally stop dying repeatedly, and watching your companions be butchered by monsters.   \n\n I definitely recommend it to any roguelike fan.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1471482572, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1482540213, "recommendationid": "24984068", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508043", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433640257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 66, "steamid": "76561198042112772", "num_games_owned": 81}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The sprite and tile art are terrible- reminds me too much of the 90% of games in the GameMaker library.\n\nOther than that, it lives up to being like Chunsoft's Mystery Dungeon line of games as mentioned in the game's description, which is worth it if you grew up with those titles and don't care much for the game's visuals.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433637593, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433637593, "recommendationid": "16233232", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506205", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433541551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 159, "steamid": "76561198073727130", "num_games_owned": 21}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A roguelike for PC that actually feels like your playing a real Mystery Dungeon game!
