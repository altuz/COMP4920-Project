Judgment Rites makes its glorious return. \n\nI played this game long ago and still have the original CD stored next to my computer. \nAt that time, i was stuck on a level and had no chance to look up a solution - the level with the red baron airplane that shoots you \"down\" at the start of the mission. I was frustrated and then stopped playing it after multiple attempts. The time passed by and before i realized it, the game did not work anympore on the newer computers. I then lost sight on the game, but it survived multiple relocations and i kept in touch with multiple Star Trek games.\n\nWell, by sheer luck i saw the 25 year anniversary stuff here on steam and clicked it - then i saw it. Star Trek - Judgment Rites. I was like \"Whaaat the f***? Is someone trolling me?\" ... 6\u20ac? Slept over it a night ( i don't know anymore why i did hesitate at first) and then HELL YEAH i bought it.\n\nIt looks amazing. No, really. At a time where we start going into the VR phase of our RL - Oculus Rift and stuff - these \"simple\" graphics do give us what we need. The environment feels just \"right\". Sound is also fine and you get a ton of the good \"old\" trekkie stuff like the comments from Spock and Mc Coy aka. Bones.\n\nThis is indeed a \"must have\" for every Trekkie - and interesting for everyone else who can afford the 6\u20ac.\n\n\n[h1]Ratings [/h1]\n(MIGHT be influenced by my affection for Star Trek and especially for this game ;)):\n\nGraphics 9/10  (some scenes could have been done better, the quality of the cutscenes and videos differes)\nSound effects 8/10  (mostly amazing, but sometimes not as good as it could be, even at that time)\nStory 9/10  (almost perfect, but you really have to look out for everything. You might sometimes find yourself stuck because you miss something cause you did not try out all spots with all items - that can lead to frustration)\n\n[b]WARNING: This game has NO tutorial! And since you don't have the small book that came with it originally you MUST look up the key bindings on the internet since you CANT look them up ingame! *edit* You can find the original book here --> http://www.mocagh.org/miscgame/judgmentrites-manual.pdf[/b]\n\n[b] SERIOUS WARNING: You should SAVE from time to time. This game does NOT auto-save. If you FAIL you will have to REDO the whole mission you are currently doing (or maybe the whole game, but i am not sure at this moment). So SAVE AT LAST EVERY 10 MINUTES![/b]\n\nBtw: YES is does work on Windows 10, it opens a DosBox.

Puzzles are enjoyable, employing actual logic to solve as opposed to most adventure-genre games. The stories are more enjoyable than many actual episodes of TNG, and the dialogue spoken by the original cast is fantastic.\n\nOnly drawback is that sometimes you aren't sure what objects in the environment to click on because the graphics are so pixelated. For example, I got stuck on one puzzle because there was a pillar-type thing I was supposed to interact with, but I thought the pillar was part of this machine I had already been clicking on. They are two different objects but look like one. So sometimes you will know what to do but have to click on random blotches or pixels.\n\nNOTE: I've seen some reviews complaining about the lack of a star chart: there is a Steam community guide with a chart or you can get a guide from somewhere like GameFAQs.com which tells you where to click to start a mission.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1471046671, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1471046671, "recommendationid": "24864940", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503238", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433548356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 37, "steamid": "76561198006917571", "num_games_owned": 96}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "i use to have this gaqme when i was younger and loved it only problem i have is finding out where i need to go on the map to do the missions \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433544187, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433544187, "recommendationid": "16212994", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498677", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475014302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 110, "steamid": "76561198027976131", "num_games_owned": 51}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Hey Remember waaaay back when?
