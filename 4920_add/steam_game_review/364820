The ship-to-ship combat simulator is extremely detailed, to a very surprising degree, especially for the time.  There's skirmish modes, multiplayer (which I do not know if it still works or runs through Steam now, but it says that the options are available), and a campaign.\n\nSkirimish modes are fully customizable, from how many points you can allocate to your ship crew or extras, such as mines and fighers, to exactly what ships you, your enemies, or allies recieve.  There are a few different interesting setups that should keep one entertained for a while.\n\nThe campaign is where you start out as a lowly frigate and make your way up to the higest type of ship, gain a fleet, and go on special missions if you so choose.  While working your way up from one frigate and advancing in rank and fleet number is fun, there is no clear progression if you choose not to go into the special missions, and you doom yourself to an undynamic campaign.  Yet, if you choose the special missions, you had best go alone, because the A.I. in your fellt is the worst thing ever.  If you do go alone though, you can face some nigh unwinnable odds.  The main frustration is the clunky friendly A.I. vessels, but most will think that the added story and missions are well worth it, if they don't get too frustrated.\n\nObviously, the graphics of a 2001 game no longer hold up, but the sounds of the game are surprisingly still pretty good.\n\nOverall, this is a classic game which is well-worth buying for the $6.00 they ask for.  If, however, they add in Star Trek: Starfleet Command II: Empires at War or Star Trek: Starfleet Command II: Orion Pirates, jump to those instead, because they dramatically improve on the wonderful foundation that this game provides, and add significantly more content.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496283630, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496283630, "recommendationid": "32098525", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525842", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495244605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 44, "steamid": "76561197977975159", "num_games_owned": 62}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is a great classic!
