After you switch characters, it's almost a whole new game.  You jump higher, move faster, and just overall have to be more on your toes.  The second half of this game definitely puts you to the test, proud to say I have completed it though.\n\nEDIT2: Still fun.\n\nBLEAK is one of the hardest games that I have ever played... and I love it.  I have been following this game for about a year and am thrilled with how it turned out.  While the art may come across as simple, that's exactly what's needed for a game of this difficulty.  The simple art and mechanics allow you to have complete control over your character and know what is happening at all times.  The actual gameplay feels fantastic, and any time you die, you know exactly what killed you.  Every jump is a puzzle of its own, requiring you to actually pay attention to the patterns and timing of the enemies.  Blindly charging forward is a no-go as well because every time you die, you start the level over.  This harsh punishment for death makes actually completing the levels that much more satisfying.  On top of all of that, there is a \"time trial\" mode with global leaderboards for the speedrunners out there who want the best time.  At first I thought the story would just be something small to fill the space between levels, but after spending more time with the game I realized that there is actually a fair amount of story there.  I found myself invested in the characters, caring about what happens to them, which isn't something that I expected from a game like this.\n\nEnough about the gameplay though, the soundtrack needs some attention, too.  The soundtrack for this game is incredible, really capturing the mood of each world.  It's clear that a lot of work went into making the songs, and if you end up spending 2+hours on one level you'll notice that they loop pretty well, too xD\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes platformers, puzzles, or anything of extreme difficulty.\n\nTL;DR: Buy the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460841379, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1480377847, "recommendationid": "22462697", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511714", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462147767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 143, "steamid": "76561198039690652", "num_games_owned": 116}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "First of all this game easily takes the cake for being the hardest game that I have ever played. It beats out games like CSGO and Planetside 2 which are very well known for their extremely high learning curves which kick new players asses. Bleak knocks all of them out of the water. Its difficulty paired with the games awesome soundtrack and easy to learn mechanics put it among other high difficulty side scrollers such as Super Meat Boy and I Wanna Be The Guy. The comic book cutscenes between the many levels also put the game over the top for me as an avid reader of them while also being a deviation from the normal cutscenes in most games. Graphics are basic but also help make the game unique. There is also a great timer built in speedrunning mechanic which is really good for that community. Overall, Bleak: Welcome to Glimmer is a great indie game and is definetly worth picking up for its reasonable price of 7.99.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460508274, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460508274, "recommendationid": "22386222", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506052", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463940084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 114, "steamid": "76561198064083977", "num_games_owned": 16}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "EXTREMELY CHALLENGING!!!!!!
