You pilot a perpetually moving ship through a tunnel and shoot at everything in 360 degree movement. Shoot bugs to explode them and collect coins. If you shoot at the coins their color changes as their value goes up. You run them over to collect them. You can grab power-ups such as extra temporary cool weapons or shields. Shoot the mushrooms enough times to gain admission to bonus levels. The more insects you shoot the faster you travel through the tunnel. \n\nThe levels amp up difficulty in a way that isn't jarring or shocking to your system, however, if you're anything like me, this doesn't deter from frequent long strings of obscenities due to stress reactions.
