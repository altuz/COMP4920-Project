This game is great for understanding how to play hanafuda, even in real life. I bought a set of cards to play it with friends now, actually. The music is nothing special but nothing bothersome either. I love the new expansion with ukiyo-e cards, even though the original ones were already really pretty. (I am a bit biased, because I study Japanese Edo-period culture with a focus on art)\n\nIf you're looking for a relaxed, easy way to learn how to play Hanafuda, I most certainly recommend this game. If you're into even more pretty Japanese art prints; buy the DLC aswell. \n\nIf you already know how to play Hanafuda, this is probably just \"one of those other\" Asian games like the thousand and one mahjong / go / shogi games that excist.

KOI KOI!\nThis is a great little relaxing card game, providing something with a little more variety to classic solitaire, with an option to multiplay against friends. It's basically picture matching, the aim to to collect more cards and higher value sets than your opponent. Koi Koi uses traditional Japanese Hanafuda cards, which can take a few trial runs to get the unaccustomed Western eye familliar with, but this is a great way to learn how to play. \nThere isn't much else to say. It works well, and there's a few Ukiyo-e style artworks to unlock as you progress through the game. My only gripe is some of the PC-players are maybe a little too easy to beat (they make mistakes, like Koi Koi-ing late in the game at a risky time, or it seems sometimes like the cards are weighted in your favour) but this gets eliminated with multiplayer, where you can play with random strangers as well as against your friends.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500416051, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500416051, "recommendationid": "33639344", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506316", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502654063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 403, "steamid": "76561198101004768", "num_games_owned": 180}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a fun game that I have spent hours playing.\n\nUnfortunatly the \"campaign\" without DLC is 45 matches of playing against bots to collect 45 post cards.\nHOWEVER, the different bots do seem to posses diffent AIs for each character.
