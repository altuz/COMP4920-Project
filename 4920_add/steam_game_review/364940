Too grindy for a youth game? Failing at all survival gauges locks you out the minigames but does not otherwise affect the experience badly. Has fast forward button...\n\nThis is Stardew valley. You get to be a 3D pony. There are 6 locations with minigames and by keeping survival gauges high you can engage in them, and the NPCS, to try and simulate a happy pony life. You can use any money you make from these activities to upgrade your farm/sandbox area where you can spawn vanity items for RPing purposes as well as cooldown/clicker coin generators in the form of crops and fruit trees.\n\nMain concern is the cheap audiovisual assets with flat texturing, the brutal entry fee through grinding and the general lack of narrative hook or anything to get you started. Otherwise the different hubs do seem like they could offer a variety of minigames and offer a little microcosm of pony life for those who want it. Just the way it is introduced and implemented turns the player off from wanting more rather than entice them in.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504832852, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506044291, "recommendationid": "34805653", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505789", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463486975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1038, "steamid": "76561198136352696", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a game for bronies like me I like my little pony and other shows\nand the reason I like this game cause it has mini games just like Talking Angela", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506022138, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506022138, "recommendationid": "35112110", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499531", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 84, "total_reviews": 108, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 24}}
