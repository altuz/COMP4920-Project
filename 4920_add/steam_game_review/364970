This is a software for non programers, or those like me who prefer to focus on art and design, rather than typing tons of code. For this Coppercube is the best out there. Porting between PC, MacOS, WebGl, Android, and flash is near seamless. Most of the time its as simple as clicking the publish to option. There are tons of behaviors and actions to mix and match to do most things you will need, and their is a Javascript API if you want even more control. I've used quite a few game engines over the years (Multimedia Fusion, Gamemaker, 3DRad, Jamagic, Gamesalad) and none were as easy and fast to develop 3D applications than Coppercube. \n\nBUT if you looking for a engine that supports cutting edge technologies, endless libraries of game resources, portability to every device on the market, and constant frequent updates, this may not be the engine for you. Coppercube is actively developed by one dev but he also has a handful of other tools he manages so updates are usually months apart. While small there is a community that shares custom actions, behaviors, and plugins for Coppercube. Keep in mind their are graphical limitations with this engine, so don't expect the same level of GFX as you would expect from Unreal, Cryengine, or Unity.\n\nAs with Standard vs Professional, the only real difference is that Standard limits you to 10 scenes, and there is no limit on Professional (professional also allows you to edit the source, but if you are able to do that you probably wouldn't need coppercube anyways). To be honest you really don't need more than 10, its not too hard out a system where you can reuse nodes to make larger scenes to reasonably stay within that limit. You can always upgrade later if you need it.\n\nWith that said I'm still happy with my decision with Coppercube. (I have the professional version) I have been developing a game on it since December 2016. Hopefully you find this review is useful.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496504955, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496504955, "recommendationid": "32155489", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531956", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506125323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 494, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14868, "steamid": "76561198046158319", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have been playing around with CopperCube the past couple of weeks and I have fallen in love. 1 being that it is easy to get something simple up and running but also the option and simplistic coding. I start messing with the action and coding behaviors and find it to be quite easy when following their tutorial (but I am coding savvy). Graphic wise it isn't Unity but I am not out to make a AAA game either.\n\nI am running this on my Surface 3 so anyone who comes across my review I would say it runs smoothly on it and isn't a resource hog which is a huge plus to me. \n\nThings I would like to see in the future of this product:\n-Built in script editor vs the current Script Window just to run and test scripts.\n\n-An Option to remove textures and Models from the current project library would be nice. Or maybe instead of a Prefab Window (just an option to open it)replace it with a Project Resource Window for the user to have access to things only currently used in the active project. Yes, there is the Scene Graph but when you have something that you want to have in the scene multiple times it would be better to be able to drag and drop versus right click the object and cloning then moving. (That's just my opinon) or searching for it again in the Prefab library. Make it easier to organize content that is just for that project.  Having the Del key to delete items in the library would be very helpful.\n\n-Maybe an option to specifiy more than one type of vegatation image to make landscapes feel more organic. Also the option to have an Array of trees to be placed so that landscape trees would look more varied. With trees comes bushes since there is a tree generator maybe a bush generator.\n\nWell, I hope that my review would be able to help anyone. I am curious if a 6 is in the works and would love to find any progress updates.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495406039, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495406039, "recommendationid": "31892093", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509424", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501959541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 341, "steamid": "76561198113094231", "num_games_owned": 45}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I tried this copper cube 5 I understand the the action well. but trying to find objects prove to be anoying I tried ambiera for 69 nine dollars. didn't help neither.\n\nthe discusion group tried to help 5 times you tube also. \nI already paid alot to no finding objects \n\nI disapointed and remind people if you have money and months to find things then it's recamended.
