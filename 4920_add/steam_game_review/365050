I dont say this for the reasons you would expect with this game. It isnt that the game itself is inherently difficult but instead that the physics dont match whats on your screen at all. The models dont interact on what you see. You are a box... so when you jump you would expect that if your corner is on top of a ledge that you would stop... but instead if you arent far enough on the ledge you seem to slide down a curved ramp thats hidden behind the ledge. \n\nSpikes. You would expect to touch them and die.. but on several occasions my box was in the spikes and i lived. other times i hadnt even hit the spikes yet and died. \n\nThere is no feedback to dying, no sound, no music. \n\nDont let the good looking lights fool you.
