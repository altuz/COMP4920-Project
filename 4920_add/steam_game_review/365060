Each mission has a side objective (find an item, kill an enemy) and a main objective, which usually entails getting to the end of the stage and fighting a gauntlet of enemies, or clearing out a series of large enemies through the level. \n\nThe art style is nice, and colorful; very easy on the eyes. The music is fine, and suits the game.\n\nThe meat of the game comes from the customization. You can acquire 16 diffferent skills but can only have a loadout of four at one time. Each one is unique, whether it offers damage, protection, or causes  status effects on enemies. As you collect gold, you can buy upgrades to your health, damage, and more. \n\nEven spending a little less then an hour farming gold to finish all the upgrades it didn't take me too long to get through this. All the achievements are easy, save the two for defeating bosses with no damage. There is also a hidden achievement, but I'm not sure what it entails. \n\nThis game is recommended.

But being honest here, there are much better games available than yours for free. The whole time I was playing your game I was thinking to myself, \"I could be playing Plazma Burst 2 and it would be more fun than this.  So many elements felt like they were thrown in to hit the checkboxes of being a platformer rather than to make the game more fun.\nPros- It references the best Star Wars movies lightly with the acheivements\n\nNeutral- The graphics are a bit dated but I see them fitting with this as a Flash game.\n\nCons- Story is awful, the intown NPCs dialogue never changes, and there is no feeling that I am making things better for these people. A few little things thrown into the background of the town after completing a mission would have helped here. \nThe enemy AI is weak and the enemies more annoying than fun to take out. Either go for adding a bunch and let me try to curbstomp them, or make them more powerful and give me cover and much better movement and better weapons. Please.\nThe movement needs to be more polished, it is annoying the number of times that I got stuck on the edge of a ledge and was unable to jump up. Also double jump is too weak to largely help in combat and felt like it was added to hit a checkbox.\nFirerate is too slow, weapons largely aren't upgradeable, and it makes about as much sense for me to be unable to launch a drone or fire a laser when my primary weapon is in cooldown as it does to say that I can't scratch my butt while brushing my teeth.\n\nIn all I would say that this game in the state it is currently in should be something that is released for free in order to receive feedback.\nTo the dev I will list some of the free games I have played that this game made me think of in terms of platforming run-and-gun elements as to how it could have been better.\nDiamond Hollow 2\nPlazma Burst 2\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440700731, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440700731, "recommendationid": "17742135", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500415", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491519079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 221, "steamid": "76561198126986136", "num_games_owned": 278}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "First off Buy it its 5 bucks.
