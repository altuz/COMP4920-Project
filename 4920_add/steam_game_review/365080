Always picking the weakest enemy guarantees that you will win. There is no character development or any choice, aside from who you recruit and fight.\nThere is no dialogue with the other characters, they will just give you a quote (which is sometimes cut off mid-word at the end as if there is a character limit)\n\nBut then again this game, like other games from Locomotivah is not about gameplay, but about the story and about reflection. So does it deliver on this front?\nWell, as stated before I was pleasantly surprised at seeing the title but my excitement was replaced with worry as soon as I saw the protagonists name as Miala is not a Congolese name. It made me worried about the research behind the game and unfortunately this worry proved to be justified.\nNone of the Congolese names are actually Congolese, they range in Culture from Southern African to Western African and anything in between. This made it very hard for me to get into the game, as I never got the idea that I was anywhere near the Congo, the Belgian names were reasonably accurate though.\nYou get virtually no background information before you get started and even if you click on \"learn more\" there is very limited information, including a 5 book Bibliography of which only one is from the past twenty years.\n\nI also find it strange that one of the locals would compare Leopold II's riches to Rochefeller in one of the quote's. What would they care about Rochefeller? The story about Miala himself, which progresses whenever you kill a district commander, is also rather classic and unimaginative. And why in the world did the writers feel the need to[spoiler]have him schooled and taught by a white man in matters of philosophy and warfare before he could rise to be a hero and rally his people? Every one of his ancestors probably knew more about those subjects than the average Belgian...[/spoiler]\n\nAnyway, to summarize: This game is a shallow execution of an interesting topic.\n\n\nPro's:\n\n+ Interesting topic\n+ Attempt to bring a lesser known part of history to attention\n\nCons:\n\n- Poor immersion\n- Very limited roleplay\n- Hardly any strategy\n- Sometimes text is cut off \n- some spelling mistakes", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431718779, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431718919, "recommendationid": "15843371", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584758", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431572576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 178, "steamid": "76561197970548935", "num_games_owned": 7952}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Positive things first: Good intent in the story and selection of topic. Yet the game leaves the impression that the historical issue was only scratched on the surface. The choice of the actual gameplay mechanic, which is quite simplistic (build up army, fight, repeat, repeat, watch your fatigue) and that of the protagonist seem both quite out of touch with historic realities. \n\nI might have rather played a text adventure as E. D. Morel in the \u00abCongo Free State Propaganda War\u00bb or anything from a western perspective that touches well documented reality, than as Miala, a fictional very vaguely defined native African rebellion leader in his early twenties. Spoiler: [spoiler] He dies after winning the final Battle against King Leopold II himself (seriously?) at age 31? Just Why? [/spoiler].\n\nThe gameplay almost exclusively consists out of grinding through battles and increasing the strength of your army by beating the easiest opponents first (conveniently labeled \u00abvery easy\u00bb). The Campaign is beatable in under 30 minutes, probably always in under an hour. Once you figured out what does what in the very abstract fights, it's pretty much impossible to lose the game if you stick to the easiest opponents first. Since there is no variation or obvious alternate endings, the game itself doesn't offer any new content or difficulty in repeated playthroughs. It seems to be strictly linear. \n\nA lot of good chances were missed here and the lack of media other than text is astonishing, no explanatory maps, no short general introduction into the history of colonialism. The game itself transports no feeling of the horrors, only facts. One might want to read Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" or (re-)play Spec Ops: The Line (which is very loosely based on Apocalypse Now and Conrad's Book) and just imagine the setting being transformed to the Congolese jungle, to compensate for that.\n\n\n\nBut for anyone who starts playing this and eventually learns on elsewhere about the topic and in the process probably gets lost in Wikipedia, I can still only recommend the game and hope for a better more extensive revisit to the topic at large in the future.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431396409, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431569840, "recommendationid": "15794995", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520953", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431397265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 50, "steamid": "76561198028185820", "num_games_owned": 396}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The story suckered me into it, but the gameplay ruins it.
