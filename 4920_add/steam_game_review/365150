Pacman with cubes.. :) Or your favourite maze runner.. in its most simply way..\nThe soundtrack is maybe the only negative thing, since it's awful, but the game itself has nice controls (for being an extremely simple maze game of course), increasing levels of difficulty and overall well, you just have to navigate through mazes avoiding evil cubes and collecting tokens, nothing more and nothing less :P\nIf you're searching for a simple and Unity-made short maze runner, this isn't bad as many others here.\nAnd yeah speaking of difficulty, some ragequits may occur in the latter levels XD\nLabyrinth may be small, but most of the times they're timed and there's spikes in there :P", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505246979, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505246979, "recommendationid": "34907787", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514648", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
