Open world.\n\nDeep rich story with supernatural touches including the most mythical beast in Canadian lore.\n\nGreat graphics.\n\nDefinitely worth playing.

The way the story is told as you explore various areas and write stuff in your journal is very nice and makes a detective feel to the story. Only thing which bothered me was the ending which I believe they could have done better. The narrator voice is good and makes us connected with the main story and the character.\nThe game is short as some people said but it took me full 9 hours to search every nook and cranny of the map to obtain all the collectibles and flesh out the story more. I also decided to earn all achievments in this game in one playthrough which took the most of my time. There are not many enemies in the game as its focused more on storytelling and atmosphere. Its a bit like \"Firewatch\" with more mystery elements thrown in.\nPerformance and graphics wise the game looks and works good and I did not face any issues. I would recommend this game for its tight atmosphere and exploration.
