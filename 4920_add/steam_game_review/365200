As this is a rhythm shooter primarily, it literally behooves the player to shoot on the 16th, but that's somehow \"wrong\" even while it's on beat (the majority of the songs in this game are a flat 4:4)\n\nThe keyboard keys are 1, q, a, z (try to imagine how your hand sits to hit those on beat,) and the studio has literally done absolutely nothing to make it accessible on a gamepad, which is criminal considering that without a touchscreen, this game is basically unplayable. *Maybe* a gamepad or a rhythm controller like a Rock Band guitar, could be mapped to make it better, but the control mapping functions are completely stock, have labels that are not related to game functions (so you don't know if you are mapping a button to \"top lane\" or to \"Loud mode\" or what,) and the stock gamepad mapping is basically unplayable as shipped. A simple gamepad control scheme would make this game great, but it apparently wasn't worth it to the team to map one, or even make it easy for us to do it ourselves. \n\nGood music, neat idea, unplayable game. Seriously, take the couple of hours to map some worthwhile controls to the *primary* control method available on PC's before you just ship shit to Steam, where we'll be playing with gamepads or mouse n keys. OR at least relable the remapping menu, so that we can do it ourselves.

The music is AMAZING!!! I didn't know many of the bands when I started but I really enjoyed the soundtrack. The game takes a moment to pick up and I often found myself losing on a first go around but once I knew the song a bit and figured out the beat I was able to beat the levels. The game is kind of a mix of plants vs zombies and guitar hero. Its not the most complex game out there but if you love good music and want to shoot aliens I highly recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468967134, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468967134, "recommendationid": "24415859", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495171", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482792550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 321, "steamid": "76561198155485147", "num_games_owned": 65}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun and unique game with a great launch overall, but controls need to be revamped.
