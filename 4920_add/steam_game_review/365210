Each time I tried playing through as differently as possible, each time I got the exact same results. There is VERY little alteration in gameplay, choices do nothing long term. Now for the other issues, this game is pathetic in how blatantly liberal it is, rather than ask for your gender the game asks for your PRONOUNS, with the option to opt out and be identified with genderless pronouns, which frankly, having these options exist hilariously cringey, the game is riddled with this crap, even when it introduces love interests it makes you play the pronoun game, not to mention you can clearly choose all the male pronouns but still force your little niece to call you her aunt, its disgusting, really. The games pro-communist rhetoric as well, gets incredibly old, it portrays all anti-communists as evil nazis and shows off the communists like good hard working people who love everyone. TL;DR   This game has very little replayability, and was made by an incredibly biased leftist", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498641540, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498641635, "recommendationid": "32922574", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487673", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 60, "total_reviews": 67, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
