It's totally different than other games.\nIf you like micromanagement, that's your game, you will face a lot. There is no summary the total energy, food, resources, etc. used or surplus if you have any. Just the credit balance. So I decide to make an Excel sheet to sums up things. And I also made a periodic table visual aid. And it's working for me. I'm working in production, so it's close to me.\n\nYou have to make high income to pay the fleets. The patent system will help you. Just watch the energy, food, labour, officers, and the resources and gases and etc. Colonize systems, build fleets to ( at least ) defend yourself.\n\nSo I was looking for something new, and I found it. It's harder than other games you can buy here ( someone says it's unfinished game, with features missing). \n\nIf you like micromanagement and galactic conquest in economic perspective, try this game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434395820, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434395820, "recommendationid": "16425453", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479604", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436012678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561198031056100", "num_games_owned": 151}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is practically an upgrade game, not a stategy one.
