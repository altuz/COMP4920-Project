This is *only* Chapter One - at no place in the description or title is that made clear. If I had known, I'd have waited for a full (or fuller, anyway) version. Perhaps I should have dug deeper, but it is the norm to post that info in the description.\n\nAs far as the game itself: the art is very good. That's about all I can say positive.\n\nThe puzzles are very simple; however, you are often left hanging with inadequate input. While I don't expect to be hand-held, basic info should be available (there is at least one puzzle where you can work it and work it - but nothing happens unless you \"activate\" the pieces - which is not indicated at all, not even a simple \"Hmm, this fits but something's missing\"). Frustrating. Nor is there any guide or indication that you can do things like combine pieces in your inventory; again, basic information.\n\nThe storyline is less than gripping, the scripting poor and the voice acting annoying. You cannot skip through it either, as far as I was able to tell.\n\nI generally enjoy this type of game as a light, relaxing activity. Between the lack of information, simplicity of the puzzles and lack of fair description I have to downvote this, despite the very professional art. Simply not worth the price for one chapter.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431106040, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431106040, "recommendationid": "15742828", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506519", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431217942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 78, "steamid": "76561197994020414", "num_games_owned": 686}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I will start with the positives.  I really like the artwork, it has a nice painterly feel.  I also enjoyed the puzzles, though they perhaps could have been a little harder.  The voice acting, while short and a bit repeatative when clicking something incorrect, was decent.\n\nAnd now for what I felt could have been improved.  The game is VERY short.  The story, while interesting, is not very interwoven into the game itself.  I felt like I was given a bit of the story then thrown into a series of rooms almost unrelated.  While trying not to include spoilers, which would completely ruin any gameplay this game has, some of the interactions could have been more intuitive.\n\nFor a game like this, I wish Steam had a neutral recommendation.  If you find it on sale, perhaps it is worth your while, but not for the full price.
