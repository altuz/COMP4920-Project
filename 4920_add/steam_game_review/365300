This game is basically Half Life 2 with a few different mechanics. The game is even set in the same world. And with Valve not making HL3, this is as close as it gets. I have absolutly no complaints about the gameplay, story, or anything in the game. My only complaint is that the story is to short. It is only four chapters, but the chapters are GREAT. The engine is still the Source engine so no performance problems and a nice physics system. As I said above, this game is basically HL3 - YOU SHOULD BE DOWNLOADING THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!\n\nThe game is free, so if you somehow manage to dislike the game, you won't have spent any of your hard earned money on it. I have no idea why this game is free, they should DEFINITLY be charging money for it - the entire game looks and feels like it was made by a professional development studio who put in a lot of hours to make this game basically perfect.\n\nThe game features a new gun (Based off of the Gravity Gun) but instead of picking things up and throwing them, this gun launches glowing balls of energy that a) kill everything b) make you fly like a crazy maniac on some serious drugs and c) blows everything up that it can ... Basically, it is the most awesome gun every created and is somthing I miss every time I replay HL2 now (Valve should totally add it to HL2 (Or someone should create a mod...)). While you CAN get all the other guns from HL2, you don't really need to... or want to. The new Grav gun is awesome enough. I mean seriously, when can I get one of those in real life? Some one needs to invent it.\n \n\nAnd Devs, if you are reading this, please oh please make this game longer... Also, actually use that darkness mechanic (It's really cool, but you only use it for that one room).\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 10/10\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, as a \"side\" thing, the game is called TRANSMISIONS: ELEMENT 120... and 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 so maybe HL3 confirmed? Also, it has 3 numbers so again HL3 Confirmed?", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486589858, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489078959, "recommendationid": "29789980", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528599", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488233236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 164, "steamid": "76561198049659892", "num_games_owned": 142}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The only complaint about Transmissions: Element 120 is that it's too short! \n\nMORE, PLEASE!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488233339, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488233339, "recommendationid": "30228876", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521392", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488138771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 64, "steamid": "76561198210967807", "num_games_owned": 26}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is all we ever wanted!
