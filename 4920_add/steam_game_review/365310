Meet Dr. Hayfeather and enjoy a fun story and world that matches the colorful retro aesthetic of Organ Biker's 8 bit graphics and 80's new wave and hip hop inspired chiptune soundtrack.\n\n[u] Release Date: 1 Jun, 2015[/u]\n\n[h1]The Gameplay [/h1]\nThe gameplay is pretty basic but it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Even the first level is quite hard to get past. It respawns you in the busiest lane of traffic and you just get pummeled by a non-stop flow of speeding cars. There is a period of invincibility for a few seconds after respawn but it doesn't always work, sometimes you just die instantly even though your guy is blinking.\n\nAll in All [u]Organ Biker[/u] is a simply Retro-Racing Game! \n\n8/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep [/i]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503140524, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503140524, "recommendationid": "34347978", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499744", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
