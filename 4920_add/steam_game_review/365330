The most broken, frustrating, unsatisfying experience I have had in a LONG time. \n\nHorribly clunky unresponsive, glitchy movement. Luck based pointless spamfest \"fighting\". Absolutely no story to speak of whatsoever.\n\nAll you do is go through an ambiguously stereotypically asian city filled with spikes, rolling barrels that spawn literally out of thin air, bullets that literally spawn out of thin air, and ambiguously stereotypically asian enemies. You beat them all up in exactly the same fashion, none of them act differently other than slightly different barebones animations, even the \"bosses\" are exactly the same as the mooks, except with more health and a unique sprite. \nOnce you beat the last \"boss\" the game cuts to a black screen with \"...a good workout\" or something like that, and then your booted to the title screen. \n\nAlso did I mention that there is NO way of saving progress in any way. You quit? You start over. Your PC died suddenly? You start over. \n\nMany MANY times I have been killed because the game just did not read my inputs, or straight up did the wrong thing, resulting in my death, and sometimes the game just sends you flying upwards forever when you jump up a ledge (thankfully there is a reset checkpoint button), and the collision detection is extremely random, something that would normally kill me doesn't, and vice versa. \n\nThe last level (Level 5) is absolutely disgusting and highlights all of the game's problems I mentioned previously. As well as stupidly long rooms. \n\nThe soundtrack is decent at best.

MORE PLEASE!!!\nWell, the thing is its too fucking frustrating. The enemies have no real rhyme or reason to their attack patterns, and there are spikes fucking everywhere. The game is a death trap and don\u2019t blame your audience for not being hard core gamers that transcend the PC gaming master race/class. We tenacious types are hard to come by these days.\n\nthe best part is, the game actually has realistic controls and free running physics for the main character. The last game was better flowing with free form puff jumping and more open environments to explore and enemy attack patterns that made sense, sure the combat got old, but the very first game was about the combat, second game wacko bananas ninja jumps, this one combines realistic jumps with fantasy spikes and trash cans and Chinese warriors from out of nowhere.\n\nThe death trap environments, along with the true-to-life(ish) actions of the character make platforming a pixel nightmare, and a real test of patience.\n\nI feel that the game could have had a better challenge curve, but i suppose its fine as is. all the same, don\u2019t expect as many people to have the patience that i had.\n\nAlso, if anyone cares to notice, I\u2019ve been referring to these games as a series, and that\u2019s because I feel they may all be the same story\n\n*spoilers for Samurai_Jazz*\nIn the first 2 you're the same guy. At the end of 1 you get to (either) lay your masters soul to rest after he commits suicide at the beginning and (or) fight a dark reflection of yourself that stabs you in the back anyway, but that could have been all in your mind and it\u2019s supposed to make you think of honor vs. all of the killing you did to get there...\n\n*spoilers for Shin Samurai Jazz*\nFlash forward a few years and you're (either) dead and (or) a ninja, and back in the city where your master died and there\u2019s a gang of undead thugs still running the place. You fight the yakuza style 1920s/30s gangs and demons in the first game, now followed by 3 spirits. You take down the last gang the three spirits take over the world instead, and finally you conquer them in the name of humanity or something. The spirits basically loose all power and as a last hearty FU to the \"Ronin\", they cut the bleeding earth in half!\n\n*Spoilers for Jump Boxer*\nThe game starts and you look like some hobo that\u2019s fighting at shadows. But after a few sections, I started passing by graffiti that was a tribute to the \"Ronin\".\nmy guess is, the earth got screwed, Ronin moved into a city where the earth was stable (or he managed to fix the earth somehow), he moved to china, and now as a senile old man, he free-runs around the inner city, and he's either shadow boxing his hallucinations or he's continually haunted by the spirits of dead warriors for being the one responsible for Japanese demons fucking up the earth...
