It also has quite a fair bit more color to to the levels,and has frequent use of music. It introduces a variety of parkour moves that are not present in prince of persia and divides the action between dungeon-style levels in dojos that have death traps, then introduces a little bit of diversity while navigating to the next dojo, beating up some guys on the way, and solving a bunch of smaller easier parkour sections while travelling.\n\nThings are not all rosey however. The game, despite the fairly complex lowkick highkick lowpunch highpunch block system that trumps prince of persia's simple swordfighting, has a noticeable input lag. Most noticeable in the combat actually, but also present during navigation, in by which if you press a key while another action is performed the key is flat out ignored. This is present to a less extent in prince of persia whom allowed change of directions on the fly. Also this game's combat is rather ridiculous, you can simply go punch punch kick, punch punch kick while going forward and you willl beat every foe every time.\n\nThe music changes when going from inside to outside locations but the sampling is very short and loops constantly. \n\nThe colors are, well colorful, but prince of persia had a distinctive aesthetic with its nearly monochrome presentation only adding in the rare colored element into the mix. The soundblaster era sound effects were clearly superior on prince of persia's part. Prince of persia had fairly solid exposition with a cool intro and mysterious persia setting. The animation work in both game come a wash as The way of the Pixelated fist as great animation work for the characters, but prince of persia has a near motion-capture like quality to the way the animation translates muscle and body movement of the protagonist that is not quite captured here. The death traps in prince of persia had sound effects and looked a lot nicer, and most damning of all, this game just spawns you back at the beginning of a level with no death animation. Getting impaled, crushing your character and getting sliced in half was half the fun of prince of persia and seeing it omitted here seems like a great missed opportunity.\n\nI could go on, but once you factor in the nostalgia factor. Prince of Persia 1989 comes out the winner hands down. Both games are equally frustrating in that you often know what you try to accomplish and struggle with the controls as you try to make it happen. Unfortunately the use of a controller did not help given the input lag, which prince of persia does not have but forces the user to suffer through a rather insane keyboard layout including arrow keys, shift and whatnot.\n\nSo in conclusion this is a really nice homage style game, I probably would had kept it around just for kicks, but after beating the first dojo I was unable to enter the following dojo for levels 8-16 I button mashed the Y button, and every other button and no dice. Maybe I am missing something but this game has very little exposition and story so I doubt I am missing a plot trigger.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496973031, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505087281, "recommendationid": "32280875", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496359", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 6}}
