The music is great, and they know how to make me laugh everytime I go through it. Like someone else mentioned it is pretty linear but I enjoy the story anyways. I think even people who never watched an anime or touched manga would enjoy this. If you like to watch anime/games that has comedy and romance this is a game you should play. ^^", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506772238, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506772238, "recommendationid": "35334103", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 30, "total_reviews": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 9}}
