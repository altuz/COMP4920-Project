Would DLC be nice? Sure. I would have loved some Valkyries or scumbag weebs from out East, but this game is rad without it. If a negative review says otherwise, they're just wrong. Look at these hours, friendo. I'd say it's thirty dollars well spent.\n\nIt's a mercenary company simulator. Hire men, build up their stats and skills, equip them and watch them killed horribly by undead, wolves, orcs, other humans and the occasional Viet Cong goblin sniper shot from halfway across the map. Find contracts from penny-pinching nobles and townsfolk to take caravans across the country for less than your men get paid in day. Get into four fights along the way, and have vampires hop out of the shipping crates to forcibly retire your band.

The casual gamer can have fun with this if you don't mind losing every now and again, but this game is a perfectionist's dream. \n\nNo game short of Blood Bowl 2 will frustrate you more with dice. No game will reward you more when you find ways to overcome them. This game will break your heart, and go in dry with no lube. Other times, you'll wish you could make sweet passionate love to it. But it isn't an RNG shit-show. Minimize risk, position correctly, and come prepared. Do everything to swing RNG in your favor, and you'll be better off for it. \n\nYou can't always win, but you never lose.

For the sake of argument, you could say that there was enough flavour text to draw out the world. You could also say that each character has its own story, and you would be correct on both counts. But an interpretation of the world and my subordinates' story isn't enough, I want *my* story, unique to myself where my decisions matter to the world.\n\nFor example, I wanted to be a bad guy from the start of the game. After the prologue of having my merry band getting slaughtered I wanted to gather more people like myself, set-up a hideout and ambush peasants going to and fro. Kidnap them, maybe hold ransoms and such. Running from the army to instead, kill small mercenary groups, the kinds of which I was once in. But to continue the story, you have to play the good guy route. Fair enough, most RPGs just takes the player along a particular route and it does not offer two different choices. Still I was disappointed from the lack of freedom.\n\nAnother example, I come across raiders ambushing peasants along their way to wherever. I decided to save them, so I did. But after that, there was hardly any interactions with them after the battle. No options to recruit them (forcefully), no reward haggling or even a simple flavour message from them saying \"thank you sire, you have saved my life, etc\". You could argue that I could just imagine them myself, but I want *them* to thank *me* at that moment in time. From there my immersion was starting to wear off and I was disappointed of the lack of interaction and choices with the denizens of the world.\n\nThe last example, which I was very critical about is that I can't be in fights. I can't even see myself inside the game, I have to imagine myself in the back lines directing people with my godly voice (which must've been so loud that  it can reach my subordinates regardless of distance). Imagine myself travelling with them all over the continent and imagine myself dying after my subordinates die because I'm a weak scholar that cannot carry a sword and will automatically die if not a single friendly was beside me. At first I thought it should be fine, but I found myself disinvolved in the life and death of my subordinates, only the waste of time that I spent bringing their levels up and how it was a chore to raise another character in lieu of the dead ones. I find myself just clicking on the map anticipating that some event will happen which would break this monotonous cycle of getting jobs to get money so that I can get stronger so I can do a higher paying jobs...\n\nI was really disappointed that I can't get my own character; who should I roleplay in combat? You could argue that a model representing me inside combat doesn't matter. But I *strongly* believe in the concept that every RPG game should have a representative of the player in any situation inside the game. Especially in a game where combat is esentially the whole game. It's literally inside this game's name *Battle* brothers, If I'm not inside the battle then where would I be when it occurs? It's an oversight I cannot overlook.\n\nAfter playing multiple playthroughs I find myself having the same experience on each and every one. Because in one game, I can try out different character builds on different brothers. The only difference being the end-game event, which I have to admit I haven't experienced yet. So replayability is also lacking I feel.\n\nThe combat, the core of the game, is overall very satisfying and fleshed out, with an engage/disengage system and separate head and body armor bar along with the default health bar. Hexagonal battle boards and corresponding change in sprite when a character has wounds (a lack of a nose, when it has a missing nose injury). The sound effects; very satisfying, I can feel the *OOMPH* when a hit connects. I could say these features are very effective.\n\nMinor gripes that I have (in descending order):\n-no repurchase/resell feature; when you sell or buy things accidentally, you cannot sell/buy them for the same price.\n-little points of interests; besides rng hideouts and towns/fortresses, there really is nothing else (to my knowledge).\n-small map; I wanted to explore more but there are only ~10 towns in the entire continent and only one exploreable continent in the whole world.\n-few content(things to do) besides combat and features that supports it.\n-lack of tooltips regarding details like whether a weapon is piercing or not (piercing weapons are ineffective against undead)\n\ntl;dr\n\n+combat\n+music\n+sound effects\n+ambience\n+character models change according to their injuries\n\n-lack of immersion\n-lack of freedom in game direction\n-lack of interactivity with people on the road\n-no player model\n-little replayability\n\nDo I regret buying it for $29? Yes I did.\n\nDo I regret buying it? No I did not.\n\nThough I'm a disappointed in the of immersion department, I'll just treat it as a medieval sellsword management simulator.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504679140, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504679140, "recommendationid": "34770472", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500198", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505770152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6478, "steamid": "76561198040904160", "num_games_owned": 51}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a good game, with solid gameplay, music, and graphics, but the devs fucked up the development.\nNo mod support, no more development, nothing for the end game.\nIf you can, get it on sale, but only on sale.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505668138, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505668138, "recommendationid": "35028544", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501067", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506467535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11526, "steamid": "76561197994100817", "num_games_owned": 277}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is a piece of art from various aspects.

I like turn based games, (Xcom is my all time favorite) and of the batch I bought I played this one first. \n\nI am giving up on it.  \n\nI'll start with what I liked.  I liked the setting, the text vignettes of events, the idea of managing a mercenary company.  I liked the Germanic background (as I'm about to start German classes) and the art style, the bobblehead characters somehow fit.  \n\nThe game at it's core is a combat game.  I tried what I thought would work on my own (pikemen behind shields) with ok results.  Not that great, getting beat up bad against Orcs and Goblins.  I went online, read some battletips about how great bows are.  I tried several bow mercs that constantly got slaughtered first.  It almost seems the AI has better range/aim.  I went back to my shield/pikemen approach, which works pretty good but I still take some losses and am grinding a living.  I went online and read about picking your battleground, dont just charge their archers.  I read the various factions faq.  I just quit ragequit the game after brigands would not charge me, I spent turns moving back and then they just won't come, they will wait until the end of time on the higher-ish better ground.  Now, maybe that would make sense in real life but this is a game (not to mention I read that strategy online, maybe a new build killed it).  You don't have enough of an edge in combat to go charging in all the time, and the AI is a tad bit clunky.  Everytime I move I end up with like 1-2 actions points and I have to spacebar (wait) or return (end turn) and then ... it's hard to explain, but believe me moving is a tad clunky on the interace and then having the AI wait me out was the final straw.  \n\nI give up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504656579, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504656579, "recommendationid": "34766768", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498854", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505622279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18808, "steamid": "76561198031108824", "num_games_owned": 30}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Battle Brothers is a fantastic low-fantasy, turn-based strategy game, styled after various tabletop board games like \"Cry Havoc\" and \"Seige.\" Yet rather than playing out a single scenario, in Battle Brothers you'll be faced with the ongoing challenge of managing a mercenary company and all that entails: keeping your men fed and paid, ensuring morale doesn't become a liability, and finding work that won't get your sellswords killed. Come up short in any of these areas and you'll face desertion or doom -- but if you're cautious, cunning, and a little bit lucky you'll live long enough to become a legend.\n\nThe world's backstory is fairly understated. You can tease out some of it through completing fights and crises, but it isn't the focus of the game, and you'll mostly be left to guess and wonder at your exact relation to it beyond being a man who kills for coin. After all, you're no noble born. You just point your men at the nasty things that scream and bleed. History is for the historians, let the living exalt or fear your mercenary company as you make your own tale. How many wars can you decisively win for the noble house that hires you? How many greenskin hordes can you put down? And how many times will you return the risen dead to their graves before your legend is finished?\n\nAside from battles, your interaction with the world will chiefly be through random events. Are you the kind of mercenary leader who orders his men to rob a band of children on an ill-fated crusade, or are you the kind to help fix merchants' broken wagons? Your choices for the events are all straightforward, no nasty surprises that turn your good deed into something heinous, or your foul act into a blessing to those around you. \n\nBeyond fighting for various employers, you can venture out into the wild lands and hunt for weapons and armor of a more legendary stature, or just pick fights with the meanest foes you can find as a break from butchering bandits and driving dire wolves into extinction.\n\nIf any of that sounded appealing to you, you'll definitely enjoy Battle Brothers.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505628623, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505628623, "recommendationid": "35015383", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501940", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1901, "total_reviews": 2208, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 307}}
