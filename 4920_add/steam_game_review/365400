But beyond that, my biggest problem here is the controls. This game was designed for a mobile platform in terrms of the type controls that it's going for, you don't get the precision that you'd want (at least I'd want) regarding the mouse. Sadly, that leads to a bunch of problems, and while variety eventually develops, the gameplay doesn't excite me as much as I would hope.\n\n+:\n-It now runs\n-Different premise, interesting to say the least.\n-There's variety down the line.\n\n-:\n-Controls are too imprecise for my liking, and leads to some problems in terms of the technical precision needed to do some puzzles. Repeating the same parts over again can get irritating.\n-Music will wear on you, and also got a DMCA on one part one when attempting to make a video (just fyi for YTers out there).\n-Gameplay lacks oompf. \n-Early on, combination of imprecise controls and gameplay leads to problems.\n\nFootage of Gameplay:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uskOzz-XBC4\nFootage of attempted Play here for first video: http://youtu.be/ivgbev2r34E", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1431372966, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431359346, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431391799, "recommendationid": "15788531", "developer_response": "please start the game in administrator mode, your windows blocks configuration file. have fun", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514163", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
