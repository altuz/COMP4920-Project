I have not logged a lot of play time, however I have watched a few tutorial videos and have learned that this is not a gap in my understanding of rules/controls, but is in fact how the game was designed to be played. \n\nFundamentally what bothers me about the game is the fact that you are not building consistent trade that develops and grows over time. Instead every turn the resources demanded by planets and the prices are re-rolled, and all your convoys from last turn are removed, and you basically have to plan things from scratch. This is enjoyable for a few turns but quickly becomes tedious, especially with larger empires. It is frustrating to invest five minutes thinking through an excellent trade route, only to have it removed the next turn (and with no way to recreate it). Not only that, but it removes an element of long term strategy from the game as I do not expand based on optimizing my current trade network, but instead expansion is best done through a simple greedy algorithm (grab the best, nearest planet every time), since the world will compleltely change next turn. \n\nI would accept the fact that you basically start each turn from scratch trade-wise if the controls of the game made it very easy to set up new trade (and the only difficulty being thinking through and optimizing things - aka the fun part!). Instead everything from the camera control (the game would honestly be better if they scrapped the whole planetary system thing and replaced it with a board game style system with no third axis of rotation to mess the view up), to the ui/menus (no way to see what the second resource a corporation wants to trade is - you can only see the resource it wants that turn, you need to zoom in to see text after clicking on a planet, and the tooltips are awful), to setting up trade (watch a tutorial: even the devs have trouble clicking back, and trade, and travel, and figuring out what the hell is going on). The single most frustrating aspect is the system of fleets, which mean that if you are creating a very large trade route, and you have almost finished it, but the last planet you want to visit doesn't have enough fleets (or fuel or whatever) to visit, then you need to undo the ENTIRE trade route, then add fleet to the planet, then redo the entire trade route (being able to add fleet while making a trade route would help here). It feels as though the game was only tested on tiny three planet systems, and the devs didn't bother to see how controls work with larger systems. \n\nMy two main issues compound to make the game unplayable for me. While I would personally enjoy creating long term strategies over the turn-by-turn optimiziation the game instead asks for, I understand how this system can also be fun and challenging, and was willing to give it a shot. However with the aweful controls, having to re-think everything turn-by-turn makes the game too frustrating and slow to be playable. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450794144, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1450794144, "recommendationid": "19843498", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602603", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433665479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 361, "steamid": "76561197983226094", "num_games_owned": 150}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 36, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Apollo4x is a very unique attempt at a 4x game, that focuses on building and optimizing an economic system.

Its not very flexible on its approach, its a one-off goal to expand and exploit with an over-arching goal to exterminate (or win by other means before your own demise) and that to me is a bit misleading still.

You have an interest in Space 4X? You like the many Space Trading Games? You enjoy games like Magic: The Gathering? You actually crave games that make you think?\n\nIf you have answered yes to one, or even all of the above. You owe yourself to give Apollo4X a purchase. Yes, I am saying that right away. Why? Because all the aforementioned is in this game and then some! But now, you are probably thinking..\n\n\"Oh great, another game genre mashup that just will not work!... I'll Pass!\"\n\nHold on... Not only are each of these elements solid in their own right. But in Apollo4X, they come together to make a super solid, unique and rather innovative title that shouldn't be overlooked. As a 4X game, you will not do something, then mash the turn button waiting for something to do. Each turn has strategical depth. You must meet colonial demands, purchase resources, build up colonies, prepare and plan for trading. \n\nTrade is not an option in this game. It is one of Apollo4X's core mechanics. If you do not trade, you will go bankrupt, and you will lose the game. No population building leading to masses of taxes here. You have to be strategically aggressive in your interplanetary business, as the more you expand, the greater the upkeep. Colonists Empire-wide will also make demands. Ignore their demands, you suffer loss of approval rating and if that hits 0, you will also lose the game.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, there's the Alien Centaur threat to deal with. They are aiming to take over the whole galaxy, and most importantly, take you out by capturing your home planet of Apollo. Whilst their are no space battles in the game, land battles are played out as a card game. This game has a fantastic strategic complexity as battles are not one on one. Each card will affect several others in a deck. So what you select, and the tactics you choose in how to play them matters. So even when you are outnumbered and outgunned, it is still possible (But not easy) to win a battle.\n\nSo after some 1st impressions. What are the pros and cons?\n\nPROS\n\n- Starting the game, maps are not final. Feel at disadvantage?  Just don't like the map? Throw it out until you find something you like.\n\n- This game has depth from the start to the end. You will not be hammering the 'End Turn' Button. Gameplay is engaging and there's always plenty to do. Strategy is key, you will have to think! A strategy that works in one game, might not work in another.\n\n- A genre mashup that actually works. There's no 4X like it. Apollo4X is truly a unique and innovative game that pulls you in! \n\n- One more Turn Syndrome? You bet! The game is fun and totally engaging.\n\n- A welcome 2D galaxy option for those who require it.\n\n- Many options before starting a game can potentially serve up lots of replay value!\n\n- Your purchase will be helping to save rescued dogs... Good bang for your buck in both game and charity.\n\nCONS (Can also be positives for some, including myself)\n\n- Although not a disavantage by my standards. This game takes the old school approach. There is no tutorial mode. You will have to read the manual. Understand, and pay attention to what every section of the UI does. The learning curve will be steep at first.\n\n- Maps can get busy fast, and initial confusion might arise. There's a lot of information to react to every turn. Turns are not quick, and neither is mid-late game trading and combat. You will not finish a single game in just a few hours.\n\n- No storyline or campaign. Just the old school way to play. If you're looking for 100's of random events, and a story to follow. You will not find it here.\n\n- A few very small issues here and there which will be tightened up with a bit more community feedback.\n\n\nTL;DR? - An innovative 4X game that dares to be different from the normal formula, and as first impressions go, it suceeds!
