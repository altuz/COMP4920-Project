This is much more advanced features but has an easy to pick up simplicity to it that will have you easily creating any type of platformer you could imagine.\n\nTutorials are in the shape of sample levels as you walk over each tile it will instruct you what the tile in front of you does. It could kill you instantly like a spike trap  or let you bounce like mario. There are many tiles in many different categories.\n\nTiles are easy to place in the editor although I would prefer a quicker way of erasing a tile say being able to press delete to erase the tile under the cursor.\n\nI recommend this as you will be able to be able to make balls-hard platformer games with one pixel collision deaths similar to those awesome games back on the c64 and indie platformers of today.\n\nGreat!\n\nB1trider", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504969935, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505615622, "recommendationid": "34839620", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505548841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 87, "steamid": "76561198102529938", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really cool engine!\nIt's really easy to make any unique platformer game!\nNice community,a lot of cool people will help you with \nany problem you may have,even the developer!\nAlso it has some nice game-ready assets to get you started on your games!\n\n10/10 -me", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505509776, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505509776, "recommendationid": "34981354", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "total_reviews": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
