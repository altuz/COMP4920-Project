The puzzles were fun and challenging and some of the mini-plots were hilarious. While the end missions seemed a little bolted on, it was well worth it.\n\nThe only issue I had was understanding how shell overload worked. I was button mashing overload and would eventually get connected, but I didn't figure out the deliberate process. After a few hours I figured it out: when a server is protected with a proxy, each press of the shell overload will increase the speed of a bar that overlays the proxy status text. If you have more shells and press more overloads, that bar goes faster. Once it is full, the proxy is bypassed.\n\nI can imagine that this is not a game for everybody. You are terminal hacking, running programs, erasing logs, and figuring out vectors into target systems. But if you have some Linux experience and you want a hacker-esque game that gives you some thrills and chills, this is well worth it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506398631, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506429464, "recommendationid": "35215373", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495793379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 352, "steamid": "76561197989489227", "num_games_owned": 260}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really good, similar to uplink, with a bit more polish and story", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506915844, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506915844, "recommendationid": "35403908", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498947379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 15, "steamid": "76561198289884206", "num_games_owned": 54}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Maybe I`m just to dumb but I cant really figure the game (tutorial) out and I havent really tried to either.
