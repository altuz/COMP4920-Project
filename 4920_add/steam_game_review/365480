Considering the price tag of 14,99\u20ac it certainly delivers a fair amount of fun and some hours of highly interesting battle scenarios to a fair price.\n\nThe story is solid and you get the feeling the Devs put their heart into it. It certainly has a fair amount of stereotypical characters which use their own repertoire of catchphrases and lingual oddities, which certainly isn't everyones taste and seems to bug some people the wrong way. But overall the story has depth and some interesting developments, believable character interaction as well as some serious meaning to ponder about. I for one certainly enjoyed experiencing the campaigns and consider the storytelling to be the strongest part of the game experience.\nThe beautifuly hand-drawn battle environments and intermission scenes sure do their thing to put up atmosphere.\n\nThen there is the gameplay:\nWell, it is NOT Total War. It also did not copy the state-of-the-art other turn-based strategy deploys, like, for example, Zone of Control. It has it's own set of rules, and gets pretty harshly judged on them in some other reviews. \nHowever: I believe it works very well with its own rules. Having the limit, for commands you can give, surely seems unfair, considering the same restriction does not apply for the enemies. However: It adds another layer of depth. A question of priority. You have to think carefuly which elements to deploy and which to save. The AI does not have the restriction for commands, but it has the inherent problem that it is a simple AI and is therefore somewhat predictable. Some elements just wont need commands, as they fight themselves when engaged or by ranged combat. The combat system also awards planning ahead with the four avaiable standing orders like \"advance\" (move forward automaticaly each turn) or \"pursue\" (hunt down an enemy unit and ignore everything else). It also defines the interesting decision when to put units together into formation to move them with less commands and when to split them up for single action. From my experience there won't be a lot of idle units if you play smart, and apart from the early phases of the game you won't need more than those 6 commands per turn (likely even less).\n\nThen there is the utter lack of progression: No, you do not level your units, you do not gain stuff, you do not build stuff. You sit by, get a story told, get units and characters set for the next scenario and fight out puzzle-like battles to take part in their adventure.\nIt is a story-driven linear experience. So what? Last I checked not EVERY game needs to be a sandbox game or needs to stuff your face with goodies to be legitimate. (Not that I don't enjoy sandbox games or getting stuffed with goodies... >..> ) The scenarios are diverse enough to keep the whole thing interesting. At least if you didn't search for a sandbox-game.\n\nBottomline:\nSolid experience with a good price<->game ratio. If you do not expect more than a good linear story of some individuals which get caught up in war, kings, queens, nations and duty, with interesting battles in between, this is just your thing, and I'd definitly recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499696460, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499696460, "recommendationid": "33432070", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503461", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 20, "total_reviews": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
