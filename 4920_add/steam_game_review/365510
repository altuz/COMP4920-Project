I initially tried to play it the wrong way, by solving the puzzles without really thinking about them, and that's not very fun. The good way to play this game would be to puzzle out a plan to  the solution in your head first, before executing your plan.\n\nThe basic premise is you need to work your way towards having the tiles arranged in a certain order. This requires some level of foresight and some reverse engineering of the solutions, a task which I find quite difficult. You can find yourself to the solution randomly, but the big difficulty is in minimizing the number of moves it takes.\n\nThis provides a very difficult puzzle, but the earlier levels do offer a good way to ease you into it. And if you do find yourself burnin through all the levels, note that you're unlikely to run out as there are a lot of them.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492768357, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492768357, "recommendationid": "31271906", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504821", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
