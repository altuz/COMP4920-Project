I understand the value of the things I have deemed to be worth recording, and I understand the context of the words I have used to record them. If I were to show anyone else my diary, perhaps they would feel a sense of me and my life, of my feelings and of the experiences I've had, but they definitely not understand my diary the way I did. This isn't some grand statement about how people can never really know one another, this is simply me pointing out that I would never narrate my life in the style of a novel or a diary of some 80s teenager in a movie, listing exact details and long florid descriptions of actual events and people. I doubt anyone does. \n\nWhat I do instead is write shorthand. Feelings first. Minimal exposition, explanation, and structure. It's my diary, I didn't make it for anyone else. Why would I need to explain to myself what my life is like?\n\n[i]Beeswing[/i], if you haven't caught on, is a nonfiction video game from a certain Jack King-Spooner which feels very much to me as though I am reading someone else's diary. Someone else who apparently feels the way I do about the need to make your innermost thoughts traditionally readable. This of course, is an intentional choice, because this isn't someone's diary leaked to the internet, this is a game on Steam which is being sold for money to a public audience. So I have to accept that this is all as manipulated as any old three act story, a trick that the dev has used to make me feel a certain way, but I'll be damned if it hasn't worked.\n\nThe game is mostly a trip through various fragments of writing, small stories that are self-contained and often have the nature of either a subversive modern parable or meditations on particular themes (recurring ones being the fear of death, the alienated feelings of immigrants, the dispossession of the physically and mentally disabled). They have the thin premise of being things said by NPCs to the protagonist, Jack King-Spooner, who is taking a trip to visit his hometown Beeswing, but frequently enough the game breaks the fourth wall by talking about the background music or giving you tourist tips if you are ever in the actual area the game is set, to remind you that the game is really just a collection of memories that don't exist in a temporal or physical space that makes real world sense. You're guided through the game not by a feeling of accuracy to reality, but by the raw intimacy of the dev-author's nostalgia.\n\nTo that end the game is very successful. The \"handmade\" graphics, from water color to claymation to actual childhood photos, strengthen the feeling of intimacy, of looking through someone's box o' memories. Which is of course very appealing, because humans are snoops who love to get into each other's business. \n\nSo do I recommend? Yes. Would I like to see more games like this? Yes. Which is my favorite story? Probably Beatrice. Maybe the flour lady. Maybe Danny. It's a good game. Lots of good stories.
