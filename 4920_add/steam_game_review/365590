I mostly wait a year or two for gold edition or prices to drop. Most of modern games are broken or rushed by greedy publishers at the start and i do not like to be ripped off or be an unpayed betatester. I do not know how this game looked like at launch, so my judgement is not clouded by any kind of prejudice.)\n\t\n        I did install this at the free weekend 16 of September 2017. Game version 1.7 at the time. I heard most negatives on this game, you know those bad reviews when the game was launched. (Angry Joe review, Metacritic, etc...) So it would be very simple to jump onto the hate train as many others did. I really wanted to hate this game, but i just can't.\n\n\tAt first i was really disappointed by very bad character creator. There are only 8 male and 8 female faces. Most of them are ugly. 4 hair combinations and a few scars, piercings, warpaints and thats it. I thought \"Here we go, another rushed multiplayer game..\" Oh boy i was wrong..\n\t\nI started to play. Walking around, fidling a bit with controls and graphics and I noticed how good the graphics are. That attention of detail which i did not see since Witcher 3. Yes some terrain textures are a bit blurry sometimes, but overall atmosphere is breathtaking. So much detail on this scale is very rare.\n     \nYou will see New York city in a mess. Loads of rubbish, bags, cans, wandering dogs and mice. Abandoned cars, lots of explorable interiors. Bodybags, frozen corpses, broken electronics, spray-painted walls cars, mass graves in Madison Square Garden. Crows flying around, tons of military or science equipment, etc... Everything hand placed so it feels very real, that feeling of despair is really there. You can move or shoot most of the things and they will react. (Yesterday i spent an hour just by walking around in a huge office building, shooting fire extinguisher's. They fly a bit and make funny noises. My 2y old daughter sitting on my lap was laughing all the time.)\n\t\nYou can see wandering civilians among the devastation, to whom you can give some food or water. You will see gangmembers and robbers stealing from civilians or outright killing them. You don't have to intervene most of the time, you can just leave and go explore and loot somewhere else. City feels like living place. Yes after playing many hours You will notice that there are similar things happening in different parts of city, but there is a huge variety.\n\t\nThere is day-night cycle and weather cycle, all of it looks very realistic. You can have nice bright day or bad foggy winter night. Lights, snow and fog can sometimes combine into blinding conditions and you can't see more than few meters.\n\t\nGuns (there are a lot of them, but You can carry only two + one handgun as backup), crafting and customizations are very good. Sounds are almost realistic. Shooting big M60 without silencer and hearing that echo from the buildings around You, that is very nice. \n\nYes everybody can look a bit similar in winter jackets and coats, but everything is very well made. There is minimal clipping of clothing, gear and weapons. You can see some snow and frost to settle on you when outside.\n\t\nMissions and sidequests are very good and varied for multiplayer game. There are some rescuing hostages, fixing antenas, defending supply drops etc.. They can be a bit repetitive, but they are situated in different places so it does not feel that bad. Big story missions are awesome and not same at all. And many times during the mission I just stop and look around to admire the view or watch details around me. Story is not that bad actually. Most NPC's and story characters are very well voiced and animated.\n\t\nI think that most things in the base game can be played solo. I did connect with other players a few times, but they just rush forward mostly and keep dying like ret@rds. I like to play solo, exploring, looking for hidden looting bags, listening to voice messages, intel items etc..\n\t\nI wandered into Dark Zone a few times, mostly to die like an idiot, when met some strong enemies. But a few times I managed to get some loot and went to chopper site. I met other players, they did not shot me, so I did not shoot them. We put our stuff onto chopper cable, waited for extraction, defended site from enemy NPC's and then walked of with our loot without killing each other. Maybe i was just lucky and low level, but that made me feel like there are some normal thinking poeple in the community.\n\t\nOnly thing that bothers me sometimes is: The game cannot be paused even when playing solo. You know, you are in a middle of dense fight and something in Real Life needs attention, and you just can't freaking PAUSE. But that is understandable for MP game.\n\nPerformance-wise:\ni5-3570K, 16GB RAM, GTX 1060 6GB, Win 8.1. High settings, V-Sync ON, 1080p - solid 60FPS.\n(exceptions are:\n- bluring, vigneting, chromatic abera-crap, DOF - those are off as I don't like them\n- extra streaming distance - 50%, it makes very small difference in visuals, but huge FPS drops on some random places\n- sharpening - 70%, personal prefference)\n\n\tSo far the game really captivated me. (Something that did not happened since Witcher 3) For 20 Euros (Steam sale) it is very good quality/price ratio. I have bought full Gold Edition, but did not play any DLC's yet. I will update this wall of text when I do.\n\nPositive:\n- Great graphics, atmosphere.\n- Good gunplay, many skills to try.\n- Nice varied guns, crafting and upgrades.\n- Can be played solo (mostly).\n- Well above average sounds and music.\n- Loads of content, even in the base game.\n- No locked skill classes, you can try and change all skills on one character.\n- Some sense of progress when upgrading a Headquartes.\n\nNegative:\n- That stupid character creator.\n- Best looking clothing is bought with real money.\n- Game needs some crappy Uplay to run.\n- Ubisoft as a publisher\n\nI have to recommend this game. It is very well made and developer Massive Entertainment did very good job.\n\nP.S.

The Division is pretty cool, and a real AAA title.\n\n\n[b]What kind of game, exactly, is The Division?[/b]\n\nIt's a third-person-shooter, with RPG elements and an open world, that rellies strongly on cover-mechanics.\n\nWhenever you get into a fight (which happens constantly) you'll find some cover, hide behind it, and use one of your 3 weapons and/or your special skills to take all hostiles down. One could argue it gets repetitive--and it does, just like any other game or, really, anything else in life, does--but...\n\n\n[b]Here are some of the things that make The Division particularly good:[/b]\n\n[i]RPG Elements[/i] - You have 3 weapon slots, and 6 armor slots. You'll get loot from enemies and chests, and frequently improve your gear throughout the game. TD is not a fantasy game, so there's no fantastic spells nor effects, but it has sentry turrets, seeker mines, healing stations, and more. Weapons and higher-tier armor also have some particular special effects that give you some useful extra bonuses when you meet the condition to activate them (having X or more of one or two of your 3 main attributes.) The gear is good enough to make you feel rewarded and keep looking for stuff.\n\n[i]AI[/i] - The AI in this game works pretty well. Enemies will constantly attempt to flank you, snipers will stay as far away as possible, dudes carrying close-range weapons will rush you. Some have grenades, others deploy sentry turrets, and they all move constantly. This makes the fights a lot more interesting.\n\n[i]Map Design[/i] - I'd say TD has the best map design I've ever seen in a game. The amount of objects spread over the world is incredible, locations are very well furnitured, there are several interesting and beautiful places, a lot of different cars spread over the streets (and they lower when someone shoots their tires, and their doors and hoods open/close as well, which is neat.) It's scary to think about the amount of work Ubi put into making all the models and textures for this game, it was obviously a [i]lot[/i], and it makes the game much more realistic and pleasant.\n\nAll the types of cover you can use, and the way they're placed everywhere in the game also make it so that every encounter is somewhat different from the others. They managed to make this work very well.\n\n[i]The Writting[/i] - It's a Tom Clancy game, you know that. So you know the writting is flawless, and realistic. The only unbelievable thing in The Division is that although New York was affected by a deadly virus, it wasn't a muslim who released it.\n\nIt's worth noting that the voice-acting is great as well, just like the game's graphics and sounds (I just don't have these as my top priorities, so I'm not making an exclusive topic for them.)\n\n[i]Multiplayer[/i] - I'm not sure any other game has ever treated multi-playing as TD does. You can form a party of up to 4 people, and go together or spread out all over [a good part of] New York. You also see other players inside Safehouses, and you can invite any of them to your party. You can matchmake, and find random players to play with. You can choose to matchmake only when doing main missions. And, finally, there's...\n\n[i]The Dark Zone[/i] - This is a place you can go any time, a place where the best loot can be acquired. All enemies there are \"Superior\" (I'm not sure how the game calls these ones) or Elite, and other players will also be there, whether they're in your party or not, whether they're friends or foes. In the DZ, you can kill other players to still their loot, you can wait until they hang said loot on an helicopter's rope for extraction and steal it, or you can be the victim of such felonies yourself. More often, you'll run into friendly people (at least so far I haven't run into any hostile players there myself) and just start exploring the DZ together, helping each other. It's pretty cool. You're out there, in the most hostile of environments, getting r*ped by NPCs, then you see another player, and you don't know if you can trust each other, so... you wave to them. They wave back. And just like that you are friends, and your time in the DZ will be much easier from now on.\n\n[i]Difficulty[/i] - The Division is not easy. You'll die a lot, all throughout the game. Sometimes, specially during main missions on higher difficulties, you'll have to plan how you position yourself and deal with each fight, or you may be stuck there for a long time. And this is awesome. Games are supposed to be a challenge and require some skill, so you can get a sense of achievement when you succeed in doing something. Easy games suck.\n\n[i]Bug-Free[/i] - After 40 hours playing, I got none whatsoever. So... yeah, that's a good thing.\n\n\n[b]The downside (not much of a big deal):[/b]\n\n[i]Single-Playing[/i] - The main problem in TD is that playing solo is a lot harder than playing in a party. One friend is enough--so get out there and find yourself one. I had to do that.\n\nWhen playing solo, all the heat will be on you. Basically, you'll get hit every single time you try to get out of cover to shoot. And some enemies in this game do a LOT of damage (snipers sometimes do like 4/5s of your HP in damage with a single shot.) Partying with someone will allow you to share all that heat, so you actually get some windows to aim at and shoot your enemies. You can play TD solo, it's perfectly possible, but it's a lot harder.\n\n[i]Loading Times[/i] - Long ones. With 8gb RAM, it takes my computer about 3 minutes from starting the game until actually getting to control my character. 12gb of RAM probably smoothens this out a lot, but the game [i]is[/i] heavy.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion...[/b] even though I do hate Ubisoft myself to a certain extent--for ruining the Prince of Persia, Heroes of Might and Magic and Anno franchises--I gotta say there's nothing wrong with The Division to justify the Mixed feelings Steam reviewers directed towards it. If there once was, it's gone. And if you enjoyed Freedom Fighters, Gears of War or any other game of the sort, you'll like this.

There's plenty of neat stuff to find exploring the large open areas of a pretty convincing (Albeit mostly desolate) virtual New York City. As far as single-player is concerned, i found it to be rather fun. It gets repetitive yes, but it's fun if you take the time to enjoy the game at your own pace. The atmosphere is great, and the graphics (while not as good as the trailers) are quite pretty. The gunplay is fun, and choosing how to approach missions is enjoyable. Without going into great detail (which other reviews will cover) the game does have a rather large difficulty spike as the missions go on. And the game is much more fun with some friends in co-op. The cover-shooting mechanic is a large part of the gameplay since you'll be ravaged horribly by high-tier bullet-sponge enemies if you don't hide behind something. It's a pretty ambitious game, and while it doesn't nail everything it sets out to, the sheer amount of exploration and fun with friends makes it a game i can recommend to people looking for a casual single-player/cooperative experience.\n\nA word of advice if you want to enjoy the game: [b]Do not go into the Dark Zone.[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505679680, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505758055, "recommendationid": "35032377", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506705470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 259, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22907, "steamid": "76561198102709275", "num_games_owned": 17}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game is rising back from the dead and getting a lot much better from 1.5, can't wait for 1.8 update!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505429428, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505429428, "recommendationid": "34959292", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498947", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458007639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1495, "steamid": "76561197961011214", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun for the first few days because it seemed to promising, then you realize it is a shitty version of Borderlands with movement mechanics like a horrible version of Gears of War.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505490453, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505490453, "recommendationid": "34975114", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450667", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507032137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 546, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1272, "steamid": "76561198051551646", "num_games_owned": 64}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Tried it out during free weekend and brought the Gold edition whilst it was on sale.\n\nIf you are a fan of shooters, loot and teamwork, then this is a game for you. Great environment and game play. You can either solo play or match people running around the city/missions together. Only bad side is that the moment and control isn't the smoothest compare to other cover combat system.\n\n7/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505728484, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505728484, "recommendationid": "35042239", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495554", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486334834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6969, "steamid": "76561198218233681", "num_games_owned": 15}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun game, both PvE and PvP!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506088163, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506088163, "recommendationid": "35128233", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500278", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506869081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 595, "steamid": "76561198264973289", "num_games_owned": 82}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The Division has gotten many mixed feelings from people regarding an open world with nothing to do or just same mission after mission or servers just being shit shutting down the game completey. I disagree. I believe The Division can be a fun game you can enjoy. \n\nPros:\nGraphics is amazing\nOpen World \nMultiplayer/Coop\nGreat Rpg elements\nCustomzation \nEnjoyable Combat system\nStill alot of people play\nPerformance on pc is great. I am playing on a amd a8 7600 which is a apu with 8gb of ram using a stock fan. I play on low settings at 900p with 27-38fps which is great for my budget system.\n\nCons:\nThis game is not as fun without friends\nSole players will have a hard time with missions\nGame can get very Repetive\nDlcs is not cheap like the surivial dlc which is $15!!!\n\nOverall I say this. This game can be boring and hard but if you have a group of friends it can be very enjoyable and fun even if you do sole it will definity be something you would comeback to play. I had no server issues when playing online. I will say that for the price the game is being sold now I would highly recommend picking it up for it's $20 price tag. I wouldn't recommend buying it for $50.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505616514, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505616514, "recommendationid": "35012477", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499109", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9727, "total_reviews": 15268, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5541}}
