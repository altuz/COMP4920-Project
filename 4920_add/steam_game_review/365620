Graphics look like mid nineties abandonware. Loading controller defaults did not allow me to actually drive the jeep around. Yeah... because thats a combat aviation game but every time I go in a single player or multiplayer game I am dumped in jeep that I get to drive pointlessly around textureless, empty, barebones military bases. My country was called Red Country. All online modes were solo only except one mode with one server for 10 players. It involved going into instances around the map and supposedly capturing stuff to flip it to your team. The map was perfectly evenly divided between both the teams so I can safely assume nobody captured anything in forever. I tried loading the game again to see if I could get in a plane in single player and the intro music looped 9 times until I tried to tab out and it decided to work. It wanted my email to spam me offers. Buying this game gives you one month with all vehicles unlocked after which you have to pay a fee. Since I could not get out of the JEEP I am not interested.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496103906, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505095192, "recommendationid": "32052712", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508717", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 12}}
