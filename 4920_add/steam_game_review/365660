Also there many new tricks that will make the gameplay easier for you. With manuals, you can keep the combo going for the whole level and you can also build much bigger combos! Forget all struggles you had in OlliOlli, buy OlliOlli 2 and enjoy!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500665008, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500665008, "recommendationid": "33703795", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510917", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 148, "total_reviews": 173, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 25}}
