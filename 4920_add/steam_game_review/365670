I agree. For someone who has never touched a 3D/CG program I cannot reccommend enough that you don't chose blender. It is difficult to catch on just because of the shear amount of things packed into it. It has made improvements, big improvements in my opinion since I first used it, it can still be a challenge to navigate and understand. If you have dabbled in 3D/CG software before, this will still have a bit of a big learning curve and some things to get used to, *cough* right-click *cough**cough*. Like I mentioned before it can be a bit confusing just because theres a lot you can do with it.\n     All that being said if you choose to stick around, if you choose to take the time to learn this, either on your own(via youtube, etc.) or paying for lessons (CG Cookie, etc.), if you choose to deal with the initial frustration that may accompany learning this program (some people might be frustrated longer than others it all depends), then you will have access to one of the most powerful CG Creation Suites in terms of what it can do, and how much it costs(free by the way). If you want to take it on I'd recommend sticking to only one feature, like 3D modeling. Focus on learning that before you start trying to learn animation or compositing (Thats not the trick that's just how I went about it.) When you get familiar enough with it everything else sort of falls together. Now lets get down to buisness...\n\nPros:\n-Can do a lot\n -3D Modeling\n -Animating\n -Compositing\n -Video Editing\n -2D Animation (Grease Pencil)\n -Sculpting\n -3D Painting\n -Game Creation (BGE)\n  -Python Scripting\n -Capable of photorealism\n -Add-ons (Free and paid)\n  -can optimize some aspects of blender bringing it close to some professional program equivalent\n -Pretty big community willing to help out\n  -youtube tutorials\n  -Paid course tutorials (CG Cookie, Blender Guru, etc.)\n  -Community Forums\n  -just google it =P\n\nCons:\n - A lot to learn in one suite\n  - Not for the faint of heart\n  - Nor for the short of patience\n  - Don't expect to learn this overnight\n - Right-clicking, not huge but can take a bit to get used to\n - because there's so much you can do in blender, when asking the community anywhere a question you need to be \n    specific (ie., \"I wanna know how to make my flower look like this one.\" Like in the compositor, materials, textures, etc. \n                  not a very good example but meh.)\n- Blender is generalized not specialized/optimised \n -In other words comparing its Sculpting to something like Zbrush you'll see some stark contrasts\n -Same holds true with some of its other features\n  -Personally, though, I think its animation (rigging, weight painting, animating) is better than Maya but that's me.\n- Blender Game Engine (BGE) is real nice and you can make some impressive things, however it does fall short when you compare it to other game engines like Unity or Unreal\n  \nPersonal experience with this is I was first exposed to blender when I was 12 in 2006 I dabbled in it and was really confused what was happening eventually after a few days I just gave up. I didn't feel I was making any progress let alone know what I was doing. I didn't touch it again until nearing the end of my sophomore year in college since then I got more involved with it. When I found out it came on steam I was already in 2nd semester Junior year so what you see are hours after I found it here I've had a longer time with this than what you see. Prior to this I was taking classes that taught 3DS Max, Maya, Zbrush, and Mudbox. Blender was self-taught (not counting CG Cookie).\n\nAll That being said I'm sure I might have missed some things but I hoped I explained enough to answer most questions on this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488078758, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488078847, "recommendationid": "30184428", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604688", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505229947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 95453, "steamid": "76561198089227029", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 51, "votes_up": 55, "comment_count": "7", "review": "I gave up blender, then I said to myself, my dream was to create good-looking 3D Anime girls.\n\nTherefore here I am now, creating 3D Anime girls. \n\n[i]Only if you have a passion that caters to your determination, you can do great..great..great things[/i].", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487308842, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487308886, "recommendationid": "29977376", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568678", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501948059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3146, "steamid": "76561198145679422", "num_games_owned": 37}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 27, "comment_count": 0, "review": "now i can create 3d assets, which will be added to my game,and its absolutely free,  ty blender!!!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485487366, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485487366, "recommendationid": "29513962", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531579", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507149406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4151, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 12457, "steamid": "76561198014909945", "num_games_owned": 349}, "votes_funny": 63, "votes_up": 30, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Will It Blend?\n\n\nYes.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488037388, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488037388, "recommendationid": "30170416", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537906", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486278950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1143, "steamid": "76561198169957179", "num_games_owned": 35}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Followed some turtorials and made some really cool stuff.
