So here we have a modern clone with some twists on the idea.  Main differences are that each character has two special abilities.  One that is reusable on a timer, and one that has limited uses but can be replenished by picking up collectables.  I'm a purist when it comes to pvp, so the idea didn't sound appealling but testing it out in 1 vs 1 local, it was good fun.  It added an extra element to think about.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Vds1XfP3Jh8\n\nThis is probably needed, as the classic game, which would be my personal preference doesn't have so many bonus's to collect as Bomberman did.  You simply get the basics.  Whereas in Bomberman each player would have the opportunity to get every power up, they are just built into the characters in BRAWL.  So it's different, is it better?  I don't think so.  It's still fun though.\n\nI only played in 1 vs 1, as with all arena games, more players would undoubtably increased the fun a lot more!  I've read a review on here saying the multiplayer online doesn't work.  I haven't been able to try it out yet, the playerbase seems very small and my efforts to find other players has been fruitless so far.\n\nI encountered no bugs or glitches, the game seems solid.  Graphics and sound are good.  It's a nice, fun alternative to the classic Bomberman.  Hopefully the community will grow a bit with time, the games only been released for two weeks.  In the mean time you will need local buddies to play against, unless you're happy to kill bots and do the single player campaign.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440761533, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440761682, "recommendationid": "17752613", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520644", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450042300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 294, "playtime_forever": 112, "steamid": "76561197985072747", "num_games_owned": 1161}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Genre - Gothic Bomberman Clone\n\nThe characters, cut scenes and voice acting are very atmospheric. It is set in a dark world with supernatural toys and monsters. The game plays like Bomberman with abilities and a single player adventure mode. I wasreally enjoying this game and hope to brave it again one day...\n\nHowever, my major gripe is around the difficulty. This is because when you get caught in a duel, which you will  in single player mode, the odds are too heavily stacked against you. At the moment you have to kill them five times in a row whilst also avoiding the hostile mobs. As many Bomberman players know, one or two mistakes and it is game over. This has stopped me progressing as much as I would have liked without swearing at the screen and loading up a different game, and this was on low difficulty! They should have done a one on one battle with the AI being properly scaled by difficulty.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer yet, but in theory it should be worth getting for this and will probably be more balanced than Single Player mode.\n\nI would recommend this game for highly skilled Bomberman players, and not casual players who want a bit of easy going fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440535249, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440535249, "recommendationid": "17714771", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526141", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446457860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561197995245130", "num_games_owned": 322}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Lame, insanely hard, even in EASY mode, redundant and waaaaaay behind a bomberman in terms of fun and excitement.\nBrawl's universe is original, though extremely redundant again : everything's grey and dark, cold and static.\nAnd to be honest, it doesnt worth its price at all.

Although it's not as bright and as colorful as Bomberman is, this game is has an attitude of it's own. Get into a good match online or locally and your set for some fun. This game is actually quite difficult keep in mind (even on the lowest setting)!\n\nThe [b]gameplay[/b] resembles that of bomberman except with a few unique features. Each character comes with their own abilities (two to be exact). The Girl is able to teleport and throw a knife. The Toymaker is able to deploy a totem and detonate them. The Sad Clown is able to \"sneeze\" and confuse. The Puppet Mistress can use her gaze to slow opponents and petrification. The Dummy is able to freeze bombs and detonate them. The Wrestler can charge and smash opponents. The Thief can go invisible and use his special ability, shadow step. The Mine can silence and cage opponents. Of course just like Bomberman, there are pickups available in game to make your bombs better. Some of these pickups include being able to hold and deploy additional bombs, increasing the range of the bombs, giving you ammo to use a special and increasing your health. \n\nAdditionally, players can detonate bombs whenever they please. I'm not sure exactly how the bomb detonation system works as sometimes when I press \"detonate\", they do not detonate instantly (I'm guessing maybe I simply chose the right player). They have also included the option to take away the blood and gore. I'm sure most gamers will play with it on but it's extremely appreciated to have such an option available. Single player is interesting as it follows each character and their diverse story/history. The narrator can be a bit annoying but does his best to immerse the character (especially when you die over and over). He's sort of corny but the twisted storyline makes up for it all. It is true that this game is sort of hard and some parts are extremely difficult to get through. On easy, some of the levels are possible! Seriously, this game has a steep difficulty to it at times. Opponents come in all shapes and sizes. Some have shields while some are able to eat your bombs! Single player missions will try to diversify by having you protect something or play through levels that are not of equal dimensions. \n\nThe [b]visuals[/b] are exceptional. They tried to visualize everything for the player so identifying which bombs will blow up next is perceivable. I definitely like the diversity within the characters. The mood and tone [b](sound)[/b] they chose to introduce this game is appealing even though I'm not a big fan of dark or scary themes (unless it's the Darkness)! The interface is quite friendly and is easy to use. They seemed to really try and nail the details with the music and the quick button switch from keyboard to gamepad. \n\nThere are different game modes available in local. Although the classic version is usually the best, players will also like to try sumo. It's isn't actual sumo where you run into one another. Rather, you are attempting to knock other players out by placing bombs that shoot punching gloves. Color domination is another cool game mode in which you have to try to cover the map with your color. Team play is also possible here by selecting the \"Team Arena\" game mode. I have to commend the devs here for trying out different game modes. Why not try new things with a completed game? \n\nOverall, the game is better than most Bomberman clones out there. It's still not Bomberman but it's still fun (especially with friends)! Playing by yourself can get a bit redundant. I would say really do your home work and if this does appeal to you, probably wait for a sale.\n\n\n\nRATING : 7.0/10\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Gameplay[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall [/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]ScreenShots : [/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=650896070] Flaunting some of the items[/url]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=656236416] Local game modes[/url]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=656236786] Sumo part 1[/url]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=656263666] Sumo part 2[/url]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=656236946] Controller layout.
