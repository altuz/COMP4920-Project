Cannot reccomend at present as unplayable otherwise pretty fun for Rugby fans (although not the polished article).  3/10.\n\n**UPDATE** - Shall re-trial the game to see if I can get rid of the crashing issue and the report back.

The players all froze on the field and I had to quit the match.\n- Passing is about 95% reliable. Once in a while the pass goes off in a random direction that I did not want.\n- The switch pass is a little slow to respond.\n\n- Free play mode is only a single player-no way to make unopposed runs to practice, which leads me to...\n- There is no good explaination in tutorials or documentation of what the \"change attack\" and \"change defense\" buttons do, I didn't even realize that was an option until several hours of play.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1482820484, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1482928603, "recommendationid": "28701343", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1470399107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1122, "steamid": "76561198007661875", "num_games_owned": 25}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Thoroughly enjoying the game.
