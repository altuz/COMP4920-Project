You pickup various weapons (a shotgun, rocket launcher, plasma rifle, etc...) and pray health* drops as you eliminate waves of enemies on a variety of levels (*that being said, when you clear a wave of enemies, you restore some health.). \n\nThe enemies are varied with airborne, huge tank ones, infantry, etc... It's a cool-looking game if you are immediately into the 'retro game' / 'Tron' aesthetic, and it looks better in motion while playing for yourself. Some more variety in the gameplay with the enemies attack patterns/animations or level objectives beyond \"shoot everything else more than it shoots you\" during these waves would make the game way more refreshing, but I've enjoyed each time I've booted it up and tried to get past its difficult swarms of enemies. \n\nPerhaps most importantly the game's weapons and explosions all have weight to them and they're enjoyable to use. I wish you had more traversal options, like a dash or a double-jump of some kind, but the main sprinting and strafing feels reliable and smooth for the most part. It would be nice to see some kind of powerup system to modify the main rate of fire, range, or damage of the weapons but the game plays more like an old school shooter relying on the player strafing/jumping enemy attacks while constantly blasting the opposition. \n\nThere are some portions of the game that can really kill the smooth pace of the combat. For some reason -level design spoiler-[spoiler](the water looks cool and all, but then once you go underneath the water and look around there (thus far 3 levels in..) has been NOTHING underneath beyond a few fish, which is a cool, surreal moment when everything above is so much different, but it feels very underdeveloped,[/spoiler] add to that fact that whenever the player falls into these areas, they have to clumsily navigate to one of very few ladders placed around to get out again. I have seemed to get stuck at the top of these ladders very often, only to have to go back down a bit, come back up, orient the game to lift my player over these barricades/ladders but it really kills the dashing pace of the main aboveground gameplay. It didn't kill the game altogether for me or anything, but I just avoid the water from afar now. \n\nIf anything, I just wish the scope of the game were larger and included something along the lines of going into buildings, fighting underwater, or in the air beyond mostly all combat taking place along a far horizon line at the infantry level. There is very little to no story, nor do I think there should be since the game is pretty straightforward altogether.
