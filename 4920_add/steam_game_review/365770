It does a decent job at mixing stealth and timing puzzles but feels like it has an identity crisis at moments. Overall it feels very polished and the controls, ui, menus, art, sound, and transitions are all top notch. I don't pay much attention to the story so if its good or not I can't really say.\n\nEach level is pretty linear and are partitioned in a \"mini-puzzle\" fassion. Each level containing multiple \"mini-puzzles\" to avoid a bot in some way to collect gems. Collect all the gems to open a waypoint to complete the level. After each of these mini puzzles there is almost always a checkpoint. Checkpoints are so common it ends up in \"I can just half ass this attempt with no consequence with the hopes it will somehow work\". Maybe if they were stretched out a bit more but as is  and the game feels easy even though I know I fail A LOT. Yes it helps doing the same thing over and over but actions lose their consequence and that feeling of \"I'm repeating the same shit\" is still there only you're doing a shorter task over and over. It's a double edged sword and I don't think the dev really got around it too well. Some levels you run backwards after aquiring a different gadget, disabling alarms, or something else but most of the mini puzzles you complete have no bearing on future events once completed only compounding the feel of linear levels.\n\nThe mechanics are varied and introduced slowly; new enemy types, different gadgets, enemy behavior, and environment props. The build up of these new mechanics feels really strechted out and makes the first couple of hours feel a bit slow but I had moments in every other level that kept me playing. Once all of the new enemy types and gadgets are introduced it really varies the gameplay. At the same they are more segregated than I'd like.\n\nThere are a few things wrong with the bots.There's a delay before the bots one shot you and if you break line of sight the delay is reset. This way you have a chance to run away. A short range, wider fov, peripheral viewcone would be nice even on pawns as you can easily slip around a corner or stay just out of his fov when you're close to a bot to go unoticed. Also the attempt to \"search\" is so basic its almost insulting. Go to the last known position of the player/sound, wait 2 seconds and return patroling. Later in the campaign the bots might activate an alarm if they see the player but the bots all go to the exact same location. Also the patrol routes are exact with no variation. All of these feel like decisions to adhere to the puzzle play style but again makes the game feel easy. This is the identity crisis I was talking about.\n\nI feel really conflicted about this game but tried my best to articulate why. It's worth a buy on sale or if you like puzzle and stealth games. If you just like stealth games it might be best to wait for a sale even if the idea of adding puzzle elements sounds interesting because like I said it's a little too much puzzle not enough stealth for me atleast.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505897518, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505897518, "recommendationid": "35080184", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508861", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505897948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 627, "steamid": "76561198041516169", "num_games_owned": 220}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game for the sale price of 5.49! Maybe 14.99 would be the sweet spot. However, if the next 2 characters have another 6-8 hours of content like the first one did, then that's a lot of sneaking around for $20! Yes, the levels are 'repetative', of course they are. You are shown a gimmick, then the next pile of maps use & mix it with what you've learned. Eventually you can pick how you want to face the situation and often not even use the gadgets at all.\nBesides, every videogame has repetative levels, so you argument is invalid.\n\n> Enemy view cones are bigger than they are drawn. It looks like they only reach to the middle of a block but actually cover at least the whole block, if not a bit more. So when you think there is enough room, you'll get caught. Yet they can't see you standing literally right next to them.\n\n> Ai is really dim.. like.. Far Cry 4 dim. You can run right behind them, and they only spend 5 seconds inspecting your last known position. Not to say they're broken mind you, but it'd be nice if they put in a little more effort.\n\n> Some half-walls you can roll over while all the others you cannot. I understand the puzzle reasoning so they're more like barricades I suppose.\n\n> You can only run if you have the gadget for it. Seriously, even if you are discovered you have to sneak away while the enemies get to run. Granted, you sneak at at walking pace. When you are using the gadget, your running is completely silent.\n\n> Player maps are listed by Upload date (assuming), and arranged in a bare-bones map list. They have scores for the top players, but it hasn't been saving mine after the first one :/.\n\n> Music reminds me of a PS3 game called Haven, and Cyan's Riven.\n\nBonus > The character Tick, who appears once in the first run, sounds like certain YT 'critics'; which is amusing as he's voiced by one.
