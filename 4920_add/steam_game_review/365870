There's often a real Jekyll/Hyde quality to homemade content, but the levels in Below Kryll are consistent. They vary from extremely technical and difficult platforming challenges to exhibitions of surprisingly sophisticated art and music. User tags make it easy for each player to find levels which suit their own play styles.\n\nThe level designer itself is on the simple side, though clever users have found innovative applications for just about every tool. The first time or two designing a level can be frustrating - not all features are immediately available, something which might not occur to aspiring designers until they fire up the designer. Fortunately, Below Kryll has a very supportive community that can offer assistance to anyone tripped up by a design snag.\n\nIn sum, Below Kryll is a fun little indie gem that offers a massive, ever-growing amount of content for a low price. Strong recommend for anyone into platformers.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499723110, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499723110, "recommendationid": "33441596", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502297", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 29, "total_reviews": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
