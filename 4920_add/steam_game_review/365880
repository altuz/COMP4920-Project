I did have to skim through a walkthrough video to get a little more understanding of the game play. ottherwise it would have taken me forever to figure out how to combine objects. if you want a real challenge, don't look at any walkthrough videos.

This first chapter provides around one to two hours of gameplay depending on how dense you are. It plays entierly in one small room and you never learn much about the characters or the story, because it seems to be an intro of a much bigger game that will probably never be released. I'm writing this in 2017 and there have been people asking for chapter two since 2015 now. I don't think the developer will release any more of this. I can't recommend it because of that. If you are looking for a good adventure, try one of the first two Secret Files games. If you'd like a first person puzzle game, look up The Room 1 and 2.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501418328, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501418417, "recommendationid": "33903901", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 40, "total_reviews": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 15}}
