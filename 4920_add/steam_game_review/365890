This objective and unbiased review will try to give you the best image of the situation of the game to this date. \n\n1.PRICE.\nThis game is not worth the full price for its content. Buy only when on a 75% or more discount.\n\n2.WHAT IS HEROES OF NORMANDIE?\nThis video game is based on the original Heroes of Normandie board game. Its digital adaptation has all that a board game fan would expect. A map with varying terrain that affects unit performance, unit tiles from simple infantry and specialized infantry to light, medium and heavy armor, with different stats, traits and abilities for each one of them. Cards that grand your units bonuses or hinder your opponent and the obvious dye rolls that resolve all conflicts between the player's units. All in all the turn based board game in your PC.\n\n3.BUT IS IT REALLY AN ADAPTATION?\nHoN board game fans will be left wanting, since the game is not a full adaptation of the original and many cards, abilities, units and terrain features are yet to make it into the game, sadly. The game feels like a lite game of the original board game so far, but never the less will somewhat satisfy those who haven't played the original game or want things neat and simple for a casual experience, that will soon get boring, due to repetitivness and less than rich content. None of the expansions of the board game have been adapted yet, with the exception of some units (see DLC). Fortunately a digital rulebook of the game is included in the files and in-game so that new players can get familiar with its notion.\n\n4.GRAPHICS AND SOUND.\nThe game is pretty light and uses the Unity engine, like many google store apps, for a cartoon like feeling. Simple and beautifull. Since the units and the maps are depicted in adequate detail and with bright colors. Music is consisted of one or two generic tracks and sounds of explosions and gunfire, while units inderact on the map, as well as ambient sounds for movement or birds chirping, fit in well and do their job of making the adaptation feel alive.\n\n5.CAMPAIGN AND MULTIPLAYER.\nThe campaign is consisted by about 40 missions split between 3 factions, US, German and UK. The missions are accompanied by a scenario that tags along and each one has a duration of 5-8 minutes and of a hanfull of rounds, to complete their non too complex objective(s).Also the number of units in battle is quite small and the extend of the map about 25-15 squares. Fortunatelly the game has a free roam mode where you can create and play your own missions or simply play skirmishes on the campaign maps, till you knock yourself out. Multiplayer, even though available, has a very little crowd to be actually an exciting experience. Your best bet is to play hotseat with a friend or schedule a match and invite him/her to a challenge.\n\n6.BUGS AND FIXES.\nThe game has many bugs that have not been adressed since its release. Most bugs are related to multiplayer, like conectivity and hotseat function. But campaign has its fair share with uncompletable objectives and A.I. cheating. In general the game is not polished with typos everywhere, wrong explanation of rules, stats and abilities that cause more confussion, a generic pattern of dye rolling, malfunctioning cards, sloppy menu and in-game navigation and less than ideal A.I. intelligence. All in all the game seems to have been released in it's beta version and passed over for a full price as the final.\n\n7.OVERALL.\nA very casual game that does not live up to the original, with poor content, many annoying bugs and glitches, unpolished and as it seems abandoned by its developer. Considering it has been two years since its release and the handfull of minor and none too important patches and additions that the game has received, except the cards that where not included in the first place (added a year later!) and the change of (a dead) multiplayer servers, with sluggish paces, things are not optimistic about its future. On top of that the way content and patches have come up in the course of time, seems like the developers are adding missing and new minor features gradually in purpose, so as to test the water  for an increase or not in sales and try to keep the appearances as to what this game was actually advertised to be! Leaving the impression that the game was never meant to be complete at launch and serious doubts about if it will ever be wrapped up. Still good enough to dilly dally a few hours, only if it was not for its price. \n\nI rate this game with a 5/10, but it wouldn't hurt adding it to your library, if you are an indie or super casual gamer or just a die hard fan.\n\nNOTE; I will attempt to refund the game via Steam so I don't know if this review will be viewable in the future. \nUPDATE; Unfortunately because I have more than 2 hours on record I can not refund this game. I recommend watching you tube videos first if you want to have a taste of the gameplay.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498148434, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498896308, "recommendationid": "32646150", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543051", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495320564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 199, "playtime_forever": 165, "steamid": "76561198007513026", "num_games_owned": 510}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This should be the type of game I like, I'm a real fan of TBS games.
