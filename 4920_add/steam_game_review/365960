One of the best tyres simulation I've ever experienced. But the rest of the game is just full trash.\nUnfortunately, tire is not the only component of the car and a racing sim.\n\nThe first disappointment was when I first launched the game. The game had to download 10GBs, and after that it managed to start downloading something else. Why? 10GB wasn't enough for such little content it has?\n\nYes, the game lacks content. You have some race cars and some tracks. Mods from workshop work mostly fine, but I couldn't find any road cars or anything other than racing circuits. No point-to-point tracks which is really sad.\n\nOn the other hand, there are 3rd party mods which are complete garbage. Some won't even load, some are not compatible or just converts from rFactor and look like they are from rFactor. Some mods don't simulate the car properly making it impossible to drive. But this is not the game's fault.\n\nThe interface is garbage. Not intuitive and unuseable. First hour of my \"gameplay\" was trying to figure out how to set up the game and everything like this.\n\nFor some reason it is insanely hard to drive in this game. I played a lot of Assetto, DiRT Rally and LFS, but none of those exhausted me like rFactor 2. Hell, even rFactor 1 didn't exhaust me that much that I felt like I was running for 40kms straight.\n\nOverall, I expected a really good driving sim with customization and mods.\nWhat I got was pain in the ass with very little content variability.\n\nThe game just can't afford me anything other than... a few cars and a few tracks.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505312708, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505312708, "recommendationid": "34920524", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490883", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 166, "total_reviews": 221, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 55}}
