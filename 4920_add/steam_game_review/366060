Its pretty easy to get used to the controls. I liked the nightmarish, yet evily funny creatures and bosses. Gameplay is fun, killing monsters by leading them into traps and using items, which is a uniquely fresh idea. It does have a few bugs, like sometimes the mouse control would spaz out, and during some boss fights the screen would shake more then it should have. I certainly hope more is added, as it is a bit short. Overall great game, definately worth the money.

You must clear each room by destroying all enemies, however you get no weapons. Instead you rely on traps around the map to vanquish your nightmarish foes. You do have your trusty teddy bear though to use to activate switch based traps and to slow enemies to get them in the right position at the right time. The game looks similar in style to Nuclear Throne, but has little else in common other than its 2-D pixel-art aesthetic. \n\nThere is already a short tutorial in place to show you the basics of the game, but even though I played through it I felt I personally didn't need it. The game is quite simple but fun and includes a static upgrade system so eventually even if you keep dying you will improve your character. There are also many random items which will help you along the way, such as a toy gun (which actually isn't a toy at all) and other defensive and offensive items. I think the price is somewhat low for this title so I can easily recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432251846, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1432252163, "recommendationid": "15934022", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510764", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467261429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 762, "steamid": "76561198058071700", "num_games_owned": 691}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "review": "WOW, this game just sorta caught my eye and i  decided to buy it although there was only one other review of the game at the time. I do no regret my purchase at all. Reminds me of binding of issac in a good refreshing way. Love that you have to really think of how to kill the enemies due to a lack of damaging projectile always available. The layout of the game is very promising and the soundtrack is VERY memorable. the art is notably eye catching too. I seriously reccomend buying this instead of some starbucks coffee. It is a hard game that is keeping me playing, and i cant wait to see what this game brings to the table later on in its development stages!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432263580, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1432263580, "recommendationid": "15935558", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507096", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491679257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 100, "steamid": "76561198103023463", "num_games_owned": 117}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Played the demo.
