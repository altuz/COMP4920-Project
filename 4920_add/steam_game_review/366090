Boy was I wrong! Colony Survival is totaly DIFFERENT. It is all about building a whole base block by block and defending it with Guards. In Minecraft you have no real motivation to build and keep building. In Colony Survival you have to manage the ecconomy you build and balance growth and defence. In Minecraft you are baisicly alone where as in Colony Survival you become the KING or Queen of your own kingdom. You get to RESEARCH things and IMPROVE. The developers are listening intently to our feedback and so far all improvements have been for the better. They are soon to bring us the 0.4.0 Update which will add all kinds of ores Technologies and options for your army of Guards. Crossbows sound pretty fun.

Though as of this review there is not much to do in the game, it is definitly addicting with what you have. You can build a great castle and watch it be destroyed with one mistake which keeps you on guard. The food system is well thought out but more varity would defintly go a long way. The AI is simple yet proficient at what it is supposed to do. The multipayer is good.

Im playing with my friend on his server and were just having the greatest time. It really brings back that feeling of adventure from my days playing minecraft for the first time, but still it manages to feel like a completely original game. I've put my pros and suggestions down below.\n\nPROS\nGorgeous graphics. the attention to detail in the lighting right down to most of the blocks is phenomonal\nGreat terrain generation. The red taiga mountains with snowy peaks and the forested hills really feel grand and majestic\nGood sense of progression, this could be improved in terms of skill tree but I love watching this small village grow to a city\nDevs are fantastic! Super responsive and helpful\n\nSuggestions\nI love most of the blocks, but the logs just look way to much like dirt for my taste. \nSome of the items are almost the same color gray as the uncraftable things in your menu, so sometimes it looks like you cant craft things you can.\nAlso, I totally understand that this is early access, and I know that dev's have lots of plans but just, more more MORE!\nAlthough my friend and I still have tons of stuff we want to do.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505677944, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505677944, "recommendationid": "35031827", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501656", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499054944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 114, "steamid": "76561198167680011", "num_games_owned": 82}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is amazing if you like nostalgia but I do feel it isnt worth 20$ its worth like 15-10 because it doesnt have the most content in the world but it still holds a dear place in my heart.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505692035, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505692035, "recommendationid": "35035410", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501359", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505944515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 124, "steamid": "76561198196988815", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "AMAZING!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505854787, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505854787, "recommendationid": "35072292", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497855", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505827992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2703, "steamid": "76561198336855119", "num_games_owned": 5}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a really fun game.
