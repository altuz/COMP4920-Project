In Wurm Unlimited, you can build, fish, cook, fight, do whatever you wanted to do in Minecraft, except more fleshed out.  You can do more.  It takes more time.  This is a game that feels realistic in its approach to the medieval sandbox, and makes that its staple drawer.  It will not attract casuals by any chance, however this game tends to breed gamers who are generally more down to earth and patient than most.\n\nYou may make some trusted friends.  You may enjoy relaxing here after a long, hard day of work.  Who cares you only cut down a few treees and sawed em up today?  You can get it done tomorrow.  And its that kind of relaxing game ethic that really makes Wurm Unlimited shine in a way that I never really got to see other sandboxes do.\n\nWurm Unlimited.

If you enjoy games where building and community come before combat, but combat is still an option, you will probably enjoy Wurm. If you prefer games with instant gratification, quick combat, and the ability to jump and sprint, I do not suggest this game for you.\n\nEven with nearly sixty hours in Wurm I am still very much a noob. There is a lot for me to learn, and I still don't have enough skill to build a stone floor or destroy a fence. I cannot kill a wolf without help from NPCs. I still don't entirely understand the ground flattening system. I can, however, load up the Wurmpedia on my phone, play some YouTube videos in the background, and spend an entire day building a storage tower next to my house that I spent a week on.\n\nMy advice for getting started is finding a good server. A server where you can ask other players questions and get help is a godsend, sometimes literally with certain deities prohibiting certain actions. I needed something that only drops off human guards, but the deity I follow prohibits butchering humans. I got help from another player whose deity demands butchering humans. In return, I buried her bodies since my god likes that and hers doesn't. It's a community game at its heart, and playing alone is very, very lonely.\n\nTLDR; Sandbox, takes a while, find friends", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504584996, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504584996, "recommendationid": "34749480", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540210", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506589608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 166, "steamid": "76561198035094289", "num_games_owned": 1585}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Okay, I've only spent a short period of time in this, but I want to go ahead and say that starting my own private offline \"server\" was a piece of cake.
