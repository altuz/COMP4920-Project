I don't believe I played this game back then, but I am very glad the game  is on steam and I have the privilege to play it.  I highly recommend this game to sports game fans and those who play casually.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple, but yet at the same time has depth to it.  When pitching you can change the ball's path and/or increase the speed.  When batting you can move around in the hitters box to best position yourself to hit the ball,  You can also steal bases or prevent the player from stealing a base.  This is just some of the mechanics that you can do in-game, there is more that you can do.\n\nOne gripe I have is there is no mid/between game saving.  When you enter a game mode you have to play against quite a bit of teams and the matches go on for quite a bit.  If you exit the game, that is it and you have to start all over.  This is a bummer because if you play in short bursts like I do, it can get frustrating because you potentially can't beat the game.  I am hoping some sort of saving will be implemented in the future.\n\nFrom an hours to price ratio, you will definitely get your money's worth and much more.\n\nOverall this is a very fun game, I haven't enjoyed a baseball game in a very long time and this hits the spot.
