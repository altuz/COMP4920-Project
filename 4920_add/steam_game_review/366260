Don't use this version to speedrun).\n- want to play this online (the online is shit)\n- Want to conquer leaderboards (hacked leaderboards)\n- Own Metal Slug X.  This is basically a beta Metal Slug X\n\nI love MS games, but having a broken achievement killed the fun for me.  I feel like I got stiffed.
