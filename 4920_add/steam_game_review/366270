Beautiful hand drawn graphics, a nice thumping soundtrack with plenty of drum & bass, great effects, good scoring and it always feels very satisfying racking up that score. There are plenty of humorous animations when you shoot enemies off hospital beds, or those guys trying to warm themselves up by the burning oil drums. Details like these remind me of Metal Slug, which is definitely a good thing. Compared to Shock Troopers 2 prerendered graphics that look out of place, it's bad slowdown and a mediocre soundtrack, this is so much better. The 3 branching paths give you more choice (compared to only 2 in the sequel), it adds a lot of replay value to the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499373804, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499373804, "recommendationid": "33323858", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506505", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
