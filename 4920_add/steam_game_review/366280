Players compete via split-screen to defeat enemies and outlast their opponent. While unable to attack each other directly, you can summon fireballs, minions or boss-monsters to overwhelm your opponent. You send more for performing combos, where defeating an enemy causes them to explode and defeat nearby enemies. Because of this mechanic proving more effective than shooting every enemy down individually or via bombs, there is a action-puzzle game feeling to the whole experience, trying to line up enemies for the largest possible combo before shooting them down.\n\nThe cute and colorful graphics and characters really give the game its charm. Each character also feels very unique in their attack arsenal and movement speeds, with decent balance among them, though some may take longer than others to get used to using or fighting against (with only the ultra-final boss possibly challenging the game balance as a secret character). For better or for worse, there is also this game's share of Engrish to explore, including having main character's name labeled as \"Load Ran\" (presumedly originally intended to be Lord Ran? *shrug*, it's well established to be Load Ran now)\n\nHowever, there are some flaws with this game. There is currently a bug (which was also in the original) relating to scores, which is bad considering this game uses leaderboards. There are also some instances of the music stuttering or doubling up. Lag relating to overpopulating the screen with bullets/enemies has been reduced, which I would consider a good thing, but some devoted fans of the original may not approve.\n\nFor offline play, this may not be the superior release of the game, as the Dreamcast had all the the above issues addressed, including an option to change emulation speed (to reproduce lag found in the original), and an option to change music to a newer arranged selection. There was also a Saturn version which included one additional character. But those are way more expensive to purchase, and lack online play . . .\n\nSo fans who have previous versions may have to weigh whether there is much to gain from this release. But it is definitely a fun and unique cute'em up for fans of the genre, or those looking for a unique versus experience.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464728566, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1464728735, "recommendationid": "23316013", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503177", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464626340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 200, "steamid": "76561198010707755", "num_games_owned": 714}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Love it!

The slowdown seems to be fixed and the video options don't reset anymore. The sound seems good too. I haven't been able to test the online multiplayer again yet, but even so I can now give this port a solid recommendation. I'll leave my pre-patch review here marked though, for posterity.\n\nNow please patch Raiden Legacy to run at 54fps and we'll be golden, DotEmu.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Pre-patch)\nThis is one of my favorite NeoGeo titles, and also one of my favorite shmups ever made thanks to its unique 1v1 take on the genre. I'm very familiar with the original title as well as its Dreamcast port, and I have to say, this one on the PC is trash.\n\nSound emulation is very poor, when booting up the game's character select screen the audio tends to loop over itself immediately. I ran into a bug the first time I tried to play the game where my stick just stopped working for no reason (luckily only in character selection and in single player, but that's still unacceptable). Online has very noticeable input lag, feels like you're sliding around everywhere, which makes it that much more difficult to dodge incoming fire. Speaking of dodging, there seems to be very little effort put into emulating slowdown when there's too many bullets on screen, making dodging heavy attacks far FAR more difficult. This was also an issue on the Dreamcast port, but they had the sense to include a NeoGeo mode in the options which restored this slowdown.\n\nAnother mark of shame upon you, DotEmu. I'd rather play this on my hacked NeoGeo X.\n\nEDIT: I'd like to point out that the emulation of the Humble Bundle version of this game, released just a few months ago also by DotEmu, is far superior.
