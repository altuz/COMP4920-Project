A 2D puzzle platformer where you are a spirit who learns to control the seasons, using your powers to try and solve a mystery plaguing the forest.\n\nThe story isn't deep or elaborate, but charming enough. The voice actors are decent, and the visuals are fantastic.\n\nPros:\n\n- Changing seasons to solve puzzles is a unique gameplay addition\n\n- Each seasons is visually distinct, has its own musical score and ambient noises\n\n- Each season provides its own unique changes to the landscape, making switching between them to solve puzzles necessary (Winter freezes water so you can walk on it, Fall makes mushrooms grow you can jump between, etc)\n\n- A simplistic but charming art style\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Some of the puzzles do not appropriately explain what you need to do. I had to resort to online guides for a few solutions\n\n- Movement can be sluggish, and jumping can be tedious when trying to time jumps between platforms\n\n- Certain aspects can be repetitive as you have to re-solve simple puzzles to go back to old areas\n\nOver all, I think it is a cute game for those that like 2D puzzle platformers. I enjoyed it, and while I did get it on sale, I felt I got my money's worth. I cannot say if it is worth it at full price, as that's really up to personal opinion. But i found the art style beautiful and the story charming enough, and changing seasons to solve puzzles was quite a bit of fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505587904, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505587904, "recommendationid": "35004471", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506697744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 191, "steamid": "76561198120873514", "num_games_owned": 27}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is not a normal game.

On top of that, it just seems intent on wasting my time. The animations are painfully slow and you're forced to watch each one of them, often in sequence, and I'm not complaining about the cutscenes, I'm talking about how you're forced to watch a boulder take 5 seconds slide into the ground so that you can pass after also reviewing the puzzle you just completed, showing you that you did infact press all the right buttons in the right order.\n\nThere's also no map so you're forced to guess where you are in relation to your objective or anything else. When you activate something, you're shown a scene wherein you're shown the consequences, but once you can control your character again, it's anyone's guess as to where said scene actually occurred. There are differences between the districts that you obtain the season fragments but within each of those districts, I found that everything looked very similar which didn't help with navigation.\n\nPlatforming is very forgiving but it couldn't afford not to be as the controls are extremely floaty and movement extremely slow, and it's not always clear what part of a platform is actually considered solid by the game due to its artstyle. The game is considered a platformer and I considered this to be one of the most miserable parts of the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505206548, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505206548, "recommendationid": "34897356", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501650", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493731014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 627, "steamid": "76561198352725446", "num_games_owned": 105}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Beautiful, colorful, immersive, and heartbreaking puzzle-platformer.

Infact this hurts me alot to say, but what everyone is saying about this game is true. The graphics, music and voice acting is BEAUTIFUL. I haven't played long enough to run into tedious puzzles or ridiculous backtracking.\n\nNo\n\nThe reason this review exist is because, from the mere 40 minutes of gameplay I have, I've fallen through the world THRICE!\n\nThe first time I was only 15 minutes in or so. My fox jumped on a ledge and instead of grabbing the ledge it fell through the world into the void.\n\nSecond time I stood against a tree that I thought was part of the background. Before I realised it's an obstacle my fox fell through the world into the void.\n\nThird time I was walking... I was FUCKING WALKING when my fox suddenly fell through the world straight into the void. I. WAS. WALKING.\n\nAnd then I fell.\n\nForever.\n\nAnd EVER!\n\nAND EVER!!!\n\nI am fine with falling through the world once or twise in hours of gameplay.
