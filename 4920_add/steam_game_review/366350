The first 1.5 hours I spent getting it to work properly but thanks to a nice friendly dev I was being a wizard in no time.\n\nI loved the intro and I loved the story and the jokes they put in but after like 20 minutes that just stops and it becomes a rather dull endless runner kind of game with very little variations. \n\nI would still recommend it though, as I hope that more stuff will be added such as more story, more enemies and most of all, more locations to run! I think that would make this game actually great. In it's current form it is not as awesome as I feel it could be.\n\n6/10 I would say.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435755985, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435755985, "recommendationid": "16826275", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506700", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482331183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1429, "steamid": "76561198062906934", "num_games_owned": 185}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really simple but and addictive casual game. worth the $5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436879415, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436879415, "recommendationid": "17043186", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490875", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435659193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198012001525", "num_games_owned": 96}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "16", "review": "*Edit*\n\nIts a good game but it still has some bumps here and there overall its good.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435659355, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435661945, "recommendationid": "16805858", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489089", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
