Especially in the beginning. There is indeed a reason for that, but it didn\u2019t stopped me from falling asleep twice.\n\nLike a few people already said, this visual novel [b]isn\u2019t for everyone[/b]. Not only because of the horror elements (quite violent and detailed in text. I enjoy horror/gore so that didn\u2019t bothered me, it was actually a \u201cselling\u201d point of the game to me) but simply because the story is mindf*cking. Imagine that someone took Higurashi, Umineko, characters from sitcom comedies, The Twilight Zone series, and Matrix and put them all together in a blender, and still added happy songs with a few rock tunes to it. That\u2019s like 1% of what MYTH is to me. Meaning that such mixture could end up being very good or very bad. Well, that\u2019s up to the reader to decide, and in my opinion it was\u2026 Weird. Good weird, actually. I\u2019ve never read anything like this (I mean not this bats*hit insane) so it\u2019s hard to describe. The author tricks the reader several times, tell them lies and more lies, and then when we see what might be the \u201ctruth\u201d, we can\u2019t believe in it...\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s a very complex story [spoiler]with other stories happening at the same time, which will probably make you confused if you don\u2019t pay attention[/spoiler]. It\u2019s more like a puzzle, not like Higurashi or Umineko tho. It felt like it had more \u201cfake\u201d parts than real ones, some of them were hard to obtain (regarding the boring scenes that held some importance), and there\u2019s the ending. For such a crazy plot I expected something like that, but it was \u201csimple\u201d compared to the rest of the story. [spoiler]Which is a shame since Aguni\u2019s ending - the prequel that is included in the game - was good.[/spoiler]\n\nI know it seems that I\u2019m pointing more at what I consider flaws, but I actually enjoyed MYTH. It surpassed my expectations, when I thought the story was becoming predictable, it changed. I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t even understand half of what happened and yet it was enjoyable. lol\n\n8/10. I recommend getting this game if you like to read [b]a lot[/b] and you\u2019re looking for a different (or even disturbing) plot. And if you don\u2019t mind about questions that will be unanswered, and slow paced narrative. If you're in for the challenge, I hope you'll enjoy in the same weird way I did.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500750621, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500750621, "recommendationid": "33727685", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588432", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
