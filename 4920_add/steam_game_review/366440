Savage 1 was alaso a great game in its own right, although I preferred Savage 2.  I know this game was meant to be a remake of Savage 1, essentially, but it just isn't very good, and S2 released a completely unfinished game and tried to make as much money as possible off of it seemingly while knowing it was going to die like all of their other games and doing nothing to fix it.  They really are a quite awful developer that just happened to make one (or two for you Savage 1 fans) of the best games of all times.  But, this just isn't it.  They should have brought in at least something from Savage 2 or made a totally new 3rd game instead of trying to do a cash grab like this remaking a game that already had it's source code released to a fairly active and faithful Savage XR community.\n\nHaving said all this...why release the source code for Savage 1, but then just ruin Savage 2 to the point that no one can play it, erase everything about it from your website like it never existed and then NOT release the source code like you did with Savage 1.  This is why so many people that play your games hate your company.  When you actually had interesting original titles you did nothing to advertise them and just let them fall to the wayside unmaintained.  Now all you do is exact copies of other successful games in an attempt to make money.  Then you make everyone excited with the announcment of a 3rd Savage game, but it's just a remake of a game that people already play and as soon as things start to go wrong you just try to get the most money out of it as possible.  I guess what I'm saying is MAKE THE SOUCE CODE FOR SAVAGE 2 PUBLIC FFS.  Or just do anything with this series that isn't ruining a once great thing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506210942, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506210942, "recommendationid": "35166663", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510422", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472107916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 203, "steamid": "76561197964788432", "num_games_owned": 148}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Can't believe I wasted money on this garbage dump.
