Its hard, but not the hardest platformer I've played (Dustforce is way harder). My only con is that it was a bit short. My first time though gameplay was 37 mins with 173 deaths. But for only $3 it is definitely worth it. I like the bounce off the wall gameplay mechanic. The later levels introduce other objects to interact with such as disappearing blocks. It would be cool to see even more elements like these.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433432885, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1433432885, "recommendationid": "16187992", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499427", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435905386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 94, "steamid": "76561198028154347", "num_games_owned": 177}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pavel Dvorkin blocked meon Facebook and denies it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463697256, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463697256, "recommendationid": "23088894", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484732", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431837935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 132, "steamid": "76561198110843706", "num_games_owned": 173}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "1", "review": "terrible ending, alt-tab to exit, the screen will lie and say the menu has just returned, don't fall for it, close the program and play a game with more than 46 minutes of game play", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431813926, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431813926, "recommendationid": "15861506", "language": "english", "votes_down": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446906", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481072041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 116, "steamid": "76561198244180602", "num_games_owned": 54}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Quick,Fun,Hard but Amazing 9.8/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1481072247, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1481072247, "recommendationid": "28228539", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
