The product is basically a slimmed down simpler version of filter forge only much much cheaper. Similar functions can also be found inside the blender node editor. I have used both, and yet i've found Working with Zeuxis to be a much easier and more enjoyable experience. \n\nNodes are scalable, connected through direct contact, and in a seperate window than the settings that they contain. This makes arangement rather easy, and an entire set can be put off to one side on its own. Using the copy and load nodes a set of nodes can be saved, and its output duplicated to entire other areas without having to redo everything.\n\nSome of the aspects i like are probably things that only I care about. In the combine node, you can combine the different rgba channels of the two inputs in different ways choosing between things like add,subtract,multiply,etc where as in other programs I have used I would have to seperate the different channels out and handle each of these combines seperatly.\n\nI love the way that this program handles normal maps. It can generate one from basically any input, and does a better job then some other programs do with the same feature. You can then apply a lighting node to it to generate a lit surface from different angles. This is monumentally useful to me.\n\nI like this program a lot, but that doesn't mean nothing is wrong with it, But the creator has responded to concerns or requests that I have brought up in the forums. \n\nI suggest anyone who is even remotely interested in this software try out the demo first and see if it fits their needs. If it is useful, its $6.99.
