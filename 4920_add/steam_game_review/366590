It's a great platformer and the levels are very well put together. The fake CRT screen refresh rate line was getting on my nerves after awhile. Great art style and very fluid controls. If you're a fan of platformers, I'd buy it at any price point, if you're on the fence, I'd wait till for a sale. \n\nOne minute review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RKgE3E0IMc", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436240625, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436240625, "recommendationid": "16920395", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519746", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450078481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561197972060003", "num_games_owned": 215}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I like it - seems really fun so far. I would only wish the more of the ASCii character set was used for a real DOS/UNIX look like in the retro early-early 90's, 16:9 support would look approperate on my PC's monitor or TV. No loading issues or anything with my GTX980/i7 4930k. Also - custom refresh rates would serioustly be nice! (how does this work currently? Does it use system?)
