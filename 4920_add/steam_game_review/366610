No issues on that.\n\nMain menu of the game is horrible. Horrible. Force to use the controller to navigate. Guess what? You can't click on any of the options unless you're using the controller and space bar key on the keyboard to enter the option. \n\nNot able to customize the keys of the controller. (Doesn't really matter)\n\nOh Hey! Multi-Player. Sweet. Just grab a friend and have his/her controller jam into your PC to play. Who needs to play globally when you can play locally right?  \n\nWant to close the game? Hit the escape button. Quick and simple. Hit it by mistake? Sorry. You gotta reload the entire game.\n\nHow much did you pay the game reviewers to write stuff like that and even rate a 4/5?\nI can't rate below a 0/5.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430294727, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430295127, "recommendationid": "15607304", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488921", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1479414916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 177, "steamid": "76561198265419211", "num_games_owned": 35}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Controls are annoying af", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461261559, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1461261559, "recommendationid": "22553193", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498755", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443050990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 182, "steamid": "76561198131682430", "num_games_owned": 1425}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun Game To Play !", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442169858, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442169858, "recommendationid": "18020227", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483367", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1455512193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 71, "steamid": "76561198064943895", "num_games_owned": 26}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "i find it funny to play as a cupcake getting donuts, but i have a problem with this game multiplayer my parter is supposed to fire their own gun and use grappling hook but all the controls are for my controller for some except his moving and jumping please fix this so for now gonna have to say no dont play  unless you solo... but then what's the fun", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455397700, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1455397700, "recommendationid": "21189641", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
