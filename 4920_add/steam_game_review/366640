It's good for an RPG, has a fun naruto shippuden style of combat, and interesting skills progression. \n\nCons: game ends abruptly, the story makes sense and is relevant up to the point of the final battle, which you won't know is the final boss but it will be. Suddenly then it's over and you're left wondering what happened to all the plot and lore you've been collecting so far.\n\nWhat would make it better: Make the game longer, tie up those loose ends nice and tidy, could cram in another 20-30 hours of game in there without even having to add new story.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505066071, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505066071, "recommendationid": "34867699", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513557", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505070181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 499, "steamid": "76561198037011177", "num_games_owned": 215}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Was waiting for this game but forgot about it along the way before release. Very glad the sale on steam gave me a notice so I stumbled across it again. This is the first indie game that has genuinely had me interested and after playing just past the first boss until now it shows exactly what the gaming industry, mainly among triple A titles, is missing. This is adventure gaming at its finest with deep combat system where you have to pay attention to the walls of the battle arena to know what magic element you can charge up for magic attacks whilst enemies are coming at you forcing parries or blocks. The AI is no pushover once you've gotten past the tutorial and will have you submit and at times trap you if you can't learn how to respond to attacks and treat this as a button masher instead. Interesting characters to meet with humor. Good character designs.

When approaching the beach in the beginning area walking into the water shoves you up into the air on an invisible platform. Nothing terribly special but it does show some signs of being unpolished. Beyond that the game is rather fun, kind of light-hearted if not seemingly a button-spamfest. The dodge-roll mechanic offers very little to the table, enemies when performing chain attacks still turn in your direction so trying to roll around to attack from the side is pretty much useless. So it's mostly run away when they perform a combo then rush in and spam the punch/kick buttons until you knock them down. Rinse, repeat. You're given \"Shi\" early on being a form of magic but it seems a little unimpressive so far. I'm still near the beginning so once I can unlock more Shi it may offer more strategy to combat. Speaking of combat, if you need to sneak by an enemy or just want to launch a surprise attack you can use Chado's rock summoning technique to hurl a stone to draw the enemy's attention, or hit an enemy with it and temporarily stun them. Aiming could be a bit easier admittedly but it's effective.\n\nVisual-wise the game looks really good if you can look past some of the low polygons used on the 3D models. This definitely doesn't look next gen but it still looks quite beautiful. For an indie game a bit impressive even. One complaint I read was the voice acting, personally I like it. Combined with the comic panel cutscenes it adds for some very amusing moments that had me cracking a smile. All-in-all I would say this is definitely a game that's a must-have for anyone who enjoys action-RPGs with a light-hearted colorful approach. If you're unsure if you would like the game just wait for it to go on sale. I managed to pick it up for $12 at the time of writing this and I can say it is well worth the price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505107561, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505107561, "recommendationid": "34877111", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492902956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 113, "steamid": "76561198150484916", "num_games_owned": 8}, "votes_funny": 10, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I installed this game on my Toshiba Satellite C551 laptop w/ Windows 10 when it was released in April and I had the minimum RAM of 4 GB but not the recommended 8 GB RAM.\n\nThe first time I tried to play it, it crashed Windows, as in I had to reinstall Windows 8.1 then re-upgrade to 10 because I forgot to make a Win10 boot disk and also hadn't backed up my documents in 2 months like an idiot.  (Honestly, this is the one freaking time I didn't use my Spidey senses and just not buy the game; I figured if my computer couldn't handle the game, it wouldn't play or would play slow, not render Windows unbootable.)\n\nSo I waited months for this game to come out, then I spent like $30 or whatever it was on this game and I now can't even play the thing.  I considered installing more RAM, assuming maybe that was the problem, but since I really don't know for sure, I'm never going to play this game because I just don't want to go through the hassle again.\n\nI have to mark it thumbs down because of this, unfortunately.  No game should kill Windows like this, especially when I had the minimum recommended requirements.  Unless it really wasn't the game that did it, but loading the game for the first time is what I was doing when I got the \"no bootable device\" error or whatever it was, so what else would it be?  It took me almost 5 months to even come back on Steam and write this review.  I really wanted to play it. Oh well.\n\n(I don't know why it says I have 1.9 hrs on record.
