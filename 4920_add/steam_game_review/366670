I am NOT GOOD at point and click games but in this one, there is just enough logic in each sequence to figure it out. The in-game help system is also well designed. \n\nThe in-game help system is well thought out, and only releases a single clue with each mouse click. So instead of revealing the entire point and click sequence at once (and ruining that screen), the in-game help just release a single clue at a time. If you're really stuck then sure reveal the entire sequence, but maybe you figured most of it out except one thing. \n\nThe puzzles are also reasonable. There is a pattern that can be deduced, and there is a hint with a timer if you can't find the last one of 'find X pieces of the map'. type puzzles. A few puzzles can also be skipped entirely. \n\nThere are a few screens where historical information is shared about technology brought back to the West from China. \n\nAs others have mentioned the game is short, but worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1481021580, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1481021580, "recommendationid": "28217381", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507797", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449367111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 113, "steamid": "76561198011127647", "num_games_owned": 85}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Short but sweet.
