After  collecting hundreds of them over the years, I was expecting something  with at least some innovation, and much better graphics.   Hmmm! well....... maybe the space invader like levels  are different, but overall Breakout Invaders is a poor second cousin  removed to many of the breakouts I've played over the years.   Some freeware  versions  have been   more challenging, and look better graphically than  this game.  It's not seriously bad, but   compared to  a lot of the more recent breakout games I've played, it looks   dated , even though some of the level designs are quite interesting.\n\nThe  game felt sluggish with my mouse (a Razer Naga), the graphics are a retrograde step when compared to the likes of games like Magic Ball 2, 3 and 4, Strikeball 2 and 3 (to name just a few of the  more well known ones - for some reason Alawar changed the name of  the Magic Ball series to Smash Frenzy).  The original, released  over 10 years ago, is the only one in the Magic Ball series that looks and plays worse than today's game.  The second in the Magic Ball series   looked better than today's game  (released way back in 2005), had  more power ups and played well. The third in the series had a major graphics update (see video link below).   Compare Breakout Invaders to the likes of the Magic Ball games,  Ricochet Infinity  and Shatter, the latter two of which are  available via Steam.  They are worlds  apart in quality and game play.  Breakouts were my first love w.r.t. arcade games  (next to shmups and TD games).  All that said,  Breakout Invaders is only \u00a31.99, soooo.... despite my disappointment, it's not a great loss; I've still got thousands of free levels   to play via Ricochet infinity.  :)\n\nYou can  compare videos of  the  breakouts I mentioned above by clicking on their names.
