Think Fault:milestone one in the way the story grows and comes together at the end, but without fault's obvious cliffhanger.\n\nThe production values are quite good. I'm not sure what to praise more - the character art, the backgrounds, the music or how dynamic some of the scenes are. It's definitely not a run-of-the-mill visual novel.\n\nLast but not least, I have to give props to the VAs as they do an excellent job of conveying the characters. It certainly helped pull me even more into the story.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that if you like your thrillers/mysteries/character drama/magical world stories, I think you'll enjoy this one as is.

Let see... \n\nWell firstly, the novel had pleasant graphics and animation. They were a bit repetitive though, a standard in the genre I guess. During fight scenes the repetition almost got disturbing however. Also, a more seamless fitting of the characters into the milieu would be appreciated. Or do people really just stand there in other visual novels as well? This much? Why not have them sit, sip their tea, point to things, show emotion with their body etc.? Voice acting was also on the positive side. It seemed quite natural (at least to a non-Japanese) and was well in sync with the English text. No complaints\nabout the music either.\n\nNow about the text... some of it was pretty highbrow-level, which is mostly okay but at times can feel a bit silly if not used with caution. It can make the text unscrupulously vexatious. A small sample of words and phrases from one little part of the novel:\n\natone, rebuke, gorge, emphatic, impassive, \"in response to specific remarks\", \"That's indubitably the reason for the baton relay-like exchanges\"... \n\nBiggest let down for me was that there wasn't enough action, romance, suspense, twists or general pizzazz. There was some of this and some that, yes, but no single element seemed very dominant. Not that I could see. This was a mystery novel sure... but seemed apologetic about it by dishing out other elements as well, ending up one knick-knack shop of a story. On some level reading MERIFA was like going to a museum, you yourself needed to make it interesting, give it some effort. The entertainment did not really jump at you enough. But that's just my taste as a member of the ADD-generation. In fact, if they continue writing this or stories like this, the makers could very soon be the Stephen Kings of visual novels... in good and bad. That reminds me of the youtube video \"Stephen The Lesbian\", now there's entertainment that jumps at you!

So if u like mystery genre then u will like this VN. Just a small bit is that this VN does start slow. Once u get past the slow part of the game the VN will start to pick up.\n\nThis VN u will play as Yuu, Chiharu, and another side that is ???, The ??? is for because u will be playing through other's POV. Although u will play more of Yuu's side in this VN.\n\nI really liked the characters a lot. I can't decide who is my favorite. Probably Rin and Pops:) Also the characters have voice acting in this:) Only Yuu doesn't have a voice though.\n\nI really liked the music in this VN. the music was very nice.\n\nThe BG I had to get used to because at first I didn't like them. Then as I got used to the BG I started to like them.\n\nAlso something important to notice is that there is a sequel to this game called Indigo Blue Heaven. So u will not get all answers in just Red Is For Anguish. This might be the reason why Yuu is mute in this VN. I assume Indigo Blue Heaven u will play more as Chiharu. If that is also the case then maybe Yuu will have a voice in Indigo Blue Heaven and not Chiharu this time.\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed this VN a lot and recommend anyone else to try this VN.
