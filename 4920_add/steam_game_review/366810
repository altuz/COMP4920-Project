It plays like a gridder movement-wise, but unlike a gridder, you do not choose a party of characters whose skills complement eachother, instead you play as a solo adventurer and you click on the screen to swing whatever weapon you have equipped.\n\nThankfully, there are no longer any monetary purchases to unlock content.  All content is unlocked via gems which are only obtained by completing dungeons.  There are a number of different adventurers to unlock as well as cute little pets which will actually help out in battle.  You can also unlock the various dungeon skins for the randomized dungeons with gems as well.\n\nThe game includes a 16 level, well-crafted dungeon filled with puzzles, monsters and treasures, but it will probably only take a few hours to complete.  After that you are free to run it again, but there are also randomized dungeons to play through.  While not crafted as in depth as the main dungeon, they do at least offer some variety and exploration.  \n\nWhile playing you gain any number of dropped weapons and armor, and no matter what character you take, you are free to equip anything you want.  The problem with this is that every character roughly plays exactly the same way making little need to unlock other adventurer types.  As you progress through the dungeons you find higher and higher leveled equipment.  When you start new dungeons you find equipment based off of your current level or equipment stats.  This means you have little need to upgrade your weapons and armor outside of the dungeon, which is available to you, but mostly uneeded.  It also means the dungeons never really get challenging.  This really is just a casual game with little strategy or skill required.  The only challenge in playing through is figuring out the puzzles which hinder your path to the end of the dungeons.\n\nIf that was all that was offered with this game, I would probably say there just wasn't enough content for the gem grinding required to unlock everything, but I think what saves this game and makes it a worthwile game to play is the ability to make your own dungeons and then upload them for other players to play through.  As of right now, there is not a huge player-base creating dungeons, but there is still quite a list of player-made dungeons available.  Obviously the quality of these dungeons is entirely dependent on the skill of the designer, so they can vary in how fun they are to play through.\n\nAll in all, this game makes for a fun, satisfying jaunt through a dungeon, but it probably isn't going to hold the interest of players looking for any real strategy or character building.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455378111, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1455378111, "recommendationid": "21181780", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530770", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444570391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 311, "steamid": "76561198009878692", "num_games_owned": 113}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I do not expect to have to pay money to advance after I have bought a game.

Gems\nComplete 16 Level Dungeon - Reward 60 Gems\nFREE Gift everyday which can be 1 Gem - 2 GEMS - 3 GEMS - or Gold (A random amount)\n\nBad points...\nThe monsters have the same carectoristics exept archers, would be nice to see monsters throw fireballs and poisen clouds and move and attack in different ways to make it more challenging and interesting\n\nThe monsters level up when you level up this needs to be different to give player more encouragement to level up and use their gems as it is i can see no logic in leveling up a carector and using your valuable gems until this changes.\n\nPets EXP points are static around 3 to 4 points with each hit regardless of increasing their damage level stat, I would of thought that when you increase your pets strength and agility which increases your damage level this would increase the amount of EXP points you recieve from attacking monsters.\n\nAlso pets can't do magic regardless of having the function to increase their macic stats with gems the only improvement i can see with upgrading pets stats is increasing their health so they can fight longer periods of time before dying and waiting 25 seconds to revive, this needs much improvement.\n\nYou can't buy spell books in shops and they can be hard to get in gameplay\n\nThe magic spells does not increase in strength when you increase the spells level, all it does is decreases the waiting time to cast the same spell again (Countdown bar under spell used moves faster from right to left) and this makes no logic as when you level up so does the monsters you fight which means you have to shoot more fireballs to destroy monster, I think it should be that when your spells levels increase so does the power of the spell used too and that makes sense.\n\nJoystick 360 degree buttons needs to be used a lot to center screen which is annoying, would of been better for the screen to auto center itself and just use the 360 buttons to look around left/right/up/down and when 360 buttons released the screen returns to center itself automaticly.\n\nNo joystick key allocated to delete on screen messages you must use the mouse to do this so this game depends on 2 pieces of hardware if you want to use a joystck.\n\nNo tab to configure game keys/joystick keys\n\nNeed to heal pets with magic\n\nPets need to heal Carector\n\nMore pets needs to be added to selection\n\nHas no steam achievements or cards and this is important as it gives gamers targets to reach and improves sales of the game.\n\nWould be nice to buy the soundtrack\n\nWould be nice to have a tab to click on to reset a carectors stats (start from fresh) BUT still keep any UNUSED GEMS in inventory, and give a message warning to click on YES or NO to reset that one carector you are currently playing on the screen, to resets all carectors you need to do this with each one in turn.\n\nWould be nice to see new pets such as a baby deer/Fox/Golden Eagle/Polar Bear/Butterfly/Bee/Lion/Panda Bear/Penguin/Sea Lion/Crocodile/Dragonfly the list is endless))\n\nWould like to see some new carectors such as...A Dalek (Dr Who) and a Cyberman (Dr Who)...Marvel Carectors such as Wonder woman and Catwoman Batman Superman Supergirl Flash the list is endless))\n\nBesides all this it is still a game worth playing and has great possibilitys if the developer takes advantage of improving this game with patches which i strongly advise him/her doing\n\nGems is no issue in this game if you play this game right as you build up your carector/pet on the first level in the prison cells and exit game and do it again (Same Level) this way you build them up and get loot then complete the whole 16 levels to get 60 gems free, also you get 3 gems free everyday as a freebie if you know how to do this (which i do)\n\nThe reason for purchasing Gems in this game is for those who wants to unlock everything fast and have a big headstart in the game from the start (but this is not needed to complete this game)\n\nThis is a good game and if you love dungeon games like i do then you will love it.\n\nAll this game needs is some improvements to make it a smash hit, the trick here for complete success is to keep the gamers interested and addicted to playing this game which improves sales and development of the game and makes the developers lots of money.\n\nSo developers get your fingers out and start improving this game if you want to make loads of MONEY!!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436704484, "written_during_early_access": false,

I ended up with Dungeon Hero, simply because the developer removed all microtransactions, and I wanted to support that decision with real-world dollars. I ended up being pleasantly surprised with it.\n\nDungeon Hero is a casual (and pretty shallow) but fun Action / Gridder (think: first-person, grid-based RPG-esque games such as Legend of Grimrock, Eye of the Beholder, or Dungeon Master). There is NO story, just dungeon crawling, monster bashing goodness. The main draws are the randomly generated dungeons / loot (as in Diablo) and unlockable characters and pets (gems are picked up by completing dungeons and used for unlockables). I've put around 8 hours into it, and I've still got a lot to unlock.\n\nThe assets are pre-purchased (meaning, you've likely seen them before) and a bit cartoony looking, if that sort of thing bothers you. I wouldn't enjoy them in a more serious gridder, but they seem to suit the casual aspect of this game pretty well.\n\nThe addition of a quick-n-dirty level editor is smart, and you can bring everything out of the dungeons with you and transfer gear to other characters. Dungeons are completely randomized; however, if you feel like playing through a designed dungeon the dev has included a few of those, too. For me, $6.99 is a bit steep for a casual game (I bought it at a sale price of $3.49), but if it fits what you're looking for, it might be worth it for those times when you just want something light to play.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460648703, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460648703, "recommendationid": "22412050", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511063", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503446993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 909, "steamid": "76561197983285903", "num_games_owned": 267}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "In short\nWho's it for?\nPeople who like grid based dungeon crawlers and just want to kill time for a bit and don't mind that the extra content is gained through grinding for gems but the main content is available. There is no cash shop and you don't need to pay real world money to unlock the content despite what other reviews state.\n\n\nIn long\nSo I like this game on mobile and while yes this is a port with a cash shop ( that I don't think exist in game) you don't have to pay real world cash to progress. The gems are easily aquired with a bit of grinding and loot selling. The game is fairly easy more so since the gems are easily given per play. People seem to not want to put the effort of earning the gems to progress. Also the gems are used to unlock EXTRA content as the MAIN game is unlocked from the getgo and it has puzzles and a story. It's not a terribly deep game but it's a nice little time sink . There doesn't seem to be a weight limit to the loot you can carry and your character is customizable stat wise. Want to be a dual weilding sellsword that can cast heal spells you can, Just know that based on the character you pick any stat that deviates from it's class costs gems you need to earn. As mentioned I've played this game on mobile and love delving to see what loot I can grab and stuff I can unlock and never paid a dime in the cash shops. Playing on the steam version is more liberating cause instead of gold I earn gems and it's easier to unlock things. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454464122, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454464122, "recommendationid": "20923415", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506156", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506429906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1051, "steamid": "76561198018811934", "num_games_owned": 44}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is best played in stereoscopic 3D.

The game is designed as a simple hack-and-slash game.  A casual game to play during dead time.  As such, combat and dungeon exploration are the key components - not unlocking heroes.\n\nThe random game modes are easy enough to complete without your hero dieing (which only costs two gems for revival), and these modes provide you with the gems needed to advance your hero with enough left to go to your stockpile for the occassional death or weapon improvement.  With leveled up characters and some spare potions, the large random maps and the more complex, 16-level, hand-designed dungeon provide you sufficient gems to unlock higher level pets and heroes.\n\nIn addition, the main benefit to higher level characters is greater starting stats and base stat ceiling.  Lower level heroes can be as powerful as higher ones by buying stat boosts at the cheaper price of 1 gem per stat increase.  Personnally, I like to get higher level heroes for astestics and completeness not gameplay benefit.\n\nWhile the game could be defined as pay-to-win (assuming you define winning as a complete unlock of all heroes and pets), this would miss the main focus of the game, which is casual combat.  As a player, the micro-transcations primary purpose is to allow you quickly unlock a particular hero or reduce the time needed to reach a certain self-imposed goal; while at the same time, supporting the developer.\n\nMicro-transcations aren't inherently bad, they just have been implemented in ways to force players to pay often or suffer significant wait times.  As I have presented, this game doesn't suffer from this problem, so micro-transcation shouldn't be the reason you don't play it.\n\nIs this game great?  No, but it doesn't set out to break new ground or have complex gameplay mechanics.  It does intend to provide hours of casual fun and I would say it does this quite well.\n\nAre there areas that could do with improvement?  There are definitely a few aspects that could be changed to improve the fun.\n\nIt would be great if custom dungeons of sufficient size and monster quantity provided gems (even if it is just 1 or 2).  This would reduce the dependence on the simple random dungeons to boost gems.  \n\nGiving players more potions in the store would also be a huge benefit especially for warriors who suffer from the lack of sufficient spell-casting to stay healthy and deal damage.\n\nThe last area that could a little work is customization of dungeon details - most notable props and chests contents.  The ability to have force certain chests to include a health or shield potion would allow dungeon creaters finer control over the dungeon progression and puzzles.\n\nAlso, this game could practically designed for achievements.  Achievements act like added objectives in lot of games, and these could reduce the repetitveness of the default game modes.\n\nWho would I recommend this game to? I would recommend this game to players seeking a well-made hack-and-slash with simple combat mechanics.
