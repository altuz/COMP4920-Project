The soundtrack sounds nice and the bug models look nice, the UI works nicely. But don't press anything while the menu is loading because it will crash. Also a single player mode would be great~\n\nEdit 1: So as you can see the dev(s) are great with feedback :D (Thank you!~) It seems like the crashing has stopped :D There is also a training mode now with no enemy bots, but you can practice your flying and landings (a bit challenging). I've also noticed that the weapons are strange while in flight. If I strafe left or sometimes just turn I slow down and can't shoot. I don't know if it's a mechanic I'm missing or what~ But overall a pleasant experience so far for a game that released early access yesterday.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1435404229, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435386931, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1435440049, "recommendationid": "16734265", "developer_response": "Hi!
