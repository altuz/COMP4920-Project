I bought it because I watched some gameplay of it and it seemed so much fun.

It is a really nice touch.\n-The managing of the ship isn't easy and when you achieve something it really feels like an achievement!

But for someone patient and willing to get into the mechanics and lore? It's AWESOME. Challenging, interesting, dramatic, funny.\n\nI first noticed it because it looked so beautiful - and it really is, the style matches the whole feeling really well and the music alone made me drift through a system peacefully just listening to it (until that darn Glukkt found me. Well. Should've paid my debts). The game explains your failures when you know where to pay attention, which could take a while during a hectic last minute escape - but there's no silver platter for \"this is how you succeed\". Which in my opinion is really cool and makes me want to start over an over again, especially with the different difficulties.\n\nThere's a new story behind every seed, behind every crew, you just need to be willing to listen. And enjoy. And maybe learn to fly that lander. :'D Now excuse me, I have to practice and make \"friends\".", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504867290, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504867290, "recommendationid": "34811724", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499771", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505310808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 171, "steamid": "76561197978588370", "num_games_owned": 34}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "TL;DR Great, but difficult game. You will fail and need to learn from mistakes made in previous runs. Awesome soundtrack!\n\nPreamble: I have not yet played that much myself, but I have seen 20+h of streams and vods (if you can understand german  I really recommend Gronkhs Let's Play of TLJH).\n\nTo some people TLJH feels just like a sequence of minigames (flying spaceships, landing on a planet, talking and negociating with other races), but in my opinion these account for an awesome game. Yes getting into the game is not easy and reading lots of text in a game is something most people are not used to anymore. I like that due to the seed based \"procedural generated\" universe you can search for seeds other people recommend as easy / fun or play your seed again with a different ship/crew or just play a different seed and you will get an extremly different adventure (different quests, different alien races,...).\n\nFinally I really enjoy the soundtrack.
