Cause this is old school fps with old graphics and controls. Its a finding the way kind of game where you need to find a key, lock up next room etc etc. Its not great but there is tons of shitty games that makes this game to golden. But its f2p and if you want to have a little childhoodnostalgia, then try it out. Do you remeber games titles like \"Zero Tolerans\"? That was the shit back then, if i played this in 1995 i would have loved this game. \n\nPros:\nNostalgia\nThe sound....attackasdfhkasfhasl from the green dude is super!\nIts better then GASP\n\nCons:\nBad rewiews from younger kids that dont have any clue about what they are talking about. \nAnd the game isnt that great.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486455888, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486455888, "recommendationid": "29757383", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492611", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441958286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 41, "steamid": "76561198130221227", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 8, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "i expected this game to be bad, but it wasnt to bad at all. \n\nit got differcult when it became dark and trying to shoot something you cant see was fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447206095, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447206095, "recommendationid": "19002438", "language": "english", "votes_down": 29, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450912", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
