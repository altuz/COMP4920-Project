While this doesn't make this game unplayable (as of writing this), some people might experience nauseating or any similar effects.\nPersonally, I do indeed see some consistent flickering. But I don't exprience any medical-side-effect, at least not yet.\n\n\nTechnical-fore-words:\nIt is fair to warn right away that this is indeed a very \"as-it-is\"-release of the originaly year-2000-build of this game, which is also mentined on one if the first pre-title-images. So there are no build-in tweakings in options-menu for windowed-mode, resolution-changes, or various other \"modern\" tweaking-options aside wheteher you want to turn of the sounds or not most importantly.\n\nThat being said, you're going to get one of the least amount changes suffering re-releases on Steam, only chnage being that it works on (at least most of the ) moderm machines.\n\n\nYou're also unfotunately forced to use another 3rd-party screen-capturing / shotting-software since due the age and un-modified nature of this game, the Steam-overlay won't be working (at least by default).\n\n--------------\n--------------\n\nAs for the game itself, \"Puzzle Station\" is the non-product-placement \"off-spring\" of Ninai Games (before Detonium Interactive) of \"Drop Mania\" (which eventually was \"remade\" as \"Super Drop Mania\" for Gizmondo by \"Fathammer\"; then there's of couse the \"Rampage Puzzle Attack\"-variant also by \"Ninai Games\").\n\nLike the title suggest, this \"Drop Mania\"-variant is much more puzzle-heavy for the most part. But considering the simplistic nature of the game-mechanics (link 4 or more of the same color-blocks to \"poof\"-them), I for one can forgive this even if sometimes I'd like to just watch pretty explosions \"without thinking\" (I.E. playing without swapping the blocks with Ctrl-button).\n\n\nSo, is the game worth buying?\nWell,  puzzle-game enthusiastics, especially those who are looking for some older titles, this is quite a good and solid one to their collection.\nThat's pretty much all I can say about this game, for now.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe we'll see an actual new \"Drop Mania\"-game in future on PC. \n----------------\n----------------", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430588373, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430590228, "recommendationid": "15656781", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543161", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1476461928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 222, "steamid": "76561198010340343", "num_games_owned": 209}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "2", "review": "lapsuuden peli. tuli rassattua pienen\u00e4 vidysti...  jotta t\u00e4ytt\u00e4\u00e4 arvostelun kriteerit kirjotukseni niin voin todeta ett\u00e4 peli on koukuttava ja pelin ulkon\u00e4k\u00f6 saa aikaan tarpeen poksauttaa kaikki palikat!
