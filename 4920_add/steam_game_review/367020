And it is. You can already guess half of the characters and the plot.\n\nTo make it worse, the character development is shallow to an unbelievable level, up until the point in which your \"route\" is decided. After that point, the other characters will play a minor role, or even totally disappear, and the story will develop the \"Chosen Character\". You'll be somewhat at the middle of the storyline - but there will be only one or two choices left to make, everything else is linear.\n\n\"Chosen Character\", quotes intended. I personally have lacked any sort of empathy towards any of the characters until I reached the last quarter of (some) of the routes. Some of the endings are very forced in the \"oh well, that escalated quickly\" vein, and ruined the empathy.\n\nThe art is very good, that is true. Apart from the hand of Yui. The H-Scenes are pretty good too, but I'm not sure if I could recommend a game based purely on that. \n\nAfter so much bashing, I must admit there is one pretty well done ending. One. It was almost worth it. \n\nLinux port is sloppy because of the bug in Renpy.

I mostly preferred the Yui route because I just love the Tsundere type of 2d girls and to describe how I felt about the journey for that route is rather simple. \n\n\"It gave me a happy ending but left me a bit unsatisfied\" \n\nI say \"unsatisfied\" to express my disappointment on having no more content left on Yui! Because I was entranced with the character and wanted to learn more about her, which is why I wanted to know what happens next after the \"holding hands\" scene but I just got hit with the fact that it's all over. Although the after story might change that but I think the after story for Yui might be included in the love scene patch? Because there was no indication if there is an after story after the first one (in the steam version). \n\nIn conclusion, I had fun even though I was mostly attracted to the Yui path but I would still recommend this visual novel for anyone who wants a simple read and love \"wacky\" characters.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501808068, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501808163, "recommendationid": "34005249", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503641", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500151237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 433, "steamid": "76561198300297476", "num_games_owned": 272}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Competent seems the best word to describe this visual novel.\nIt is neither the best nor the worst I have read, nor do I regret reading it.\nThe story is a bit of a cauldron of cliches, with an amnesiac protagonist right off the bat and plot twists I saw coming from a mile away. Despite this, the story was still interesting and I finished all the routes. \nSome of the events are rather hard to believe, which significantly detracts from any pathos the writers have built up. When I stop reading to google 'can you really die by biting off your tongue?' it's not a good sign. (Apparently the answer is: yes, but very unlikely).\nOverall though the characters are good, with a decent attempt at creating complexity.\nThe relationships between the characters seemed a but bizarre though - once the protagonist finds his love interest he seems not to care for any other of his former friends, leaving them to deal with their issues by themselves. [spoiler]Poor Megumi, it seems to be inferred, is murdered by her teacher if Hideaki opts for Shiro - and nobody seems to give a rat's backside[/spoiler] It left me with a bad taste in my mouth, particularly on the later routes where I'd already learned most of the character's backstories only to have to watch as Hideaki blithely ignores them, or worse. The choices are fairly straightforward, so there didn't seem to be any way of combining the routes so that going out with one girl didn't entail you being a total git to the others.\nThe pacing feels a little odd in places, particularly with the rather pointless calender system which certainly only confused me. There are surely better ways to show the passing of time?\nThe art is nice, which is all I can really say. Although some of the female sprites seem to lack casual clothes - Poor Shiro wears her school uniform all year round it seems, despite CGs showing that she owns a rather adorable blue dress.\n\nOverall, if you really like visual novels, then get on sale. There isn't really anything here which isn't done better somewhere else, but at the same time...it's not bad.
