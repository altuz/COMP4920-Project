Until decent changes i don't feel the need to play it again because no matter how much I play it I will always be random character A equipped with random 2 attacks (A B C or D) that walks through a map to collect keys and for some reason kill a boss for a baby. I wont ever become more than that in the current game system and some random character B that just bought the game could walk in and be the exact same as me despite random character A spending way more time in game playing.\n\nYou have the ability to make your own stuff through their voxel system which is a good thing, I've seen it be very successful in other games but this one is still very early in its creation so the creating system is not at a point where it can offer much.\n\nThe available maps to play are very straight forward and due to no equipment or leveling there is no point in killing anything on the maps except the bosses (which currently drop a random baby followed by you being teleported back to the starter map)\n\nNow I do expect the game to get much better as the devs work out where they're going with it.\n\nIf you feel like helping them move along by buying it in early access don't expect to get a lot of enjoyment out of the current version of the game but rather probably bug test the current version a bit and hold onto your early access version until the final version is complete because it should become a pretty good game.\n\nHope this helps :)\n\n[Update]\nI updated the review after I replayed the game, all I needed to change in the review though was the amount of \"classes\" from 4 to 8. Nothing else to note has really changed, I went through all current levels in ~15 minutes, still no point to killing anything but the boss, still no real progression or something to work towards, and no loot so I'm still gonna be waiting until it's a good game. Leave me another message when the game has made decent progress or if you want me to re-evaluate the game to update my review.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431986964, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1444297193, "recommendationid": "15891558", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521054", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469881880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 51, "steamid": "76561198045630717", "num_games_owned": 175}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a good little game but not that much content max an hour of gameplay", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469949499, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1469949499, "recommendationid": "24629033", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511733", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503450933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 143, "steamid": "76561197978423729", "num_games_owned": 909}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I like voxel games.
