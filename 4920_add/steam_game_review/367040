It looks really dodgy and it is on many occasions. If you can make your way past the first 20 minutes, it really picks up with a menagerie of bizarrely textured guns and a colourful cast of monsters. Monsters such as Imps, Ogres, Midget Lizard Men, charred gas mask clad soldiers that dance when you kill them, and even skeletons that throw....\"rocks\".\n\nFINAL OPINION: Not quite worth $9.99, but it's fun to play overall.\n\nEDIT: The latest patch has broken the game. I can no longer recommend it until the problem is solved.\n\nEDIT EDIT: It's been rolled back to a stable version. So it works again.\n\nEDIT x3: However, no work seems to be being done to improve the game anymore. Also, some DLC has been released when the base game is rubbish with no signs of being fixed. I had high hopes for this game reaching it's $9.99 value, but it seems that's never going to happen. You have disappointed me, Dakker. Your small scale example of the AAA gaming industry disappoints me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430285508, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431420799, "recommendationid": "15606391", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640251", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437586830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198100750095", "num_games_owned": 117}, "votes_funny": 38, "votes_up": 44, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Refund Simulator 2015", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437587278, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448913273, "recommendationid": "17175873", "language": "english", "votes_down": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519748", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
