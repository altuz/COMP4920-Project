The controls are terrible even if I could have remapped the buttons or the joystick axis, which wasn't even an option. The tank is the best thing about the art and that's not saying much. I don't know why this was done in a custom engine instead of literally anything else available. The physics are atrocious, with hitboxes that do not even remotely agree with the graphics, and I finally gave up when I fell through the world and never hit a kill plane despite waiting for over five minutes.\n\nThe level design is beyond bad and is something I would have done better at than when I was doodling on paper back in grade school. Blind death jumps everywhere with no indication of what you're about to get into, and the 3d platforming is a cruel joke, only made immeasurably worse by the abysmal camera angles that this game inflicts upon you.\n\nThe music is the best part of the game in that it's merely acceptable rather than torturous trash.\n\nThis is the first game I've purchased on Steam that made me want a refund. At least when I was gifted Bad Rats I knew exactly what I was getting into accepting it.\n\nNow I feel sorry for my two brothers, whom I gifted copies of this game on the hopes that it would be at least enjoyable.\n\nI think I would rather play Blaster Master 2 for a full weekend on loop than ever sully my monitor with this \"game's\" presence again.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430546856, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430546856, "recommendationid": "15648376", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548744", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430596977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561198037859516", "num_games_owned": 385}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 27, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm going to lay it down simple, DON'T BUY THIS GAME.\n\nthe graphics are god awful, quite frankly they look like they are lifted from a shitty unity game from kongregate.\nthe gameplay is terrible, if i was actually trying to survive in this game, i wouldn't die, but as is, the droning music and repetive firefights made me truly discouraged.\n\nthe controls are terrible on a gamepad, and there is no options to change them (honestly there are very few options to choose from)\n\nthe asking price is FAR from reasonable when there are games that are ten times more fun and enjoyable than this load of crap at half the price.\n\nI'll say it again, do not buy this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430597427, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430597427, "recommendationid": "15658921", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491249", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484193963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 90, "steamid": "76561198046571606", "num_games_owned": 192}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "epic little game love it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1484194904, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1484194904, "recommendationid": "29196665", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495616", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430506419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 27, "steamid": "76561198005915501", "num_games_owned": 92}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I bought this because I was a fan of the old NES game Blaster Master and this looked like a new version of that.\nFrom what I can tell I personally think it was worth my 5 dollars.\n\nYou get 3 gameplay styles; the side scroller inside the tank, a FPS style inside the tank, and a FPS shooter as a human outside of the tank.\nI didn't get far enough to see if there was any use for the human mode in the 2d side scroller, so that might come in later.\n\nThe controls were easy for me. I used the gamepad which used one joystick for moving, one for aiming, one trigger for jumping, and one trigger for shooting.\n\nThe depth perception in the 3D mode while jumping is a little tricky since you sometimes need to jump up or down and the camera didn't help much with that, so sometimes it was just a jump and hope you land in the right spot.\n\nThe A.I. enemies are very basic, they run straight for you and if they touch you it hurts. The first enemies can only jump, but some enemies can shoot soon after.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the 30 minutes or so I played to test the game out, and I plan to play more in the future to see all the cool upgrades the tank gets, and different guns the human gets.\nFor my money, I'd give this game a 8/10 for price and enjoyment.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430506847, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430506847, "recommendationid": "15641620", "language": "english", "votes_down": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503734", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450725752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 38, "steamid": "76561198109060595", "num_games_owned": 129}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you're suicidal, then this game is the game for you! \nIt takes humanity, and turns it into this....thing.\nWho even is Helena? \nWho was Helena the original and 2nd?\nTHIS GAME GAVE MY SON CANCER!\n\n11/10\nF.UCK! this game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449541281, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449541321, "recommendationid": "19558331", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464577", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1430972233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 29, "steamid": "76561198084077567", "num_games_owned": 379}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "1", "review": "HOLY SH!T .....ITS BLASTER MASTER IN 3D!\nat work and bought it ...play a quick round .....as i said above blaster master, one of the games i loved as a kid on NES.<so what its a copy ...so what if it may not be up to NERD lvl perfect...its FUN!\nWHO EVER MADE THIS THANK YOU!\nAs far as the remapping of gamepad which drives me fucking bannaballs when i see pepole cry about remapping<trust me all the games on my account i use pinicale or Xpadder  and it works fine>...hell even the one they selling now for 3 bucks lol\nthe game is cheap you get what you pay for people are to freaking picky....come on 5 bucks thats x2 redbulls that you drink and piss out and are gone.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430506898, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1430867633, "recommendationid": "15641636", "language": "english", "votes_down": 33, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478607", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444589134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 30, "steamid": "76561198086751130", "num_games_owned": 114}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very fun, would recommend.
