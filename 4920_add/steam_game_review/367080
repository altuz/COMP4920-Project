The dungeons in this game envoke a \"My mother was right1 I never learn!\" with a lot of exploration and puzzles to solve while being suprised  by demon headed ghouls or spiders; it's all wonderful. \n\nThe art style of this game is beautiful and perfect marriage with the dope soundtrack. I really enjoy the protagonist and his sidekick, to my suprise. I was expecting to really dislike the tophat - thinking it would be too goofy, but I LOVE it. The NANOSWORD is so freakin' cool. \n\nI find this to be a work of art through and through and look forward to failing at dungeons until I do it right. I wasn't one who was too crazy over Zelda(besides Majora's Mask and only because of the MASKS), but this game appeals to me. It has a great groove to the gameplay. I suggest throwing down and suggesting the Wu, the developer, for crafting such a good game. \n\nALL IN: Get this game if you want to sink a few minutes or a few hours into a run, if you like visual delights with a psychdelic sci fi space groove track to them.

There are good ideas here, but the inspiration is too obvious and the execution is poor.\n\n\nMy biggest gripe with this game is the combat. You have a sword and the ability to teleport over short distances. It is so similar to Hyper Light Drifter that comparisons are inevitable. Where Hyper Light Drifter is tight and controlled, Songbringer feels loose and sloppy. Instead of having interesting and challenging enemy designs, Songbringer makes up for it in sheer numbers of enemies. This results in button mashing working just as well as any attempt at skill.\n\nAnother questionable element is the demand that the game puts on you to figure things out. There is a surprisingly large number of interesting things hidden beneath the surface, but they are hidden to the extent that you are likely to miss them. I am sorry to say this, but the core game is not good enough to inspire that level of commitment.\n\nThe strongest element in the game is the almost psychedelic quality. Your character can eat cactus to regain health and have visions that will help you along the way. As with the combat, this is another element that draws inevitable comparison to other titles. In this case, the obvious inspiration is Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery. That game did the exact same thing and did it much better.\n\nAll in all this game feels like a fan mashup without too much depth to it. The game borrows way too heavily from Hyper Light Drifter and Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery and combines it with an overworld and dungeons from NES/SNES-era Zelda. The result is not very good. If you like the aforementioned games, you are better off playing them instead of Songbringer. In its current state and at the current asking price, this game is not worth it.\n\nIt is worth noting that the developer seems to be actively listening to his audience and improvements and tweaks are said to be coming. I respect the effort and wish the developer all success in the future. This game is not for me, but it might be for you.

Important to note is that this is most directly influenced by the original NES game, and not say, A Link to the Past or any of the 3D ones. You are given little in the way of instruction and essentially just nudged in some directions. There are dungeons that must be found, items to be plundered from them, paths that the items open up in the overworld, (slight mechanical spoilers if you want to figure everything out on your own): [spoiler] bushes to be burned, and waterfalls to be snuck behind. \t[/spoiler]\n\nCombat is fairly basic, mostly just sword swinging and hat throwing (it's a boomerang but more eccentric), but it feels good and hits have a good weight to them. Button mashing will get you killed fairly quickly, though dungeons are small enough and you keep any items or keys you've picked up within them so you can make a break through a hard room if you must. \n\nThe gimmick of the world shuffling itself based on your word seed is neat, though I don't know that you'll really want to play this over and over. Two or three runs should be satisfying. Still, they're solid runs. I'll be interested to see what speedrunners do to this game. \n\nI raise slight issue with the claim that this game has hundreds of items; really, there are 5 elements that you can assign to most of your equipment, so in one run maybe you'll have a sword that shoots lightning and your bombs will spew acid, in the next you might decide to apply the traits to different items, but their utility isn't all that different. I ended up using most items as an overworld key more than a weapon. It's very light Metroidvania in that sense.\n\nMusic is neat and creates a nice atmosphere. Writing is charming enough. \n\nTL;DR: If you like the feeling of exploring an overworld and going through each screen looking for secrets and whaling on enemies with a sword, bombs, and boomerang, this is worth your consideration.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504580298, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504580298, "recommendationid": "34748556", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505404", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506122260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 99, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 904, "steamid": "76561197993866273", "num_games_owned": 160}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Just beat the game for the first time and I was blown away.

Since nearly every other review has said what is good about the game I wont say much.\nIn my opinion the games best feature is the procedural generated world. The interactions between Jib and Roq are defiantly worth a laugh or two. The simplistic art style does look nice and the additional lighting effects really adds to the experience. \nThe music is eerie and odd but it fits the game world. There is defiantly a sense of progression, after each dungeon a new upgrade is unlocked. Some of them are unique, some are normal like a blink ability.\n\nThe game gives the option to play on perma death mode or a normal mode. This is a real nice feature, but I can't even imagine playing on the perma death mode with the problems.\n\nOther reviewers have described the game as having \"heavy\" or \"dark souls like\" combat. But when I hear that, I imagine rewarding, slower paced combat that has impact to it and punishment beyond perma death. There is hardly any punishment for death except for on perma death mode, I don't see this as a problem but I feel that it is not a fair comparison.\nThe biggest problem with the game is the combat (even after the combat update). Generally I replay procedural generated games not because of their story, but because they feel nice to play. This, does not feel nice to play. The sword mechanics are so far out of touch. The combat is slow and methodical. This mainly comes from the hit-boxs. Combat is incredibly frustrating due to many many things. Walking into a new room and taking damage during the transition frames due to having enemy's spawn inside of you. Hitting enemy's that bounce off walls and bounce back into you. Either whiff nearly every swing or take damage trying to be close enough. The hit boxes of bosses are especially bad. This game also has way too much going on during some of the boss fights. I can't describe it as bullet hell since bullet hell games are designed around that core game-play mechanic. There is no indication of the hit boxes on their moves. So if a boss looks like the are attacking the only thing to do is to run and spam dodge for i-frames. Except when it isint.\n\nThis is a game that wants to be both, slow and fast paced. This is because of two \"upgrades\". The blink ability, and a shield that blocks damage after doing nothing, I would say standing still but it takes too long to be usable. The enemy's in the game are all designed to simply run at you, this would be fine if you could do anything to stop them. Some are small and hard to see, starting off slow-then they sped up 10x and hit you before you can react. Others simply run at you with multi-hit moves + collision damage. Sometimes the room you enter has 90 monsters and the door behind you is locked so all you can do is spam attack.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506235401, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506235401, "recommendationid": "35172619", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505103", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504746814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 33, "steamid": "76561198057473202", "num_games_owned": 541}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "5", "review": "Songbringer is a good example of a game that had all the right ideas but failed on execution.
