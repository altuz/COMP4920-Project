I'd had my eye on it for a few months and decided to pick it up when it was on sale. Holy crap I fell in love with it the first time I played it. A post-apocalyptic setting with tons of room to explore. I like the art, I like the sound design and I like the story. At first I was put off by the combat mechanics, but I adjusted pretty quickly. Money seems like it's hard to make at first but once you get rolling, you end up not hurting for it anymore. I honestly could have played 10+ more hours in this game and I still wouldn't be tired of it. It also doesn't hold your hand which I really appreciate. This is one of my favorite games that I have played in the past two years. I'd definitely play a sequel.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497963718, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497963718, "recommendationid": "32591662", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520572", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498521461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 33, "steamid": "76561197993928746", "num_games_owned": 848}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "2", "review": "As others have mentioned, the game plays in a small window with a fixed resolution. So those of us with high resolution screens get stuck staring at a tiny window when we want to play this game. This becomes problematic in a number of places, the first being a door handle in the beginning of the game as you end up slowly searching for what seems like the single pixel that can be interacted with when you need to open it.\n\nI only spent maybe 30 minutes with the game as I attempted to play it in that tiny window before I requested a refund.\n\nOther issues I encountered:\n\nWhat seemed like a bug where I wasn't given an item as a quest reward. The lack of this item made combat extremely difficult.\n\nCombat uses one of those click twice and land on the sweet spot in order to hit the enemy (you can see this bar in some of the screen captures). Due to the tiny window, this  was somewhat annoying since it was hard to see the moving bar.\n\nAs already mentioned, some of the clickable objects seem to have single pixel detection boxes. This seems to be a bug, since other objects that are exactly the same have much larger detection boxes. If this was encountered in the first area of the game, I can only assume this type of issue will be more common further in the game. \n\nSince it has been over a year since this game was last updated, I can only assume the resolution issue will never be fixed.\n\nThe game has an interesting concept, but it's held back by too many early on issues for me to attempt to get past the annoyances. If the Dev comes back and revamps these issues I would be willing to check the game out right now, but until then it seems like an interesting idea that was poorly implemented.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498561408, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498561408, "recommendationid": "32850804", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484848", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498190675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 58, "steamid": "76561198110058844", "num_games_owned": 21}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I like everything about that game... besides the combat. the main focus of the combat is trying to get the moving line-thing to be in the middle, and it gets extremely tedious when there is a one-second delay when you click it.
