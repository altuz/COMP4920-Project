You can tell there was a lot of love put into making this game. \n/ The voice acting is, with a few exceptions, pretty nicely done. There was only one character whose voice I found annoying or whose voice acting done in a cheesy manner.\n/ The art is good, only had one instance where it seemed noticeably bad but there was nothing extraordinary either.\n/ The dialogue is nicely written, there are hardly any mistakes throughout the game and the characters talk realistically, as humans would. Well, as realistic as it can get for a game of this sort which is bound to have at least somewhat stereotypical and quite flat characters.\n/ There are a bunch of endings, a few of which are very similar but over-all, the game's story gets really complex on some routes and not so much on others. Some endings are sorta unexpected. I don't see that as a bad thing, as I'd firstly completed some of the shorter routes, unknowingly, to later discover how much more there was to the story. All in all, when you fit the pieces, there aren't really any plot holes or discordances and the story all ties in really neatly.\n/ The bloopers are cute af.\n/ The character you play isn't a dislikeable cunt.\n/ At first the story is slightly ridiculous and random but it gets a more mature vibe as you play and I'd say it managed to make me take it seriously for at least two playthroughs.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486219578, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486219578, "recommendationid": "29694725", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506519", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503259704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6112, "steamid": "76561198239065514", "num_games_owned": 57}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This didn't like at first, but as I play more of it.

When I saw it was free in the store I mostly got it because I was board.Though with that in mind I was not disappointed. There were some things i did not like about it because some endings felt really similar, but others blew me away with how in depth they went. I thoughly enjoyed this story and found it really interesting I can not wait to get the sequel and I hope it is just as good or hopefully better. I felt the artstyle really worked for this game. I would like to give this game a 9.5/10 rating because of the stuff mentioned here but don't go by my rating just try the game because its free to play.", "received_for_free": false,
