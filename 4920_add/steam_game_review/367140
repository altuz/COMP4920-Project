Has a variety of distinct characters for some replay value, all conveniently labeled on a \"for beginners/for experts\" scale if you're worried. The art's a little bit curious, but there are definitely times where it works to the game's advantage. I also give it points for the variety of tips and challenges it adds and unlocks for you as you play. Highly recommended!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499681578, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499681578, "recommendationid": "33427160", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419087", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 24, "total_reviews": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
