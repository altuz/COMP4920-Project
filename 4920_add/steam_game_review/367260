The core gameplay is very fun and has a lot of potential. However, it is not without flaws and definately is not ready for prime time yet.\n\nIssues in no particular order:\n* Many of the melee weapons seems to have an excessively long cool down. I'm assuming this is to discourage spamming  but it's unnatural to see the dwarf hold the end of its swinging animation for a few seconds after attacking, and makes it hard to do anything at all during that time. \n* The menu, while cool in theory, simply isn't good. It's hard to navigate through all of the game types and is not intuitive. It should not need a block of text at the bottom that explains how to get around. I suggest putting the game types in a list and having things like the settings menu accessable via a selectable button. \n* Speaking of settings, relying on the Unity launcher is a big no-no. It looks unprofessional and can't be used with a controller. While it's acceptible for a game that's still in development, it needs to go before the final release. All of those options (graphics settings including resolution, fullscreen/windowed/borderless windowed, vsync, etc. and key mappings) should be in the in-game settings menu. \n* Speaking of key bindings, the controller mappings should probably default to the Xbox 360/One controller layout as that is the most common layout on PC. Also, a game that is ideally played with controllers should be FULLY controller compatible. This means (again) no Unity launcher but also a binding for the Esc key's functionality, which currently cannot be rebound and requires me to get off the couch and go to my keyboard in order to, say, exit the game. \n\nI know listing a bunch of issues makes my review sound like the game is bad. Actually, it is the opposite. The core gamyplay is, again, very fun. That being said, it is an early access game and I bought this game with the intent of providing feedback to improve it while it is in early access.\n\nBottom line: The core gameplay is very fun. Invite some friends over and enjoy playing it like other local multiplayer games such as Nidhogg, Towerfall, Speedrunners, Gang Beasts, Spelunky HD (in deathmatch mode), and more. Assuming development continues on its current track, this game is worth it, particularly at the current price (USD$5.99).", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1433449281, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433301823, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1433301823, "recommendationid": "16147821", "developer_response": "Hey there, and thanks for the review!\n\nLuckily we read the review just in time, and made some \"last-minute\" adjustments to the update (0.9.9) just pushed out: There is now a global attack cooldown time option that allows tweaking the attack cooldowns globally, ranging from 0.7 (fastest) to 1.0. The default is now set to 0.9 (instead of \"classic\" 1.0), as we agree that the cooldowns were bit too harsh, and the default might be changed to something even lower in the next updates.\n\nAdditionally, the main feature of this update, \"frenzy\" kill reward system that reduces cooldown on each non-team kill, helps with the melee waiting issue as well.\n\n\"Anti-spamming\" was indeed the reason behind many longer cooldowns, but there are now numerous other ways to balance current slow-recharging attacks, and excessive cooldowns are really no longer needed. Playbility annoyances like this are something we want to eliminate altogether, so further cooldown tweaking will follow in the next minor updates.\n\nAbout the menu: In its current form the navigation is somewhat of a relic from the earlier development stages. Since adding more and more game modes, collections, options, and recently stats & help in the menu, it has become extremely bloated and hard to navigate through. High in priority, we'll be remaking the menu system propably in the 0.9.9.2 update, in a couple of weeks. The new one should work like a charm.\n\nThe other issues are something to be fixed as well, but have no ETA yet.\n\nCheers!", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503346", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1434710857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 54, "steamid": "76561198085189433", "num_games_owned": 491}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Dwarven Brawl Bros offers interesting maps, diverse weapons and a range of game modes.\n\nThe current drawback of this game is the menu interface, which is initially somewhat confusing, however this isn't a big deal.\n\nThe game is deceptively simple initially, however  there are loads of game modes and the weapons, combat and maps allow for fun and creative strategy.

The tutorial now displays, above each player, which buttons or meaningful button combinations they have pressed, everyone gets to know their keys even when they don't use them in correct situations. The second thing to help new players (and pretty much everyone) is the new in-game button mapper that allows each controller to be mapped individually by the player using that controller. When mapping the keys, visual recommendations are shown, helping to choose \"optimal\" buttons for each action. Setting the controls before actually playing is now something that shouldn't be confusing anymore, and should actually help players figuring them out.\n\nIt is still true that pressing several buttons at once, like swap + down for picking up a weapon, can be somewhat confusing for \"non-gamers\", but messing around now in the tutorial mode for a minute or two should really clear things up even for complete beginners. As an additional \"newbie\" helper, player numbers are now shown above each player when a new session starts.\n\nThe control tooltips were partly resolved by the aforementioned button-feedback in tutorial, but we also added the remaining \"hold to quit\" message in the menu that now displays a message when the button is held. Not being able to quit the game (without resorting to Escape key) was actually a bug as no gamepad input was read for that action, even though the text guide stated otherwise. This is now finally fixed. :-)\n\nThe menu are still something to be tweaked, possibly getting more attention in the next update. For this update, we added a master volume option for controlling the overall audio level, in addition to the existing music level option. The menu music level was adjusted down, and now has its own option for controlling it as well.\n\nIt's great to hear that things work gameplay-wise!
