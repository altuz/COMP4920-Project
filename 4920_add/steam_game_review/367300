And there's nothing bad about that. \n\nYou start by configuring your ship in three areas:  The hull slot (i.e. your ship's passive quality), \"utility\" slot (which is a deployable non-offensive ability like teleporting or slowing time), and the \"secondary\" slot (which is one of six consumable super weapons).  \n\nWhen the game begins, you're presented with an environment that anybody who has ever played Asteroids will be familiar with.  You're immediately able to fly off in any direction--asteroids and enemies will spawn around you, which you can shoot for points and items--and there's no real \"destination\".  In addition to asteroids and enemies, space is randomly populated with other cosmic objects like black holes, anomalies, higher-density asteroid fields, and nebula clouds.  Whether it's instantly killing you, bringing down your shields, or simply making life harder for you, each of these phenomoena has a tangible impact on the gameplay.  \n\nThere are also random \"events\" that can appear--a stranded civilian needs rescuing, a bounty needs collecting, a piece of lost cargo awaits discovery--that are another way to provide item bonuses to your ship.  The main conceit is that shooting the subjects of these events destroys them; they're the one thing in space that you don't want to vaporize, so look out.\n\nPeriodically a boss will spawn, locking you down to a screen-sized area until one of you is dead.  For the most part, these bosses seem well-designed--none of them are especially easy or tough, and they all play differently enough that you can get a real sense of \"personality\" in each one.  And each time you kill a boss, the universe gets a little more pissed off at you.  \n\nMy only gripes are that the icons for items and power-ups aren't really readable.  This isn't a big deal since you're going to be hoovering up everything you come across, but it would be nice to more easily identify WHAT something does before I race across the screen to grab it.   Similarly, while I understand that Pixel Star is emulating the simple vector-style graphics of games like Asteroids, I still wish there was a greater variety in appearance of enemies.  As it currently stands, most enemies are some variation of vaguely-triangular spaceship, and distinguishing between them isn't the easiest thing to do--especially as things grow chaotic.\n\nBeyond that, Pixel Star is just a humble question of \"how long will you last?\"  You'll fight a growing number of increasingly dangerous enemies, collecting items and power-ups and fighting bosses until you inevitably perish. That is to say. if you're looking for some greater purpose or motivation for blasting asteroids and space monsters, this game's probably going to let you down.  Otherwise, it's a solid distraction--especially when you can get it for about the price of a soda.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460351201, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460351888, "recommendationid": "22352233", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503058", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471637418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 256, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561197970149845", "num_games_owned": 2326}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty simple and limited game.
