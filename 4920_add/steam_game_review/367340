The actual game chapters are going to be released at a later date (hopefully for free), with the first scheduled for May 30, if it isn't delayed. \n\nUPDATE: Chapter One of Fleetcomm has been indefinitely delayed. If you buy this game you will only receive the tutorial missions and the developer has not set a release date for the actual game itself. \n\nKEEP IN MIND THAT YOU ARE PAYING FOR TUTORIAL MISSIONS WITH NO GUARANTEE OF RECEIVING A FULL GAME. \n\nSo what's it like? It's a slightly more \"tactical\" variation on games like geometry wars and asteroids. It has a fairly typical loadout of shmup-like weapons, a shield, a weak laser with infinite ammo, a stronger \"railgun\" with limited ammo, a temporary cloaking mode and a bomb (which doesn't seem to actually do anything). The gameplay mostly consists of trying to fulfill simple mission objectives such as \"destroy all of X\". You'll be given a small ship to navigate around a 2D plane (think asteroids but with freedom of movement) and you'll have to dodge/reflect numerous projectiles and enemy ships, while trying to shoot down as many enemies as you can. \n\nSounds great in theory, so how does it play? Kind of like a steaming pile of garbage. The controls are really awkward. You use the mouse to steer the ship but the mouse buttons aren't utilized at all, requiring you to engage in some pretty awkward fingerwork on the keyboard.  Enemy design consists mostly of amorphous blob like enemies, which gives you the impression that you're fighting amoebas rather than a menacing alien fleet. The game is certainly colorful and your screen will often be filled with flashing green lights and various bright artifacts but you're more likely to get a migraine than enjoyment out of it. \n\nTo be fair, the game is definitely playable and there's a kind of logic to the gameplay, but it's just not fun. Even the original Asteroids feels like a much smoother and more intuitive experience.  I'd also go as far as to say that Asteroid's 4 bit sound effects were a lot better than Fleetcomm's bizarre mixture of hums, drones and blips that make the shooting feel very unsatisfying. Some of the weapons, including your primary gun, don't even make a sound and it's hard to hear the very quiet buzz of exploding enemy units over the deafening dubstep soundtrack. There's just no weight to it at all and you just don't get that feeling of \"mass destruction\" that you should get from playing a shmup. \n\nAs for the deafening dubstep soundtrack? It's as I described. Repetive, distracting, unpleasant, and it consists of one single track that plays over and over again. Just terrible!\n\nI would rate my 30 minutes in Fleetcomm lower than coming down from an ecstasy binge in a really bad nightclub. Really not a very good experience, and nowhere close to a \"complete\" one. This is essentially an early access game without the early access label, and a bad one at that. Don't spend your money on this rubbish.\n\nAnd the worst part of it all? It's the result of 4 years of \"work\" and over $37,000 in public donations. What an absolute joke. \n\nEDIT: ONCE THE PRICE OF THIS GAME INEVITABLY DROPS TO A DOLLAR, IT MIGHT BE WORTH BUYING AS A KUSOGE OR A GAG GIFT, BUT ONLY IF YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE GIVING THE DEVELOPER YOUR POCKET CHANGE.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464075385, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1465260040, "recommendationid": "23177415", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654631", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472965096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 432, "steamid": "76561197998273415", "num_games_owned": 666}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 109, "comment_count": "5", "review": "[h1][b]**6/19 UPDATE**[/b][/h1]\nWelp, the FleetCOMM steam account hasn't logged on in 2 weeks, the fleetCOMM discussion boards have gone from tightly moderated to nothing, many backers never got their keys, the steam trading cards that are promised on the front page still don't drop and chapter 1 still hasn't been released.

There's a game somewhere in here that's playable that I look forward to seeing in the coming months. Squadrons and formations appear to be fully customizable, which may prove to be interesting if the program can handle it.\n\n[b]CONS: [/b]Poorly optimized, it cannot decide if it wants to play at 10fps or 80fps and eats through CPU. No resolution options. Nearly no environmental feedback whatsoever. Program can't execute a proper close without crashing. Interface feels like a clumsy interactive Flash circa 2006, making preview videos misleading, at best. Spammed input can freeze the game up; Not an great asset for a shmup. The tutorial area is a confusing mess-- It introduces concepts slowly, but with absolutely no explanation. Whether you succeed or fail, each mission boots you back to the title screen. Slow, floaty gameplay does not fit the camera-shaking, no-holds-barred style it portrays itself as and is very slow. Balance issues are present in Chapter 0, where you can die within a couple seconds of starting a level, or not take damage for 15 minutes before knowing how to even properly pilot the ship. (If the ship loads. Sometimes it does not, and you are piloting just the directional circle around it.)\n\n[b]WORTH: [/b]It may be worth testing out, but I'd question keeping it even at this massively discounted price. This game had been delayed well over five times with a complete disregard towards dates set, so updates for future missions feel extremely bleak. Whether or not this is true, we will find out on May 30th. But as a consumer, it would be foolish to not have major trust issues with such promises being treated so flippantly before. Hopefully the dates set from here on-out will be abided by.\n\n[b][u]OVERALL:[/u] [/b]I would like to return on May 30th to see what Chapter 1 has to offer, and alter my review to reflect the changes made. I am a big fan of this genre of games and have anticipated this title for a long while. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td][h1]SCORE:[b]2/10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[/b][/h1][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Full Review Coming Soon[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464084174, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468055611, "recommendationid": "23179121", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567363", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464072179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561198022185404", "num_games_owned": 113}, "votes_funny": 87, "votes_up": 165, "comment_count": "5", "review": "Fleetcomm is the most disappointing release since Rogue's dad blew his load into his mother.

From going silent on Kickstarter backers to flood of delays just before its launch, developer apparently had his hands full with something else rather than his Asteroid re-imagination. \n\nBut how bad can it be? UI looks worse than most games stepping out of prototype stage, gameplay itself was rather dull though that might be a matter of preference, aesthetically game was seizure inducing, bright colors, abstract swirly backgrounds almost felt like it was made by a completely baked graphics designer, sound wise it was nothing to write home about and music was lingering somewhere in an okay category.\n\nThe most absurd part about this game, is that majority of it is missing. After going to chapter selection you will be greeted by varied selection of two chapters, Chapter 0, the tutorial and Chapter 1 which is currently unavailable and will be released on May 30th. Now considering reputation of this developer and their history with delays, I wouldn\u2019t put much hope in that date, but perhaps you\u2019re younger than me and still have some snippets of optimism left, good for you.\nFunniest and rather disingenuous part of this entire ordeal is, FleetCOMM released as a full game, yet with this lack of content it should be considered an Early Access title. So after all that gloating that game is released and all the haters (more on that soon) complaining about him being incapable of finishing his game, will choke on it, turned out that he didn\u2019t finish it after all, but hey, at least it\u2019s on Steam, right?\n\nAnd that brings us to another important chapter, the PR mismanagement. After game got delayed several times while already being on Steam, people started asking questions, expressing their dissatisfaction and yes there were occasional troll or two poking fun at a game which release was long overdue.

Not that it matters tho, as the enemys dont care about you and simply float around and ocationally release bombs which are more like triangles. \no and the tactical part of the game? it boils down to being able to select 5 ships and slightly move them around in a \"formation\", which means nothing. \n\nBut the most daming part of the game is not is garbage gameplay, or its high end music (which was made by placing a retarded cat that is tripping balls on a skrillex cd), its the fact that this 2d space game that is more like a D grade software project made by a highschool student runds worse then the witcher 3 on a 1996 computer.

I swear to god this thing gave me a headache on the first tutorial level. Speaking of tutorial levels, that's all there is. 8 tutorial levels. The actual first mission is supposed to release on the 30th of May. Expect delays. \nIn all honesty I can't really call this a review: Most of the tutorial remains unplayed. I'd love to play more but my desire for self preservation keeps getting in the way. \n\nLets go ahead and discuss the pros and cons because fuck it why not\n\nPros: \n-Movement is ok, feels fairly alright considering you're a space ship floating through space\n-the combat doesn't make me want to kill myself, thats what the visuals are for\n-The little logo on the steam page looks pretty cool, I guess\n\nCons:\n-visually, it's a nightmare. bright, flashing lights that induce headaches\n-buggy to the finest degree. (my copy contained a bug where every ship model was invisible, forcing me to hold down the radar button in order to play)\n-the sound, oh god the sound. It still hurts me. When its not blaring poison into your ear it's just generic dubstep\n\nIn its current state, this game is a health hazard.
