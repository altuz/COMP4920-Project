While it's got a uniquish artstyle, the gameplay and controls feel a little bit off.  In particular, you'll feel like you're getting stuck on ledges at times, and some of the jumps do take a level of precision that may be asking for too much. The music is the highlight here as it keeps the high energy gameplay going, and it's definitely a cool fact that the game was developed by one person. seemingly But at the cost of 10 dollars, I can't recommend it because the game just lacks compared to other games like JumpJet Rex for the cost versus return. For those who want a challenge. \n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Great Music Selection, even if some of the music is things that we have heard before in a remixed format.\n[*] They do add a little bit of variety, and the boss battle while still focusing on platforming was nice.\n[*] The retro style does work for some of the pixel work.\n[*] Have to give the developer credit for doing this on his own. \n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The controls feel a little bit off. There's a bit of play at times, and some of the precision. In particular, a lot of times where I felt like the jumps were just too tricky or you seemed to get caught on wall edges a bit. \n[*] Being honest....there's not anything specific that stands out here in the end.\n[*] Certain levels feel like that they don't take advantage of the speedrunner genre. \n[*] Enemy designs could use a bit more design work put into it. \n[/list]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438989940, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438989940, "recommendationid": "17435916", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501459", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481671832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 236, "steamid": "76561198276533464", "num_games_owned": 182}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really a fun and cute little game.
