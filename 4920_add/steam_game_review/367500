Firstly the characater customization is fantastic, as well as the option to customize your own \"Pawn\", which is like your merc/buddy/slave  that can never truly die.\n\nThe level of detail in the gear, and simple/ease of enchanting upgrading gear is nice (minus them moon shimmer pelts -I'm talking to you post Daemon White Saurian Sages! Luckily I have my 4 and am just making forgeries at the npc shop :) ). The amount of weapons, armors, and the enemies, and the combination of jobs/classes and the augments you can use to choose the class that fits your play style.\n\nThe BIGGEST winner for Dragons Dogma is the combat. It puts the craptastic aim and shoot, no skill involved combat of Fallout and Elderscrolls to shame and I mean TO SHAME! You can burn, freeze, blind, dodge roll, shoot, and CLIMB (Yes, you can climb big ass boss monsters or grapple smaller ones) and strike that giant Cyclops in its one eye to do massive damage! Be warned, if not careful he'll grab you and smoosh you, toss you (if you run out of stamina) or in the case of the Gore Cyclops..out right kill you in one shot by eating you.\n\nMy first 30 mins of gameplay...I was like \"meh\" I wasn't impressed...then after sitting down and getting out of the town and actually \"trying\" the game...it opened up and blossomed like a spring flower. \n\nIf you like Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Shadow of the Colossus, and maybe a little of Dark/Demon Souls....or just an action rpg fan in general? GET THE DAMN GAME!!!! Oh, yes, and don't worry about the port, because the game playes like if it was native to PC. Excellent port compared to Dark Souls...ugh, don't even mention that port lol.\n\nAnd Capcom...PLEASE!!!! Where is Dragons Dogma 2?!? I NEED IT IN MY LIFE! \n\nYours Truly,\n\nD.

Upon writing this review, I have spent more than 49 hours in the game. This game is a classic, one that you'll enjoy for a long time. I can see myself spending 100+ hours exploring, fighting and trying to survive in the land of Gransys. TL;DR: JUST DO IT!\n\nPROS:\n- Immersive: This isn't an easy game... but every fight is exciting. There is always a sense of accomplishment once you kill a boss. Leveling up and progressing in the game is also fun since you'll notice how easy it actually is to kill that one boss it once took you a WHILE to kill. \n- Romance Everyone: Every human is romanceable, even some Pawns (i.e. Barnaby).\n- Quests aren't boring: Usually, spamming quest after quest can be dreadful in some RPGs, but not here. The lore is also pretty easy to follow through the quests. You think it's just a simple escort mission? Well, think again! \n- Dynamic: I love the game's animation, the skills, the environment, it's movement is so dynamic that it adds to the whole immersive experience. The voice acting is also superb, it brings life to the some otherwise dull-looking characters! \n- Character customization: Play as M/F. Multiple body types are available, as well as color customization. Sufficient hair options (but i'ts just not enough for me, heh).\n- You are not 'alone': (unless you choose to be). You can hire pawns in your party (up to four members) to help with your adventuring. You can hire pawns online and pawns which are greater than your level. These pawns 'import' experience they've had and give you tips during skirmishes (monster weakness, quest help, etc).\n\nMEH: \n- Generic design: the equipment and monster designs aren't really exceptional, they also lack variety, save for some. The majority of Gransy's environment is pretty boring (I guess I can say the monsters and their habitat complement each other :P). Haven't finished the game yet, but apparently, post-game monster designs add a bit of variety. \n\nCONS:\n- Lack of keybinding options: For PC players, this is a problem. You can't access the quests, maps and equipment directly.
