Everything about this game is fantastic, and it's definitely better than the titles I chose to play instead of it.\n\nYou start out your journey learning basic controls and how not to die, then the game sends you off in ten different directions to explore at your leisure. There is no hand-holding to be found here. At first, it can be overwhelming, not knowing where anything is or what you're supposed to do next, but that's part of the appeal. Eventually, your explorations are rewarded when the game grants you a map and a way to record new areas you've explored to your continually growing map.\n\nThe controls are very tight, and, for a platforming game, that is critical. I've never encountered a single bug (other than the ones in the game, of course), so this game, from my experience, is very polished. The combat system is great; you eventually can grow your abilities in several different ways and use charms to choose how you want to play. Bosses and mini-bosses are initially tough, but they have patterns that, once you learn them, they don't seem so difficult anymore, which will help out if you ever want to go back and do speed runs or perma-death runs. And they're all unique, so fighting bosses will only ever fill you with anticipation for a great fight.\n\nThe art is incredible, the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful, the story is emotional and backlit with tons of hidden lore, and the characters strewn across the world are diverse and lovable (even Zote; he's pathetically adorable). There are little details everywhere that only add to your journey: running through grassy areas and scattering leaves in your rustling wake; using an ability to blast yourself in a horizontal line through the map and barely skimming the water; and attacking a crystalline enemy and chipping little fragments off of it with every nail swing. My descriptions don't do any of it justice; you'll have to experience it for yourself, which I highly recommend you do, if you have ever considered getting this game and have not yet. There is an immersive world waiting for you.\n\nAlso, this game recently just came out, and it already has one free expansion, with another one on its way this Halloween and another one planned after that. I can't say I've seen a devoted developer quite like Team Cherry. They're really pushing out polished content... and for [b]FREE[/b]. You don't have to pay more after you've already bought the base game! Who does that? Seriously. It's amazing.\n\n10/10 if you like platformers, enjoy a challenge, or appreciate fine art.

What makes a game a defining work within its genre(s)? These things are subjective, but I can surely say that Hollow Knight made me ask these questions so that I might give it such labels. It is a game that nails (pun intended) the quintessential aspects of what a souls-like, a metroidvania, a platformer, an RPG should be. \n\nThe story is mysterious and elusive, told not only through cryptic dialogue, but by the beautifully drawn world surrounding our, though tiny, intrepid protagonist. Mute in the vein of Links and Samuses, he wanders through the sprawling Hollownest, a character in its own right, driven to complete an unspoken mission with no purpose given. Who are you in a world neither lost or forgotten but twisted to ruin?\n\nI can't even begin to coherently present why this game may be one of greatest of my time. I can only hope that a few words and my 37 hours of play-time may convince you to give yourself the opportunity to experience what this game has to offer. Even if you end up hating it, I'd rather you gave it a shot than miss a work of art. That doesn't do it justice. Team Cherry painted their Mona Lisa on the first canvas. I can't overstate enough how profound this game was for me.\n\nPros:\n\n- The controls are tight and responsive. When you press buttons, the character reacts. The protagonist isn't floaty and input is responsive.\n\n- The art is gorgeous. Every single asset is hand drawn and animated, reminiscent of Skull Girls. Even if you don't like the art you have to appreciate the skill and beauty of what was done here.\n\n- The soundtrack is appropriately melancholy as you explore the derelict depths of Hollownest. The boss music is intense and adds character where it should. \n\n- The story, while vague, is presented wonderfully as I've stated above. You will be left with questions at the end of the game, but they are intended. What better excuse to explore the world more and decipher answers?\n\n- The progression is solid. You collect abilities and powers via metroidvania exploration, and you buy upgrades and other abilities via a souls-like currency system.\n\n- The difficulty can be challenging. I like to believe, for the majority of the game, not overwhelmingly so. It seems enough so that I always feel like my mechanics are being pushed. This is something I hope anyone playing metroidvania or souls-likes is looking for.\n\nCons:\n\n- Due to the game's cryptic and vague nature, figuring out what to do and how to do it can be challenging at times. Beyond what may be desirable. It may get to the point that you find yourself looking something up online or backtracking unnecessarily. I'm listing it as a soft-con.\n\n- Out of the two faults I have with this game, this one would be the dealbreaker for some people. There is a STEEP difficulty spike towards the end of the game. Some of the bosses will make you want to rip your hair out, but even those are a common staple of souls-likes and pale in comparison to my main qualm. There is a REQUIRED platforming section nearing the game's conclusion that unlocks the path for the \"true\" endings. This platforming section is of the lowest circles of hell. Super Meat Boy is the only comparison I can give. Be prepared for that torture when the time comes. If it wasn't that bad, I wouldn't put it in a review.\n\nPRO TIP (NO REAL SPOILERS): There are ONLY 3 endings. 1 you get from following the standard path, and the other 2 hinge around a pivotal decision at the end of the final boss. You HAVE to complete the platforming section I mentioned above to have access to that pivotal decision. There is a 4th bonus \"ending\" scene that requires a chain of NPC interactions through the game. I'm putting this here, so you don't sweat yourself too much worrying if you missed something or screwed something up. SLIGHT CRYPTIC SPOILER MESSAGE THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED ME AT THE END: [spoiler] When the wasp reigns in the brother, stay thy nail and peer into those radiant dreams that haunt him. [/spoiler]\n\nIf you consider yourself a fan of metroidvanias or souls-likes, you owe it to yourself to give this game a shot. That's really all I can say. The ratings tell the same story, but this is my personal invitation to you to try it. Even if you end up disliking it, it was worth finding out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504619165, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504619165, "recommendationid": "34756834", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505354624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2776, "steamid": "76561197995319188", "num_games_owned": 464}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "My personal game of the year.

A stagerring achievement by just two people, it excels in all areas: the design is beautiful, the atmosphere gripping, the characters wonderfully written, the music evocative and the gameplay smooth, responsive and spiced with just the right amount of difficulty. All this combined with the fact that the developers are asking for much less than this game is worth makes Hollow Knight must for fans of the genre and curious gamers alike.[/i]\n\n[b]A Dream in Violet[/b]\n\nI will start this review with the most obviously praisworthy aspect of the game, that you'll notice right when you click that little play-button on your Steam-interface: while not being too technically impressive, the hand-drawn art is one of a kind. The areas all have a distinctly different, yet wonderful Gothic-atmosphere that conjures a world full of mystery, secrets, decay and yet - beauty. Special effects are used sparingly, which actually contributes to the full hand-drawn artstyle the developers were going for, and don't distract from the amazingly animated sprites and detailed backgrounds. The leitmotiv of the game is dreaming - and this games looks like a dream. It sounds like one as well; the score ranges from fail piano-melodies to impressive orchestral efforts, but always looms in the background, never taking away too much attention from the gameplay and art. \n\n[b]Smooth as Velvet[/b]\n\nWhereas immersive atmosphere, unique art and recognizable scores are certainly important for Metroidvanias, they are wasted on bad gameplay. Luckily, Hollow Knight excels also in this area; moving feels as smooth as in titles such as Symphony of the Night and much better than in - say - Super Metroid, and the jumping was even more precise than in the aforemented titles. In fact, the controls were so easily picked up and the feeling that my protagonist was doing exactly what I wanted without any delay was so present, that I will continue to measure every sidescroller against Hollow Knight in this regard. Over the course of the game, you will learn new abilities, for example the classic double-jump, that control just as good - nothing as nail-bitingly stupid such as Super Metroid's walljump.\n\nOnly the combat can take some time to get used to - after you hit something, you will experience a little backslash on your part, and if you are hit, the screen freezes for half a second. This contributes to the tactical nature of the game however, akin to Dark Souls - everything goes a little slower than in comparable games, tactical positioning and the enemies' movesets become more important because you can essentially stunlock nothing, while you cannot drown in a flurry of blows either. Every enemy has a pattern that wants to be learned, making the progression just as much a matter of the player's skill and experience than of his/her equipment. \n\n[b]Sadly Uniform[/b]\n\nThe only real gripe I have with the gameplay is how little you can customize your character. Granted, different charms change your character's abilites considerably, and the fact that you can only equip a limited amount of those power-ups gives you a lot think about, how you should approach one of the really difficult bossfights, or if you really need faster healing in a fast-paced platformer section. Still, you essentially have one weapon - your Nail, some kind of longsword - three different spells, three different special attacks and that's it. And the power-ups are not game-changing as well, just a little more reach, or easier money-collection or some temporary hitpoints. You get the idea. It's not a gamebreaker, by any means. Just something I've sadly missed over the course of my 50 hours in Hallownest.\n\n[b]A Loveletter to Immersion[/b]\n\nTo get the bad taste of petty nitpicking out of my mouth, I choose to continue this revew with the aspect that impressed me personally so much more than the near-perfect gameplay or the beautiful art: it's how much soul, how much passion was injected into this game. It truly is a consistent vision from beginning to end. To map the chart, you have to buy a map from a wanderer, which is crudely drawn and almost unusuable at first. Then, when you also pick up a quill, your character will start to scribble onto said map while being at a checkpoint, and update it with your latest findings. Many things, from small secrets, NPCs or upgrades up to entire, gigantic levels are just hidden away for people that explore the world really thoroughly. There is also a larger secret, aking to Castlevania's inverted castle, whose prequisites are not too esoteric, but highly missable for people that do not pay enough attention to the plot and the surroundings. \n\nDetails like that make Hallow Knight such a standout title. It is daring, yet every little detail is precicely thought out, taking one page or two from games such as Dark Souls or Deus Ex, titles that have one consistent vision which influenced every single decision in the process of making the game.
