Not exactly cutting edge but it achieves what it sets out to do. I'm going to assume people reading this review have some sort of understanding of the sport. \n\nPros:\n- The match engine does a very good job of simulating how attacking sets would work. Early in the set your forwards create a 'platform' by how well they get up the field, The better your 'platform' the more successful your back moves will be. This is a simple and easy to understand method of simulating attacking sets.\n- Has a good level of tactical control, allowing you to choose what plays to use in which sets and control how much freedom your playmakers can have when attacking. You can choose to let your team play a very simple structure with your playmakers having very little say, or incorporate more complex moves with your playmakers having more freedom.\n- The team calls give you a stronger control of the game i.e. one such is Engineroom Overdrive, which for a set or so, once per game, makes your forwards much more potent and create a much better platform.\n- Staff management and training is also fun, allowing you to retrain players to different positions.\n- The transfer market is fun, if not overpowered, other teams do not partake in mid-season transfers between themselves, only from players you have personally transfer listed in your own side. Ignoring the transfer market and only signing players whose contracts come to an end is a much more challenging and rewarding experience, this also forces you to cap manage. \n- In game A.I. is pretty good, each team has unique attacking and defensive structures.\n\nCons: \n- A little buggy, major one is when a scrum happens with your starting hooker off, the ball gets constantly passed to them. \n- Players attributes do not change from season to season, defeats the purpose of signing young players. Player developement is also strange, the games forces the few players that can increase in calibre to stay in your academy (reserves) until they reach their max calibre, even if they are good enough to be in your first team.\n- The player 'calibre' system is strange, occasions occur that despite two players having similar attributes, the player that is 'professional' calibre will still be much stronger than the 'semi-pro' one.\n- Attributes are more centered to positions than players, resulting in, for example, James Roberts having a speed of 63/100 because he's a centre, despite being arguably the fasted guy in Rugby league. I understand that this may be required to make the match engine work though.\n\nA really good start to what can hopefully be a strong long term franchise, really fun and I'm still not bored of it. If you love rugby league you'll adore this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499931053, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499931053, "recommendationid": "33497440", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 24, "total_reviews": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 13}}
