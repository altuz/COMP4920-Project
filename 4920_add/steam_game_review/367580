The goal is to clear each level by removing all the lines. The lines intertwine and are hooked into each other. You need to look for lines that are clear to be removed, and then determine the right way to use the game's mechanics in order to pull those lines away from the rest. Each time you 'pull', you have to make sure you don't pull at a line that's stuck and can't be removed yet, because that means you have to restart the level. In the game's later levels, you get three strikes before you're out, so you're allowed to make up to three mistakes before you need to restart the level.\n\nThe game has 50 levels. The problem with [i]Hook[/i] is that at least half of those levels are 'tutorial', teaching the player the different mechanics they need to know to solve the later, more difficult levels. So [i]Hook[/i] has a very, very mild learning curve and I'm sure that will test some players' patience.\n\nEven though they offer no challenge whatsoever, clicking through the first 25 to 35 levels  does pay off in the end, when you're finally offered challenging levels where you need to put everything you learned into practice. You'll know when 'the real game begins' when you see three dots appear on the screen, representing the mistakes you're allowed to make before the level resets.\n\nConsidering you only get 15 or 20 'real' puzzles after a very slow build-up, [i]Hook[/i] is still worth playing because those last few puzzles are fun to solve and the full price of the game is only 99 cents, so you can often buy it for even less.\n\nA few more short facts about [i]Hook[/i]:\n[list]\n[*] The game's background music is soft and atmospheric, almost relaxing even. \n[*] The interface is as simplistic as the game itself: you can scroll through the puzzles you already solved and that's it. There's no game menu, you need to close the program by pressing Esc.\n[*] [i]Hook[/i] has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get three while running the game.\n[*] The game only has one Steam Achievement that's awarded for completing the 50th puzzle, in other words for completing the game.\n[/list]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504977040, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504977040, "recommendationid": "34842149", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520435", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505065665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 164, "steamid": "76561198258120188", "num_games_owned": 439}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nice game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505065729, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505065729, "recommendationid": "34867562", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505462566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 99, "steamid": "76561198080677874", "num_games_owned": 1054}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Simple Perfection...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505462606, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505462606, "recommendationid": "34966618", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499709", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505473801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 339, "steamid": "76561198399895281", "num_games_owned": 27}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nice puzzle game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505179978, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505179978, "recommendationid": "34893294", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494652", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504753441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 81, "steamid": "76561198353011116", "num_games_owned": 110}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This puzzle game develops and becomes more difficult at just the right speed.

Pretty much a bummer as the puzzles themselves are enjoyable.\n\nIf you love puzzles then I would suggest it, for the experience.
