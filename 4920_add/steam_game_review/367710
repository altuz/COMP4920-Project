Forever, probably.\n\n- Boring gameplay: wait for an exorcist, scare him away, repeat. Wait for the cops, then scare them away too. Essentially, its all about dragging the map around and clicking one single button. From time to time you'll gather enough \"scare energy\" to place down some posessed barrels, vases or dust filled bags which scare civilians automagically, with a lower fear yeild, but that's all. I think authors could have done much more with this idea, but they didnt, for some reason. \n\n- Buggsy. Interface randomly became unresponsive, dialog boxes with randomly cropped text or no text at all.\n\nResume: probably do not worth neither time, nor money :(", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492301912, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492301912, "recommendationid": "31167520", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505574", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 33, "total_reviews": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 25}}
