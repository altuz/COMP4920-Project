Quest items to pick up are particularly guilty of this: some of them will eventually be picked up after one or two crashes, but some never do, and one of them might just make you unable to do anything else than grinding while waiting for a fix.\n\nThe main problem with that, is that you will be playing for more than 2 hours before running into a brick wall, at which point Steam will not refund you even though the full game is basically not playable.\n\nA very great game that I had the chance to enjoy through a third party software as its mobile version, but saying that the game is FINISHED is a joke. I don't own a tablet/smartphone and I was very happy to support the developer when it was finally released on PC, but it's been released here 5 months ago and even basic functions aren't working properly (I crashed during the tutorial battle, for example) despite the fact that the devs announced 1 or 2 months to polish it up.\n\nGood game. In theory. It had better be completely bug-free after Early Access if they plan to push the price up once it is done.
