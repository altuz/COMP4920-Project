I played the game offline for a couple days (Hurricane Irma) so my hours do not reflect playtime.\n\nIn short, this game feels like an open-world Call of Duty with elements of sniper Elite.  A more forgiving far cry.\n\nI loved Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, which in my opinion felt alot like DICE games from the same era. (Battlefield 2: Bad Company)  The missions in this game have much the same feeling, (at this point There has only been one \"guardian angel\" mission, which I loved.\n\nThis time CI has framed their game in a Gorgeous detailed open world, rife with side objectives.  Cryengine produces such beautiful environments.  You can blow through the story missions or put time into the side missions and optional objectives.  I found a completionist take to be very rewarding.  The setting is stunning, woods and mountains, and I explored it in depth.\n\nI have heard crticisms of the story.  Sigh.  It's an action game...  The writing doesn't need to break any new ground.  This game has what it needs to move the adventure.  Brotherhood.  Betrayal.  Vengence. Retribution....  (More to come, will update.)\n\nAudio is good.  Voice acting good.  \n\nOver all, the game has a few bugs, but feels AAA.  Hats off to CI.  \n\nI got the season pass edition of this game, a couple months after release, for about $20.  I find this to be more than fair in a market that thinks a gamer should drop a minimum of $100 for similar content in the first few months after release.  Bravo CI.\n\nElements.\n\nThe gunplay.\n\nSniping is the main event here, refined and exhilarating.  (I lean heavily toward it.  I have 13 skill points over what I can apply to the tree) Bullet cam is well done, if it gets too repetive, you can shut it off.  I don't.\nSecondary weapons are useful, varied and upgradeable.  You can engage in COD like gunplay, but you do not get nearly the sort of forgiving health setup.  Bring your A game. \nSidearms are good in a pinch, stealth headshots are their specialty.\n\nStealth.\n\nVital here.  You can crouch and go prone.  Sound is a factor.  Stealth kills are quick and brutal.  Throwing knife is useful.  In my opinion, stealth is well done and not to be negelcted.\n\nMobility.\n\nJon has a nearly Ezio-esque ability to climb and jump.  CI gives you plenty of opportunities to use them.  \"Extreme navigation\" can lead to rewards or help with objective infiltration.  A great addition to the game.\n\nThe drone.\n\nI love this damn thing.  As a recon tool it makes far more sense than the \"tower\" trope or the balloons from mad max.  Also doesn't serve the same purpose.  Local goals only....  If you want to know what is in the world Map, go explore it.  The side objectives give you plenty to do.  Unlike many open world games, there are no pointless collectibles.  Weapon unlocks and supplies aacompany almost every \"point of interest\".\n\nThe music is great.  My fiance, who hates video games in general commented on the sweet music.  (Which shares roots with the Witcher 3 soundtrack)\n\nIf you see this on sale, i don't think you'll regret going for it.\n\nPS- get the DLC.  Especially the car/rifle.  For a couple bucks, they are worth it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505238987, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505318382, "recommendationid": "34905727", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505926", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505800634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1928, "steamid": "76561198040257934", "num_games_owned": 379}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Yo Ho\n\nI have to recommend this game. The shooting weather it be sniping or getting in close CQB style is fun and satisfying. The game like many other CI games does not do story well and I am ok with that as its the mechanics of the game play that I enjoy. This is akin to taking down bases in the Farcry games, you have the freedom to approach how you would like. I have to recommend playing it on the normal/hard difficulties if sniping is what you aim to do, as the easiest pre-set gives you a bullet drop pointer (making it good for casual players). I have not encountered any major issues with this game in a technical sense, however on my laptop (low end specs) It does have some draw distance pop ins ect, and a few texture issues at times. There are a few sloppy spots in the map ect, but all open world games have these issues somewhere. I have noticed with CI games there are more than the AAA games, but I have not encountered a game breaking bug as yet.\n\nSome of the pluses, the enemy will man mortars and fire on your last known location, mines are set up in the obvious sniper spots around the map (there are camp/sniper spots set up, but you don\u2019t have to use them). And there are enemy snipers counter sniping you in different locations. The drone is handy, but if you want to make it a bit tougher don\u2019t use it and recon on foot. The skill points also can be used or you could leave them unassigned, up to you. There is a good amount of customisation for your weapons, skins as well as larger mag's, lots of scopes, silences, different bullet types for the sniper rifles. And for those that like them bow's, a re-curve and a compound. And the old bullet impact clip when you pull off a head shot, that's always fun, similar to the Sniper Elite games, CI has been using this for a while themselves. \n\nThe bad, the story (predictable), and some of the sloppy parts in the map, for eg. rocks floating or logs ect.\n\nSo if your still not sure grab it in future on a sale.\n\nAris", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504831376, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504846899, "recommendationid": "34805383", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504657", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504870008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 552, "steamid": "76561197997821027", "num_games_owned": 271}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Man, this is the best Far Cry game yet!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504786878, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504786878, "recommendationid": "34793289", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505998", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505513153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3736, "steamid": "76561197970584372", "num_games_owned": 900}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Have played it (and both DLC).
