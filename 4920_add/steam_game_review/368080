So at first I thought it was going to be a simple, exiled royals gather forces to get their kingdom back storyline. But to my surprise, the game is highly philosophical, even the powers and the mixes of powers are based on traits and philosophical approaches to governance and leadership. The plots in each zone examine political approaches to different scenarios and how systems are not perfect. The magic of the world is explained perfectly and even the antagonists both major and minor allow you to understand their personal philosophies as it ties into their powers.\nThe biggest questions in the game deal with history, prejudice, politics and how to have oneself on the political stage, that and magical African anime powers. What surprised me and I found refreshing, is that you never ever get to fight the most powerful antagonists because they are just too strong, both physically and politically, there is no overthrowing the system, there is only, making sure you survive the system. Most anime and game tropes have you becoming strong enough in a short period to beat a foe that has decades ahead of you in training and put more work into it than you, not this game. And because of that, it feels like a more real world. I plan to replay to see if there was more that i missed and take my time.\nOne of my favourite aspects is the marriage and personal growth system in the game. Since the MCs are a married couple, their powers only get stronger as their relationship grows and improves. The husband and wife both undergo massive character development and work through rocky times together to prevent them from being one dimensional, they have different ideas, strengths and opinions and they don't always agree. They fall out, but they pull each other up. Its subtle but it shows that marriage, like the political systems and philosophies the game weaves into its world, is not perfect, but it is always something to be worked on. I thank the studio for making not only a purely African game, but a great one that made me think and actually want to replay an RPG.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505440493, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505440493, "recommendationid": "34961833", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499498", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 31, "total_reviews": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
