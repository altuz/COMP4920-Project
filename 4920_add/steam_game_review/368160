Just, keep vol. 03 on hand when you read this volume; you'll want to start it about five seconds after you finish this one.\n\n(No spoilers review)\n\nIt's World End Economica's second volume, with more jargon, more characters, more feels, and more of everything else you loved from part one. And better, mostly.\n\n[b]Graphics: 7/10[/b]\n\nIt's an improvement of most things from part one, and graphics aren't an exception; character sprites are more varied, backgrounds are nicer and fit better with the rest of the art, and CGs are much better; the final CG itself is a work of art. Same as part one, however, the CG gallery isn't unlocked until you finish the VN.\n\n[b]Sound: 6/10[/b]\n\nAlso a marked improvement over the first part; still no voice acting, and the music is rather forgettable, but it's no longer irritating and does its work well.\n\n[b]Story: 10/10[/b]\n\nIn many regards, this is also an improvement over the first volume; it's darker and shows a much more marked character growth for the protagonist and people around him. It's slow at the start, taking time to rebuild its setting after the timeskip, but once it gets going it's just as gripping and emotional as the earlier volume, all the way up to its grand conclusion.\n\nSadly, one area where it's actually worse is in its use of economics jargon; as befitting a second part, it touches more complex concepts of finance throughout the plot, such as options trading, but actually manages to explain them [i]less[/i] than part one, to the point I'd recommend to keep Wikipedia handy if you haven't studied the field before even in passing. Another possible point of contention is the change in romanization of character names, which took me some time to get used to; part three uses a mix of one and two, so at least the series is consistent in its inconsistency.\n\nOne warning, though: unlike part one, you [i]will[/i] need to read part three as soon as you finish with this one.\n\n[b]Longevity: 6/10[/b]\n\nAs the first part, it's a kinetic novel with no choices whatsoever. Took me around 6 hours to read it all, but I can't say whether it took me longer than the first because it's longer, or because of its jargon; I did have a bit of trouble following it at times.\n\nReplay value is just as with part one: pretty high for a kinetic VN due to foreshadowing of later events, as well as the jargon used throughout.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nMuch like part one, this is a wonderful VN that will toy with your feelings over and over again, all while teaching you about the world of finance in a realistic way, even if it's set on the moon. However, if by some reason you can't purchase the third volume, I'd skip this one until you can read all three; it'd be sheer torture otherwise.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493006385, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493006385, "recommendationid": "31333008", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493504196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 935, "steamid": "76561198257916498", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is the second installment of world end economica and you should check out the first one if you haven't in this part hal further grow out and taking back what he has lost in the two years before the money and the memory that confidence.
