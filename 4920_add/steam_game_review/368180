This early access has so much to do when you get down the physics and mechanics of how you roll around. Wehn I started I thought I was going to get another Super Monkey Ball, but it's not that at all. The platforming works very nicely and you'll want to master it. The amount of freedom you have to complete the courses is so fun to try and get your best time possible by taking untraditional turns and routes. Overall super satisfied with this game can't wait for more content to come.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502072139, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502072139, "recommendationid": "34073039", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500343", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 35, "total_reviews": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
