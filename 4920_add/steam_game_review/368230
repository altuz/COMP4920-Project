This game can be very frustrating and is basically designed for you to get overwhelmed and have to start over. The minimalist approach is a bit of a gimmick and I couldn't help but feel like this game could have been so much more. Kinda disappointing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504983509, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504983509, "recommendationid": "34844330", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498062", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1875, "total_reviews": 2216, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 341}}
