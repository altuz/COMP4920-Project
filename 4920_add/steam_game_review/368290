Why not start from the beginning, well of course. Months ago I remember the creator working on some small project, all it was to begin, probably, can't fully remember. But he offered to me the alpha, so I graciously accepted the offer, and boy was I surprised about the depth of the game, there's so much more than just a simple indie game, and it does come across as very enjoyable.\n\nLet's get this pajama party of a review started with an insight into the game itself, then we can work further into it as this progresses. Now at first glance, you may look down on the blocky graphics that could run on a SNES, and the same lighting as a collapsed mine, but looks can be deceiving and in this case their scant nature is what builds the game. It is the deep pitch-dark view you are presented with that draws you in, \u201cwhat's this\u201d, you think as you remember the controls, \u201cah yes, all I need to do is add my own light\u201d, begging the question of 'how many rectangles does it take to change a lightbulb?' \n\nOne. It seems.\n\nBut really, these simplistic graphics are a real powerhouse in this modern era of high-tech graphics, where many gamers focus too much on the initial, skin-level, aesthetics of a game, angrily reviewing graphics alone. No, this game is a true light to me, showing that, like many indie games, graphics are not a huge priority in making a game a game. Rectangles and a broken dimmer switch make this game truly glorious and straightforward in the most necessary of areas.\n\nThe general feel and flow of the game and its controls are perfect, responsive and accurate, testing each player's ability to platform, as well as their ability to puzzle solve, with the light placement being the centre point of completing a level. I was honestly amazed by the tuning of the game and the polish the creator has drummed in, a very admirable result from a single man trying to juggle this game with education. It really does have a \u201cThomas was Alone\u201d feel to it, I find myself with that same voice in my head, 'Troy was alone, but he was good at falling, and this reverse falling'...\n\n'Oh, and dying.'\n\nThis happens a lot as you progress, getting to the levels full of spikes, trial and error would apply, but there isn't enough error in that phrase. More like a lot of error, and occasional failing a bit further into the level, and only then, when your psyche is in ashes and you have every death achievement, do you have the creator's permission to finish the level.\n\nOverall, this game is damn near perfect, it doesn't overstay its welcome, it's concise and lasts as long as it needs to. One cannot complain about the game being small, as an indie game it is meant to be a shorter game, not being a hardcore game, though one that is still as challenging as the high end of modern puzzlers. So I do highly recommend this game, and this isn't because the creator has paid me (he hasn't) but because it really is an amazing game to distract yourself from the harsh realities of life.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432586243, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432586243, "recommendationid": "16002897", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515821", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448732844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 15, "steamid": "76561198025112884", "num_games_owned": 440}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Wanted to enjoy this as the mechanic is novel, but I just didn't have any fun with what is basically a sub-par platformer with an extra gimmick to make it annoying and frustrating.\nCompared with full game platformers like \"Out there Somewhere\" and \"Thomas was Alone\" this is more of an experimental concept.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448747279, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448747279, "recommendationid": "19346701", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499493", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440364044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 19, "steamid": "76561198123247522", "num_games_owned": 100}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This Game has potential, I really like the concept, but it wasn't executed well at all. but, it does have some strong points, so I'll be doing a Pro's and Con's List. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+This Game has a really good concept, granted, good concepts are only one factor of what makes a good game into a good game. \n\n+there aren't that many people that reviewed this game before me, which generally means that this game hasn't been out for a long time.
