The price by default is a little steep, so if you get it I'd recommend getting it on sale. The gameplay reminded me of Marble Saga: Kororinpa for the Wii, and that pretty much sold the game for me. Controls very similar to that game as well, gave some nostalgia. After you clear all the levels, you get a level creator that I think could benefit a lot more from Steam Workshop integration.

The marble barely responds to the mouse moving the platforms; it's absolutely embarrassing how hard it is just to make the marble collect one star. I also disliked the full 180 degree turn the camera makes if you make an attempt to look at the levels better, so essentially you only get two distinct angles of view. And even then when you flip the camera it spins around so quickly that you barely have any time to re-adjust the angle of the floor before the marble goes careening off the edge. The marble itself is painfully sluggish, and with how strict the medal times are it grates on you very quickly and you just want the marble move faster.\n\nOverall there's just no fluent control of the game; it doesn't feel the least bit polished in comparison to games like Monkey Ball, and it succeeds very well in ruining the immerson of the game completely. This game set a personal, land-speed record for me of \"Fastest Game Refunded.\" I cannot recommend this game, at all.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1440416859, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440177011, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440177589, "recommendationid": "17647311", "developer_response": "I'm sorry you had a bad experience.
