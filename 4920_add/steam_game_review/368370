I'm not being pretentious here with bull like \"It's not a game, it's an [i]experience[/i]\", it's more like a film played in the wrong order. In Her Story, you look thorugh a police department's interview video database, watching segments of a woman being interviewed in any order you choose. \n\nSo, how do you get a game, or a [i]captivating experience[/i], out of what is basically the chapter select screen on a DVD? How do you build suspense, foreshadow major plotpoints, and not immediately play the last scene when all the power rests in the player? To put it simply, you can't. Not 100% of the time, anyway. I was only 10 minutes in before I watched a video that revealed a major twist that I didn't even realise was a twist because I was never told the opposite, and only halfway through the database before I searched the two phrases that bring up the most important scene, and the last scene. (The phrases were, and of course major spoiler warning before you see them [spoiler]\"Her Story\", \"Gone\", and \"Eve\", it brought up the scenes where she told the police that Hannah killed Simon, the scene where she tells the police Hannah is on the run, and the scene where she tells the police that her real name is Eve, respectively.[/spoiler] ) \n\nYou may be wondering now, \"If that's his opinion on it, why is he reccomending it?\", and the answer to that is that I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hours in which I played the game, how ever short it was. The acting throughout was phenomenal, Viva Seifert is a brilliant actress, and genuinely made me feel as if I was watching actual police interview tapes. The writing is also as remarkable, creating a working non-linear narrative even though the player sits in the editing booth. The twists and turns of the plot still work even if you've seen the twists before the setup, as when you do see the setup, you put all your information together then, and sit back for a couple of minutes as you try to comprehend what had just happened.\n\nQuick note that some might take as a spoiler so proceed with caution, it's only a minor spoiler but a spoiler anyway - [spoiler]To not end the game after you've watched the final clip perhaps 20 minutes into the game, a message comes up that basically says \"So... do you get it?\". They try to be as vague as possible about what that [i]it[/i] is, but by doing so I had thought they were talking about a different plot point. Right after, they say the line that is perhaps the biggest spoiler in the game, and the line that completely went over my head because I had no idea what they were talking about,\n what they expected to be the line that explained everything, had just left me incredibly confused.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I'd say that \"Her Story\" is an extraordinarily well written and performed game that is unfortunately, and quite ironically, bounded by its freedom. If I hadn't searched those terms mentioned earlier, I could have perhaps have had an experience ten times as good as the one I did, however the gameplay mechanics are too experimental and too limitless to work to the narrative's fullest potential.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506326720, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506326720, "recommendationid": "35198457", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508774", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506241176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 227, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 227, "steamid": "76561198008612758", "num_games_owned": 163}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great little indie, maybe a bit short full price, but on sale it's a must-have.
