Very punny if that's your thing (it's mine, and I loved every one of them), if not this game probably isn't for you (or most games of this genre). It was kinda weird to me that it didn't go all out in either serious/dark or silly plot like most point-and-click adventures go (especially a paranormal one) but once I realized that I got into it more for what it was. I really enjoyed the two leads Detective McQueen & Officer Dooley. They have great chemistry and play off each other well enough to keep the cases fun and hold stakes at the end. The subplot about the darkside unit and it's origins and relationship with the city is very interesting and would be great to springboard off of if this game does well enough to do a sequel!\n\nThe game itself is kinda short given that each of the 6 cases isn't that long, but given the price and quality I'd say what I got was pretty fair. While short, each case (by my gauge) where mostly just challenging enough. I *tried* not to cheat and most of the logic is pretty sound, but still at least once a case on average I had to look up what to do, but that just might be my shortcoming, it all made sense. The music was pretty nice, as well as the art. \n\n*I DID initially play with my sister, but she quit by the 2nd case because there is a lot of flickering lights used for atmosphere (especially in the 2nd case) and it's migraine inducing if you'r sensitive to it (even with my brightness all the way down, it gave me a headache and I tried to avoid those rooms). \n*The only other sensory complaint was fly noises in two screens in the 5th case. They are REALLY irritating (to me personally, most people probably not so much) and I feel like they didn't really add to the camp vibe despite how (disturbingly) real they sounded. Neither of those things took my enjoyment away from playing the game per say (aside from not being able to include my sister), but I feel like they should still be taken note of.\n\nBUT those grievences took up a very small slice of the game, which I could tell was made with a lot of heart, and puns.
