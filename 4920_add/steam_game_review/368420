Are. Shit.\n\nMelee fighters can cancel their attacks with any strike of any kind, they reset the timers on the spells REGARDLESS, they can ALL be blocked and/or deflected, they can't keep up with the melee speeds even at their slowest...\n\nAnd for some god awful reason, the devs decided to give several powerhouse melee fighters with high health and/or mobility ranged attacks that can one- or two-hit pretty much any caster, POWERFUL repositioning abilities...\n\nWhile some casters suffer severe lack thereoff.\n\n\nThe pyromancer? Slow. Weak. One pip alone in BOTH health and mobility, he doesn't even possess the ability to reposition effectively as his flight is slow and can be canceled if hit with any attack mid-air or prior to proper casting...\nAnd his teleport is so short-ranged he might as well have tripped and fallen behind his foes, for all the worth it has.\nEven his spells aren't all that potent, in comparison to the mini-nukes of the mechanist, the balls of death thrown by the two-handed warriors, nor the explosive slams and grapples of any of the melee classes.\n\nHis AoE fire bomb is half-decent, but has a long cooldown and a surprisingly small AoE for its size.\nAll of the first slot spells he possesses have cast-times that make them impossible to use in CQC and have staggeringly short effective ranges or can be outright deflected right back at him...\n\nAnd while he DOES have the option for a fiery melee, the attack speed is such that he can rarely counter-attack any but the slowest melee classes.\n\nWorse still, his standard ranged fireball can be deflected right back at him and does little damage when it DOES hit.\nAnd due to his SINGLE PIP of health, this is far more devestating to him than ANY opponent.\n\n\nThe only mildly decent caster isn't even a DPS, but has a death ray. AND the ability to teleport massive distances using his ball o' transitioning. The pyro, meanwhile, sits in the air or pops between points an arms' reach away, unable to flee, tank or defend himself with quick melee or a magical bubble or ring of fire.\nSeriously. The balance for casters needs a HUGE adjustment, especially for the pyromancer.\n\n\n\nWould've been interesting if all spells/special abilities were separated by melee and magic, allowed to be alloted amongst those two basic class-types freely, melee weapons the only real restriction between characters...

originally wrote a meme review but it deserves a real one.\nMirage is a beautiful game, and its excellence goes beyond its visuals.\nIt's chivalry without the spins and reversals, but all the characters have cool abilities to add some depth, some of which can be used in the middle of a melee\nThe level design is beautiful and encourages the player to use the many movement skills the game offerts.\nMobility is an integral part of this game, and nothing feels better than to walljump over an enemy's head before chopping said head off.\nThe Vypress is by far the character with the most mobility (fatty carpet notwithstanding) , seconded by the Tinker.\nThe Vypress has one high speed lunge and a dashkick, the Tinker can dash backwards (this can be used to jump upwards), The entropist can teleport or fly around on a carpet, the gay alchemancer can hover for a bit and sprout fairy wings,the  Taurant can ram in every direction, even up, and use his spin attack to hover and move forward.\nThe vigilist has a shitty jump, but she doesn't need the mobility anyway.\n\nAll of this makes for a really exciting melee combat game with excellent level design and a strong emphasis on team tactics.\n\nA few problems are the current autobalance system which doesn't work too well, and Bazaar is too easy to win as the attackers.\nBalance is pretty good, all classes are fun to play, I
