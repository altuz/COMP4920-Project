They're...pretty awful. I would liken it to Silent Hill 1. Lots of emotional statements with no emotion. Just opt to read.\nSome of the cut scenes where characters interact were clunky and akward. Didn't try too hard to be realistic. \nAnd... well, the ending. [spoiler] I resent playing as this \"caring mom\". What she did... was sociopathic. She felt sorry for herself more than anyone around her.
