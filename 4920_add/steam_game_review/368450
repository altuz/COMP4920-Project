The mechanic of \"forgetting\" means you spend a lot of time spinning in circles, which is not great for motion sickness. This is particularly problematic for the level where you need to jump across turning cogs, whilst spinning around to make new cogs appear. This leads to many frustrating deaths, and it made me so sick I had to quit the game several times. I'm just not sure \"atmospheric psychedelic mind-bender\" and \"frustrating platformer\" are two categories that go well together?\n\nIt's also often not clear what you need to do - to the point that it can become annoying. I like surrealism and not being spoonfed, but some puzzles I completed without even knowing why or how. I'm not sure if there's meant to be a story or message we are supposed to follow, but the voice over phrases came across as nonsensical and therefore pretentious rather than genuinely deep.\n\nI really wanted to like this, but I feel like it's a bit of a wasted opportunity. I know I've been predominantly negative, but I liked this enough to want to keep an eye out for what the developers create in the future. I really hope they build on the graphics and the atmosphere they've created here and move in a slightly different direction for their next game - hopefully more towards atmospheric exploration than face-palming platformer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499811905, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499811905, "recommendationid": "33466794", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 43, "total_reviews": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 35}}
