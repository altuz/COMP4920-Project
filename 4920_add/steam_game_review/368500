That game wowed me. The ability to climb ANY building? And I could be this cool ninja-like hooded killer that could coordinate just HOW he wanted to assassinate a target? Wow!\n\nI played Assassin's Creed 2 in 2009. That game wowed me. They improved every mechanic from the first Assassin's Creed. I loved where it was going. The story was AMAZING! I felt a sense of progression as if I was growing up with Ezio Auditore (the assasssin in that game). We were with him from the moment of his birth to the moment of his death.\n\nI played Assassin's Creed 4 in 2013. That game wowed me. They removed the ability to kill a target any way you wanted but in its stead, they allowed you to explore the open seas of the Caribbean. In addition, the story was amazing. Just like Ezio's story, the story in Assassin's Creed IV had progression to it. The person you were and the state of the world in the beginning of the game changes durastically by the end. It also tied some loose ends from AC3 that lingered.\n\nNow, I come to this game. I am not wowed. In fact, I am disgusted by this game. For one, Ubisoft charges you REAL WORLD CURRENCY to buy virtual money. Yeah, you remember the money you had to earn in AC2, 3, 4? You can now just pay a low fee of $30 for 100,000 in game money. The money doesn't even get you anything special. You buy things just like you could in AC2 (medicine, bullets, etc). \n\nThe story in this game is absolute trash as well. The Jacob Frye voice actor sounds like a random guy they picked off the streets. \"Hey buddy, if we bought you a pint, would you like to do the voiceover in our game?\" The guy overexaggerates EVERYTHING he says. On top of that, the story seems to be going nowhere. The plot established from the first game is long gone. There is no sense of mystery. However, that is not because questions were answered. If anything, questions were UNANSWERED from the ending of Assassin's Creed 3. It doesn't seem to progress anything. It's just another Assassin's vs Templar's story with no ultimate end in sight.\n\nThat doesn't mean everything in this game sucks. In fact, the environment is AMAZING. The size of London as well as the beautiful graphics really captivates my eye. Unfortunately, the animation for both running and combat is trash. It looks like a game for babies where you're controlling Mr. Wiggles (I don't know what character that is, it just sounds like a character that wiggles his arms everywhere until he hits someone). The running animations look like they were ripped from 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas multiplayer mode.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I wanted to find a semblance to AC1 or AC2 but they've lost the plot. Ubisoft has lost the plot, guys. They plan on releasing a new AC game in 2018 so let's hope to heck they get on with the plot. \n\nI give this game a 6/10 - it's a great game on its own but it doesn't live up to the hype of the Assassin's Creed series. They should have made this a spin-off series called 'Creed of Assassins' or something. At least then I'd understand it's a story taking place in the Assassin's Creed universe and not an actual continuation of the story.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506543341, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506543341, "recommendationid": "35248732", "language": "english", "votes_down": 35, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579923", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504290274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3896, "steamid": "76561198288465734", "num_games_owned": 30}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 41, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Stealth games are my favourite and this edition of AC is by far my favourite.

I feel more like a guy used to playing games with a PS4, and then playing a game on XBox. The coolness is there, just I'm not used to the controls, so I can't preform to the max.\n\nWhat I wish was diffrent: Hands down the controls.

However, I cannot in good concience recommend this to anyone who would like to avoid tearing all of thier hair out. Why you may ask, simple answer, Uplay. Uplay is the cancer that infects all of the games made by Ubisoft. Why is all the world they feel the need to make a steam knock-off with no dicernable purpose other than to frustrate is beyond me. All that this poorly implemented and maintained system can manage to accomplish is mix up accounts, have an extra loading screen and another useless window open in the background. The only advantage you can possibly find would be the tiny tid bit rewards you can get. Which is not saying much as you can usually never get the chance to use them in the first place because Uplay mixes up your games with an account you deleted years ago, which in my case it did, to all my Ubisoft games on Steam.

Many things unfortunately.\n\nI'll start off with the positive:\n-Really great music if you love classical/victorian era music, it makes the atmosphere way much more better, really, it is probably the best point of this game.\n-A map that has the right size for an Assassin's Creed game.\n-Nice graphics and textures but... See negative.\n-Principal assassins (Jacob and Evie) looks pretty cool and promising enough, so does the other characters, such as Henry Green, perhaps not as much as Ezio and Altair but he looks pretty decent, not as much as Jacob and Evie though.\n\nHere's the neutral points, depending on the whom, it could be a negative point, for me, it is but it's not that bad anyway:\n-There are no swords in this game.\n-Not every costumes from previous games are available, unfortunately, not a disaster, but would have been good to have them.\n\nNow, the negative:\n-Ugly textures not only from far but from close too, graphics are okay, they're not that great actually, textures are pretty good but depends of what and the lod (distance view) is kinda horrible considering the age of the game, plus it is nothing like in the E3 but that is to be excepted from Ubi isn't?\n\nNow the even more negative that makes me hate this game more than liking it:\n-Microtransactions, you've heard that right, optional? Hey kid, I don't care that it is optional or not, it's already an overpriced game, why should there be any cancerous crap like this in a game like this?\n-Gameplay has been dumb down, there are some good things about it but it's too easy that it is too hard, get what I mean? Probably not, the gameplay is too basic, I don't know if it is me, but there are things you cannot do anymore.\nDouble air assassination? I don't know what's wrong with it but it seems like you have to be really close to the two persons otherwise it won't work like in the previous Assassin's Creed games, it's really bad.\nJumping and running, what the heck is this? Can't you just keep the formula of Assassin's Creed II: Brotherhood? That one was way better than the ones we are getting recently. I mean, you could jump anywhere and dies from it while in this game, it won't let you jump, like some kind of anti-noob measure? Yeah no, but thanks, no, I don't want that crap.\nRunning and jumping feels so simplified, if you want to drop off you have to repeatly click \"E\" (default keyboard key) instead of holding it once and dropping (and die if you're too high) like you could in the previous games.\nI could be making a big paragraph about the gameplay that would take me 1 hour to write but I'll end it here, you get the idea of what I'm trying to say about the gameplay of this game.\n\n\nIn the end, I would suggest this game, but the gameplay is so simplified, I don't like it, I can't stand it, otherwise, it looks like a good game with flaws here and there.\nDon't buy it for more than 15$.\n\nIf you are new to the series and or are a casual, you'll probably love this game if you love the steampunk/victorian era but if you are a previous Assassin's Creed players who likes the gameplay of the first games then this will be a downside to you.\n\nHonestly, I would except the up-coming games to get more complexe and harder, but I was wrong, they really went mainstream, Assassin's Creed should not be an easy game, it should be an challenging game with a complexe gameplay, or at least, that's my opinion.\n\n\nMusic overall 9.5/10 - This is for the OST that has no singing, don't really care about the OST that has singing.\nCharacters overall 8.7/10 - Nothing more to say about that.\nGraphics/textures 6.5/10 - Could and should have been way better than that, we are PC gamers after all, not console gamers.\nMap design and size: 8.5/10 - It is pretty detailed and its size is just good for a game like this, would have been great to have more (small) maps than one though.\nMicrotransactions -10/10 - What are they doing here?

The introduction of the grappling hook is certainly a minus for me.  Free run in the AC series was about being fast and fluent.  With so much gap between buildings and the necessity of the grappling hook, free run is ruined in AC Syndicate.  Every 10-15 meters, you will need to halt your parkour mode and watch your player move very boringly across a line.

Payed $15.99, and I am still disappointed. I gave it the good old college try but got about 4 hours in before getting sick to my stomach from enduring it.\nThere are four factors that can sum up my experience with this game. \n\n1) [u]The Writing[/u]: Absolutely horrendous and lazy. \"Too many cooks spoils the broth\" as they say, as the writing makes this game seem more like a fan-fiction, than a triple-A title. The thoughts and plot devices connecting each of the missions are incredibly, weak and paper thin. It makes it obvious most of the budget went into the facial animation for major historical figures, and fixing all of the technical errors in their new engine. The first two hours of gameplay thankfully didn't have a \"play as a child and experience the death of your parent\" section. It did however consist of ham-fisted characterisations of Jacob and Evie Frye.\n\nHalf of the dialogue is purely to set up Jacob's delivery of corny one-liner after one-liner like a bad 80s action movie, while his sister Evie shoots him jokingly condescending looks. After all, who can say no to a complaining man-child, who is always asking \"why am I not stabbing a person wearing a nazi-like Templar armband right now?\" (Because they actually do that in this one). The Crime Syndicate aspect in the game is clumsily rushed into the fore-ground by Jacob, with his bloodthirsty child-like glee, apparently because he's \"always wanted to run a gang\". Meanwhile Evie wants to do Assassin things and track down a piece of Eden (as always). \n\nWhile the marketing team tries to paint the two as completely different play-styles, there really is no difference in gameplay between the two until you get to the final levels of progression, where they each are able to acquire 3 buffs that the other can't. Evie's being Stealth Boost, ACTUAL INVISIBILITY, and Throwing Knife Buffs, Jacob's being HP, Firearm, and Damage Buffs. The other 49 skills they can both acquire.\n\n\n\n2) [u]The Combat[/u]: Assassinations have gotten boring, playing the same few animations of stabbing in the small of your target's back when you're in sneak mode. When the animation DOES differ (when your character is NOT sneaking), it often ignores the context of the environment and plays a random animation. The combat pacing (and choreography) is terrible. There is also now a combo meter, and combat is based around four different mechanics. Attacking, Guard-Breaking, Countering, and Dodging. For each press of the [Attack] button, your Assassin will strike at least twice. In a one on one battle you can mash the button and a normal enemy is helpless. If they're a \"brute\" enemy, (that is to say the bald-headed strong-man who is the ONLY character model for this archetype in the game) they might try to attack through your combo, which you can counter and ignore. The Syndicate fighting isn't even as well thought-out as the Arkham fighting system, as it doesn't reward you for timing your attacks. So feel free to button mash, and if you split attacks between more than one enemy they get REALLY confused. You never really feel threatened or in danger. If an enemy tries to shoot you from afar, there's no need to worry. You have several seconds to prepare and execute a Nicholas Cage-like bullet dodge with the dodge button. So you can dodge every bullet. Welcome to the Animatrix.\n\nWhen you reduce an enemy's health to 0, they don't fall or die. They stay in a Punch-Out-esque slouched position, half heartedly attacking you until you perform a horrendously animated \"finishing move\" on them with the camera zooming in for dramatic effect. Mind you, it's not very dramatic when this happens with literally every single enemy in the game. The sound design is very lacking here as well, as many finishers use borderline stock sound effects for your fists and weapons impacting. Many of these are poorly synced to the animations as well.\n\n3) [u]The Exploration[/u]:  Everyone complains about the grappling hook/zip line. It is actually a very smart choice in design, and highlights a flaw in the setting. The broad streets of London, and tall flat faced buildings, do not allow AC's free-running/climbing mechanics to shine. One of the quintessential Assassin's Creed features does not translate well to a modernizing city. Who would've thought. I am glad the grapple mechanic was introduced, as it helps gloss over the fact that:\n\n\ta) The setting was a poor choice for the style of game they were making, which is why they're going back to Ancient Egypt, avoiding Ultra-Wide city streets.\n\n\tand\n\n\tb) They absolutely botched the free-run nav-meshing and made it feel unsatisfying and clumsy to run across rooftops and parkour through the city.\n\nThe camera is also unbearably close to your character with a very minimal FOV. Very bad for those of you who experience simulation sickness easily, expecially seeing as it jumps around desperately trying not to clip through walls. There is no known way to change this. Not through in-game settings, or ini edits, so have fun on your collect-athon kids. \n\nThe clothing physics were also locked at 30 fps for my game, and so i was left wearing a card-board cape for the first hour of my experience. (I use a 60 hz monitor on a medium range rig). There is a fix for this at least, and it's relatively easy to find if you google it yourself.\n\n4) [u]The NPC AI[/u]: Seems everyone in Industrial London is both deaf and legally blind. Citizen NPCs have absolutely NO impact on the environment. Everyone is there solely to react to you. None of their reactions trigger anything. They just stand there in wonder, or scream and beg you not to kill them. Meanwhile the guard standing 15 feet behind them has no idea of what's transpired because he's facing the opposite direction and apparently needs some hearing aids. Enemies have a visual range of maybe 20 feet or 6 meters, and no peripheral vision whatsoever. There is one such example early on in the game which i'd like to point out.\n\n\t[There is a civilian talking with a guard who is also his friend. I killed the guard in front of him because he wouldn't move on, and I needed to pass him without being detected. The civilian man stood \tthere screaming, hands at his side in a nuetral position. Meanwhile the guard behind him was completely unaware of what happened because he was facing 90 degrees to the left. The civilian didn't sound any alarms.]\n\nThe AI is bare-bones and is there for decoration.\n\nThis is the easiest stealth game I've ever played.\nIt is the worst Assassin's Creed I've ever played.\nIt is the least interesting Assassin's Creed I've ever played.\n\nDo not spend more than $10.00 on this game.
