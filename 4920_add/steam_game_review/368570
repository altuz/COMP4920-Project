And for that price, the experience is definitely worth the shot. If you don't feel something for this game at the third track, go ahead and ask a refund.\n\nSo... that's when you wonder if I checked the wrong box by giving a negative review. \nWell, I meant it. Because, no matter how much I loved the experience, the game suffers serious bugs that have never been patched. How serious is it ? YOU WON'T EVEN SEE THE FREAKING ENDING ! You can't access the final cutscene and because of this bug, the game never grants you the achievements for finishing it ! Don't even think about contacting the devs, since they don't have the decency to answer. They seem to be done with this game.\n\nNow that's on you to decide if these issues are serious enough to give a pass.
