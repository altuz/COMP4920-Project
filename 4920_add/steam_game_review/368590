It's hard not to like it. With a beautiful soundtrack and graphics to boot, the game compliments it's self well. Along with that, I would say the first 3/4 quarters of the game plays well and the mechanics are decent enough to get by. If you're looking for a short game to run through, this game only took me about an hour to beat ([i]7 hours were spent practicing to beat parts without dying, and to get achievements[/i]). This could be a pro and a con.\n\nWith that last point, that's how I want to start the cons/dislikes. The game is pretty short and by the time you beat it, you feel like you were just getting started. The game has a minimalist story, meaning the story is told in a way that is least amount possible. There are [b]ABSOULTELY[/b] no words in the entire game besides a few tutorial messages that pop up and the word \"[i]Albert[/i]\" written on the letters you can find. There's a total of 3 cut scenes that are unclear as to what they mean and the collectibles are the only other way you can piece together a theory of what the story is. The last quarter of the game is unforgiving the first time around. With a game like this you have to expect to die and reload, that's just how it is. However, when they throw in an auto-scroller and make only one check point through the entire thing ([i]half way through it[/i]) it can be crushing having to spend 30 mins on a single part because 20 of it was getting back to the spots you died so you could try a different solution. There is another auto-scroller segment a couple parts after that which isn't as long or bad, but can still give the same effect leading to harsh judgements of the game.\n\nTo be [b]COMPLETELY[/b] honest, I hated the game by the time I finished it the first time. Solely because of what I stated in the paragraph above. The last part wore me down and out of enjoying it when it took 30mins to beat a 5min segment. Having forced myself to go back and learn the game to get the achievements, I found myself re-liking it and enjoying it all over again. If this game was longer and I had to deal with those auto-scroller segments I probably wouldn't have gone back to the game or enjoyed it the next time I picked it up. [b]SO[/b], to conclude, I [b]WOULD[/b] recommend this game to friends. If the art style and soundtrack isn't enough to enjoy it, it's a good puzzle game that's short enough to warrant playing through it several times.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500951382, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500951382, "recommendationid": "33778178", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503781", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483854805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 209, "steamid": "76561198057507728", "num_games_owned": 74}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A little disappointing.\n\n- A straight forward incomplete and dull game with visual narrative and a different art style from normal, that is quite appealing.\n- For gameplay it makes you desire more of it, it has some interesting mechanics and ideas but the way it was made makes them pretty tedious as it has a very slow paced feel to it.\n\nFor the price it's at the story is too short and gameplay lacks fun, I'd say the only good thing of this game is its art style which is a bummer cus if the approach was different it would make a more appealing and interesting game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503925588, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504134793, "recommendationid": "34552431", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501508", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501179162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 241, "steamid": "76561198006689642", "num_games_owned": 577}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game had a good idea (childhood trauma during the time of the 3rd reich).\n\nUnfortunatelly this background story can only be guissed by the paintings of a small child which can be found in postboxes during the levels ...
