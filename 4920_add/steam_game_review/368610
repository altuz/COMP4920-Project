The reason i classify this as lite, to me personally, it seemed easier than other rogue games on steam. I suggest if your just starting to get interested in rogue dungeon games, or would like to try one, this is the one to pick. Anyways, here is my pro/con list:\n\nPROS:\n\n`Easier than other Rogues\n`New Game + lets you play the game again with all your items\n`Fun game with many different items and weapons, armors, and other things to find in the dungeon\n`Ability to pick which skills you want\n\nCONS:\n\n`The museum requires multiple games to finish\n`You only have 4 character sprites to pick from\n`The game is short for a rogue game\n\nMy Final recommendation: I recommend it because, unlike other rogue games, it is easier. This could make people that are just starting to try out rogue games play it, or if you want a quite easy rogue game, this one is not too bad to play.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503799262, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503799262, "recommendationid": "34518710", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528031", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 130, "total_reviews": 138, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
