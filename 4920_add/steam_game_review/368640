Comparing to the mouse-firefly in Child of Light, this one is like a firefly in his 70 or something. TO move the firefly the player will need to hold the mouse, which is kinda tiring. This can be improved by giving the option to, instead of holding down, click to toggle. This problem makes many stages a lot harder.\n\nAnother problem is the camera. There are lots of objects that moves Mion, leading to camera moving with her. During this movement the player is usually required to make Mion remain in a certain area to clear a stage. The slow speed and camera movement combined make you unable to precisely position your mouse in order to dodge incoming hazard or attack.\n\nAnd, since there is only one object at a time that will be controlled by mouse, why not replace the mouse with it? A mouse leading a firefly leading a loli is pretty weird and breaks immersion. I suppose this is originally made for tablet or something with touchpad, leading the mouse problem.\n\nThe idea is kinda innovative to let the player lead, instead of directly contol the protagonist.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501142746, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501142746, "recommendationid": "33826630", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508490", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500912590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 823, "steamid": "76561198103023016", "num_games_owned": 109}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is hard , It become very very very harder if you want to complete all Achievements.\n\nTry to play this game when you feel empty or you have nothing to do.\n\nit will give you frustration spice of life :v", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500913996, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500913996, "recommendationid": "33769542", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 32, "total_reviews": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 14}}
