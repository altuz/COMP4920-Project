The levels can be a bit repetetive after a while. But the overal feel is amazing, since you can't see what or who lies before you. You use sound to visualize where everything is, but if you make the wrong sound at the wrong time, it could mean your death. It's a scary feeling to walk around in complete silence, and it's even scarier if you have to outrun the monsters.

Kind of bare with minimal presentation, no music and simple sound effects. Simple maze navigation in unity engine. You use the sound of your footsteps to echolocate around. The visual representation of the sound waves are well done. Possible to sneak around or clap to hide or create sound waves. Must also avoid enemies that chase through sound. Original concept and controller support as well as minimal sprites that do not look pixelated when fullscreened.\n\nIts true the enemies follow you through walls. There is also a fair deal of trial and error in figuring out the maze layouts and understanding which creatures must be baited, which must be outran, which you must sneak by, and in which order.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503876741, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503877073, "recommendationid": "34541404", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501862604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 52, "steamid": "76561198255936293", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great concept, enjoyable game without much stress.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501862302, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501862302, "recommendationid": "34018759", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 200, "total_reviews": 220, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 20}}
