Every level randomly presents you with one of a handful objectives ranging from surviving until a timer runs out, to shutting off devices before they catastrophically overheat, to retrieving fuel rods from one part of the map and depositing them in another location.  Along the way, you're beset by a variety of enemies (the titular aliens) and, true to form, \"game over\" is a single death away.\n\nFortunately, you'll have access to a generous array of unlockable weapons and items scattered throughout the game--and this, in my opinion, is where the game shines.  The sheer variety of weapons and items may be impressive, but the fact that they're generally well-balanced is shocking--particularly when you consider how diverse they are.  There's the shotgun with its typical buckshot spread, the sniper rifle that pierces multiple targets, a laser that becomes more powerful as it fires, and...an electric pogo stick?  \n\nYet you'll discover combinations and quirks that aren't immediately obvious.  Orbs ordinarily prevent you from firing your weapons while you carry them, but if you're using that electric pogo stick, you're still able to kill enemies...because the pogo works by dropping down on their heads (plus it lets you move faster!)  The explosive boomerang will injure you if it's still armed when it returns...but if you're nimble, you can kite it around indefinitely, letting it chew up enemies as you run around with your sidearm.  The \"Mega Chakra\" is a sloppy and temperamental thing, yet even after being abandoned for another weapon, it'll violently react to enemy contact.\n\nAnd that's to say nothing of all the sidearms, explosives, defensive items, special abilities, and perks the game has to offer.  Hacking modules, a transforming blaster for a sidearm, remote satchel charges, a radioactive unit that passively accumulates the resource used for special abilities, teleporters, forcefields, etc.  The point is that there's a great variety of tools at your disposal, and many complement each other in unexpected ways.  Since each player can hold a primary weapon, sidearm, explosive, special ability, defensive ability, and perk at any given time, the combinations and strategies are surprisingly vast.  Perhaps not quite \"Binding of Isaac\" levels, but great nonetheless.\n\nThere's a commendable ecology of enemies, as well, bolstered by the game's mutation mechanic:  Smaller, weaker alien variations will grow into monstrous versions if exposed to too much radiation (the result of leaving them alive for too long while radioactive beacons are spilling green light everywhere) or if they pick up the green radiation pellets that drop as ammo for special abilities.  In other words, if an enemy beats the player to the pellet, not only do they begin mutating into a more powerful version of themselves, but the player is denied a valuable resource.   It's a refreshing dynamic and forces a balance between hoovering up pellets despite your tank being full, and leaving them until you need them (but risking the chance that they benefit an enemy instead). \n\nAt the lowest difficulty, the game is appropriately easy; on the hardest, the average player won't be able to sleepwalk through a run (sleeprun?).  And despite getting killed a lot at higher difficulties, I can't recall any moments where I felt like the game cheated me.\n\nOf course, if you're still having trouble, the couch co-op allows two players to tackle all 12 levels together on one screen.  Combined with the aforementioned abundance of strange and novel items, this feature makes for some intense and hilarious moments that really amplify the game's crazier side.\n\n\nPROS\n+ Fantastic diversity and balance among weapons, items, and enemies \n+ Mechanically solid:  Easy to pick up, but harder to master.\n+ Solid pixel-art style\n+ Couch co-op\n+ Very responsive developer\n\nCONS\n- Strange technical issues in conjunction with Nvidia Optimus\n- Limited assortment of game modes\n- Level design and aesthetics can get too \"samey\" after a while", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1481769610, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1481932782, "recommendationid": "28380702", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503065", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504309966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 541, "steamid": "76561197973172334", "num_games_owned": 270}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So I'm new to the game.

I'm a fan of Super Crate Box. It reminded me of gems from a bygone era like the NES Mario Bros (not Super) that was a simple arcade platformer with an endless array of levels. Super Crate Box was an iteration of that same arcade formula, and this game in turn, is an iteration of the Super Crate Box formula. \n\nThere's not so much procedural generation as there a randomization of game modes and the creatures and weapons that spawn in each level. There are bosses, and they appear at appropriate intervals. There's also an endless mode which is more reminiscent of the aforementioned titles. \n\nIn its simplicity, there is a lot of fun to be had here. I haven't put in a ton of hours due to only experimenting with new patches during early access, but I intend to play it for a long time yet to come. Super Mutant Alien Assault is a mechanically excellent title that yearns to be experienced, and you'll be particularly aware of this if you are from older generations who still visited local arcades.

As somebody who loved super crate box, I've been looking for a single screen puzzle-shooter to top it since. And well, SMAA is almost a contender. Almost.\n\nTouting itself as \"The Citzen Kane of Super Crate Box Clones\", joke or not, admittedly got my expectations up. The gameplay looked promising from the trailers, so I decided to pounce on it immediately. While the hype and love started oozing from every one of my pores as soon as I started playing, the well dried up pretty fast of my enjoyment. There seems to be a soulless void... an emptiness, to this game. And, I'm dedicating the rest of the review to try and figure it out for myself using self-talk therapy.\n\nFirstly the positives:\n\nThe graphics are very good. The gibs of the enemies are crunchy, and remind me a lot of shooting a rocket or super shotgun at some cacodemons in doom. It's very satisfying when you chunk a cluster of flying enemies with a rocket launcher, or snipe a particularly troublesome foe in the head with a sniper rifle. The spaceship's designs are all very pretty, and every enemy is thought out aesthetically to match their obvious functions.\n\nThe gimmicks it's added to distance itself from crate box are also unique and interesting. Monsters mutate not only in speed, but now in function- they grow larger, gain extra abilities, and sometimes can even reach more than one stage. There are now grenades and special abilities added to the mix, which can be powered by the radiation gathered from upgraded monsters. This means you can choose to upgrade some monsters for some special ability ammo if you wish! There are different types of levels, making your goal from each vary.\n\nBut now for the negatives:\n\nAfter deliberating the issue with SMAA in my head, I've realized it all comes down to the game's speed. A game like this doesn't need to be fast to be enjoyable, but when a game is both fast and slow at the same time the action begins to clash and create friction between the different elements. \n\nTo sum it up in an allegory: Super Mutant Alien Assault is like making Usain Bolt hit a huge rock with a pickaxe. You can sprint around the rock smashing it all you want, but at the end of the day, you're doing long tedious work and have to keep running around in circles to get the job done. In super crate box, you shoot fast, deal lots of damage, but die fast. This is because super crate box is a high score based arcade game, so it's just skill that lets you get further. However, SMAA has changed the genre to sort of a roguelike room clearing game, and has to be rebalanced to fit that. Therefore, this fast movement based game has now been refitted to pump in more gimmicks, include player health bars, ways to stall, more player power... And to balance it out, more enemy health. Now the game runs a whole lot slower, and since the movement is about the same, feels a whole lot clunkier as a result. Sound familiar?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXQ2lO3ieBA\n\nTo quickly wrap up the other things I have problems with:\n\nThe music needs to calm down. This is a minor gripe because I can just mute it, but based on the new speed of the game... Loud aggressive dubstep music just doesn't work. It sounds like every second of my game should just be some call of duty montage on youtube, even if I'm just sitting around waiting for enemies to spawn. I just muted it after a while. This is pretty much personal opinion and I don't factor it into my review, but thought I should mention it.\n\nThe slowdown effects are tied to framerate. That means that whenever the game wants to dramatically slow down time, it reduces the framerate directly. This is extremely distracting, and text cannot justify how much it hurts to look at. I don't know if the engine itself is responsible for this, but I seriously hope it will be patched eventually.\n\nOverall, while not all terrible, I still cannot recommend SMAA because I find Super Crate Box to be way more enjoyable for free instead of 8 dollars. If this game was the first of it's kind with nothing to compare to, maybe I'd say it's worth the price, but honestly there have been games that have done it better before for lower prices and/or free.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468387102, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468387301, "recommendationid": "24289206", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502105", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465974380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 232, "steamid": "76561198043765841", "num_games_owned": 273}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A fun little arcade-ish game that I could envision eating a number of quarters in the days of old with some changes.
