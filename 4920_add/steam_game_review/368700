Or maybe downloaded off of Jumbo Games or the like. It's the kind of game you sit down to play for an hour. Then come back the next day and play again. It's got that subtle addictive quality. It's a very good blend of easy, approachable, and challenging. Almost feels like an obscure game Apogee might have made back in the day. Every time I've played it I've experienced new enemies, upgrades, and obstacles.\n\nI love that I can collect items to unlock new ships, and these ships recieve completely different effects from the artifact/potion pickups. Each ship is a totally different game.\n\nMy only complaint is that in the very late levels I keep dying from being rammed, despite whatever collision damage reducing modifiers I've equipped. Even in the speediest ship, which I transitioned to by a chance powerup, later levels feature so many spawning enemies intent on ramming you that it presents a huge challenge. But of course, this a rogue-like, and daunting challenge is to be expected.\n\nStill, I wish there was a cloaking device with a timed cooldown cycle that when activated would prevent me from picking up anything or firing, but would hide me from the enemies. This would allow me to better tip toe around the later levels and cloak & heal when resistance gets too tough. Ballancing this, most upgrades are only found by shooting enemies, and some fuel has to be obtained from mini boss battles. For all I know this upgrade is already in the game and I haven't found it yet, that's how much neat upgrade loot is in this game.\n\nIf you like the idea of an action rogue-like with a sort of Fort Apokalypse meets Defender vibe, definitely check this out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432240940, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432240940, "recommendationid": "15932271", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512312", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1431862290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 118, "steamid": "76561197970240087", "num_games_owned": 410}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a fun little action-roguelike.

The planetary action reminds me strongly of Solar Jetman (NES), but the worlds seem to be made from scratch each time, so each one is always a new experience on dropping out of orbit.

Some acquisitions are \"Collection\" items that affect all future playthroughs.  The music is pretty sweet, and the sound effects are distinctive for each enemy and its fire.\n\n(This bit here contained a complaint about the \"Teleporting Eyeball\" enemy being hard to notice and showing up too close to the player's ship to avoid, sometimes, but the developer has addressed both those concerns on this first day of 2016, and made a previously somewhat cumbersome equipment system a bunch easier to use, to boot.)\n\ntl;dr:  GET THIS if you like solidly-done blasty gameplay and getting cool (and uncool)  items, with a nice bit of story on the side, and lovely music all around.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451207947, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451648408, "recommendationid": "19989937", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503049", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466729735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 604, "steamid": "76561197993619651", "num_games_owned": 76}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "5", "review": "Looks like a good spacey, pixel-arty 2d scrolling shooter.
