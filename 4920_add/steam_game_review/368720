The models aren't that \"wow\". the planets are ok. The controls response, the menu, a lot of things is missing. The first word that came to my mind was \"Refund\".\nBut then, why not to give it a try?\nWhy not to support someone coding on huge game all by him (or her) self, as it apperas to me not only for the money, but the fun of it too?\nI really think that in the time to come, this game will become memorable.\nToday? Today is an incomplete game. but someone once said \"I have a thing for children, dwarfs and broken things.\"\nIf you expect a triple A game, don't buy Sirius online.\nIf you expect a gem to run smooth and looking real in your 4k monitor, don't buy it.\nBUt, If you want to be part of something living, and support something that has a great chance of becoming an amazing experience, BUY IT!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502793002, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502793002, "recommendationid": "34253292", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 44, "total_reviews": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
