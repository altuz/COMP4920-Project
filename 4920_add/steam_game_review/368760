It's a bit on the short-side and rough around the edges but there's a bit of replayability.  I like the graphical style and learned a few things.

I only learned 4 or 5 facts I didn't know before and I only remembered 2 or 3 because these were interesting. Some facts I feel were left out though\n\nWhy thumbs down? It's way too short! 2 hours with \nrunning up and down the stairs twice to get something! I do \nthink there are maybe two other endings which I did not \nplay yet, but still, I expected more.\n\nAbout the gameplay: the gameplay is only with your mouse \nand you can play it with just one hand. And the fighting system\nisn't really challenging or interesting.\n\nIt was a fun game to play, just short and unchallenging.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435784321, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435786645, "recommendationid": "16833209", "language": "english", "votes_down": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534136", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484488443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 89, "steamid": "76561197989069159", "num_games_owned": 157}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Educational game, lacks polish.\n\nThis game has something going for it, but also lacks polish.\n\nFirst and foremost I recommend this as an educational game, it is almost like playing through a short documentary. It has a lot of clickable stuff where you can read about different stuff in the viking world. I knew most of the facts, but for someone not from Scandinavia there might be some new things to learn. \n\nFrom a game perspective there is a lot of hunting for little coins, hammers (that let you choose specific viking deities when ever you collect 3 of them), talking to people, doing small quiz-like dialogues, spot errors in the form of items not belonging to the time etc. \n\nWhere it lacks is instructions on how to play. For example it took me some time before I found out how to spin the camera (hold right mouse button down), the voice acting is in Danish, but text is in English, which might be a problem for kids, also voice acting clearly isn't super professional.\n\nIn the end I will recommend this game to promote educational games, I think games like these are really cool and I don't mind it being short, the price point might be a tad too high though.
