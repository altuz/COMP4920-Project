However, the premise of the game is interesting and the game show lots of potential in some areas. However, it's obvious that there is still work that needs to be done to improve it. For example, the ability to be able to save progress and the option to play the game in window size.  As it is, this game resembles more a student project as opposed to an \"indie\" game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499132010, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499132010, "recommendationid": "33210096", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502471", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
