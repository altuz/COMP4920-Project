Main point are the \"dilemmas\" which some of the different \"leaders\" come to you with each round, and how you handle them. The resolutions aren\u00b4t always logical or even seem buggy once or twice.. but yeah. \n There are no elections... no bigger results or demographics besides a few basic ones like \"stability\" and \"income\" naturally.\n\nI finished one scenario (in not even ten minutes?).. got a few hundred points as \"result\" and thats that.\n\nConclusio: The \"President for a Day\" games are not promising much.. but deliver even less, at least for me. Maybe for people who just want some easy clicking in between it\u00b4s fun enough, also the price isn\u00b4t too high.

It's simple with simple mechanics yet (similar to Democracy 3) it's really easy to mess everything up. Basically, you have Dilemnas that pop up every turn that require your attention, generally, \"give X amount of money for Y.\" You also have a military which you can move around the various territories in an attempt to quell rebels and bandits but be careful not to overexert yourself. I learned very quickly that doing the right thing wasn't always the best thing for my country and I've had to replay a few scenarios to get it right. I'm actually kind of sad that the game doesn't have more scenarios to play through but for 5 bucks the content is still pretty fun. Plus you'll want to replay just to do better as a President each time. I recommend this for Democracy fans.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QXdMNPYZ8", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438802533, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438802533, "recommendationid": "17403570", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580820", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438811617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 47, "steamid": "76561198033853794", "num_games_owned": 539}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 50, "comment_count": "3", "review": "The concept of the game itself is great, but from the red thumbs down I'm sure you can tell that I didn't find the execution satisfactory.\n\nAs a speed reader I've gotten through three of the four scenarios in my forty five minute play time, and thus I'm going to imagine it would have taken me an hour to gotten through all of them.  So it's President for a Day but only Gameplay for an Hour.  But it's a little more than $4 at the time of the sale, so I didn't expect there to be a lot of content itself. \n\nThat being said, time does have a large factor as to why I didn't enjoy myself.  You see the game has a score system that ranks how you did in the little more than a dozen turns you're given, and I felt it actually hurt the game more than it helped it.  Why?  Because at the start you choose which leader you play as, with some buff attributed to them as well as a goal which gives 250 points should you complete it.  To give a comparison, score from other sources (as far as I'm aware from my three scenarios) more often than not amounts to less than a hundred, and I'd guess that's if you do really well in other categories.  With that I feel as though I'm playing Quidditch.  Sure, I -could- do other things to help raise the score up, but ultimately it comes down to that goal.\n\nA lot of people will probably think that it doesn't have any influence on the game itself so I shouldn't complain, and I can't fault them.  That being said there were other problems I had.  If I pandered to a group as hard as possible, if I agreed with everything the rich and the military say, I obtained support in the 60s region, which only provides the first buff, though that is still useful.  I don't even know if there's any buff from raising it higher than that because again, the game length is fairly low.\n\nAnd that's what it comes down to.  This isn't a bad game, it's just a short game that leaves me feeling unsatisfied.  I didn't feel a lot of weight to my actions, but maybe that's the point, life is hard in Africa and there's only so much one man can do to change things up.  Anyway, it's $5 when the sale ends, you might find more enjoyment than I did, and feel it was a worthwhile experience.  But I'd first reccomend getting an emulator to play Hidden Agenda on.\n\n(I encourage people to add comments, either in favor or even if you disagree with me, and if I have any extra tidbits to say about the game I'll probably add it to the comment section so that the review itself isn't a huge wall of text on what I would or would not add to the game)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438813552, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438819853, "recommendationid": "17406028", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549307", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442122386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 855, "steamid": "76561198120175354", "num_games_owned": 303}, "votes_funny": 15, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Recommended for individuals yearning to be the leader of a nation but otherwise refuse to do something about it other than through a click of the mouse.\n\nAlso highly recommended for would-be megalomaniacs with dictatorial aspirations.
