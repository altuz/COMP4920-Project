Once you get the dash attack ability (Has you dash in any 4 directions) the game gets an increase in enjoyment when it come to gameplay.\n\nThe Item shop, (after you buy the Health increase) is useless. For coins you can get a health refill (Enemies drop health, sooooooooo..... pointless?) an extra life(if you run out you just start back at the last check point you crossed, plus unlimited continues), and for feathers you can get a magic feather (that makes you invulnerable for 15 seconds.......... right after you leave the shop...... wait WHAT? o_O) and a magic potion that refills your hearts once they run out (AKA fairy in a bottle).\n\nSome enemies are programed in Unnecessary Bull shit that seeps at their very maw........ ok mostly just the flying enemies. The butterfly's do make it difficult in the beginning since the range of your sword is short, and they fly at you in a Boo like fashion from mario bros. Seriously screw butterfly's.\n\nUpdate: Or maybe I just suck, but you know what, I ABSOLUTELY HATE THOSE DAMN BAT'S THAT FLY FROM THE EDGE OF THE SCREEN IN THE LAST LEVEL. SCREW YOU! YOU F***ING BATS!!!\n\nAnd that's the only thing I hate from the final level - end anger enduced rant\n\nThere are also some area's that will leave you confused, since you have to remeber where you have been and if you go through the wrong door, the door behind you closes and you have to trek through that area all over again just to get back at the area that has multiple doors. Not too much of a problem for me, but for some that could get annoying.\n\nProgession is Great, as you keep going up the game will get progressivly harder, but it seems it's mostly at your pace. Once you learn to deal with some enemies naturally over time, you feel more confident then when it gets to the next area it adds another difficulty. This is pretty solid right here.\n\nOnce you get an item that has you charge up your sword....... it takes way to long it seems and just seems to leave you open and is only effective towards one enemy that can be easily avoided.\n\nUpdate - I was told by the developers that they fixed the sword charging problem, Great job guys. This made me want to use the charge up way more, and once fixed made combat enjoyable again........... except for the bats in the final level.\n\nUpdate: Bosses are cool looking but can sometimes seem exploitve. I was able to find parts of the bosses where you could find an area to just hang out and spam your attacks. But that could also be a necessity since sometimes the bosses attack paths seemed ridiculous to dodge. Like the Total Biscuit Butterfly Boss battle, that would spawn Little Biscuits to attack you...... I'm still wondering why Total Biscuit was a butterfly. Final Boss was definetly the best part of the boss battles, I won't spoil anything but he's a good fresh challenge.\n\nSo overall The game is good, but not something that you should go out of your way to get.\n\nUpdate: I do love the fact that the developers were able to hear out their audience and fix some problems, and I understand that they cannot go back and make the magic feather of invicibility a more useful item since that might entail changing code which could cause the game to glitch or crash. But thanks again Pixel Barrage for improving after release.\n\nMy recommendation:\n\nUpdate: I still stand by my original conclusion, though Pixel Barrage willing to hear the criticizm and improve upon the game from those remarks, definetly gets a plus in my book.\n\nIf you're looking for a new sidescroller, get it.\nIf you're interested but have some doubt's from the price, you can pass it and get it later.\n\nIt's really nothing you need now, but can be fun at times", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435934057, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436550541, "recommendationid": "16861490", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517407", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454191178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 378, "steamid": "76561198191263907", "num_games_owned": 1195}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "8/10 Marvellous\n\n\nPro's\n\n+ Quaint game musics.\n\n+ Exquisite atmosphere depicted by pixel.\n\n+ A Large world to explore.\n\n+ Flexible difficulty, which can be very friendly to casual players and be quite \nchallengable to hard-core players.\n\n+ Upgrade system and collectable items.\n\nCon's\n\n- The battlestyle may be a bit dull.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451579181, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451579244, "recommendationid": "20153344", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503094", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450986271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 77, "steamid": "76561197963981669", "num_games_owned": 428}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's... okay.

Problem with that, much as in Assassin's Creed 1, is you might go for a long while before getting a health up, so it becomes part of the music and is an unnecessary sound, acting as a constant warning that the player is already likely aware of; get more health! But it's not a deal breaker and once you get your health up, it thankfully disappears. I don't think there's an option to turn it off, but not a big deal consider the rest of the game is great fun. \n\nI wasn't sure how the game saves progress, but thankfully when you contact the winged spheres, once they fly up, you have saved your progress. There are Knights that give you tips if you need them also. To conclude, you gain new abilities and go through many castles and different underwater maps, facing all kinds of fun enemies from fish, butterflies to globs that spit, and more.
