It sacrificed most of its spunkiness to bring us more conventional point \u2018n\u2019 click gameplay and a better graphical style, but it also relies too much on the previous episodes to consider this a standalone game.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nAR-K: Great Escape is actually the third segment of what originally was supposed to be a four-chapter adventure game, now released as an individual product. Therefore, it is almost completely unsuited for new players\u2014there is a recap video at the start, but the editing is too terrible to provide any information.\n\nBeyond the improved graphical style, the most obvious change in Great Escape is how less bold it is. For example, our protagonist, Alicia\u2014who finally got more reasonable body proportions\u2014lost so much of her sass that she feels more like a generic late 90s adventure game heroine instead. Still, she is the only real character, because each member of the otherwise decent-sized supporting cast has too small roles and screen presence to make any impact.\n\nNot just Alicia feels like part of a traditional point \u2018n\u2019 click but the rest of the game as well. We spend most of the playtime chasing typical adventure game puzzles throughout a new area, the AR-K space station\u2019s sub-basement, where the shantytowns and gigantic industrial complexes serve as an intentional stark contrast to the last two episode\u2019s posh futuristic city-state. The plot itself tells Alicia\u2019s attempt to escape this place, and while it is incredibly predictable down to the last story twist, it is a cute and harmless enough tale to pass the time with, and hope that we can eventually see the conclusion of this saga.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504676508, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504676508, "recommendationid": "34770029", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520094", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 36, "total_reviews": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
