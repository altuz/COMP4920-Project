It's obviously inspired by Touhou Project; and if you like those games, you will absolutely enjoy this one.\n\nThe art and music are top notch. The story is about what you'd expect (hint: there's not much to it.) The stages are well designed, with a good balance of difficult sections and breathing breaks. Overall, I'd say the difficulty is pretty high. It's about on par with most Touhou Project games, actually. There's not too much random twitch dodging in Jigoku Kisetsukan - most everything is pattern based. If you're used to playing Touhou, you'll recognize the setup of the stages. Random enemies, miniboss, random enemies, boss. Bosses follow the same sort of \"spell card\" system as they do in Touhou. (I.E. Normal attack, special pattern with a point bonus if you clear it within a time limit and without dying, normal attack, repeat until somebody dies.)\n\nI love the art in this game. The character portraits are gorgeous, and the sprites are so charming. They've got a sort of pixilated look about them which serves to distinguish them from Touhou, and is super adorable. Unlike some danmaku games, it's almost always clear what's happening on the screen. The backdrops don't intrude, and the only time you might lose track of your character is when a boss is preparing a special attack, at which point their portrait will scoot across the screen. You're safe during these intervals, though, so it's not a problem.\n\nA very nice thing is the ability to practice all the stages on all the difficulty levels right from the get go. The only thing you'll have to unlock is characters.\n\nThere's also a section with information about the characters and their backstories, which I quite like.\n\nAll in all, this could pretty much be considered a Touhou Project clone. But it's a really well done one, and it's obvious that a lot of love went into this thing. I can't recommend it highly enough.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485135010, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485135010, "recommendationid": "29434573", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501744", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495164242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 228, "steamid": "76561198079119793", "num_games_owned": 127}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is honestly really fucking fun.
