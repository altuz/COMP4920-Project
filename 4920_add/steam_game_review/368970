It looks great and has lots of character. From what I played it seemed to have a great quirky almost Douglas Adams-esque style. However, I found the isometric perspective just too much, for me making jumps nigh on impossible and leaving me extremely frustrated. The store page says it is inspired by some games I've never played, so I might be missng out on a nostalgia factor here. \n\nFirst game I've ever requested a refund for, I wouldn't recommend it.
