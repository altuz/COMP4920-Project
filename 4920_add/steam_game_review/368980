I'm also happy to add my own extremely positive review to the game.\n\nI initially started playing as Ki, due in part to the skin and the fact that she was the first character I got to play as. Started messing around with the 5 turn games, and got my ass handed to me by everyone else. I thought that it surely had to be the character. Unlocked 1 or 2 other characters, and tried them as well. Still got my ass handed to me. Then, I decided to try the Trials. Went back to Ki.\n\nFirst 4 fights were easy, and then the last 1 took me 3 or 4 tries. And that's when the magic happened. Instead of actively trying to make random matches, I started playing to the strengths of Ki's abilities. And lo and behold: it worked! \n\nUnlocked a few auras, messed around a bit, got 1 I liked up to level 2, and practiced a bit more in Trial mode and  that 5 turn mode. What a blast! Moved on to Ranked matches, and managed to get up to Silver Rank 1, with a win streak of about 7 or 8 matches, I think. \n\nWith the initial 500 Gem allotment, and the fact that the game is liberal in giving you these Gems for victories, and even a few for defeats, unlocking the Auras and Skins doesn't require godlike skill, just some perseverance. And perseverance is always made easier if the game is fun, which it sure as hell is! I've seen no bugs or crashes, and the artwork in the game is beautiful on all characters.\n\nA special mention to the community so far, as well. Every opponent I've played against so far, has been gracious in defeat, and humble in victory. \n\nThe game has a solid base for what it is, and can easily be transformed into a massively engrossing affair. An absolute steal at the current price, and worth it if you enjoy the Match-3 gameplay style. Wicked Fun: you really live up to your name with this one so far!

Why ? Sparky is hard to beat, its a OP-character: He has a normal skill which gives the opponent 2 turns less out of 5 in unranked mode (40%!) or 3 seconds less (30%) in ranked mode, here are 10 seconds per turn. This skill is overhelmded OP because you can cast it every turn - I lose 80% of my games to Sparky and also I win 80% of my games when I use Sparky.\nNow the next part: Since the patch there is a bug when you cast a skill that nothing happens and the game cant go on anymore - you need to lose the game by yourself over options or close it any lose it.
