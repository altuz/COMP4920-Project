It started as a comprehensive simulation of a starship command, down to crew and food, and weapons, and trading and planets and fleet that starships moving all around you, doing their own things, and you can help your own side in the war effort. In Angle of Attack, you are down to one planet, with jump gates that takes you to other parts of the planet, and you can attack or defend as you wish against the humankind's nemesis, the Gamulons. \n\nIn practice, the game essentially has you playing lone wolf attacking things when you can and dying here and there then respawn to do it all over again. There are bazillion different combinations of weapons and crafts, but they don't really feel that different. Flightwise, controls are difficult, as the vehicles transition between VTOL (hover) and high-speed flight almost without warning, and missile avoidance is a matter of luck. You rarely if ever see friendlies and there seem to be no strategy to the miliary, making you feel as if you're just playing in someone else's sandbox. \n\nAll in all, I should have expected this as MOTS, as that's the same feeling I got from playing BC3K (and its various incarnations, such as \"Universal Combat\")."}, {"votes_down": 13, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1436218397, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525118", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 25, "recommendationid": "16916652", "votes_up": 36, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009549547", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1414328049, "num_games_owned": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 19}, "timestamp_updated": 1436218397, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The worst monetary decision i've ever made...\n\n\n\nyes, worse than a selfie stick."}]}
