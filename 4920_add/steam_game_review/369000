Very ellpitical and vertical jump hard to control. Hard to evaluate depth in first person. Hard to adjust jumps in mid air. Controls \"stick\" (e.g. you press W for forward let go of it and you character \"slides\" forward for a second before stopping as if you had kept pushing the input). Audio was not well recorded or the sampling suffered some with vacuum like silences in between notes that irritates the ear. The only gun you have has strange laser recoil going, aiming is imprecise, and both yours and the foe's projectiles are slow and boring. Goal is to platform around until you reach exit/pillar of light and get another level in the middle of nowhere recycling the same assets. Xbox360 pad bindings were so poor I had to give up and use KB+M. You actually have to use shoulder buttons to look left and right.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503698049, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503698205, "recommendationid": "34490856", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503123", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 117, "total_reviews": 167, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 50}}
