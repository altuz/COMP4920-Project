Now, with a fittingly appropriate new name and a few tweaks here & there Slain ' Back From Hell ' was resurrected once more. It's style reminded me of classics of old, such as Ghost 'n Goblins / Altered Beast / Splatter House, with it's distinct levels & imaginative bosses. Here, the developers have stitched all that together with a sprinkling of the bloody macabre & thumps you with head banging Heavy Metal rifts, producing an all together new kind of beast. On reflection, the game is still cursed with sluggish & poorly thought out controls, which frequently hinders the fluidity this game deserves to be dishing out. Added to that is it's unforgiving difficulty, where you feel like you're just progressing through sheer luck, rather than any skill gleaned by perseverance. Its a shame, as this game has a lot of good ideas going for it, and I wanted this game to succeed. If more blood, sweat & tears from the developers were applied, it would have remedied all these shortfalls. I hope it's successor ' Valfaris ' fares far better, and the lessons are learned.  As it stands, Slain: Back from Hell will remain a game worthy of a few minutes of your curiosity \u2026 nothing more.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505637672, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505637672, "recommendationid": "35017874", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516211", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505382221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 208, "steamid": "76561197973766362", "num_games_owned": 598}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Slain: Back from Hell is a side scrolling pixelart platformer focused on slaying masses and masses of evil monsters that slowly walk at you with a strong heavy metal vibe to it all. Despite its fantastic aesthetic and highly polished finish it ultimately lacks substance and ends up feeling slightly limp.\n\nSlain makes a fantastic impression right out of the gate. You play as some guy whom name escapes me who is raised by a spirit to cleanse the land of the evil forces that have invaded. You step out of your tomb and the aesthetic is instantly clear: this game is a strong homage to classic thrash and death metal albums of the 80s and early 90s. This is not your streetwise thrash-core or nu metal personal dramas, this is right out of a Kreator, Celtic Frost, Possessed or even Emperor album, severed heads on spikes fighting rotting skeletons and demonic beholders. If you are not in the grove with the metal nonsense I just spouted, think Shadow of the Beast or Ghouls and Ghosts (if old enough). Everything is smoothly animated, beautifully detailed and has an appropriate soundtrack playing in the background. The only downside to this presentation may well be the somewhat tongue in cheek dialogue, but it reeks more of self aware over the top metal lyrics than bad, ironic text, so I let it slide, after all it is still better written than a Possessed lyric (Atheistic is so Mystic(?)).\n\nInitially the combat is punchy and feels powerful. Controls are responsive and hacking apart the monsters in your path is satisfactory. I understand that the initial release was a mite too simplistic and there was input delay, but with my old Xbox 360 pad I did not notice any issues.\nThe challenge is also real. You are likely to die a good number of times due to enemies being somewhat high in damage output and there being a tiny number of health refills on your path mixed with spaced apart checkpoints. When you do find a checkpoint it refreshes your full health and mana, so you need not worry about backtracking to find previous items you missed.\n\nDespite the rather fantastic start to the game things go downhill rather fast unfortunately. After the bloodgrounds opening level, the pacing keeps running well with a nicely challenging boss for new players and is followed by the blood tower: a Castlevania 1 style climb from the base of the tower to the summit, activating lifts and some simple jumping puzzles made challenging by assorted flying enemies with knockback and projectile hurling monsters complicating things, eventually leading to the peak. Here you fight two tough enemies, which you just fought slightly below.\nFrom this point on the game's sence of pacing and progression plateaus. The Highlands is more or less the same as the Bloodgrounds, and the Wolf moor (I forget the name) is very similar with a fun chase sequence thrown in. Gameplay wise it feels more akin to Shadow of the Beast than anything else, the tower climbs and bosses being the exceptions. You run right, hit things till they are dead, then run right some more. A big enemy appears, you learn to parry their moves, and you continue. This then repeats over and over with little to no platforming or variance in the combat. There are special powers where you can imbue your weapon with elements, but that just gives a slight boost to damage against some enemies (witches hate fire, wolves hate frost). In that there are two things: Power up and hit multiple enemies, parry big ones and riposte them, mash skellies and so forth. In this the game just feels too long for what it offers. That mixed with reputation doing the same sections over and over when a mistake is made does wear down patience. I can tolerate repeating parts, Dark Souls and Super Meatboy taught me that, but here fighting the same 5 enemies over and over due to the more ponderous combat eventually wore me down.\n\nThis is a thumbs down, and I really dont want to do that, but it is so very hard to advise for most people. If you are a big fan of 80s metal, give this a shot and see if you can spot the references. Its better than just cheap meme crap referring to PewDiePie or whatnot. Aside from that I can't really advise this game unless you REALLY loved Shadow of the Beast.\nConceptually awesome, and really meaty!
