Just.. Just no... This game really isn't too great. First off, we die when we haven't even done anything. And trust me, this isn't only going to happen once or twice, this happens literally every two fucking minutes. I actually tried to make it for more than two minutes, but the fucking fighting mechanic is garbage, worse than the 2015 Godzilla game, but this is just shit. The only thing wrong in that game was the fighting mechanic, but seriously, this game is even worse. Why can we only be a lion? What about a tiger, or a leopard? Hell, why not even the Predator himself? That's the reason I bought this game. Can we please get a decent simulator that isn't a ripoff of Goat Simulator? If you're looking for a game where you play as a predator, this isn't the one to buy. I might've thought this might've been that mobile game where you could play as animals from Africa and dinosaurs like Spinosaurus, Tyrannosaurus Rex, etc. But no, of course it wasn't... Just don't buy this, it's not worth the three dollars.

The price tag wasn't huge, but with as many games as I've played, I know what I can reasonably expect for that price. I posted a short review stating my opinion, to which the developer, GameIndica, responded almost immediately. Combining my input with that of others, he released not one, but two launch day patches which addressed most of our concerns. Any developer who cares that much about customer feedback has his heart in the right place. This alone helped me feel that he more than earned not only my $6, but also a better review. So here's the skinny:\n\nBasics\n  This is a small game about being a lion eating everything that moves. I'd call it more of an arcade game than a simulator. The basic objective is to convince the population that you are as great a threat as possible (raising DEFCON levels) in order to earn the biggest rewards (coins and diamonds)  which you can then invest in upgrades to make your lion more deadly. \n\nVisuals\n  The graphics get the job done, but won't blow you away. The art style is like a children's cartoon show, with bright colors and bobble-headed characters (except also with blood and corpses). Some of the character models are funny enough on their own that they made me smile. Animations are amusing enough, but can get repetitive after a while.\n\nSounds\n  The screams and shouts coming from the NPCs definitely add to amusement factor. Like the graphics, they're cartoony and fun. Though technically not sounds, the little speech bubbles that pop up on screen have some pretty funny memes to offer. The atmospheric sounds do their job nicely, adding a layer of depth without being obtrusive. Music is not present, which is fine by me. I usually end up turning off music in a game like this in favor of internet radio or something. Eating people to the sounds of The Prodigy, for example, is a great time :)\n\nControls\n  The controls are a little wonky at first, but they are basic enough that I got used to them quickly. I strongly recommend a gamepad. Gamepad recognition is quick and easy. Just turn it on at any point before or during play - no menu options to set up. The controls feel good once you've gotten used to them. Running with your lion at top speed (after all speed upgrades) is genuinely fun, and lunging at three or four targets, killing them all, is very satisfying.\n\nGameplay\n  Overall, this little game will probably provide you with a few good hours of late night entertainment. This is just the kind of thing I like after a long day and a few beers - light arcade-style gameplay that doesn't require a huge time investment or mental focus. The upgrade system feels a little limited and some expansion of it would add replay value. \n\nOverall\n7/10 - Not a masterpiece, but a fun offering from a new developer. If this appeals to you and you want to expand your library, you'll probably be happy with what you get for the $6 price tag, but if you're on the fence I'd recommend buying it on sale. The developer's quick and positive response to criticism definitely made this into a \"thumbs up\" review and give me reason to look forward to future releases from him.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431731202, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432479044, "recommendationid": "15845756", "language": "english", "votes_down": 31, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492157", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1432007364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 37, "steamid": "76561198166383016", "num_games_owned": 51}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This game is so much fun to play.

I'm going to explain what the best parts are about this game right now!\n\nFirst of all, when you play the game the quality is set to the best one which games don't really do. If you click outside the window in windowed mode then the game will actually pause which I think is a really nice feature to have. It loads quickly (even quicker than modern console and PC games do) and has a nice main menu. The process of getting from the menu to the game is really quick because you are already at the place the game starts at. The animals are easy to kill so you don't have to worry about them that much. The graphics are perfect for the sort of game and the cartoon like physics just make it even better. The controls can be hard to master at first but soon you will be a true lion going around and eating people. One of the most funniest moments is when people sometimes glitch out and their model stretches everywhere which has now been fixed :(\n\nThe hunger makes you think about whether you should go somewhere isolated or not without upgrades. The game play is so great and everyone should play it. Let me reword that: PLAY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!\n\n(Also why do people not like a review that is positive?)\n\nAs a note: I will not change this review just because a lot of people hate this game. I like it so there is no point to get me to change anything.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431724172, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1432051652, "recommendationid": "15844512", "language": "english", "votes_down": 142, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.365607", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
