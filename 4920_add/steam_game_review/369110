I really do. The aesthetic is fun, the levels are generated well, and the main conceit of having 100 days to get ready for the big \"job\" is exciting and interesting.\n\nAll of these great things are marred by poor gameplay. Movement is imprecise and buggy, with the character sliding along sloped floors unable to jump. You have very little control over the height of your jump, making the precision jumps you sometimes need to avoid detection very hard to use. Your speed and control in mid-air is wildly inconsistent, sometimes launching you haphazardly into the sights of a patrolling robot and sometimes failing to jump from one wall to another leading you to land in a bed of spikes. \n\nLike any other rogue-like/lite, you'll die. A lot. But it will often feel like it wasn't your fault. It often won't even feel like it was the level, or randomness's fault. Just the fault of bad controls.\n\nOverall, a really fun concept with tons of potential has been kind of ruined for me because of extremely loose controls.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499796433, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499796433, "recommendationid": "33461825", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531438", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 162, "total_reviews": 256, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 94}}
