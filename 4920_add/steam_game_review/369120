As a prequel to the Invisible Apartment game, once again we are in the shoes of Kasey, a young hacker in a light cyberpunk setting, as her hacking leads leads her to find out things some would rather she didn't uncover.\n\nBefore I say anything else, if you haven't played the original Invisible Apartment, it is on steam, and it is -free-.  I would recommend playing that game first, as it establishes the protagonist well and my review is aimed at those who have already played the free chapter.\n\nMechanically, Zero is identical to its free counterpart. The quicksave button won't give you feedback on whether the quicksave worked or not, so, as with the other installment, clicking MENU in order to manually save is your best bet. I also found that sometimes my clicks wouldn't register in the game, though that also happened with the other chapter and it's possible that it's on my end rather than a game issue.\n\nI was also a bit frustrated with some of the failure states, as some of the choices, from my experience at least, seemed similar enough that discerning the correct option was less about deduction and more about guess and check.  Additionally, your choices might lead you to a few small differences in events, but the major structure of the story won't budge from your input.  To me this isn't much of an issue, but I imagine it could be frustrating to some.  \n\nThe soundtrack is solid, mostly ambient tones to fit the game, but I thought they worked well.  (As a side note I have no idea where to find the soundtrack on the game's website, and if they have officially posted it somewhere I don't know where that would be.) The artwork is also fitting of the game's tone, and the art style is well represented by the screenshots on the store page. Whether you like the artwork or not is rather subjective so there isn't much to say, other than I appreciated it.\n\nZero is not a long game, as I beat it in about an hour.  While I like the character of Kasey and enjoyed the game myself, I don't really see myself picking it up for another playthrough anytime soon. Like I said before, the story won't change much from your choices (as far as I can tell,) so i don't see a ton of value in going back and trying to see what few bits I missed.  \n\nA six dollar price tag isn't huge by any stretch, but for the length of an hour it might not be what everyone is willing to shell out. I personally thought it was worth the money to see a younger and less confident version of Kasey, but to each their own.\n\ntldr: Hesitant Recommendation.  If you wanted to know more about Kasey's character and appreciated the (FREE) original game then Zero complements the other chapter well. That said, the different story and slightly longer length are the only real changes to the game from the first installment; so if you took some issues with the scope of choice or other aspects of design in the original, then you'll find them here as well. \n\nIt was short, but I enjoyed the first game for it's story and protagonist, so it's no real suprise I enjoyed this prequel chapter as well.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431059245, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1431059870, "recommendationid": "15735623", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545420", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459630596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 385, "playtime_forever": 152, "steamid": "76561198120348301", "num_games_owned": 791}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Like I said on my review of the first chapter, the interface of this VN doesn\u2019t match its atmosphere. It\u2019s too simple, and to be really honest, kinda annoying (the text box is basically transparent, and the letters are plain white. It\u2019s hard to read stuff sometimes)\u2026 But anyway, leaving that technical detail aside. \n\nThe writing doesn\u2019t make much sense in a few scenes; like on the beginning, with Joel [spoiler]being taken away[/spoiler]. It felt too rushed, I barely had time to fully understand what was happening. It\u2019s a short VN, and like other people said here, the choices are basically just \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d. The ending was pretty dull too. The art style was ok, BG was good, and BGM was pretty nice. Characters are quite plain tho, I couldn\u2019t feel sympathy for any of them (not even Kacey).\n\n3/10. It\u2019s too expensive for what it\u2019s offering, get it only on a good sale if you really liked the first game. Overall, I simply don\u2019t recommend this VN, but I\u2019ll keep reading the next chapters to see if things will get better.
