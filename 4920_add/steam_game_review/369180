Though you can still play through the main campaign and some extras, there are a number of features that utilize daily counters.  However with the game abandoned, these features never unlock on the next day - the counters remain infinite.  And for those few who like to pay for in game currency to help get items faster, the ability to purchase said currency is no longer available.  Not a negative for myself, but can be for others.\n\nThe gameplay itself is entertaining only within the first couple stages.  After that its \"clunkiness\" begins to wear on you.  Go play Diablo III instead.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495932518, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495932518, "recommendationid": "32008718", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504614", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 8}}
