It's one of the many problems with this software. It doesn't shut down. It doesn't save. It doesn't respond to clicks or buttons or let you place objects. It freezes and it crashes. It is completely unusable on my AMD FX 8350 Machine running RX 480 on 16 gb of Tritan X ram. I've had several problems with Steam not supporting the purchasers right to working software. I reported it within hours of buying it, only to get a message back later saying I have used it more than the 2 hrs they allow, which is untrue. I researched the issue thoroughly to try and fix the matter myself. Still it doesn't work. I am going to get a refund through my bank and will not buy anymore software from steam outside of specific titles I know of on the game's end where these issues are no prevailant. Steam does not care about their customers, if they did, they would make sure to protect their purchasers and to reinforce certain rules with their developers. I spent $44 on this software with hopes of getting my ideas down to a visible project as I re-enter the coding arena for the first time in decades. \n\nSo Steam and Devs, if you notice your sales going down, and particularly you notice now that my purchases are effectively halved here since the first issue arose months ago (BEEN HERE SINCE THE BEGINING MYSELF AND AM ON MULTIPLE ACCTS AS I HAVE KIDS THAT DO NOT LIVE WITH ME BUT I MAINTAIN ACCTS FOR THEM), now you know why. You are the very example of corporate greed and corruption that is making the world burn and killing the industry for us all. \n\nHere's proof of my claim: \n\nHello Lord Siidius\t\nWe have reviewed your refund request.\nWe are unable to refund this purchase to your ****  at this time. Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum).\n \nShoot 'Em Up Kit\t- Playtime: 4 hours 43 minutes\n \nPurchased: Apr 3, 2017 PDT\n\nIt did not, but you can't get a real person on the phone for STEAM, which should be a red flag for anyone who wishes to spend money anywhere. Text support = no support. I have moved my main purchases elsewhere, and strongly suggest anyone reading this do the same as this behavior left unchecked will only worsen with time. \n\nThanks.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492212355, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1492212355, "recommendationid": "31145535", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513810", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 4}}
