Looking at its current state it's easy to say Minecraft + Quake. But being a creative game like this it's really up to you to decide what you make out of it.[/b]\n\n+ A few weapons to test out and possibly have your friend join to have a little frag fest in a custom made map\n+ The different themes for each map allows the creator to have a decent range of customizability (for now, very early in its current state, great potential)\n+ Art style is unique especially the 'grid' system\n+ Graphics are pretty solid\n+ You can use buttons & wires to make trap doors in a custom arena map that you can also make (I smell a Deathrun game type/map)\n\nI'm very happy to help support this game and its developer. I see a lot of potential for a game like this. Being made by only 1 person it may take a bit of time, but regardless of how long development takes, at this games current state it's definitely playable & enjoyable. Also the price tag is great as well. :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446697938, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1446700786, "recommendationid": "18885712", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526053", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475284641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2179, "steamid": "76561198122944962", "num_games_owned": 232}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "With like 25h played, I think it's time for a little review.\n\nFirst of all, I want to remind people this game is still in Early Access, and yes, it is still a bit \"quiet\" so to speak. \n\nBut, this game is pretty friggin' awesome! \nYou play a robot that can jump, run and shoot. That's it :)\nSee this game as a Quake vs. Minecraft\nYou get the Quake (team) deathmatches and the building blocks from Minecraft, neatly packed into a futuristic look.\n\nThere are some small islands available to choose from before starting to build, or you can build completely from scratch out at sea. Place and rotate blocks, give them different colours (like a red base for the red team and blue for the blue team) and several other colours in between. \nHopefully added is a simple \"colour pad\" where you can choose your desired colour as for now it is a bit limited.\nThere's foliage that you can plant, also on the metal-looking blocks, you can adjust the lighting for different themes and change the day/night cycle. \n\nYou can make traps with fire, hidden doors, teleports, jump-pads, lava basins, dripping acid, you can add timers to normally invisible \"light paths\", or have them constantly on, or with pauses, and it all works pretty straight-forward!\nYou can do the tutorial, but you don't have to be a genious to figure out basic building, not even with (timed) traps/constructions!\n\nI'm impressed with how well things work so far, the looks (Unity) a pretty good and the lighting effects are nice. \nThe textures are really quite well (not so pixely as Minecraft) and the movements, also in build-mode very well working.\nFor those who love that everything connects, this game, too, is awesome as round objects such as arches merge prefectly with square blocks placed on top and on the sides! \n\nHere's hoping that more options will be added to the game during the course of development (I'm not sure but I think it's just 1 guy doing this! That's impressive!!) and that the game will catch on so we can all look forward to old-school Quake-like Death Matches!\n\nBefore I forget: It says \"Create your own sports\", but as there are no really movable objects most ideas don't work out. \nYou can, for example, make a sort of \"dodgeball\" with guns instead of balls, but I think it'd be cool if there are movable objects, such as a ball, so (obviously with guns) you have to try and shoot the ball (literally) into a goal. \n\nConclusion: If you still have a soft-spot for old-school shooters such as Quake, and you love designing your own levels that you can share (either editable or non-editable) with the community, it's worth buying the game! It's really not that expensive and you will have a lot of fun designing, running through your levels, expand, change, adjust, run around again, place guns, shoot at your placed targets to open secret doors to rooms with better guns, and when you're satisfied that it all works: share :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463843263, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1463843263, "recommendationid": "23118329", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498177", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503372248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1143, "steamid": "76561198052753078", "num_games_owned": 296}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Now, I've played this game for nearly 2 hours when writing this review and it was the first time I have played, so let's get started with my first impressions and then follow through to a pros and cons section.\n\nFirst Impressions:\nSo I first launched the game and found myself a launcher for it. I was a bit confused as I thought that the game would throw me right in. I hit the play button and nothing happened. \"What?\" I thought to myself as I quickly googled the problem and found no solution. I continued to attempt to \"repair\" and \"redownload\" the game from the launcher to no success. I then decided to check to see if the game was downloaded correctly from steam though the \"Verify Game Cache\" function in the games properties. I did this and found out that 7 files had not been downloaded. Withing 2-3 seconds I had those files and went back into the launcher of the game. It worked! I could download the game with no issues and finally got in. \n\nOnce the menu loaded I was blown away. The game, although in an early access stage, still had a very nice and sleek looking menu. The game looked and navigated quite professionally and is substantually better than some other early access games I have tried. After a bit of fiddling I managed to get the graphics to what my computer could run them at (max basically) and then decided to load up a world! \n\nI was feeling a tab bit lazy so I decided to load up somebody else's creation. Very easy and simple to use navigation allowed me to load up somebody else's map that they had created. I could edit it, play on it, and even interact with it. From what I can see, nothing was missing from the user created map and everything was working just fine. From here on I got very excited. I wanted to make my own map. A map I could call home.\n\nI loaded up a new map and got to work. After about an hour of learning the controls I had finally gotten a hang of it! I flew around adding blocks, destroying blocks, placing enemies, placing guns, and of course, placing jump pads. I finished a bit of my map with many jumping parkour areas and some more difficult jump pad areas to reach. Overall I got a fun map that I played on by myself for some time. I then decided that this wasn't enough. I needed a bit more of something \"cool\". I went into the menu to see what I could grab for myself and found hidden doors. Well, I used them as floors. \n\nOnce my map was finished I decided to see what else I could do with the game. The maps options were quite in depth with details such as: Gravity, Time of Day, Theme, and also Day/Night rotation being possible within the options. With my map done I decided to hop off the game and write a review, because overall the game amazed me. The graphics (although not spoken about much in this review, or even at all) are quite amazing and look very sleek. The character customization is fun and all of the weapons (although only a few so far) are perfect for an arena style shooter. \n\nNow for the pros and cons:\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\nGreat graphics\nFun gameplay\nGood progress in the games development\nEasy sharing of your games\nHas mutliplayer functionality (although I haven't explored it yet)\nHas good plans for the future of it's development\nDeveloper shows good knowledge of creating games\nCan be played alone/Co-Op/Multiplayer/ in PvE or PvP\nMany fun user created maps for the game\nRelatively cheap to buy and well worth it!\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\nIt is only a 1 man developer team which worries me if he loses interest in developing the game.\nThe use of an independant launcher is cool, however steam updates would be a lot easier to keep track of from the users perspective.\nNo publically hosted games on official servers.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458387636, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1458387636, "recommendationid": "21921485", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504044", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460040664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 187, "steamid": "76561198006574969", "num_games_owned": 248}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Im not used to writing Reviews but i feel like this game needs some recognition.\nFirst of the game is really beautiful.

The go to the tagged game because fuck its amazing :D\nAtm its even 50% off for the coming days (at time of review) to making it the cheapest non-thinker purchase ever!\n\nImagine Minecraft, except it was polished 3D whereby you had the choice to either make beautifull projects with realistic looks..... \nYou could make a large quake-like map, set deathmatch settings and place weapon and armor spawners to turn your map into an amazing third/firstperson shooter .. or make an adventuremap using complicated technical logic that trows the Minecraft version of Tekkit out of the window for being to easy. OOORRRR.. you can do all of that at the same time! Your choice!\n\nSo far the blocks and features added can keep you busy for quite a while but regardless of the development only having 1 developer, updates are very solid and steady while the developer is very active in listening to feedback and bugreports. The roadmap also looks sweet as hell.\n\nAs can be seen in the community hub of the game, so far there have been amazing creations.
