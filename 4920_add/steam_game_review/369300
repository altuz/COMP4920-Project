In the tutorial the narrator suggests you to look around the tree house for things to interact with and instead of rewarding you for doing that, NONE of the interactable objects actually does anything. Then you go in the candy kindom, there you can interact with ALL house doors and mailboxes and NONE of them actually does anything, and the (unskippable) comments Finn and Jake give for them are the same for each one... so boring.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the \"solution to the investigation\" with PB, because there, after answering the same (unskippable) questions and dialogs for the 4th time, I just rage quitted the game and asked for refund.\n\nBottom line is: if in an adventure game most of the objects you can interact with are actually boring, you end up not wanting to explore anymore, and exploration is the core of point and click games... this is how I felt playing this game... annoyed, railroaded, bored.
