The game contains 80 puzzles/levels, 40 playing as the humans fighting the beasts and 40 more as the beasts fighting the humans. The majority of the human puzzles can be won without losing any units, which is a fun optional challenge if you like that sort of stuff. Overall it's a nicely balanced game that's fun to play in short bursts between doing other things.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500592929, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500592929, "recommendationid": "33683931", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
