I enjoy chess and I really enjoy the chess type units.  I feel the game needs a hero or a General a unit that has huge hit pts.  The fog of war needs to go.  I feel a 5k army is needed up front.  I made it up to a 1700 pts army.  The only problem is I was wiped out in two turns due to the fog of war.  The AI killed my entire army without my having a chance to fight back.  Crossbow cannot move at all.  Weird.  Units should beable to move at least 4 hex?  Zero, one or two is strange.  And I have no cav. units to build at all.  So if you enjoy the AI at a nightmare level and are unable up front  to build units that can survive this is the ticket.  I own the game I will keep the game, I would not buy it again .  Have fun. They have had close to 10 years to fix this possible great game.
