Wow, just wow. That pretty much says all there is to say about this game. The first thing everyone says about this game is look at the graphics and you are right these are some graphics. This game looks exactly like my memory of the original Operation Flashpoint but with pixelated sprites corpse-walking around like they were drilled day and night by assholes from Vienna. These devs are serious about muskets and it shows but they need to make friends with someone who went to art school--and not art school at community college this needs to be an art student in serious debt. Just one would do the trick & make this game look like something you could sell your dad on. \n\nPeople who know me know I am serious about my grogs & this game has pretty much all the grogs you could have. First off there are hundreds and hundreds of soldiers shooting at each other in this game & most of it has nothing to do with you. This game is what it feels like to get serious about commanding a division of Austrians & when you look around there are frogs everywhere with sharp things and Prussions in the distance getting serious and I really can't say much more than that about this game.\n\nThe best thing I can say about this game is that it is halfway to Graviteam Tactics style 1800s shit. This game models a lot of stuff and I'm not even sure about a third of it. This game is a simulation if you ever needed stimulated if you went out and tweeked a reenactor and then did the same thing in this game you would see that these devs are serious but have no idea about even simple art design this game has an interface that looks like your gramps made it in knock-off photoshop & that is not even hyperboll.", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1501643821, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501643821, "recommendationid": "33962598", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 37, "total_reviews": 50, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 13}}
