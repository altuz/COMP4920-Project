I know you've already talked about controls but, I do want to say that there are way too many of them.  Still playable but the the shift/alt/ctl commands make it very hard for someone to get into it.  If you're someone who just came from playing the X games the space bar will drive you mad.\n\nNOTES:\n-change the roll keys to Q and E\n-change thrust up and down to CTRL and space (that was the part that made me feel wonky when I played becuase I can't change the the command keys.)\n-change ENTER to tac command and SHIFT+ENTER to overworld\n-BACKSPACE to zero speed (It's easier to remember if you want to stop than the botton under it.)\n-change SEC FIRE and MISSLE to R and/or F\n-change X to the lock nearest target\n-change C to change target\n-change Z to your thrust compensator\n\nI think those might be a little more user friendly\n\nSide Note:\nThe spacebar I think most people might just be use to pressing it to pull up the \"mouse arrow\" that's the only reason it drove me mad.  Kept going in and out of tac mode and trying to click targets.  Wanted to do the RTS double click to attack but it wouldn't let me.\n\n\nI'm just one of those people more use to the middle mouse button scroller being my thruster controls and WASD/QE being my up/left/down/right and  roll keys. \n\nIf any of this helped or is already know to you. I'm happy to try and help or just give Ideas.\n\nThank you and keep up the good work!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505184163, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505184562, "recommendationid": "34893975", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509367", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506093464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 223, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 617, "steamid": "76561197961559698", "num_games_owned": 334}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Great little game, gives me flashbacks to X3 but far more steamlined and simpler to figgure out. it can be a bit slow to startout but once you get a medium sized ship(not fighter) the game takes off. i would overall recommend this to anyone who likes the X-series but doesnt like the over complexity of them", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505146495, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505146495, "recommendationid": "34885726", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506719670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 346, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 346, "steamid": "76561198063520334", "num_games_owned": 102}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Awesome Game,\nits for everyone who likes space games, rts games, shooters.\n\nGraphics are similar to Borderlands and perfectly fit in the genre.\n\nHere my first impressions:\n\n- the battles are challenging like in Void Destroyer 1\n- the new overworld mode (long distance traveling) is clear and practical\n- you start with a small fighter and a few missions later (don't increase the difficulty if you start VD2) you will have money for your first upgrades, took me 3-4 hour for buying my next ship, so it's motivating, also in the early-game\n- the controls are fully mapable.
