Unfortunately, my inventory items disappeared multiple times in between levels. Completely unacceptable, game-breaking bug. Also, it's not possible to use the controller to navigate the menus - very weird/erratic behavior, no way to tell where your cursor will move to when you try to move up, down, left, right.

A combination of frustrating design decisions and occasional severe bugs makes this into an unpleasant experience, and if one continues playing until one has beaten the game, it's more likely due to stubbornness than enjoyment.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, combat is tedious, a boring cycle of killing weak enemies that take too long to dispatch while waiting to find a weapon upgrade which may or may not ever materialize. Later in the game, most actual threats feel as though their danger comes from clumsy game mechanics rather than appropriate challenge. Various aspects of the game feel unpolished; a shop appears at the beginning of the game when the player cannot possibly have anything to sell or any money to spend, the visual indication of the boundary of the level is much too subtle, etc. \n\nFinally, frustrating bugs often take what enjoyment there is out of the experience. Sometimes, after finishing a level, all real progress will be lost; score is reset and items and upgrades are gone (seems to happen most frequently when alt-tabbing during level end). Some enemies can be rendered impossible to kill (an abyss enemy in the -goblin family has an invulnerable portion and a vulnerable portion; usually these can be killed by depleting their vulnerable portions' health and then harpooning them off, but a Berserk elite has enough bonus health to actually survive this process, leaving only the invulnerable portion to swim around and attack indefinitely). Finally, the game actually crashed after finishing the final level, so I have no idea whether there is supposed to be an end-game sequence, and I've no patience left to find out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501393775, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501393877, "recommendationid": "33897694", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498588", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503578345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 51, "steamid": "76561198028270900", "num_games_owned": 182}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Rouge-like ?
