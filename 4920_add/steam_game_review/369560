Great intuitive secrets with amazing and innovative puzzles along with cute graphics and a good variety of loot. I love that your items can combine to make some really strong new passives! The dungeons differ from each other greatly and I feel like the bosses are interesting. At some points in the game you will end up looking like a rainbow, with your screen exploding and shaking and your character running around like a mad man. Love it, love it, love it!

They don't require strategy to kill for the most part, just go up to them and slash. That's it, which makes going through rooms just monotonous (though there are a few exceptions)\n-No item descriptions. I kinda got spoiled from Enter the Gungeon because that game has so many items and their descriptions are humorous, while giving you an idea of what the item/weapon did. Anyway, back to the topic, you need to add something that gives us an idea of what the items do.\n-IMO dashing should be in the direction you're moving, not the direction you're looking. (Again, EtG spoiled me)\n\nGranted, I only played the game for like 30 mins as of writing this, but I still think my review holds up.\nDespite all of that, I'm still giving this game a thumbs up, cause I really do want to see where this goes.\nThis game has potential, but it's not there yet.
