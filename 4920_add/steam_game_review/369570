Now i am a fan of difficult games i played super hexagon, dark souls, demon souls, dank suits 2, all the touhou's and those have a learning curve and the deaths in those games dont feel half as cheap as the one's in this game and most of the time its because grandma wont turn the car fast enough. \nSo there if you find this game's concept enjoyable buy the 200-in-1 version and buy the sound track its a way better use of your money.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451344737, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451344737, "recommendationid": "20049761", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505618", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436744279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 15, "steamid": "76561197963692483", "num_games_owned": 202}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Grab the soundtrack; skip the game.  \n\nchipzel's soundtrack is amazing and absolutely worth the download.

This game could and should be so much better but instead it feels like so much wasted potential.\n\nThe controls are terrible: You'll be sliding dramatically left and right even with the slightest press of the controls, as if the entire game is covered in a thick sheet of ice. In a game where obstacles are often placed in rapid succession, this makes it almost impossible to actually avoid everything. If you're lucky, you'll grind off the side of something and get bonus points. If you're not, you'll bounce off of the very same thing and fly off the track, immediately ending the level.\n\nThe levels are procedurally generated in such a way that you can get a different track even when playing the same stage at a different time, so while this adds some variety it also makes the game feel even more inconsistent. It feels like the the music should be synced to the gameplay but it never is. This might be in part because the start-of-level animation also starts the music, meaning you can skip up to 15 seconds of the song just by letting that play out.\n\nThere are plenty of smaller quirks that make the game feel unsatisfying and frustrating. If it detects a controller, you can't interact with the game using keyboard and mouse at all; it will refuse to cooperate. When using keyboard and mouse, you have to use the keyboard in the game but the mouse to navigate everything else: you can't use mouse controls like in Audiosurf and there is no way to quickly replay a level or advance to the next without using the mouse. Smaller issues, such as an in-game timer that always shows 0 tenths of a second, pale in comparison to the greater problems with this title.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451974296, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451974647, "recommendationid": "20315122", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436854265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561197974166381", "num_games_owned": 513}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "review": "You call this a racing game, but I know an endless runner when I see one.
