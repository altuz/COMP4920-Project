For a twitch reflexes based game this is unnacceptable incompetence", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495661641, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505094736, "recommendationid": "31941664", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
