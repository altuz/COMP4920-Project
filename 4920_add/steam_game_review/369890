Although the game can be frustrating, if you are a fan of that era of gaming you will probably enjoy what is on offer here (moreso if you are into Halloween / creature feature creepers as well,) however if you aren't a big fan of that kind of aesthetic you will probably get bored with this game very quickly as its gameplay and presentation are pretty thin. \n\nThe game itself is surprisingly grindy, and at first the game was really getting on my nerves with how many bullets the enemies take to eliminate.  Your default guns / weapons are very piddly and weak against the always-encroaching throng of zombies, demon bunnies, and floating skulls, making for an initially-frustrating experience before you use the game's currency to upgrade your weapon. Even after leveling up your gun, however, the effects from the gun don't change all that much and seem to just be a slightly wider or more damaging machine gun.    \n\nThe gameplay itself consists of little more than what you would find in similar SHMUP games, kiting the enemies around the screen and avoiding their projectile attacks and hitboxes, while using the occassional bomb / screen-clearing pickup or a time freeze which locks enemies in place and allows you to get around them easier. These two items are essential to completing certain sections of the levels as the screen can become VERY crowded with enemies and makes navigating them an exercise in precision and frustration in equal measure. At first I was pissed off that the UI would hide where enemies are (before discovering it can be toggled off and on) such as obscuring an enemy sprite spawning behind the icon of how many kills you've done, or behind the icon for the TNT screen-clearing item. This UI / HUD can be toggled off and on by pressing select on the controller, however having to swap between the two to check your life total and/or whether you have any of the special items to use can become annoying when the UI elements could have just been scaled down to avoid this back and forth. \n\nFor better or worse you have no option of exploring the levels at all, and instead are shimmied along on-rails style sequences. Occassionally the camera will lock into place and you have to defend an area from a wave of zombies or defeat a boss, but as far as player agency in choosing your own path of which areas to explore there is none, and the levels follow the same linear format each time you play them. \n\nAlthough I enjoy booting this game up here and there to try my luck at not dying, I would wait until this game is on sale to snag it if you're at all interested, even as a well-done homage to retro titles, its base asking price is a little high for its simplistic gameplay and grindy nature.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503552137, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503552137, "recommendationid": "34452954", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510147", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "total_reviews": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
