Set in WW2 in and around Berlin during the Russian counterattrack you play as a sniper surrounded by enemies. Keeping it somewhat realistic, you need to stay hidden as much as possible and take out enemy soldiers from afar. Close combat is very dangerous, especially on higher difficulties. But it\u2019s not exactly a stealth game like Dishonored or Deus Ex either. You don\u2019t have some form of \u00absuperpower\u00bb that renders you nearly invisible. Once you fire your gun, chances are enemies will start homing in on your position, so moving around is often essential to avoid getting pinned down. Adding to this is the enemy AI, which can be both unpredictable and even competent at times! Enemies (usually) take cover when under fire and will occasionally choose surprising routes to get to your position. Trying to keep track of multiple enemies can be quite the challenge.\n\nThis game then is no walk in the park, but even at the highest difficulty it didn\u2019t feel unfair or undoable. You will almost certainly die from time to time, either from making a mistake or the (somewhat) arbitrary nature of the AI, but since you can save at any time it\u2019s not really an issue.\nOh, and you can also turn on bullet physics forcing you to take gravity and wind into account when firing at long range.\n\nThe campaign is also very well designed. Most of your mission goals feel meaningful and make sense. With large open maps there is also a bit of freedom to do things your own way, which I liked. \nThere are eight missions, most of them with multiple sub-missions, which adds up to 27 maps + 1 \u00absecret\u00bb mission. Each sub-mission plays out as a series of objectives that must be completed. Objectives are quite varied and range from assassinations, providing fire support and blowing up tanks to rescuing and escorting pilots out of Berlin.\n\nVisually it\u2019s showing its age, of course. It\u2019s from 2005, and wasn\u2019t particularly stunning back then either. With almost the entire game set in wartorn ruins, expect lots of drab sepia colored areas.\n\nThe sound is fine and does help with the atmosphere. Most of the maps have distant machinegun fire, explosions, screaming and engine sounds like you would expect in a warzone. Russians actually speaking Russian and Germans speaking German is a nice touch. However, the voice acting in general is incredibly flat, especially the main character.\n\nThe controls get a lot of criticism, and not without reason. First off, your character moves very oddly, almost as if iceskating. I guess they were going for inertia, but it just feels weird. Secondly, the inventory system is cumbersome to use, so using things like health packs and explosives is more of a hassle than it should be. Grenades are also a bit strange. You see a trajectory path when you throw them, but they seem to be made of rubber as they often bounce far away from where they land. You sort of get used to these things after a while though.\n\nI started out strongly disliking the game, but it actually grew on me. Sneaking around while taking out enemy soldiers can be a lot of fun. That said, anyone looking for a spectacular action game or is unwilling to forgive the slightly clunky controls should probably look elsewhere."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501967104, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501063", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34046459", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198045647847", "num_reviews": 63, "last_played": 1503727427, "num_games_owned": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 594}, "timestamp_updated": 1501967104, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good"}, {"votes_down": 26, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501816964, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474546", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34007045", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024972696", "num_reviews": 130, "last_played": 1502212826, "num_games_owned": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 113}, "timestamp_updated": 1501816964, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I got \"Sniper Elite\" as part of the full \"Sniper Elite Complete Pack.\"  If I had bought it stand-alone, I'd be pretty upset.  It's a pretty miserable game to play.  The movement is like you're sliding on ice instead of walking.  The controls are obscure and ridiculous.  The audio setting seems to reset every start (it actually just ignores the setting until you change it and then change it back).  The game is in desperate need of a frame limiter (it would play at thousands of frames per second until I downloaded and set up Riva Tuner Statistics Server (as part of MSI Afterburner) to limit that).  The tutorial is hidden under settings and is worthless.  And, the game drops you into the first mission and gives you no hint at how to do anything or what to do (except of course the hints that pop up constantly every 30 seconds or so).
