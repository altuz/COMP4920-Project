But when I got into it, the time wasn't spent on playing the game... \nIt was spent on dissecting every little aspect of gameplay mechanics up until the cultists missions.\n\nI really like dice rolling system, as a whole it's a solid 10/10 for how it \"feels\" when just jumping into the fray and letting things take their course. Attack an enemy! Hit or miss? Feels slightly more forgiving than say... Xcom. You don't have to understand how it works, it works well either way.\n\nIt's very entertaining to anyone who likes options for the sheer fact that there's options. Because there's a LOT of options. And just about any way you want to play it is valid for completing almost every mission.\n\nThere's some important information I need to impart however. If you're anything like me, you like to optimize. You like to Min/Max. You can't stand it if you complete the objective just under a perfect score. This is where I feel the game has a terrible flaw, and if the devs are still alive out there, I'd like them to take this to heart.\n\nIn order to gain new skills and equipment, you need requisition points. Requisition points are awarded upon completion of each mission you do. However, there is the possibility of earning EXTRA requisition points, and it's very clear from the size of the requisition tree that you're going to need as many points as possible. So, how do you earn the extra points for that sweet sweet \"perfect\" score? Two ways: Kill as many enemies as possible in as few turns as possible (as the score is based on an average kills per turn) AND complete the mission in general in as few turns as possible. From here, the games compatibility with all of its \"possibilities and options\" goes down the drain.\n\nPicking anything that is slower and/or safer is immediately going to be less effective in the long run. You absolutely must rush every mission while strategically picking which spots are worth stopping on to potentially snipe some poor xeno who happened to be on your speed path. The best Kills per Turn bonus I've ever gotten was 8%, and that was at 6 kills per turn. The best speed bonus you can earn is a WHOPPING 20%!! And that doesn't just apply to RP, it applies to EXP too! Getting that massive bonus is possible on almost every mission, so going without it just seems like a bad idea.\n\nNow since the goal is to go as fast as possible, this limits which character classes are valid to play with. Obviously scouts seem like the go to pick, but they're so fragile they explode instantly. Sensorkit scans supposedly keep them aware of enemies, but the scans cost as much AP as a shot and a ton of heat too. Combine this with the fact that A:running further causes more heat and B: you can't stop running because you NEED to complete the objective as fast as possible and C: you can't use sensorkits while overheated means you're out in the open just hoping that a xeno doesn't pop out the one dark tile you can't see 5 tiles away from you.\nEngineers also have sensor kits, but have far too many responsibilities to free them up, are too expensive to deploy more, and have too many skills needed to properly defend themselves AND go exploring.\nSoldiers are pretty go to with rallying charge, but they'll soon suffer heat problems and slow down.\nHydra and Neptune are fancy soldiers with a higher deploy cost, but without the soldiers practicality (Dalan Ortho 4life).\nBerserker is like the mix of your captain and paladin... good at melee attacking stuff with various buffs and debuffs but can't heal.\nPaladins are a godsend which stop for no one and don't overheat easily (until you need to start healing).\nThen there's your captain, who also stops for no one when built as a melee tank. He can speed buff himself and run through maps to do all the objectives for you.\n\nLook, I like what's here, but the game doesn't properly incentivise the use of other classes. I play this on Demanding difficulty. My sole loadout is always Captain, Dalan Ortho, and Paladin. Squad sizes are too small to make use of other classes, and the starting SP is never enough to get more than one expensive unit (which means I end up getting my pally, but never an engineer). Missions have tactical points, but the missions never last long enough for them to matter. You go in with who you have, maybe recruit 1 extra guy if there's an easy tactical point, and it's over. The game suffers from the fact that it only has the campaign (which must be rushed) and no free play.\n\n\nSOOOOO, here's my suggestions. For the reward system, make bonus objectives gives +5 bonus Exp AND Rp. For the kill system, remove the kills per turn and install a kill threshold system. I'm thinking along the lines of the threshold being hp based? So in a mission, deal 400 hp in damage as the goal, and hp is only added to the counter when the enemy is killed. Got a skittering down to 1 hp? Doesn't count. Kill it, then you get its hp value added to the counter. Going over the target value will earn bonus %, which will hit a cap (I recommend 20%, like your turn completion bonus).\n\nFor the start of missions, give out a little more starting SP. Second to this, give an option recall or add troops based on SP cost. Conversely, tweak the costs of troops so that they're cheaper, and the difference in cost isn't literally 50% of a whole unit. For some of the bigger missions you are FORCED to use some crappy soldier or scout you've never used before, but you're unable to swap them out because there's never enough starting SP. If squad sizes were a little bigger, you could decide whether you want 3 cheap units or 2 special ones.\n\nA free play or challenge mode would be nice. I would love to see how different setups fair against waves of enemies that get progressively stronger. Maybe add this mode as a reward for completing your first optional mission in the campaign.\n\nLastly, auto-block is really powerful, not sure if it's OP though. The stat is basically non-negotiable. Armor is however, in conjuction with deflection. Unfortunately anything with low deflection and high armor defeats the purpose of wearing it since everything will penetrate it, causing half the armor value to be lost. As such the only practical option is to pick high deflection suits with low or moderate armor. Not sure how to balance it for really low deflection values.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505215929, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505217188, "recommendationid": "34899222", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504972", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505846309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 190, "steamid": "76561198146109011", "num_games_owned": 81}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I came across this page earlier today and was interested right away.
