There are different types of blocks that are introduced to make it more challenging as you make your away through the 150 levels.\n\nAs far as the positives of this game go, I feel like it was challenging and made me think many steps ahead to successfully get through a section. So based on the description it gave I feel like it delivered on what it promised.\n\nAs for the negatives, I have to say that the music and sound effects quickly got annoying and repetitive (they were also uncomfortably loud compared to anything else I would have open at the time). It's also inconvient that you only have the option to turn the music or sound effects on or off (no sliders). Beyond that, what really began to frustrate me as the levels progressed was that if your orange cube went off of the provided platforms it would disintegrate and you would have to start all the way at the beginning again. It started to feel like it was the I Am Bread of the minimalistic puzzle genre. I feel like it would've been better if they just made it so you were phyiscally incapable of going off the edge by bouncing you back to the position you were just in before you flipped over into oblivion.\n\nSo overall, I really have mixed feelings when it comes to this game, and if I could give it a neutral rating, I would. Weighing the positives and negatives, I ultimately decided to give it a cautious recommendation. I think this game is only for the very patient or those really starved of puzzle games. I finished the game 100% in about 7 hours which is a decent amount of gameplay for $3, but even then I would maybe consider getting it on a sale because of the negatives I mentioned.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501133754, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501133754, "recommendationid": "33824817", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502250", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
