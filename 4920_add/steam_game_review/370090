Passing is rough, its much easier to run currently as they can basically pick you off quite easily 1 on 1, as you can on defense.\n2. Running is very fun, however they need to add some of Maddens ideas such as, Hitstick, Stiffarm, Spin and overall more balance towards all running styles Offensive and Defensive.\n3. The rubberbanding that currently is in-game will I am sure be fixed sooner later, however it really causes some issues when your playing the game, mostly on offensive side however it makes it rough to make plays on defense aswell.\n4. The AI on passing is amazing, AI QB's are very accurate and this not only causes issues because they can just bomb it everytime if they wanted, they can hit their screens very quickly on the move with 95% accuracy. This should be looked into as it can unbalance the game in serious need-to-win games.\n5. Fantasy draft and other goodies that are planned to be added would make this game have so much more to offer, I hope they release a huge content patch in August like they have planned as this game has so much potential being one of the only Football games on PC and new.\n\nI recommend this game because I am a diehard football fan, however if you easily are butthurt over AI kicking your teams butt, you may want to avoid this game currently and look it up after a year or so of patching.\n\nMight have been a little to early release, but we need to support games that we like, specially rare Football ones. :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436994605, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436994605, "recommendationid": "17066523", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541267", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440286448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561197982132986", "num_games_owned": 855}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 50, "comment_count": "6", "review": "I love football and was excited when I saw there was an American football game on Steam.

EA has exclusive deals with NFL and NCAA and will never port to the PC.   MS is trying to make make exclusive deals with 2K so that they can have sports games exclusive to xb1 and MS10.  In addition It looks like MS is trying to start yet again their own distribution network for the PC that will only run on xb1 and MS10.\n\nI don\u2019t like this environment where you are being forced to buy a console or upgrade an OS just so you can play games.  If you are like me and don\u2019t like the way this is going then you need to support indie developers like this who are really trying to make a difference.\n\nWith that said I have played this version and it is rough when compared to titles created by EA and 2K.   Lets face it those guys have massive resources and they get massive support from the console makers as well.   This developer is small with very little recourses and no support from valve which is a shame.   If valve and steam want to continue to remain dominant on the PC platform then they need to be supporting projects like these as much as they can.\n\nAnd If you want a good football sim on the PC then you need to be supporting these guys as well.  Even with limited resources this dev has done an outstanding job with what he has had to work with.   They will have a 2016 version coming out in July and I have seen the improvements they have made.   They are still not where they need or want to be but they are making great progress. If they continue to make the same progress over the next year that they made this past year then they are well on their way to making a really good football sim.\n\nI understand that everyone wants it to have NFL and NCAA teams represented in the game.  Well they have that covered in the upcoming version.  The devs have opened this game up to Mod support and modders have already added uniforms, graphics, logos and rosters to match both NFL and NCAA teams.  So day one you will be able to download that content and play with you favorite team.\n\nBottom line I am not affiliated with these devs in any way.  I did not help with the mods and I did not receive any free software nor would I ask or except any free copies.  I simply want everyone that enjoys playing those other games on the consoles to support these guys.   I understand that it may take a few years with the current size of their budget and the size of their dev team.   They need our support if they are going to make this game better please consider buying this version and the 2016 version when it\u2019s released.

It's a solid Indie effort which currently highlights a great aimed passing feature.  \n\nPros:\n- All 'official' pro cities represented but for obvious copyright reasons, I thought the dev was very clever with each team name.  You will have no trouble identifying each game team's counterpart in the big leagues.\n- As mentioned before, the aimed passing feature\n- on easy, the AI is too easy but seemed to get challenging on the harder levels\n\nCons:\n- On all levels AI needs a little more beefing up.  Have AI adjust to player's preferential play style during the game which would force the player to quit using plays that 'always work'\n*Rather than list the below items as 'Cons', I understand the game is still being developed so...\n\nNeeding:\n- At 1920 x 1080, I feel the status bar gets 'in the way' of the view during the receiving portion of a kickoff or punt return.  A way to alleviate this would be to get dev to move the bar down a little bit.  Have not tried lower resolutions\n- Color blind features needed - namely for the ground 'target' circles. Being partially color blind myself, I have gotten used to noticing the circle during passing plays but still have a hard time seeing the target circle when about to recv. from a kickoff or punt.\n- REAL time 4 qtrs of play.  Maybe have a mode where one could do a quick game (the way it's set now) then have a more official mode using the official clock times\n- Some of the Madden features for being able to throw off blockers - hitstick, etc  Maybe a quick view change once a pass or kick is caught or after a ball is handed off where one could look from the player's POV while running the play after the catch or hand. *OR*\n- Keep the same view since I get that you want 2 players to be able to share the same screen (friend at a friend's house sort of thing) then maybe slow the game down a little bit.  I think all the AI players noticeably all run around the same speed >> FAST.  Greater variability on each individual AI and player controllered players so that some run faster, some slower.  Some defenders block and pass rush better, some don't.  etc..  By slowing the game down some, a player can read the defense a little more, maybe find the holes to run through.\n\nOtherwise it's a FOOTBALL GAME FOR THE PC!  I think it's worth it.  If you're tight with the money, maybe hold out to see what the new 2016 version will be about.  I bought in now because the dev needs to earn a living too, and so I gladly supported his efforts for this 2015 edition and will most likely shell out some more moola for the 2016 version.  I'll become a 'lifer' supporter if I see great improvements in the 2016 version because that's usually a good sign that the dev is in it to win it!\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449125437, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449125437, "recommendationid": "19453107", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510141", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447302864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 230, "steamid": "76561197967063131", "num_games_owned": 992}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Its great to see a football game on PC!!! that being said.. this game has a lot of issues the dev always says will be fixed for their \"2016 version\" instead of updates that need to happen for his current verison.

And yet, this review, at best, is a neutral review.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it can be entertaining! And I dont regret the purchase. And the dev is great! Very friendly, and seems really dedicated to the game. Its just so....lacking. Literally. \n\nI'll list the cons first, then the pros, to end the review on a good note!\n\nThe season mode feels so basic. There is no stats, schedule, nothing. In fact, it feels more like it just randomly generates a matchup to play after each game played. To show what I mean by generating a matchup after each game, this is an experience I had in my season. I was the New England Volunteers( New England Patriots, fyi) and I had to play the New Orleans Crusaders( New Orleans Saints.) I played them as the road team, on, Week 4. On Week 6, I again played the Crusaders, in the Crusaders stadium. The endzones had the Crusaders name in both games. One was played in clear weather, the next in the rain. \n\nNext, the playbooks. Ok I love to strategize about football. One thing I love about Madden video games, is to look at the playbooks to see all the different plays, formations, etc. Axis football, instead has a tiny playbook. I counted the plays. Offensively, there is 45 plays, counting Speacial Teams plays. There are 45 defensive plays, counting the special teams, again. Not much variety. The game is broke down into two(2) 5 minute halves. With limited plays, you'll probably use the same play anywhere between 5-20 times A GAME. For me, most second halves are dull. But, hey, thats just me. Just needed to point it out.\n\nThe Ai needs a whole new overhaul. Really.\nThere isn't probably, a game that you dont eventually know how to defeat and counter the Ai. But this, this Ai is so simple and easy to beat. Even on the hardest setting, I still won and even earned an achievement from it! In this case, it was for the Comeback Kids achievement. Gotta overcome a 21+ halftime deficit. Even on the hardest possible difficulty, I  had to goof off for the first half, just to ensure the Ai was ahead by 21+ points. I won 36-35, even with the clock bugging out, and not stopping when it should have! On another football game, I would've lost. On Axis Football 2015, I dont think its possible for the Ai to win, unless you play horribly, or your team's ratings are lower than the Ai, but thats still winnable.\n\nNext the price. For what they're asking for it, this game lacks in. I bought the game during the promo sale, with 10% off. The game is not worth $20. Given the current state its in, 5-7 bucks is its worth at max. Maybe $10 since its the only one on Steam. \n\nBugs abound, but none seem to be game-breaking, thankfully. How many times has the playbook glitched after an interception, or kickoff, showing offensive plays, when Im on defense? Its super annoying. And, the worst case of it struck AFTER 1.4 came out! Most of the second half for me, I was stuck using my Nickel formation, since every other formation showed my offensive playbook. Still won, and not game breaking, but still.\n\nI'll now list the few pros:\nCreative take on the team names.\nA step up from Backyard football.\nGood dev, even if experience is a little lacking.\n\nFinal thoughts.\nNot a bad game, not a great game. Way too easy, even with the new passing mechanic. The game also lacks way to much in game modes. Not even a practice mode(greatly needed) kicking game is wild, and even the roster modding seems to have gotten off to a rocky start, according to some comments in the community hub.\nThe store page says this is a great alternative to playing Madden. Playing this, it greatly increases my desire to dig out any of my Madden games and play them. Or any of my other football games, for that matter, though none are on the PC and obviously not on Steam.\nThe dev also says hes in this for the long haul. However, its already been noted that next year, Axis Football 2016 will be available for purchase, so its up to you to decide if the long haul means this game, or if whether in a few years Madden will have a rival football game to compete with. Actually, I believe when I saw game play of this game, it was on Axis Football 2014, so it would seem each year equals a new release, with, presumably, more game modes, etc.\nThe achievements are also easy to achieve. My first game with 100% achievements, and I earned them all in 9.0 hours of gameplay exactly, according to Steam.\n\nThere are plenty of cons, yes. But, I still recommend to at least try it out. If anything, you can learn about the game of football. Or experience a decent dev. Or relive the early days of football video games. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437878636, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437878636, "recommendationid": "17230211", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513155", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480498227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 292, "steamid": "76561198090505809", "num_games_owned": 196}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very fun game, simple yet fluent controls, AI impressed me, I did not think it would be as good as it was for an indie game.

It's sort of like the announcer on Backyard Football, but not as good.\n\nCons:\nI can't get my Dual Action Logitech to work with this yet so far. I downloaded a 360 emulator, but not sure how to get the game to recognize the gamepad.\n\nSummary:\nBuy if you liked Backyard Football, or Madden. This isn't anything close to Madden, but it's fun to play and on the PC. It's a good price, and definitely worth supporting the developers.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437021539, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437021539, "recommendationid": "17071276", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498333", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437069456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561197984515364", "num_games_owned": 322}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": "2", "review": "This game is far from being a full release game which unfortunatly at the moment is the case for a lot of even AAA games. This is at best an early access pickup, so if you are looking for a well polished football game this is defenetly not for you. It does have potetial and if the developers offer it the attention it needs and are not in it just to make a quick money they can do something interesting with it.\n\nPros:\n1) The manual aiming of passes is an interesting idea\n2) I absolutly have to mention the names of the teams which have nothing to do with the NFL teams like the Indianapolis Broncos, Seattle warhawks, Kensas City Indians and the fact that the teams are from the exact US cities is just clearly a coinsidence :)\n3) It has gamepad support which works fine with my 360 controller\n\nCons:\n1) Totaly unpolished:\n- the tackles and player movements are not even close to real\n- there are a lot of rules missing (holdings, interference etc) - but at least they make fun of that in the commentary\n- some of the available plays can't be selected for some reason\n- the menu ui and interacton while in a game is horible\n- do not expect any cutscenes for replays, gamestarts, etc\n- very limited commentary - at most 20 different lines\n2) Graphics with the settings set to maximum is really bad\n3) Some plays will never get you yards because the players don't react as they should - my wr was realeasing the corner just as my rb was getting there and I got takled 3 consecutive times in the same way\n4) The aimed pass with a controller will defenetly be hard to get used to\n5) No options menu and volume contol. I had to lower the volume from the windows mixer.\n\nSummary: Buy this game only to support the devs in the hopes they will continue with it and for some fun from time to time.

I just move my mouse cursor to the receiver and he catches it no matter what. Only partial controller support?? Meh not good for a sports game. It needs to be fixed so that it has full controller support. You just cant have a mouse and keyboard sports game. Some people are for that I guess but it ruins the gameplay detrimentally. It's a very crude version a bit better than tecmo football but not nearly even close to madden 98 lol. They have much work to do on this game. The only reason I am not giving it a negative review is because it is the only football game on steam. I appreciate that someone finally did it. It needs to be fixed and designed for controller gameplay. Nobody want's to play a sports game with the mouse. I hope they fix the passing so your not just moving your cursor across the screen pretty silly.

An itch to play a decent football game on the PC. When the original Front Page Sports football faded away many years ago, I thought that some other title would carry on the torch. It just didn't happen.\n\nNow we have this entry. We are instructed by other reviewers not to compare this to Madden. Unfortunately however this is exactly what this game tries to be, an \"arcady\" twitch game. Since this game cannot compete on this level with the aforementioned game, one would expect other areas to be better developed, but sadly this is not the case. If this game had tried to be more of a Front Office football with graphics, it would have fared much better.\n\nThere is simply no simulation value to this game whatsoever. There is a \"coach\" mode, but this is simply the same game only you do not control one of the players. Since this game is all about action, this mode makes no sense. The action itself is not very satisfying. Often, players being blocked will just stand there, not moving. You can find the one or two plays that will always work, regardless of how good or bad the team you are playing is. As an example, after 4 games, my team's rushing defence has given up negative yardage. My opponents simply cannot run the ball against my team. However, once in a while they will get off an 80+ pass play since their receivers can always outrun my defenders (again - regardless of how good or bad the opponent team is). So every team you play feels exactly like the previous team you just played, only with a different coat of paint.\n\nThere's also alot of missing elements from actual football. There are no leagues or divisions. All teams are thrown into the same standings with the top 12 teams going to some sort of post season play. There are no quarters in games, only 2 five minute halves and there is no changing this. Stat enthusiasts will be very dissapointed as there are no league leader displays. While in a game, you can see the stats of your individual players, but outside of a game, all you can do is view team totals.\n\nIf you want to support one of the only options in PC football, then by all means do so.  I wished I hadn't however. We do have a very large hole in the PC Football genre, but this offering does nothing to scratch that football itch. If I enter a fruit cake into the county fair, and my entry is the only entry in the fruit cake division, of course I'll win the medal, but that doesn't mean it's a good fruitcake.
