The aim of the game is to complete the loops by moving (and in some cases, rotating) tiles. It's something to take your time with and a game that is unlikely to cause any frustration.\n\nDefinitely worth it if you're someone that needs help calming down.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499851237, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499851237, "recommendationid": "33475265", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 54, "total_reviews": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
