Really bad. I was looking for an Advance Wars clone for a while now, apparently there isn't one modern game like AW that is even close to it's fun, but I had some hope for Front Wars. The screenshots looked decent enough, the topic was contained, it looked all in all like a cheap clone. But that would do. That alone would do. But of course, burned by the garbage pile of bad AW clones People were rightfully cautious and despite my burning hope so was I. \n\nSo it didn't came a such a big disappointment when I started up the game and was confronted with a pile of shit. \n\n[b]1. The Options are bare[/b]\nThe options are pretty terrible. The game is made with Unity, so you can at least configure the resolution and wither you want the game windowed or fullscreen when starting the game. But ingame you can basically just turn four options things on and off. Battle Animations, Sea Animations, Musik and Sounds. You don't have the empowerment to decide how loud music or sounds should be, either you have them or you don't. But that's the least of your worries, since you actually don't want to hear the sounds.\n\n[b]2. The Sounds are terrible[/b]\nThis is the first thing that sticks out. The sound design is the worst. The dev obviously didn't had anyone to make him sounds, so he just stuck a webcam with mic up his ass and recorded for a day in the hope to get some sounds that resemble war. You're better of disabling the sound and make your own with your mouth. Heck, get your child, get a random child, put it next to the monitor and let it make the sounds. \n\n[b]3. The Animation is lazy/barely there[/b]\nEverything's flat and lifeless. Units stand still and are pushed over the field like made of paper. There is a bit of animations when units engage in battle, but that too is very stale and cheap. Attacks don't feel powerful, destroying an unit does not feel satisfying.\n\n[b]4. The AI is just plain bad[/b]\nUnforgivable in a AW clone. One could argue against the AI in AW, but this is just terrible. I attacked a tank on a street with a tank of my own from grass. Since the street offers no cover the enemy took a fair amount of damage. In AW the AI would either move the tank away, back where it could be repaired or get into a better position or move on grass itself and counterattack. This AI just counterattacked my tank from the street, given that it was hurt more than my own, taking even more damage. I destroyed it then with the next move. At other points the AI just aggressively tries to hurt you, like a knight with no arms. I saw the AI attacking an artillery with a normal infantry footsoldier instead of using him against my footsoldier, making next to no damage. In another instance the computer just decided to attack one of my almost full soldier's with a 1 hp soldier, making no damage and blowing up itself. Even the Volkssturm that defended Berlin in it's last hours would be like: \"dude, this is dumb\".\n\n[b]5. The overall design is terrible[/b]\nThe game does not just look like a horrible tablet game port, it's worse than that. Werther the look appeal to you initially or not, the menus are ugly and unintuitive to read. The lovely simplicity of AW does not work on a higher resolution and with these graphics. It's just look like free assets taken from the Unity store.\n\n[b]6. Uninspired Setting[/b]\nWe have too many World War 2 games, even the shooters recognized that. Some manage to keep it interesting with gameplay and some special history flavour. Not this game though. The premise seems to be \"World War 2 something something\". No unique units or no generals. A huge step down from the lighthearted fantasy war world of any AW. It was never a smart or story heavy game, but it had a soul.\n\n[b]7. \"Campaign\"[/b]\nWhat the game is calling \"campaign\" is actually just a string of skirmishes without much context. There is no introduction text, no dialogs, no events. You get the name of the mission and then start a map with preset units and buildings. You are just supposed to either know the battle or handwave it as some random battle. Something something World War 2, violence, war, boom, excitement.\n\n[b]8. No CO's[/b]\nThis was something I thought I didn't need, but after the experience of Front Wars I totally do. The different abilities and unit skills of the CO's gave the armies nuances and added another layer of tactics. Here the enemy just have the same units as you, it really doesn't matter if you take Axis or Allies. Heck, you can just imagine that you are playing the dwarfs of Westvirginia in their deadly vendetta against the polish order of pancakes.\n\n[b]9. ESC quites the game instantly[/b]\nThis is relatively minor and yet very annoying: the ESC-key closes the game without confirmation and wherever you are. This is especially horrifying because I am used to close game menus with that key. I keep hitting it instinctively and it's irritating that the game has not quit button. You are supposed to just hit ESC.\n\n[b]10. It's bloody unpolished[/b]\nYou thought I am down to nitpicking. But I am not. You're reading the title right. It's not ordinarily unpolished, not a bit unpolished, it's bloody unpolished. When I surrendered the skirmish game, the computer played an additional turn until the game finally realized that the game was lost and then threw me out to the multiplayer lobby, despite me playing a singleplayer skirmish map. At some point I destroyed an enemy tank, but since I had it selected before the fight it's movement indicator was still visible and didn't vanish until I clicked on another enemy unit. At one point I took a peek into the tutorial and was annoyed out of it when it was lagging, not letting me move the unit it told me to move for ten seconds.\n\nAnd those are just the terrible things I encountered in 20 minutes. 20 Minutes! I didn't try the multiplayer, I didn't use the map editor, I didn't finish a mission. The Old Ones know what unholy terrors of bugs and terrible design are waiting in the deep, ready to snatch a player's sanity within a blink. I see no worth in playing anymore, the game is not getting less buggy and better designed the more I play. \n\nDon't buy this game. It's unpolished, bad designed, weak, it's by no stretch the Advance Wars clone you were waiting for. Get down on your knees and bow three times to Tokyo and ask Nintendo silently for another Advance Wars. No earthly force seem to be able to even emulate the concept. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439846522, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439846522, "recommendationid": "17589433", "language": "english", "votes_down": 29, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680453", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501792834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 416, "steamid": "76561198168771554", "num_games_owned": 7}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "review": "yup i agree exacty like AW, a game that i spent countless hours playing  hours playing in my childhood but on the nintendo ds and not gameboy, but they need to add the option to speed up time as in AW when the enemy is having there turn, and the sound effects are a bit iffy at times.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439827176, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439827176, "recommendationid": "17584950", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511160", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467333022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 233, "playtime_forever": 33, "steamid": "76561198108235797", "num_games_owned": 2116}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's nothing like Advance Wars, Fire Emblem or even Famicom Wars.\n\nIt has barely any content.\nOnly two factions with few units, even Advance Wars on Gameboy Advance had more than that.\nGraphics looks like a mobile game, honestly, I prefer GBA/NDS graphics than this crap.\nGuns are the same on both side which proves how lazy is the developer.\n\nConclusion: Not worth it, not even on sale, just go play Advance Wars, Fire Emblem or Famicom Wars instead, they are all great games, this one is not, even if you are new to this and have not played Advance Wars, Fire Emblem or Famicom Wars before which means, even if you do not compare this game to those, it's still bad, the price is too high for so little the game has, It's the perfect example of what not to do, a crappy mobile port, mobile games are seriously cancer.\n\nI'd love to see an Advance Wars game exclusive for the PC which means a great gem, graphics that consoles wouldn't be able to handle (okay but seriously I don't really care about the graphics, so forget that one), giant maps size that would be really big, it would be infinite when it would come to the map editor and the modding of course, you want Star Wars in your game?
