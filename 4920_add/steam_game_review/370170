And levels have not changed. \n\nThis game is a matching game, the aim is to clear all items of a level by matching twins or trios of the same item in a limited amount of time. It remembers me this kind of game, he it's not that one, on the first mobile phone with a color screen. \n\nThe mechanisms of the game are easy to learn and master, some levels are really challenging. There are also some environments to be aware of or to use, such as: weak blocks, sticky black oil, moving spikes, portals, magnet...\n\n(*):\nThere is only one main glitch that is required in order to finish some levels. In one level you need to pause the game while using a moving platform to save time. Without doing that, you are always running out of time. \n\nThis is still a great game to play, and I recommend to use my guide if needed to finish the game or getting the achievements.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457879295, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468483354, "recommendationid": "21815117", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512688", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467056563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 748, "steamid": "76561198237177218", "num_games_owned": 11}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Interesting puzzle game, with simple mechanics and levels that really make you think.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451462303, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451462303, "recommendationid": "20106422", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495077", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500508999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 180, "steamid": "76561198033107016", "num_games_owned": 349}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1465704425, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1480608196, "recommendationid": "23513981", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471502", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
