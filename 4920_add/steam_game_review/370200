A young boy named Eldin makes an appearance and - after becoming confused - Therese and he subsequently strive to make sense of their predicament. \nThere is a confounding mystery to be hashed out, but the majority of the story is of the interactions between two (almost) strangers; of the bonds that can form in no time.  \n\nPart Two opens with a promise and a preamble. \nTherese awakes in some sort of classical-yet-modern manor, agitated at not knowing where, why, how. A young boy named Eldin makes an appearance and - after becoming disturbed - Therese and he subsequently strive to make their way out of their predicament. \nThere is a suspicious conspiracy to be hashed out, but the majority of the story is of the interactions between two (almost) strangers; of the love that can seem otherwise.\n\n\nThe art is well-done. There is a stark contrast between some of it; it's obvious that those (background) images that are of lesser quality were made to appear as such for atmosphere. How? \"View full-size version in browser\" for the first advertised image. \n\nAs for the writing, other than a few absent apostrophes and commas, one use of an incorrect homonym, and one misspelling (\"breath\" for \"breathe\") - it's perfect English (as I know it at least, fer wutever dats werff). There is a good deal of stuttering (\"A-are...\" \"E-Eldin...\" etc.), if that grinds your gears. \n\nThe story is great. Will not spoil more'n I already have.\n\nThe soundtrack is the worst part of the game. Any collection of sounds confined to seperate \"tracks\" is owed the title, but I didn't consider the majority of what I heard to be a sampling of a soundtrack; ambience that will either hit you as spot-on or make you wince a bit. To be sure, there is some music and I enjoyed what of it I heard; the music obeys the tone and gestures of the characters (i.e. abrupt or no transitions) and most of the sound will be of the eerie-but-maybe-annoying ambience. And that's just a personal problem, as my ears are sensitive; isn't even the loud noises that bother me, I guess just the pitch of the chanting - crackled in my earholes, yo. \n\nI recommend this game; I think the asking price is fair.\n\nEDIT: \nI played Part One twice; Part Two once. Read at my own pace (moderately fast(?)): 57 minutes. \nWill probably play through again at least once more. \nI would advise saving often, maybe when you hear the music change, just because there are several save slots, and some of the text is skip-worthy after having read twice, but some is worth re- and rereading. And you never know when those bits will come up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439421288, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439421789, "recommendationid": "17512329", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537121", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449376231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561198062241368", "num_games_owned": 414}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "While there's amazing animated characters and beautifully contrasted backgrounds with the characters, I found the story too short for the asking price. That is not to say that the author didn't work hard on this and doesn't deserve the asked price for such a great; artistic novel, but to say that the work is entirely too short for something that I re-read and still don't have an hour's worth of gameplay. I've played many visual novels and I think even a dollar less would be an improvement.\n\nAs for the story, I had seen the likes of it a few times before as an avid anime fan. However, there were a couple tricks I hadn't seen coming that I greatly appreciated. I loved the tone and as I said before, the artwork is just amazing I couldn't ask for more there. I'm wondering if perhaps there is more to this story yet to be added or if this is all that will be given. \n\nI really hope there will be something added onto this work, as I found myself really getting and loving the story only to be left at the end wanting for more. My only hope is that there will be a continued piece or maybe another story by the author. I'm now a great fan of their works and will definitely buy more-specifically if they had the same horror-undertones as this novel. \n\nAlso the sound effects and music just matched perfectly! I'm so happy with my purchase because I got to see all this amazingness but I'm sad it ended too soon. (As I've already said many times in this rambling review.) \n\nGREAT WORK! Recommended if you've got the money to spend for something beautiful. Not if you are running low on funds and are looking for something long. However, it does have some replay value if only because you're left desperate for more!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439676985, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439676985, "recommendationid": "17557753", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507850", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
