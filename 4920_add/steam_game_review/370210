It's the first of its kind that I've played on the Vive. Works great with an XBox One controller. I will say that after around a half hour of play I started to get a little bit motion sickness. I have a pretty high tolerance as well.

Its a great game, with good voice acting (thought the mix can be a little off with dialogue a little hard to hear sometimes, but the whole experience is polished. I do seem to run out of fuel too much though, but that may be my inexperience.\n\nCertainly a great game for the Vive and all VR I would think, and I hope maybe multiplayer support will come one day. That could be quite cool with racing and time challenges etc. Doesnt need it though, works great as a stand alone with story.\n\nI think it is priced just right too.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1479758251, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1479758251, "recommendationid": "26736429", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480389090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 245, "steamid": "76561198035997961", "num_games_owned": 329}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "One of my favorite games on the Vive. It looks great and runs great on my GTX 970. Controls are easy to pick up and play but tricky to master. Head mounted weapon targeting is really satisfying. Even something as simple as picking up a package and delivering it to another outpost is a lot of fun. Game play is varried, with missions ranging from point A to B deliveries, check point racing, salvage operations and areial combat, all with voiced mission dialouge.\n\nThe game atmospher is quite emersive, you can really tell the Dev's put a lot of love in to this game. The game has fully voiced mission dialoge and nods to sifi classics that creates a unique, yet familiar world. Missions are varied but creates an intresting story line out of seeminly unrelated tasks. It really feels like being a free lancer in a hostile planet.  Floating over moon outposts feels like being in the universe of the 2001 Space Odessy or Moon films. It also reminds me of the enviroment from the lunar combat game Battle Zone from the N 64 era.\n\nIve played for about 4 hours so far and encountered 36 missions. With the time trial freature, theres a lot of replayability too. I've played for an extended period of time without any motion sickness that is so common with games like this. \n\nThere are a few minor issues with the game as of now. Mainly the fantasic dialoge can be hard to hear at times over in game sound effects, Dev team has said they are looking to fix this issue. The lack of motion controller support may bother some people, but the game plays well with an X Box controller and head tracking weapon controls are intuitive, just remember to lead your targets. Mission difficulty can be a little uneven, but with a practice, none are unbeatable. Dev's have indicated they hope to add multipayer in the furture.\n\nIf you are interested in sceince fiction and are looking for a novel take on space flight and combat sims, I cannot recomend this game enough. \n\n9.5/10\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1480466554, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1480466554, "recommendationid": "28087305", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481534892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561197961277750", "num_games_owned": 293}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very well done VR game.

Easy to pickup and play and worth the asking price. Hoping the devs add more missions in future to keep us coming back for more. Only silly problem I had was not realizing you use your HMD to aim at options on the menu page. I thought my XBox controller was glitching out on me duh, lol.  Love the planet surface setting and love seeing your thrusters firing underneath you. Really adds to the whole experience. Looking forward to seeing what else these great devs have planned.
