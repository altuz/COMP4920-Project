My first impression was that it would be an art piece with the mechanics of the genre done well enough that one can focus on the visual emersion. However the lair of the Snake god which was the first dungeon piece I took part in, was filled with dull unrewarding gameplay that focused quite entirely on the subliminal story driven religious message. which might have worked had I been doing anything other than hitting boxes with a stick then restarting a section if I touched a box. Moving on only when all the boxes had been sufficiently hit. which makes it sound way more interesting than it actually was. The music which was immedidiately striking was set on loop for my entirity of my play time such that I truly had no motivation to keep hitting boxes.\n      Maybe it gets better, I'll hope for the best.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444677882, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444677882, "recommendationid": "18446201", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511612", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458939275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 113, "steamid": "76561198238382436", "num_games_owned": 66}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "What's worse than a bad game that is slow paced?

As I bash each of their blue shells into finely ground mush I notice their sad looking eyeballs follow me around the room and reflect on my earlier encounters with the creatures in the game. There's a good deal of evidence given throughout the game in the form of dialogue and diaries that they're sapient and intelligent, and at one point were the ancient human villagers who once populated the entire area. After much effort I finally reach the final stretch, a series of fast moving enemy spawns with narrow walkways taking place on the back of the snake god itself.\n\nLooking at how spread apart the enemies are, I suddenly realize that I can run through this entire gauntlet without killing a single enemy. Some parts are tricky, but with proper timing I manage to zip past each obstacle. None of the enemies make any attempt to hunt me down, many of the bigger ones near the end aren't even moving and I have plenty of space to simply walk around them. Why am I supposed to be attacking them again, when they aren't even a threat? Maybe if I continue to avoid them, the game will recognize that I'm trying to show some mercy on these people, I think. Maybe the snake god will comment on my deliberate willingness to make the game more difficult in an attempt to be more than just some single minded killing machine.\n\nBut no, nothing happens, the only way you can finish the dungeon is to (once again) kill enough of the Husks near the end to trigger the exit warp.\n\nWhy do scenarios like this bother me? Maybe I've been playing too much Undertale lately, or maybe I've just grown into too much of a cynic to blindly accept typical RPG tropes- but a game that requires you to massacre living, sentient creatures as an arbitrary ritual to progress from one hallway to the next is not something that I can consider morally intelligent. I end up feeling like Thistle is really not any better of a person than the supposedly evil unseen antagonist. It would be somewhat acceptable to me if the game made an attempt to present Thistle as anything but a morally pure priestess, but it doesn't, which pretty much tears down the central theme of the game (the ends do not always justify the means). \n\nAnyways, for everything else I like (the laser jumping puzzles are fun and the controls are good) and dislike (the game is way too short and predictable), this experience sticks out to me the most. I don't feel like I can rightly recommend this when it killed any semblance of immersion to me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444682202, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444682335, "recommendationid": "18447098", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505092", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
