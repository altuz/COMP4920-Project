It is the most unfair stupid hard junky platformer ever to grace your screen.\n\nWhat it DOES have is the best video game soundtrack of all time. This is not up for debate, everyone who disagrees is in deep denial.\n\nThis package itself however does not have enough features to justify even the sale price, such as:\n\nThe Dos version is slow with inferior sound and music\nThe Enhanced SNES only contains some very minor tweaks\nGenesis version has yet to be released\nNES version has yet to be released\nDoes not have the original Jim Power game for Amiga/Turbografix\nNo high quality soundtrack\n\nJust get your own emulator and ROMs for free.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499818628, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499818683, "recommendationid": "33468269", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509187", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
