I'm totally biased because games like these have a special place in my heart, growing up playing Dragon Warrior, Monster Rancher, and Pokemon. I'm in love with the music, the enemies are unique, and the game has quite a few surprising twists. At a first glance, you may suspect that this is your typical 8-Bit game, but there's quite a bit of depth to the story and I highly recommend anyone that plays retro games to check this one out. I'm having a wonderful adventure so far!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494978993, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494978993, "recommendationid": "31796413", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
