The game has great graphics and very smooth controls. Everything responds right away and I had no problem completing the game without any techinical difficulties.This game doesn't have much of a story, however the unique stages and abilities Tompi can use makes up for it. Furthermore, the game is slightly challenging at times, which is good for people like me who loves problem solving. Like Donkey Kong, I believe Tompi Jones can be a 2-d platformer that could stand the test of time. I give Tompi Jones a solid 9/10 give it a try someday as it's worth your money and time. Hopefully, an HD remake could come out and It would make me and a lot of other people a happy camper.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468955062, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468955062, "recommendationid": "24413046", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.934610", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
