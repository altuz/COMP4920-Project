It had good graphics, decent game play and mechanics. Ran smoothly. My only complaints on the game are this.. The story line was off a bit. I wasn't exactly sure who I was playing and what was really going on. I think you change characters in the chapters but it does not really say that is what is going on. It does not fully make you aware of what is going on in this realm and what you are doing here. It could be more immersive with more story filled in. Just my opinion. You can watch my playthrough on my youtube channel at the link below. I am not trying to be too critical with the game because I liked it. But I just feel like I lost the story.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrzAsGLXuKEcO4zjj3KyVhvb4ZVSxxIp", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500257079, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500257079, "recommendationid": "33598602", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498765", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
