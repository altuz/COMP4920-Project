There are 23 unique characters and 23 different arcana to select, making over 500 combinations of the two. It plays a lot like Blazblue, and even uses similar light, medium, and heavy attacks, but with the addition of one button just used for dashing directly to your opponent, as well as an extra button just for your arcana. It's fast paced and there is no tutorial, but if you have played any 2D fighter before, you shouldn't have too much trouble learning how to play this one!\n\nOverall, the sprites are very well done, combos feel very satisfying, the learning curve is pretty fair if you are willing to spend more than an hour in the game. The final bosses are pretty challenging but that's the whole point of them being \"final bosses\", so don't be discouraged. Highly recommend to those who enjoy Blazblue, Guilty Gear, Skullgirls, and even Street Fighter.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506447706, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506447706, "recommendationid": "35226488", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 100, "total_reviews": 109, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 9}}
