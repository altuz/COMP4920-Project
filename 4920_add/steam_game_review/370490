To me, it felt very tricky, but it also started to feel less trick the longer I played. I used an Xbox 360 controller, so I can't really speak for how good the keyboard controls are, ESDF and IJKL. WASD would have made more sense instead of ESDF, but I digress. For anybody who enjoys tank combat games regardless of the game's art style, I recommend picking this one up.

I feel that that\\'s the true essence of \\\"retro\\\" games - the game-in-itself should be fun because of its basic structure, whether it\\'s dressed in chunky pixels, 16-bit Mode-7, or HD DX12 photorealism.

Even if the game concept is totally a \"rip-off\"/Copy/Clone/etc from Namcos \"Assault\",it makes nearly as fun as the original Namco Game, with some missing stuff:\n\n- I really miss some more sound-effects. Even if you drive a tank, i miss the motor noices or more \"heavier explosions\", like in the original.\n\n- I know its called to be \"ASCII Attack\" but even so, the Levels feel very liniar next to this they look really very....\"blank\" (got it~? Coz it plays on paper~)\n\n- I miss a \"power-up\" timer or like, i never see when they run out.\n\n\nSo yea, in my opinion it is worth playing and makes really some kind of fun, it really is a good time waister and worth the price somewhat.
