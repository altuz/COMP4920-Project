But it knows this.  That's why it's so cheap.  On that basis, I can recommend it.  It looked okay, it played smoothly (I suggest playing with the mouse, rather than a controller), and it didn't crash.  Some of the levels are far too dependent on luck, but the stage menu uses a grid-based system that allows you to circle around levels you don't like.\n\nThis is far from the greatest game on Steam, but it isn't Greenlight trash, either.  It's a simple, limited game that could be fun for perhaps a half-hour or so and is priced accordingly.  I can accept it on that basis.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506194695, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506194695, "recommendationid": "35161905", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503370", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 180, "total_reviews": 307, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 127}}
