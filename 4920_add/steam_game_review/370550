This game has a magical feel to it, and a story to go as well. The music is pleasant to the ear, and the game is very addicting. If you like these type games you will enjoy this game for sure :)\n\nWith out to many spoilers, the store page descibes the game very well, what you see and hear is what you get. This game is worth the asking price, in my personal opinion :)\n\nI will play this game till the cows come home, inbetween other games, and at my own personal leisure. \n\nI Love this game \u2665\u2665\u2665\n\nOnly 1 down fall, my achievement for getting all the stars in Survival did not activate and pop, must be a bug glitch :(\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435050199, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435050199, "recommendationid": "16642453", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572925", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436241474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 192, "steamid": "76561198064050389", "num_games_owned": 3500}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Sparkle 2 is an enjoyable addition to the Luxor/Zuma type of match 3 game.  \n\nA line of different colored balls slowly creeps forward and you have to shoot balls to match 3 or more to make them disappear.  If they reach the end of the line before you get rid of them all, it's game over (though I'm assuming you can keep trying after failing).  It's in the Puzzle category, but it's acutally an action puzzle rather than turn-based or one that just sits there while you decide what move to make.  In this game you have to think fast and have good reflexes sometimes.\n\nOccasionally you get power-ups that will help you.  Fireballs that destroy balls.  Color Match that makes several balls all the same color.   There are ones that slow the train or make it go backwards for a short time.\n\nThere are also equipable power-ups that you can choose once you've unlocked them.  Such as unlimited swap of whatever colored ball is currently next in line to shoot.  Or every 10th ball you get is a fireball.   You can try out the equipables and customize the way you want to play the game.\n\nThere is a main story with a path that you follow, but there are also other game modes that you unlock along the way.\n\nGraphics are nice.  I especially like the details on the balls (no jokes please).  They aren't just a solid color, there is a pattern to them that is nice.\n\nMusic is very nice.  To me it has a sort of fairytale classical style.  Kind of hard for me to describe.    It sets the mood perfectly for a jaunt through the creepy forest.\n\nI haven't finished the main story yet.  I might be halfway through, going on the equipable power-ups that I have yet to unlock, but I'm not sure, and I've played almost 3 hours according to Steam.
