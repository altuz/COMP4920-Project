Very casual.\nCute sounds and graphics, although the sounds might get annoying after a while.\nVery mobile-based gameplay (click on the coins above the buildings)\nNo micromanagement other than setting ticket prices and making sure you've got enough power, wifi, and pyrotechnics to go around.\nUpgradeable buildings, but a limited selection.\nOver 50 unique characters to unlock through regular progression.\nDidn't find any bugs.\nI think I paid less than $1 for this game, and I recommend getting it for under $2 if you are into easy, casual games that look nice and don't take much brainpower.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502406625, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502406625, "recommendationid": "34156890", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511548", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
