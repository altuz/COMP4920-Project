Its easier to line up shots in mid-air, but if you miss you are wide open for counter attack.  Desperate wall jumping games of cat and mouse are a regular occurrence as you always forget the chaser is just as slow as you are, and expect the killing blow to land any second.\n\nThis isn't just a multiplayer title either, which is a refreshing change.  Sure you have both local and online multiplayer, but there is plenty of meat in the single player game too.  Fun challenges, survival modes and challenging AI are all in this game and it really helps Gem Wars shine.  It's definitely a game you can play for a few hours offline in solo and not get bored.\n\nMy main negative with the title isn't the game itself, but the fact that because its a small indie title it doesn't yet have the following for thriving online multiplayer.  This is definitely a game where you will need to contact a friend for a multiplayer match.  Playing with strangers just isn't realistically going to happen.\n\nLuckily, it comes with a cheaper price tag than most so if you really like the game.  You can always afford a second copy for a multiplayer buddy :)\n\nThe game has attracted comparisons to Duck Game and Towerfall, but its definitely its own beast.\nThe elemental weapons, unique rule sets and floatier character movement all do enough to set this game apart and make it worthy of a purchase if you are keen to explore more of what this genre has to offer.\n\nSo far there have been fast regular updates constantly improving this game, and more to come in the coming months, so it's also an evolving beast. There are definitely greater things to come as this game strives hard to match it with the giants of the genre.  It's a game that knows that to match them for sales, it has to aim to outclass them for quality where ever it can.\n\nIf you're still unsure then grab it on sale and explore it for yourself.
