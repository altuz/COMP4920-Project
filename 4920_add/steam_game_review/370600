I did read some negative reviews but decided to purchase the game anyway. As much as I love Kitty, I regret purchasing the game.\n\nThe biggest issue for me is that the game will not save. Whenever I shut down the game and load it back up later, nothing I \"unlocked\" is still unlocked. The cars are relocked and so are the characters. It's as if the game isn't saving anything. What's the point of a game if our \"progress\" is going to be reset every time we close down the game? It makes the game a waste of the money I spent on it. It upsets me honestly.\n\nThe game overall is decent. It's a fun little game, almost like Mario Kart but with Hello Kitty characters. The controls for the boats and planes can be a bit wonky but as you get used to them, it becomes a lot of better.\n\nI would have given this game a recommendation but seeing as how my progress has been reset twice already, I can't rightfully recommend this game until that is fixed and updated. There is also no button to exit the game. It has to be done manually which isn't too big of a deal but is still a bit iffy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437178273, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437178273, "recommendationid": "17099823", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519257", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444479098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561197984257788", "num_games_owned": 180}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "My 8 year old daughter likes this game and we have fun playing it together, but good gosh what a lazy port. The controllers work in-game most of the time but using them or even the mouse on menu screens is hit-and-miss and ...
