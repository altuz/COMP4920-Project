I mean, it has potential, but... I'm not sure about it. Let's be clear: I bought this game because it has Aldorlea's name on it. Aldorlea tends to put out some great engaging games. Thing is... I think this game needs a guide. Or at least some direction as to how your witch is supposed to get to town... maybe I went the wrong way, but I seem to be several maps deep in a forest of creatures that only threaten me when they gang up on you in droves...\n\nI mean, the witch seems interesting enough, and she makes many a wisecrack. The fact that you can rename her helps some, too. But still... I'm not sure I'm going the right way (and said witch is about level 10 at this point)...\n\nFor now, I cannot recommend this title.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501195877, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501195877, "recommendationid": "33843147", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502944", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
