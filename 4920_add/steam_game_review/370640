At that time, I was unable to find these hidden locations on steam forums or even in the guidebook.\n\nNow 2 years later, I decide to play the game from scratch again.\nI had a wonderful time.\nFurthermore, by this time 2 of my friends on steam have already finished this game and found the secret hidden locations, so I was able to get help.\n\nReplaying the game after 2 years is really fun too.\nI enjoyed this game very much and am looking forward to playing Midnight Blessings 2 which has been recently released on steam. \n\nRecommended!!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493279122, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493279122, "recommendationid": "31389104", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494673", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 7}}
