I got stuck inside a castle, with no way to proceed, and even the so-called \"Egress\" Spell that is supposed to bring you to the entrance of a dungeon isn't working anymore. I thought this might be some kind of bug.\n\nSo, as I intended to play on, I tried to get help in the (obviously dead) forum, which didn't do me any good.\nI even tried to register at the forum of the developer (as they don't care about steam forums), which didn't do me anything good either. I'm still waiting for the admin to activate my registration. Maybe their forums are dead as well.\n\nIf I had the possibility, I would have asked for a refund, but I already played for 5 hours, which now seems like a total waste. And I won't buy a walkthrough that is even more expensive than the game was. I don't think I'll buy games from this developer anymore.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502119299, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502119299, "recommendationid": "34083765", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498735", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
