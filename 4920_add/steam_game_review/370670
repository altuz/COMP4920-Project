Remarkably poor writing on a technical level combined with absolutely no sense of subtlety, as Jerrat tells the player that he loves his family and will be sad now that they're dead and swears revenge because he is angry and is bad at fighting because he is a common man, as the story then poorly meshes with the gameplay as Jerrat proceeds to have trouble beating up rats despite regularly going to the forest to pick mushrooms. Add in the clumsy pairing of original art and stock RPGMaker assets and you have an all around mediocre game that I see no reason to bother sitting through any longer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498598501, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498598501, "recommendationid": "32889760", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507934", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498387652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1205, "steamid": "76561198030896901", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Recently played the game and finished it on normal mode.\n\nI liked the following:\n1) Interesting and fun conversations between each characters.\n2) Character's thoughts are conveyed throughout the game, which makes the content and gameplay enjoyable.\n3) Interesting system where you cannot just barge into civilian's houses and loot (like your average classic RPGs ;D)\n4) The stroy was quite short in my perspective, but the storyline do just go straight to the point.\n\nSuggestions for the game:\n(a) The world map appears to be \"locked-route\" and it would be better-off if players are given the option to be able to re-visit without being barred from the main story.\n(b) The side quest may be better if they are not time-event bound.\n(c) The varieties of enemies can be improved, exepcially for bosses.\n(d) There should be options for post-end game plays where you are able to attend to side quests or finding secret rooms in my opinion.\n(e) If only other characters may also be optional to join the party while on the quest...\n\nOverall it is quite a nice game with its own pros and cons.

I like that we get to see a lot of the inner thoughts of the characters, and watch their personal progression.  Combat was decent, good pixel art, though the outfits were silly nonsense.  Good ending.\n\nI like that there was a lot of world I didn't get to visit, as the characters had good reason to not just wander half a continent away -- they were on a deadline.  Yet those areas existed anyway, to give the world life.  There's more towns and cities than you can visit.  Also there's a lot of doorways you can't enter, because of course homeowners and shopkeepers don't want you rummaging through their stuff.  My primary compulsion as an RPG player is to loot everything, but we're playing as characters who generally don't do that.  Nice touch.  :D\n\nBig complaint was controls.  Controller didn't work, F12 surprisingly restarts the game instead of taking a screenshot (so I had to play the final battle again to see the rest of the ending -- oops!), and keys were not remappable.  It wasn't crippling, but it was very inconvenient.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497838416, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497838416, "recommendationid": "32555170", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503817", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498013432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 362, "playtime_forever": 96, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 445}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game starts with tragedy.
