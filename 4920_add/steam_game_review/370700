All it's pros and cons gathered to make a last call, [i]Black Home: Vermillion Monastery[/i] is a good RPGMaker game, yet not a good RPG.\n\nIt all begins during a heavy rainstorm, at the ruined tower halls of a forsaken monastery. We witness a battle for life and death between a Victorian gentleman, and... An undead priest and a pretty nun??!?! As the scene changes, we meet Lecia - or rather Elecia, who is a prim and proper lady with a chemistry degree. Through her diary, we learn that Lecia's husband, Lesnar left to search for an expedition arranged by the university, for the forsaken Vermillion Monastery. Said researchers haven't been heard from since and Lecia hasn't heard a thing from Lesnar thereon either. As the story starts, Lecia dreams of Lesnar calling for help and decides to go investigate the matter herself. What she will discover shortly after, is beyond her most foul nightmares.\n\nOkay, okay. Pretty yet smart girl, lost relative, someone calling for help to an obviously dangerous place and as the protagonist follows, a dreadful occult catastrophe threatening to end the world occurs? Yup, we have seen this one many, many times before. It's the baseline of all HOG and most RPGMaker games out there anyhow + even some Hollywood movies. Yet, what makes [i]Black Home[/i] notice worthy among others?\n\nFirst of all, I should say that the game presents one of the better uses of RPGMaker out there. Environment design isn't terribly rich, yet it is gathered into a logical and consistent collection to present you a really, really big dungeon crawl and a decent enough atmosphere. The original midi soundtrack is pretty and the setting in enriched with even proper sound effects. The story itself is a bit lame though, but characters are enacted properly with appropriate personality undertones to make them somewhat memorable. Their story interactions are well-written. It is very much Henry James meets Arkham Horror out there.\n\nAs an RPG though, it is pretty much a straight railroad on a dungeon crawl. You recruit a party as you play, adorn them with items, defeat monsters for the experience; etc. I didn't notice any level cap, but I ended the story with my characters around level 20, and I am quite sure there was nothing else left to slay within the huge main map. If you have an idea about the prime function of any and all JRPGs, battles will become boringly easy within half an hour, and character skills are not various enough to challenge you into battle strategies. Monsters do not differ that much in their abilities either. Thus, you play for the story.\n\nWell, there are 2 distinct endings - one happy, one not so happy - for you to discover according to your actions nearing the end. I'd say the whole thing packs 7-8 hours or gameplay if you don't mind grinding a bit and visiting the same areas within a huge map to collect loot and experience. Oh, and it has also achievements.\n\nLast verdict? It's nothing brilliant, but a decent time kill with a story for a day. It depends on your mood. It was a bit fluffy on the \"Old Ones\" concept if you ask me, but who am I to judge? Overall, the game is not bad at all. Don't forget to fetch it on a sale! Good day, and good gaming to you!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1471972115, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1471972115, "recommendationid": "25094589", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602954", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442074671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 987, "steamid": "76561197995105285", "num_games_owned": 4340}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Black Home is a turn-based RPG about a woman who teams up with a group of travellers to find her missing husband. The characters are pretty interesting and have unique dialogues, but the story is pretty generic (blah blah evil cult etc). It was an interesting idea to have the entire game set in one building and its grounds.\n\nThe game isn't bad really but it could have used a bit more polish. There are a few typos in the dialogue. The battle system is functional but it was never really clear to me whether various elemental attacks actually had different effects or not so I always ended up just spamming the highest level skill I had rather than using them strategically. Additionally, it was kind of annoying that there was no way to see how much health an enemy has left, so it was hard to know whether to use a skill that used up a lot of SP or not, and you didn't know how far through a boss battle you were. Music was okay but the looping clips were very short so if you were really exploring an area it could get annoying pretty quickly.\n\nMany items that you can interact with are indicated by a little star, but some are not, so sometimes progression would halt for a bit because I didn't have an object that I didn't know I could pick up. Also in some areas it's hard to tell if the edge of the room is a transition to another area or just a wall.\n\nEnemies are visible on the map so they're avoidable if you don't want to fight them at that moment (though it's a little weird that all enemies use the same 3 or 4 sprites) and enemies don't respawn when they're killed, which makes exploration a little more bearable.

I have a lot of RPG Maker type games, and this one managed to stand out.\n\nThe whole Lovecraft vibe is very well presented and is one of my favorite things about this game.  Creepy ancient monastery, weird characters with weird quirks, eerie sound effects- they all pull together to keep the mood slightly horrifying.\n\nAs others have noted, there is a lot of backtracking and searching for items you missed or places that you couldn't access before, but that is part of the fun.  The levels tend to be maze-like and the backtracking helps to keep the map in your head.  \n\nThe monsters and battle system are standard- more there to keep the danger vibe than to offer any real challenge.  This game is definitely story oriented rather than action oriented.\n\nThere were times that I needed to look up the location of certain items, because they aren't always noticeable.  There is a little sparkle in interactive places, but sometimes you need to be standing in exactly the right spot to notice.  It only happened 3 or 4 times, so it didn't really affect my gameplay. \n\nFor replayabilty- There are two different endings you can get and achievements to unlock. For this type of game,  I usually wait a while before playing it again so I can be startled all over again and  find secrets that I had forgotten, but it is a game that I'll be playing again.     \n\nYou should be able to finish the game in a day.
