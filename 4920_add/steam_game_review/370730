I miss the old dos one which is 6mb.\n\nAnd the opening Overture music when you select scenario is very exciting in dos-midi, quite better than nowadays mp3 to hear\n\nEntering scenario selecting menu 7 times you'll get an extra scenario, 1582, on Nobunaga's death.\n\n\u4e8c\u5341\u591a\u5e74\u524d\u5728\u540c\u5b66\u5bb6\u73a9\uff0c\u4e09\u4e2a\u4eba\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9009\u4e86\u7ec7\u7530\u548c\u6b66\u7530\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u6211\u56e0\u4e3a\u73a9\u6e90\u5e73\u5408\u6218\u548c\u5143\u671d\u79d8\u53f2\uff0c\u770b\u5230\u6709\u5317\u6761\uff0c\u5c31\u9009\u4e86\u5317\u6761\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u7532\u76f8\u9a8f\u540c\u76df\u5c31\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0a\u6d1b\u548c\u7ec7\u7530\u5f00\u6218\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u79cd\u79cd\u7530\u3002\u5982\u4eca\u4e00\u4e2a\u540c\u5b66\u5df2\u7ecf\u5931\u53bb\u8054\u7edc\u4e86\u3002", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1479284213, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504437862, "recommendationid": "26626843", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504224", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
