With the amount of cosmetics there are you can make amazing combinations. To put Holodrive in perspective it is a two dimensional platformer multiplayer shooter where you play as robots with a variety of weapons. A plus is also buying the early supporter pack for the price of the base game because you get to copies of the game to so you can give one to a friend. It also gives you a ton of coins so you can get cosmetics and new weaons right off the bat like I did with the shiruken launcher. Overall, Holodrive is an amazing game, but some weapons need to be balanced a bit more like the shotgun because I can grab it and get an average of 5 kills without running out of ammo where with the rarer weapons I can only get 2 or 3 at most. This is the greatest game and everyone who dislikes it is a quitter or is just trying to play the wrong type of game that suits them.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460314300, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1460314300, "recommendationid": "22345165", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500751", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477006622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 181, "steamid": "76561198238885804", "num_games_owned": 32}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun, but its pretty easy to get a shotgun, and ohko everyone.\nBazooka, laser, and shotgun seriously need a nerf\nother than that\ni reccomend it\nto those with perserverance", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459457201, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1459549872, "recommendationid": "22167265", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499886", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506908881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 26668, "steamid": "76561198098208155", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Super B Shooting game...", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1467265489, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1467265489, "recommendationid": "23945952", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463377428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12, "steamid": "76561198193659085", "num_games_owned": 3}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "dada", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459993624, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1459993624, "recommendationid": "22278309", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499130", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1474415360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 238, "steamid": "76561198198804489", "num_games_owned": 8}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Each time that I search a match the game crash!What should I do help!!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460826001, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1460826001, "recommendationid": "22457301", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498143", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459130937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 124, "steamid": "76561198083933396", "num_games_owned": 18}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Its like tf2 but sideways with alot of silly customizables and guns.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458921562, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1458921562, "recommendationid": "22044781", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443284", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506010564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23856, "steamid": "76561198275908963", "num_games_owned": 2}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Everything is cool - everything.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460467587, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1460467587, "recommendationid": "22375325", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 11, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
