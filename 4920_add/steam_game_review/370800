If there's some people behind this that are willing to put some time into it.. This game could be fun as hell.\n\nI don't play a ton of VR games, but the left joystick movement in this is heaps better than say the teleport movement in Robo-whatever.

The range of your shots are unrealistically short as well.\n\nI played for ~10 mins, and I was having a blast.\n\nI grew up playing paintball, and the original Greg Hastings game was the 'Tony Hawk Pro Skater' of our sport.
