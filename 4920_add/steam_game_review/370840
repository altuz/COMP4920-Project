The really really early ones, where even though you were stairing straight at a player to pass to, you would still kick the ball out instead. Well this has the same dynamics. Few passes go as intended. \nWorse, a line break causes the ultra zoom to kick in, so you cant even see players that you want to pass to.\nIt gets worse at kicking,  watch in amazement as a tackled player collapses to the earth, but from nowhere (certainly not his boots) a ball is kicked spiraling up the field. \nIts a shame, this is a game that really wants to be good, but falls short almost everywhere. \nIt is pretty clear that there has been no real testing done and the work looks shoddy and half finished throughout. \nFor example, win a tournment: you don't get to see the table. \nAdd to this that they do not even have the strips for some of the international teams.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495470555, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495470555, "recommendationid": "31903740", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505125824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3033, "steamid": "76561197992729961", "num_games_owned": 95}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Terrible.\n\nLook, I love rugby, I've put a lot of time into this game.
