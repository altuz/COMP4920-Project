It starts out, of course, like an ordinary mystery, with the heroine following threads that are surprisingly logical and believable in the course of investigating her grandfather's odd death -- but then things start to get spectral and culty in the classiest of ways.  The tone of the adventure is predominately serious, but Kathy can't help but engage in a few cheeky high jinks of the sort that are hardwired into every point-and-click protagonist's DNA.  Personally, if I don't get to do a little Threepwoodish trollery in an adventure, something just feels [i]off[/i].\n\nIf you are skittish about episodic games, know that this is not one, whatever the title suggests.

The comparisons to Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father are unavoidable, and both excel at different aspects. \n\nOverall, the characters are better and the story is much more \u201chuman\u201d. The \u201cmystery\u201d and supernatural elements aren\u2019t quite as good, though; GK was about Voodoo and had lots of freaky, unnerving experiences (the nightmares, the symbolism, the professor incident, the man outside the window, the burial wheel, etc.). KR\u2019s supernatural elements are a peculiar blend of Christianity and Paganism, and the antagonists are comparatively drab. The more human dramatics are much more compelling, though, and that's where KR excels. \n\nExcluding the antagonists (Malia and Tetelo are more interesting antagonists than their KR counterparts), every other character is on par or more interesting. Gabriel Knight is a standard hero plus witty and lascivious plus Southern accent, but not much else, while Kathy Rain is similarly witty and fun, but also deeply wounded in real ways. E is comparable to Grace in being the research assistant, but Grace is too much of a Mary Sue. KR\u2019s grandmother is more emotionally complex as well, where as GK\u2019s grandmother was solely generic sweetness tinged with sadness.  \n\nStrangely, there don\u2019t appear to be any failures. Far as I can tell, it\u2019s impossible to die or progress in a way that makes the game unwinnable (for better or worse). The worst that can happen is that you might be temporarily stalled before figuring something out, which only seems possible if completely not paying attention. This isn't overtly obvious until the end, but it does take some tension out of the game. A few times I tried to induce a failure condition only to find Kathy wouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nLike any similar games, there\u2019s going to be a few puzzles that are absolute fuckery. This game has two; the audio editing portion and the safe/mausoleum. Both are doable, but tedious enough to ruin the flow of the story; might as well look up the walkthrough for just those two incidents and you won\u2019t lose anything. The rest of the time, Kathy is dropping almost too many hints; makes for a shorter game experience, and the occasional feeling of the game just telling you what to do. \n\nHighly recommended.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506309691, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506309691, "recommendationid": "35195473", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506545071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 361, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 361, "steamid": "76561198142054178", "num_games_owned": 412}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I kept comparing Kathy to Rosa from the Blackwell series -- another female protagonist in her twenties, also a journalist, who investigates supernatural stuff and has a family member in a psychiatric hospital -- and I couldn't help but constantly think about how much I prefer Rosa to Kathy. It's not necessarily about the characters' different personalities, but more about the way in which the player can choose their dialogue. If I want Rosa to be sassy, I can make her say sassy things. If I want her to be mean, I can make her say mean things. If I want her to be kind, I can do that too: Rosa is a more more well-rounded character. Kathy felt more flat in comparison. \nKathy can be unnecessary brutal towards people. Sometimes you can choose between being nice and being savage, however, there are many times that you'll get a dialogue \"choice\", but all the choices are the same. (For example: when [spoiler]Lenny asks Kathy out[/spoiler], not only does the player not have the option to accept, but all of Kathy's rejections are mean as well.) Why do I have to be mean all the time? I wanna be able to choose which characters to be mean to according to my likes and dislikes. Having the ability to choose makes me feel more connected to the player character.\n\nI'm not saying I wanted more choice-and-consequence or a branching narrative in conjunction with my choices. Going back to the Blackwell series: none of Rosa's answers in those situations will change the way NPCs behave towards the player character. But they did change how I felt towards Rosa, made me feel closer to her. These choices are not about furthering the narrative, but about conveying different emotions.\n\nLook, I don't know how to end this rant. I literally just finished the game half an hour ago. I'll have to think about it a bit more and come back to this.\nSuffice it to say: I liked the game, but I wish it were a bit... more. Maybe in the next installment. eh?\n\n\nOther thoughts: \n- The visuals are stunning. Clearly the best part about this game.\n- The voice acting is pretty good; however, some VAs clearly have not had a lot of training/experience when it comes to unnecessary mouth noises (lip smacking and such), which I found pretty distracting. Especially when it comes to the priest, cause he talks a lot, and I don't need to hear his saliva, thank you very much.\n- Sometimes has a case of the Adventure Game Logic when it comes to puzzles. Like, how come the guy I tazered talked to me cordially when I bumped into him again later? Why is he not scared of me now?
