The concept is simple, the controls even more so, but the difficulty curve is one of the most abrupt I've seen in rhythm games.\n\n[h1]The Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Good Music[/b] - The most important aspect of a music based games is, well, the music. It's a collection of five Drum&Bass songs by the same artist. There is sufficient diversity between them to entertain, and the melody is catchy too!\n\n[*][b]Lovely Design[/b] - The game adopts a minimalist approach when it comes to graphics and UI, and damn, it looks good and makes it easier for your eyes to notice screen elements more easily. Here your reflexes are really important, and a good plain color contrast between obstacles and the road is welcomed. Minor shading is also present. The menus look very sleek and I like them too.\n\n[*][b]Entangling Challenge[/b] - If you could pass each level on the first try, it would only require you 25 minutes of your time to complete the game. However, that can easily turn in quite the few hours because it is very challenging. But it's the good type of challenge - the kind that has you replay the level again and again because surely a stupid game isn't better than you. Come on, you can do it!\n\n[*][b]Free OST[/b] - You can get the song files for free as a DLC. Be sure to get it from the app page.\n\n[*][b]Achievements[/b] - There are only five: Complete level X. Which is great for achievement hunters... assuming you can complete the game.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Insane Difficulty Curve[/b] - Level 1 is easy. Level 2 is a bit harder, but manageable. Level 3 requires a couple dozen tries to get accustomed to, Level 4 is... holy $#!^. Level 5... I haven't reached yet.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nYou pay 5 bucks (coupons are fairly common, too) for five songs and a nice reflex game to encase them. Free OST, great deal, good if you have time (and nerves) to kill. \n\n[table][tr][td]If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, [b]consider joining my group[/b] and [b]follow my curator[/b] page!

But I've been enjoying it immensely the whole journey.\nBecause the video trailer is misleading (in a negative way) and tells you nothing about what [i]Cosmophony[/i] feels like, I encourage you to see [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=564193901]my gameplay video[/url] (no commentary). I hope you can understand how enjoyable it was to play the game in this manner.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=564193901\nThe first two levels allow you to follow the tune to a great extent and can be perfected by anyone, and the game is totally worth it for that feeling alone. The following levels, though, made me feel confused. At first they just seemed like a bunch of random obstacles. But understanding came with time and practice. A big component in this game is memorization (yes, the levels are not generated; same every time). Usually I'm an opponent of memorization, but here it's very pleasant, because the levels are indeed tuned to the music. Knowing what comes next in the music is vital for knowing when to expect the obstacles. And the so called \"muscle memory\" helps with the obstacles themselves.\n\nTo complete a level (a bit under 2 minutes each) you need to go through it from the beginning to the end without failing. It's a bit annoying that the difficult parts are usually towards the end. But the game can't be blamed, because there is a practice mode with plenty of checkpoints and free traversal between them. For more casual gameplay you don't even have to play outside of the practice mode. Even so, the final levels can be a nightmare to complete if you don't get into the right mindset.\n\n[i]Cosmophony[/i] is played mainly with 2 directional buttons which let you switch between the 7 lanes. Then there is the [i]shoot[/i] button which you should use whenever there is a special kind of obstacle in front of you. This mechanic is very simple and there is no penalty for spamming the button all the time, or just evading these obstacles. Even so, this mechanic is beneficial to the gameplay. If you want to make the game even more interesting, you can try to shoot to the beat instead of just spamming, like I did in my video. Destroying every destroyable obstacle is the requirement for \"perfect\" completion of each level, but it's not something that everyone should do (there aren't even achievements for this).\n\nAnother thing I would note is that, especially in the later levels, the music's rhythm sometimes corresponds to when the obstacles pass you, and not to when you need to move away, so you need to make a big mental effort to not press the keyboard button when you hear a beat, but instead anticipate it and move before it.\n\nGraphics are nice and clean. Music is made by a great Drum&Bass artist [i]Salaryman[/i].\n\nIn conclusion, I really liked the game, but I realize that it may be just because I'm part of the target audience and because I worked around potential annoyances to make it interesting for myself, so can't give it a 10/10.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448732175, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448732175, "recommendationid": "19340660", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522548", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465099364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 298, "playtime_forever": 213, "steamid": "76561198014552816", "num_games_owned": 277}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I feel so torn with this game. i was yanking my hair out trying to beat almost every level, While it has great music and interesting backgrounds that rhythmically went with the tunes, Its very challenging.

Mechanics change mid level with no time to react, targets are hidden and require specific movement to setup a way to reach them. (Trying not to spoil anything) On the fifth level the timing of the gimmick mechanic seems really dodgy one moment and fine the next. I know where I'm supposed to be positioned at what time, but its hit or miss if the game reacts like I expect it to. Might be better if there wasn't any delay between key presses and lane switching but theres a small delay that is easily noticable when trying to quickly move from one side of the screen to the other. Makes hitting some of the timing goals a lot harder than they need to be.\n\nThat being said its cheap, the music is good, and its definitely an interesting game. If it ever goes on sale I couldn't recommend it more. But 5.50 CAD is probably the upper limit on what I'd spend on 5 levels with no level editor.

One thing to note is that the game gets pretty hard pretty fast; then again, there are only 5 levels, so each level counts for 20% of progress. Of course the first 40% of the game would be easy; at level 4, naturally one would expect a game to become very difficult towards the end of the game.

To get a feel for just how hard the game gets, I looked at the global achievement stats; 7.3% of players have cleared level 4, and 2.9% of players have clared level 5 (as of writing this review).\n\nAs stated before, there are 5 levels, and 5 achievements; one achievement for clearing each level.
