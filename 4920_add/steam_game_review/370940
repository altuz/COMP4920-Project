Really, my beef is more with the price. I feel eight bucks is a bit too much for a game in a genre that has so much stiff competition. I played three players for about an hour - until they whined enough for us to go back to [i]TowerFall[/i]. I will play more though.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Good music\n+Environments change over time (e.g. it turns from day to night)\n+Tarot cards are well done, in how they alter gameplay (very similiar to orbs in [i]TowerFall[/i])\n+The shield mechanic may very well be the best thing about this game. Essentially, when you use your shield, if an enemy shoots you at close range it will spray back at them and kill them. [b]Bringing something novel to the table is very valuable in indie games.[/b]\n+Devs are responsive and kind, on the forums\n\n[b]Meh:[/b]\n.Artwork is so-so IMO\n.Lots of levels, but the differences do not really affect how I play or the strategies that I use\n.As far as I found, there are no differences in what character you choose\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-For a game that [i]only[/i] has local play (no single or multiplayer), there are not enough game variants or customization options for a match. This needs to be first priority.\n-There is something about how the screen is fixed in [i]TowerFall[/i] that is more appealing than a screen that zooms in and out like in this game and [i]Duck Game[/i]. I don't know why, but I think its just easier for more casual players in general.\n-I am not at all religious, but the in-your-face religious nods can turn people off. It turned off a friend last night, in fact. Its a subtle thing - take the [i]Binding of Isaac[/i] for example. They never [i]quite[/i] reference anything super-specific. Jesus Juice is about as close as it gets. [i]Demons with Shotguns[/i] kinda steps a bit too far. Don't get me wrong - its a cool theme for a game, but maybe just be a bit more classy about religious references. Just my opinion, I am sure people will hate.\n[b]-I mean, I hate to say it again, but I will - this is essentially [i]Duck Game[/i], but without a billion weapon options, multi or single player, character customization, armor wearables, etc. etc. And it was only 3 bucks more at release. [/b]\n\nGood luck in the future, and I will change the review if/when enough has been done. \n\n-Ryan", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1447165639, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437058926, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1437059050, "recommendationid": "17076975", "developer_response": "Thank you for taking the time to write a review!
