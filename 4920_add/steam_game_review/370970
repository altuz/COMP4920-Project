You can shoot the enemies but you must take care  to not shoot the prisoners too. Some pushable blocks can block the enemies or kill them. This is an original little action game. The graphics and the music are correct, not great, but appropriate. The little stylized characters are cute enough. The random generation of mazes gives interesting results, more or less difficult each time. This is quite addictive at the beginning and after that, a game I play for a short session, from time to time. [i]Unlimited Escape 4[/i], included in this pack, has the same gameplay, with a different layout. I played previously [i]Unlimited Escape 2[/i], that has a gameplay a little different. I prefer [i]Unlimited Escape 3-4[/i], where you have a better control over the prisoners.  \n\nA complete description of the controls: you move the protagonist with mouse-click, press E and you can guide the prisoners (if they are close enough) with the cursor (and the enemies begin to appear in the orange cubes and pursue you), E again to stop the prisoners (and that also stops the generation of new enemies, the existing enemies continue to advance), press space to shoot. If an enemy touches you, or if you fall from the maze, you die instantly and start again, with a different maze (of the same difficulty). When you succeed to save the required number of prisoners, you play an other randomly generated level, with a bigger maze, more enemies and prisoners. In the main menu, there are settings to choose the type of camera view and the difficulty. Some of these settings are reset to default each session.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440080198, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440353794, "recommendationid": "17629594", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509939", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
