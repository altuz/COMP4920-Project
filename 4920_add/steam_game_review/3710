Back in the bronze age, 'budget game' was code for 'less quantity,' and had very little to do with the actual quality. Games that didn't satisfy the minimum level of competence and quality were relegated to the bargain bin, which wasn't something any developer with aspirations of a career ever wanted to be associated with. For a look at a typical bargain bin title, the marine sharpshooter series will bring you up to speed on just how super horrible those were.\n\nBeing a contemporary of the halo generation, Dredd vs Death is mechanically rather modern, to a point (two guns, dedicated punch and grenade buttons, partially regenerating health), while being built around oldschool - almost vintage - themes and ideas. For instance, the game assumes that when it tells you to arrest people, that you'll arrest people, rather than shoot them. If you shoot them, you get a game over. Whoa, man, what is this!? A fail state in a videogame!\n\nJokes aside, it's a curious blend of two styles of gameplay. You are, as the title might have hinted at, judge Dredd. You are judge, jury, and executioner, and it's your job to uphold law and order in a world where there is none. Missions range from preventing vandalism to cracking down on supernatural dudes made of fire who feel the need to turn incredibly fat people into zombies. Dredd, being a firm believer in LAW, has zero tolerance for zombie XXXXXL fatties, and is not impressed by the little wheels they have to hold up their incredible girth.\n\nFighting skeletons in the sewers also doesn't impress Dredd. Justice for all, but justice comes at a price, and that price is freedom. Armed with this most profound knowledge, you will arrest, shoot, and lay the verbal smackdown on everybody, no matter who they are, regardless of where you are, or the odds stacked against you. Dredd's quips make Duke Nukem look like a serious, sensible, and sophisticated character, which is only fitting, because Duke was inspired by characters like Dredd.\n\nUnlike Duke, Dredd actually has to follow certain rules, and has basic objectives that must be completed. Unless they shoot first, Dredd is required to challenge suspects, so they have at least a microsecond to consider surrender. Shooting a perp who's surrendered is a crime. In case it wasn't obvious, not doing enough LAW will damage Dredd's ego met- LAW meter. Full depletion of your LAW meter results in a non-standard game over. Finishing levels with high LAW unlocks stuff, golden eye 64 style. It's in your best interest to sentence suspects to hundreds, if not thousands, of years of imprisonment for a wide range of crimes. Illegal possession of goldfish, being too fat in public, smoking outside designated smoking areas, holding liberal views, and simply being in a position where you could have potentially obstructed justice are common crimes.\n\nThis game doesn't mess around. Like masterchief, Dredd can only carry two weapons. Unlike masterchief (or perhaps very much like masterchief) Dredd will always carry his starting pistol. The lawgiver has 6 different firing modes, a scope, great handling, and other than limited ammunition, very few downsides. Essentially, it's a Megaman buster. Your secondary weapon more often than not ends up being something you bring along to perform a specific function, or fill a particular need. Judge weapons have extra features and gubbinz, while civvie weapons are basic 'press mouse 1 to kill people'-deals. In each mission, you are allowed 3 stun grenades, which can potentially force a crowd of perps to surrender instantly. You're also allowed full, infinite use of the FIST OF DREDD, the application of which is enough to crush the strongest enemy under the weight of the LAW. Dredd's melee attack feaures into his arsenal like Duke's mighty boot, rather than the gimmicky melee attacks you see in more modern games, and enemies are placed, designed, and spawned with the assumption that you'll use it.\n\nSo you have a pistol with multiple firing modes, a secondary weapon, your fist, very limited stun grenades, the ability to verbally challenge perps with one-liners, and an arrest button. Half your lifebar is of the regenerating type, and the other half isn't. You can carry a maximum of 3 HP restoration items, which are used automatically when your lifebar reaches 0, and that's it.\n\nIt's an incredibly honest, shameless, pointed game, that sticks very close to the source material, and Dredd as always provides tongue in cheek social commentary that's as relevant as ever - possibly even more relevant now, since social justice became some kind of movement. A decade and then some after its release, Dredd vs Death not only serves as a link to the ancient past, but also highlights how far the videogame industry has fallen. The budget game of yesterday is far more competent, entertaining, and bold than the trendy hipster titles of today.\n\nIt's short by oldtimey standards (6-8 hours), but not really by modern ones, and features things like unlockables, zombie mode that don't cost money, arcade missions, coop play, splitscreen multiplayer, bot matches, reasons to play well, great voice acting, a no-nonsense plot, razor sharp commentary that never gets old, and is unburdened by censorship, DLC, political agendas, handholding, sprint buttons, cover systems, and most importantly of all, and this cannot be overstated...\n\nFun."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501869004, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522548", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 10, "recommendationid": "34020755", "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198054740508", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1504979649, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 386}, "timestamp_updated": 1501869004, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I A M T H E L A W"}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500428794, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511116", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 8, "recommendationid": "33642075", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198079337873", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1456631355, "num_games_owned": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 110}, "timestamp_updated": 1500428794, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Worth it for the akward red bull product placement (like one of the side objectives in one level is to find a stolen shipment of red bull)"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502437247, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511002", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34163131", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198028077955", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1502437012, "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 216}, "timestamp_updated": 1502437247, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I bought this for a few dollars during the last sale that \"Rebellion\" had on here.\n\nFor a few bucks, I can't complain.

The art and design are amazing. I can't still believe those views they put in the background when you look out a window or lookin' at when you're on a roof. You really feel yourself being in a HUGE city, even if the gameplay is pretty closed and linear, which is not a problem to me, but I can admit that it would be awesome, if the player could freely roam in this huge city. \nI really enjoyed arresting criminals instead of killin' 'em. There's a meter anyway that measures your acts and if you are too eager at killing, well, they take your badge and gun. :D\nI liked the story, as well. Yeah, that's it.\n\nThe only problem I have to mention is that the mouse control feels a bit weird, like if it had some kinda delay, but it has just a little effect to the gameplay, so nothing joy-breaking. And the reload is damn slow. Ok, that was two things.\n\nThe multiplayer was supported by Gamespy and it's dead for a few years now, but the game has LAN, so I guess you can manage to play it via Evolve, Hamachi, etc. And you can play the multiplayer modes alone with bots. I tried this, but not much fun there. I mean the multiplayer itself is not a big deal, especially with that mouse control I mentioned. The co-op (you can play the entire story with a partner) could be a good fun tho. I wish they had have put this kinda co-op in AVP (or at least in AVP Classic 2000), too.\n\nIs it worth 8 Euros (current price)? Well, I'd say wait for a sale, then grab it (around 3-4 Euros at top). Worth the buy, worth the play. It's really a fun game. But don't believe me, buy it and judge it for yourself."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501854183, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489206", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34016235", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198170200522", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1501856284, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 324}, "timestamp_updated": 1501854183, "received_for_free": false, "review": "this is the greatest game ever played. it reminds me a lot of the fith element. great game with futuristic open world sections. i love it. fight the law"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501850582, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497190", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34015223", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198264585443", "num_reviews": 48, "last_played": 1503593231, "num_games_owned": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 340}, "timestamp_updated": 1501850582, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Cool game , played this when i was 10\nnow im playing it on Steam\nOLD-SCHOOLIO <3"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502085036, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495038", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34075387", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058255443", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1502084829, "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 245}, "timestamp_updated": 1502085036, "received_for_free": false, "review": "i played it and yeah"}]}
