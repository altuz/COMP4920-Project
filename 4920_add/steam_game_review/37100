I love the way it looks.  And I enjoyed the platforming and puzzle solving aspects. The whole having equipment thing could just go...and the combat is terrible.  Its almost like this game didn't really know what it wanted to be.  I would have LOVED to have seen this game drop the inventory, use solely magic for combat (if it needed combat at all), and focus more giving the world more appeal.  While it is pretty to look at, it feels empty at times.  \n\nFor those who have played it, this game reminded me a lot of Valley Without Wind series."}]}
