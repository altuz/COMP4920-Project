It's almost like a homeworld mini game.  Not really much strategy or tactics, but it is a fun and addictive game, the way mini games are.  No depth, not much story, definitely worth getting on a good sale.  It's very relaxing as there is really no pressure or danger, just \"well this is happening\".\n\nIf you've reached the point where you are no longer being pulled to play a game and you aren't being pulled to play any other games, this is a fun little game that doesn't take much more than a day to play through.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504315556, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504315556, "recommendationid": "34673436", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500758619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 798, "steamid": "76561198011170199", "num_games_owned": 55}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Not a bad little game, and certainly worth the price.
