I've played Clash of the Continents scenario, very good way to learn the game.  I've won that on Grey (Amsterdam) easiest, Orange (China) and Yellow (USA) both slightly more difficult.  I'm currently working on winning as Red (Chile) definitely harder.  I think that both Blue (South Africa) and Green (South Australia) will be another notch harder.  I'm currently working on the Rise of the Reich scenario 1 game with USA the other with USSR.\n\nMy Tips to people new to the game:\n\n1. Coal is king, you need it to build anything, improving cities, making Goods, making Arms, building troops, did I say anything.  Set production of any Coal resources you own or acquire to Maximize ASAP.  Make capturing Coal resources a high priority.\n\n2. Improve Cities.  If playing Clash of the Continents you only have 1 city and it is max production, make some mobile units first turn to immediately capture surrounding countries.  When you capture a City if it's production is less than 10 set it to build Light Industry.  If it can build Basic Infantry in say 6 turns or less do that so you can defend you new territories.\n\n3. Research WAIT on it.  You need to capture a good number of territories before you worry about research.  IMO start researching Improved Infantry first, Light Tanks next.\n\n4. Check on other countries Cities regularly.  Then bottom right button that looks like a fold opens information about the world.  Click 2 button from left on Top the the far right tab (Cities) then at the headings click IPO.  That rearranges all the Citties of the World to show the highest production Cities first.  Any of these close to you are a priority to capture.\n\n5. Amphibious Assaults are tough.  You suffer a large penalty for these assaults.  NEVER try this on a Capital, instead do a massive assault on a territory next to or near them, hopefully one that shows level 1 or 0 Fortifications.\n\n6. Tanks are great for assaults.  High Offense ok defense.  I have noticed that the AI is smart enough that if you assualt with only Tanks you suffer a penalty (25 %) against Infantry so take some Infantry with you, remember I said Improved Infantry is first to research,", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495221824, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495221824, "recommendationid": "31846199", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507793", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 54, "total_reviews": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
