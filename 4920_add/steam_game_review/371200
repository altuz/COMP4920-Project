And I feel like that's what it is, except for one thing: the strategy.\n\nLet me start by saying that this game requires a lot of grinding and can be quite repetitive. Now that alone isn't all that bad, I just always listened to podcasts while playing. But what really made me stop playing was the combat. While there are lots of options, different attacks with nice animations, they don't really make a difference. As long as you have 2-3 ship types in the fleet, you're gonna beat all enemy fleets that are rougly at the same level. No strategising or thinking required. Just repetitive spamming of attacks, over and over again. I had to start a new game because of a bug (morale just constantly dropped, staying at 0 which made the game unplayable. But I haven't seen many bug reports so prob. was just unlucky) and tried to think about my choices, tried to combine different attacks, tried to actually think about what I'm doing but in the end it just felt the same as my first game. Combined with the fact that the enemy ships are basically always the same level as you, which for me really killed the sense of progress, I just couldn't bring myself to finish the game.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505563185, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505563185, "recommendationid": "34995089", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504916", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501126497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1335, "steamid": "76561197964475173", "num_games_owned": 35}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A truly wonderful experience!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505544874, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505544874, "recommendationid": "34989491", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495663", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 647, "total_reviews": 819, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 172}}
