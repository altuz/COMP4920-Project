The game is based on rolling or tumbling shapes (ball, cube, brick, cylinder, ...) through a labyrinth. Where it gets tricky is when you need to color each square of ground, or have restrictions tumbling (low ceiling), or you have time restrictions (labyrinth being bombed, conveyor belt). Some of these levels are very good.\n\nThe problems is the time-limited levels that you need to redo at each failure, and because the author likes long introductions (the game starts with a voice mail from space), that means spending a lot of time on these attempts getting past the easy stuff to fail yet again at something that is only revealed when it is too late (maybe a wrong turn in the labyrinth or a problem coming up on the conveyor that is obscured by other parts of the level). On the other hand, the game never lets you get into a new mechanic you've learned by providing a few more levels like it; instead, it prefers to throw a different mechanic at you quickly. Add to that a general lack of polish (changing the resolution always sets it immediately, no way to set SFX and cheap BGM volume separately, mixed quality of art style, getting stuck tumbling down the stairs because the game is using a general physics engine for what is essentially constrained movement), and my feelings about this game are mixed.\n\nIf the timed puzzles were optional, and if there were more levels, or if the game was cheaper, I'd recommend it, because I really liked some of the challenges. But as it is, I expect many buyers are going to be disappointed.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454803374, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454803641, "recommendationid": "21011241", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531135", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1433837231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 42, "steamid": "76561198033722103", "num_games_owned": 134}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Interesting concept and fairly fun. I only ran into a few minor problems with the game itself. The biggest and most glaring issue is a problem with collision. It seems as though when you are supposed to drop to another level, you can get stuck and have no choice but to reset.

This game is completely vapid and devoid of any actual puzzles, at least for the first half an hour.\n\nThe game runs at 40fps; for such a simple game, this should not happen. More on this later.\n\nThe first shape you get introduced to is a sphere. Yawn, how boring. A ball-rolling \"puzzle\" game. We have tons of those on Steam.\n\nThe second shape you get introduced to is a cube. Oh, how original; this CLEARLY didn't rip off EDGE.\n\nFurthermore, the levels involving the cube are extremely buggy (you can often clip through walls or get stuck in mid-air), and the 40fps framerate makes the cube move too extremely slowly. Oh, did I mention that the first two cube levels are glass mazes? Because they are. Seriously, dev, mazes where you can't see the walls are even worse than FPS games.\n\nThen there's the infamous Level 7; the cube starts off on a path which gets destroyed by a meteor, and cannot clear the path in time when the game is running at 40fps. Furthermore, while the cube seems to barely clear the path and is standing on solid ground, the \"falling off of path\" sound plays and the level restarts! This bug has made it impossible for me to progress any further, and within this half an hour of a supposed \"puzzle game\", I have not encountered a single puzzle that is not a maze.\n\nAdd to that the other misgivings in level design (i.e. punishing the player for not knowing something they couldn't have known before playing, or punishing the player for seeking a more efficient solution), UI and options (It's 2015 and you still don't have 1080p as a resolution?! There's no way to rebind keys or skip cutscenes?! Your game's UI is giant and obnoxious?!), and I can safely say that this game is one which I wish to refund. Unfortunately, I cannot do so since I bought this last winter, so that's \u00a33.49 down the drain.\n\nWhile it's no Journey Of The Light, even May's Mysteries: The Secret Of Dragonville is better than this, since that game actually started off with puzzles instead of time-wasting, buggy messes.\n\nDevelopers, take note: If you can't show any puzzles in your \"puzzle\" game within the first half an hour, why would the player continue playing? If your game's first half hour of gameplay is riddled with bugs, what reason do the players have to believe that the rest of it isn't? If your game's first half hour is not at all innovative or original, where is the \"innovative and original gameplay\" that developers like you implicitly promise us?\n\nAll in all, developers, this game is exactly what a puzzle game should NOT look like.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467828809, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1467828809, "recommendationid": "24139835", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494663", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440243270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 878, "steamid": "76561198236052602", "num_games_owned": 102}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Highly polished game, the physics are realistic with a satisfying \"feel\", addictive challenge, cool graphics and sound.\nI hope it does well and more games are made like this.\nThe game uses a very simple 4 arrow interface and the control is intuitive, it looks simple but the software must have been well developed to achieve this level of realism.\nIt does have the odd jam up needing Esc key but that is mainly because Vertex have gone the more crazy route of using a complex engine, and it pays off.\nIf you like the look of it , play it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436589233, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436589233, "recommendationid": "16986944", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499635", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460307439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 192, "steamid": "76561198059225023", "num_games_owned": 92}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I recommend this game when the developers fix bugs.
