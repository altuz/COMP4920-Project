You fix this bug by simply restarting the game.  \n\nI was definitely on the fence when I saw this on sale for $9.99, especially with some of the bad reviews.  The first two chapters are certainly well done and had me thinking that the negative reviews were way off.  But then the 3rd Act came and I was stunned at how truly off the rails the story went.  They really jumped the shark on Act 3, from a dog driving a tractor to a zombie priest trying to get the arm of a little boy to regenerate and his mom being a willing accomplice seemingly from nowhere.  So when a good story has a bad third act, it really makes you question whether you enjoyed the experience or not.  I still am not sure.\n\nMost of the experience is picking from 1 to 4 dialogue choices and from  choosing from 1 of several stories to report to the blog, print, or your boss.  This game mechanic is completely forgotten in Act Three because they are all unemployed by then (seriously).  There's a few puzzles thrown in, but they are very easy.  What makes this a good game is the writing (it's really strong throughout minus some questionable plot choices in the 3rd Act and some repeating gags that weren't all that funny).  This is a mostly good story with lots of details on all the characters, giving the story life.   ACG gave this a wait for sale and mentioned no voice acting, but in fact there is voice acting now.  It's not the best voice actors, but they get the job done or at least I've heard worse.  Obviously, the animations are not the best when the actors are reading the lines.  And in the Final Act, the animations got even worse.  The zombie guy I couldn't even see.  So he wasn't really a zombie, more like the invisible man.  \n\nI think VR definitely made this game interesting for me.  It's fun seeing all the sets and you feel like you are part of the audience.  I don't think I would have enjoyed this game without VR.  Just don't expect the best visuals, they are passable but with VR it just makes it more immersive.  I wish TellTale wold make their games VR as that would make those games a lot better experiences as well.\n\nAnyways, I do recommend this game on sale for 50% off.  I spent over 6 hours to finish this tale of murder, conspiracy, and investigative journalism/blogging/PI/gators.  It was just such a let down at the end that it left a bitter taste in my mouth.  \n\nRating 5.5/10\n\n[b]Updated on 10/3/2017 after finishing the game to reflect complete experience [/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505971220, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507008261, "recommendationid": "35097950", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 61, "total_reviews": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 9}}
