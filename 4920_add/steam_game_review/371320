It's obviously a labor of love made by people who like RPGs and worked hard to make a game they want others to enjoy. The game has a surprising number of extras, including minigames and comics.\n\nPlayers can choose whether to be a hero or a villain (although becoming a villain right away is a bit difficult because there's a tough fight). Most NPCs can be left alone, offended/apologized, or killed. Some can be recruited, then later killed if the player wants. The player can go on dates and have conversations with a variety of female NPCs, too.\n\nCustom controls are shown as needed, but otherwise players are expected to be familar with rpgmaker games. For example, players can run holding Shift or toggle full screen with Alt+Enter, but there's no help that mentions this. Also don't expect amenities like a journal or quest log, not that it's really needed.\n\nThe English translation is a bit rough but understandable. It adds to the charm.\n\nI'm not sure how much exposure this game will receive. I don't think it has much marketing and kind of showed up out of nowhere, but it's worth a look!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449516854, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449516854, "recommendationid": "19552775", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549797", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483503475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1063, "steamid": "76561198058413883", "num_games_owned": 95}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A great RPG with alot of work put into!\n*PROS*\n1.

If you are an adult, or you want decent gameplay, a decent story or even some decent jokes, look somewhere else.
