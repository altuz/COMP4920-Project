I was really looking forward to this game, unfortunately it is nowhere close to release ready.   I really liked the graphics on this game and hope the developers are able to make it work.\n\nHere are the main problems I experienced in my brief playtime and how I'd like to see it fixed.\n\n1) Towers should be introduced slowly over the first few story levels.  Currently once you start level 1 all towers are available with no way of knowing what each is good for.\n\n2) Enemies, again level 1 and there were numerous different enemy types.  Introduce them slowly over a few levels so we can learn how to combat the different types.  Maybe a pop-up the first time an enemy appears telling us about them.  \n\n3) Theme, This is a fantasy orc tower defense, I don't want my Gatling gun spitting pitiful little balls of light that slowly follow the enemy.  I want cannons, bullets, maybe a wizard.    And add some sounds and impact to the enemies.  The guns currently do so little damage you can't even tell if they are hitting the mobs.\n\n4) Difficulty.  The game is way too difficult.  Enemies are too fast, too much health, guns don't hit hard enough.  Multiple separate paths on the first level.  Tone this stuff down.  Give us a few levels of 1 path to get used to the game.  make the enemies killable.\n\nSome form of fixes are needed for the above points for the game to even be playable.  Below are some thoughts on how I think the game could go from playable to awesome.\n\na) First Person Towers.  Perks point to us being able to enter the towers for some first person action.  This sounds awesome, it sounds even better if we could control the guns while in the tower.  Imagine holding your 2 vivemotes up like you have a Gatling gun in front of you, the haptic feedback shaking your hands as you empty thousands of rounds in the approaching orc horde.  Maybe shoot for the legs to slow the enemy or go for headshots to do extra damage.  Some enemies could have armor, making it more efficient to shoot them in the extremities.  Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know if it is even possible to enter the towers yet, I could not figure out how.\n\nb) Movement, while I can access all the towers from 1 spot with the laser target, let me teleport around the board so I can lean in and get a closer view of the different areas of the map\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463018485, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463018485, "recommendationid": "22920476", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533418", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462889389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 13, "steamid": "76561198034733683", "num_games_owned": 54}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The graphics look very good, however the GUI is very buggy: the text is in the wrong position in comparison to the images.
