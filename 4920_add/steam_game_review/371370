It was insomuch obtrusive that I thought there had to be a twist, yet this game takes itself seriously until the bitter end.\n\n- Subpar and amateurish writing in general. There were so many passages that would have made me laugh my head off if they hadn't pissed me off instead.\n\n- The final boss battle was a joke. I won't spoil much when I say that you can't win the first battle and virtually can't lose the second battle \"for story reasons\", thus revealing all grinding (see below) to have been utterly futile.\n\n- Battles in general are boring. Your only two choices are to either exploit your enemy's one and only weakness over and over again or to die. Not only, but especially the foes in the last dungeon can \"one-shot\" any character despite his/her setup. Unfortunately, the class system renders itself redundant. Your \"mage-born\" characters will never be strong enough for the fighter classes and your \"fighter-born\" characters will never be intelligent enough to use mage abilities effectively vice versa. At least all encounters are visible, but it soon becomes a chore to avoid them (if you plan to preserve your resources for a boss battle).\n\n- Balancing. I hate balancing (foes level with you) in RPGs. What's the point of fighting and leveling when you're as strong as before in relation to your enemies after gaining a level? Reversely, it takes for all eternity to grind/level up enough so you can beat the few optional bosses that have a set level. Therefore, I didn't beat the last optional boss (level 50) for I was only at level 35 at the end of the game after already having played for 70 hours (even though I'm sure this game can - and should - be completed in less than 10 hours).\n\n- Equipment, items etc. are far too expensive in general. There are several instances during the course of the game in which you have to grind for hours if you want to be able to afford the best equipment for everyone - just to find out one hour later that this equipment is already outdated.\n\nThis game may be for you if you need a filler jrpg and can stand (or if you even like) biblical indoctrination. Anyone else shouldn't waste his/her money on this Christian propaganda, disguised as a - at best - mediocre JRPG.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441890004, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441890004, "recommendationid": "17968801", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561578", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451508147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 149, "steamid": "76561198117427465", "num_games_owned": 34}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is cool but it, does have a few bumps when playing it.
