But this thing really shines when you play with other people - it has a chaotic/smash bros sort of vibe to it.  The zoo animals are pretty amusing and each individual level is pretty short and sweet (at least for quite a while).\n\nAlso - I had been playing this with WASD & a mouse --> but it is a much funner experience with a twin stick controller.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464887926, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1464887926, "recommendationid": "23347579", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.997145", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472232064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 521, "steamid": "76561198025373863", "num_games_owned": 64}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a action packed game that keeps me guessing and laughing.  It seems easy, but then suddenly you have been out gunned by some kind of space zoo AI and some sweet space graffes or space pigs or some other sweet pixelated space zoo inhabitant has been left behind due to your carelessness.  You are instantly motivated to try again!\n\nThe colors and explosions are beautiful. The weapons at your disposal are nicely balanced...  you can do alright for a while bashing wth the one weapon you start with...  but soon you discover the rest and it makes you happy.  \n\nI haven't tried multiplayer yet, but it be great, of course, since the game itself is already great. \n\nThe developer showed this game at a game expo in DC, MAGFest  two years ago.  there have been so many improvements!
