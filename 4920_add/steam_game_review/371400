I realize this game is for a specific type of gamer. I've only just put a bit of time in but the game is solid. Definitely an unusual artistic style, simplistic, but I think it fits the game. Play this game on fantastic, and it looks pretty great on a 1080p screen. I like how the screen kind of rotates to give a more 3d  I think the art style emphasizes solid clear lines, and a lot of white, because fighting outside can be pretty hectic. Having a white/grey background really helps enemies stand out.\nGame play wise is where I think this game shines. The combat is responsive, and I haven't played a game where you can hover with a shield and use it to block bullets. It is definitely unique, and the developer has nailed a good feeling with it.\n\nThe whole resource system is pretty neat, with you starting with few resources at the beginning. How well you fight the initial monsters sets the tone for how well you'll do. It can be pretty easy for the generators to lose power quickly at the beginning, and then the doors are forced open, allowing enemies to attach antenna. Combat is hard, but can be learned quickly and after a few try's I was lasting much longer.\n\nOnly gripes  I have:\n\nIf you reach negative level 10, you fail and get sent to the main screen. Starting a new game is fast, but having to go through tutorial is a small drag. Thankfully you can skip pretty quikcly, but having the option to start in a new game right away would've been nice.\n\nSome advice:\nI think the game is vague on purpose on some mechanics like saving, and being able to teleport to the top of the base. But to save basically generator needs to have enough power, and when you do save it takes a lot of power so be strategic when saving. To teleport I will let you guys figure that out on your own.\n\nPlaying I reliazed how long it would take to escape just staying at base. It would take hours! Then I realized I could venture out to collect antenna boxes. Collecting one adds 5 percent to total antenna progress. Not sure what happens when reaching 100% but I can't wait!\n\nOverall I'd highly recommend this game. It is really challenging game, and innovative how and indie should be. Don't think this is a roguelike or any other genres you've played, it's been an awesome mixture of many it seems. The price was worth it to me.\n\nps.
