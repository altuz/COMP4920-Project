The randomly generated levels work perfectly, it's nice to see different layouts each time I play and the area sizes feel just right.

It's so much better than just running around in a big mess of explosions and bullets like a lot of traditional rogue-likes.  \n\nThe variety of weapon upgrades, items, power ups and enemies that I've encountered are interesting and the addition of data cards makes it all that more interesting. My personal favourite item so far is the mine, I enjoy pacing about at distance and letting the enemy come to me, only to walk straight into my mine!\n\nThe data cards seem to be rare, unless I've just been really unlucky.

It plays like a hybrid of a turn based roguelike/roguelite with the pace of an arcade game. The gameplay itself is pretty simple. When you move or shoot, enemies can do the same. There's no skip turn button, so you need to think a bit about how you're going to position your marine to deal with enemies. The gameplay loop is that you spawn into a level and you move room to room clearing out baddies. You start with three weapons: A shotgun, a railgun, and a frag grenade. As you progress through the levels, you'll find more items that mix things up. It's simple and fun. If you're a fan of roguelikes/roguelites, give this a try.

Some unusual directions have been taken with the gameplay, and while some aspects still seem roughed out, the quality of the art, sound, and interface design already feels like a finished game.\n\nThe decision to give the player a set of three upgradeable weapons is something rarely seen in a roguelike, and it plays out well in Space Grunts. While the progression for each weapon is fairly linear, having three weapon choices at all times does make the game feel more like an action game, as you quickly swap weapons between kills. I also appreciate the wide variety of items, but I never feel the need to use them early game, while in the late game I find myself running low. \n\nI'm very impressed with the art for the game, the level design, weapon sounds, music and effects all reek of charm. The simple iconic images do a great job at making the game easier to read, which makes it faster to play, which makes it more like an action game. The explosions, flying shells and dirt, and screen shake add a satisfuying visceral quality. While it's already been mentioned, it bears repeating: the gun sound effects are very entertaining.\n\nDespite the polish of the art, there are still some rough edges to the gameplay.Mainly there is not enough variety in completing the series of rooms that make up a level. The flame trap rooms are an interesting, and boss rooms are great, but the vast majority of rooms in the game involve tackling a few opponents that you are well equipped to defeat. Difficulty feels patchy at the moment, with early levels too easy, and later levels leading too often to a sudden, unexpected death. There are three classes to pick from, but their primary status feel unequal. Strength (HP) can be upgraded by Bionics items, and is generally unexciting, while Tech (Starting weapons) and Luck (Item Find) are both very important. If this was a completed game I would feel more uncomfortable about these elements, but given that the game is super fun while it is still incomplete, I'm fantasizing that it will be amazing when it's finished.\n\nSpace Grunts does still feel a bit incomplete, but given the quality of the existing work plus the frequent and meaty updates I believe we can expect great things.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443245210, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1443245254, "recommendationid": "18196764", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460158787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3367, "steamid": "76561198069898029", "num_games_owned": 516}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Got promised a skin for getting in top 5 of daily run and didn't get shit.

It's a fun and addictive time killer and you can find yourself saying \"one more run\" very often.  It's learning curve is very low, meaning anyone can jump in and have a good time, not having to worry too much if the item they are about to use will just straight up kill them.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LYtnlRTbLA\n\nSpace Grunts is fun and it does what it does pretty well, but I can't call it a roguelike.  There's not enough nuance.  There are no player levels and no character skills (outside of base stats per different character that can't be changed).  This means that your gameplay is pretty much completely defined by the drops you get or don't get throughout a given run.  Games like The Binding of Isaac do that same thing, but Isaac lets your own skill overcome adversity because of the real-time combat.  Turn-based means you can plan your actions, but I don't think it's feasible to avoid damage entirely.\n\nYou characters have 3 (4 if you pick up a crowbar) weapons with limited ammo and different uses.  You can also find various single-use tech (items) in your travels that heal you, create traps for your enemies, augment your firepower or give you a damage buffer (almost like temporary HP).  The limited ammo and single-use items puts a lot of emphasis on strategy and luck, hoping that you get the right ammo or right weapon upgrades or right tech at the right time.\n\nUnfortunately, this game isn't for me, as I felt gameplay felt relatively shallow.  However, some of my complaints are the very reason it is so easy for people new to the genre to pick up and play it.  I can see this very much being a soft introduction to the much more complex genre of REAL roguelike games (think stuff like Tales of Maj'Eyal, for example).
