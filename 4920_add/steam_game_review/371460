Centered around the use of various floor traps. Towers upgrade in a linear manner with +damage and +attkspeed. Managing ressources is quite the strict affair to beat the levels and grinding gems for permanent upgrades to allow more progression quickly gets tedious.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503562908, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503979855, "recommendationid": "34455149", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496359", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
