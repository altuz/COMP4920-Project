As an avid fan of the railroad tycoon games since I was younger, I watched this game develop over the early access period and was hopeful about it's potential. \n\nSome con's:\n- You can only have one train operating at a time.\n- The market system just gets old and boring because all you are doing is moving goods from point A to point B. \n- High level of micromanagement.\n- Criminals who try to raid your trains are occasionally OP at the start of the game.\n\nI was hopeful for this game but cannot give it a positive review as I was not impressed.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499714927, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499714927, "recommendationid": "33438713", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521322", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504648553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 703, "steamid": "76561197984266556", "num_games_owned": 254}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "There is so much to like about this game, such as the historical accuracy (with creative license for the sake of story, of course) and the change in Town attitudes, supplies, and contraband depending on the course of the Civil War.\nIt's a fresh release, so there are some bugs still being ironed out.\nIt follows the tropes of a family member passes away and leaves you the business and there's a rival trying to take it from you.\n\nThe problems difficulties I face most are:\nOnly being able to take a mix of about three or four cars, depending on the strength of the engine.  My current config is one Passenger car, one Cargo car (cargo usually needed for passenger luggage, as well as goods to sell/trade), and a Caboose for my defenders.  At my stage in the game, I can only haul 18 units of cargo (depending on weight) and 4 passengers.\n\nMy biggest challenge is Reputation.  \nI've not been able to participate in all but two auctions just because my standing with a certain town/faction wasn't high enough to let me in.  \nWith all the timed missions, there's just not enough time to grind for Rep on the side.  All my time is consumed by timed missions and raising money for repairs, upgrades, and supplies.  In some towns, I can't even do their Rep missions, because they hate me so much, so they just continue to hate me.  So many Rep ups are at the cost of a different Rep down.  Yes, that's realistic, but the numbers are so close to 1:1, that it's Catch-22 all the dang time.  One time, I went back and forth between two towns, just so I can pay the Bandits' fee and get +5 Rep until they vanished.\nI've \"lost\" at least two auctions for my company shares *just* because the town literally wouldn't let me into the auction.\nBased on the Bandits, Rep costs around $100 for one point.  In my opinion, you should just be able to buy Rep outright for $1000 a point in Town.\n\nCars and Engines lose quality.  While this is a nice taste of realism, why the hell aren't my repairs restoring them?  We know some of these engines lasted decades, and these barely last a year.  It's a massive money drain and time consuming when you have to travel and find \"the right\" car to buy and upgrade...and the cannon(s) to put in it.\n\nOne of my own damn siblings sold his company shares to Mr. Evil after I found and helped him!  He said he \"needed to money so badly\"...but never messaged me asking for money or saying there was trouble.  Just, \"oh, by the way, I sold the shares I promised you, MY RELATIVE, to the guy trying to steal/kill our family's dream, just because I needed a stiff drink.\nThat alone almost made me uninstall the game.  F*** you, that's messed up.\n\nSome missions don't tell you how to accomplish them, and some of their notes don't get updated.\nExample 1:  Get a necklace.  You have to meet a few people, in a few different towns.  The note only says the original quest, so you have to remember who to find in which town.  Fortunately, this isn't timed.\nExample 2:  You have to \"let someone vanish in an accident.\"  It doesn't tell you how to arrange it.  Just where to get the guy, and return to the client with news of his disappearance.  Even talking with Bandits in 50+ Rep, there's no \"hey, make this guy vanish\" option.  I hauled him around over a month trying to figure out where to get rid of him without visiting the town he had to arrive safely in.  Eventually, I gave up and delivered him, harming my company's shares.\n\nI'd love to see the ability to give engine/car sets to your siblings so they can earn money and rep off-screen for you, instead of the option to join your crew.  Same for your hired staff...how about hiring them to run their own line with their own lines?  You run a Company, not just your Engine and 1-5 cars.\n\nBut, this game is still fun and I enjoy it.  It's just so frustrating right now.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500952733, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500952733, "recommendationid": "33778473", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510272", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499249537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3865, "steamid": "76561198004825362", "num_games_owned": 129}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Quite a fun little game. Though there are a few bugs here and there and combat controls are a little clumsy, overall I liked it a lot. Racing against your arch-nemesis to secure a controlling share in your late father's company is a fun and engrossing experience. My only big complaint (as the devs have stated they intend to fix the bugs I mentioned) is that there is no music during the battle scenes. Combat on a moving train is one of the coolest things you can do in a video game - considering the high quality of the music elsewhere in the game, the fights should have a soundtrack to match.\n\nI will, however, suggest for new players that you ignore the game's prompt to begin in campaign mode rather than free mode. The game has a little bit of a learning curve, and it's easier to figure out your rhythm in free mode without the evil Cornelius Tilberdnar throwing a monkey wrench into your enterprise every few minutes.
