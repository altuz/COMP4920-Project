The game isnt long there are 5 levels and ca. 14 enemies in total but you have to get to them first because even the first enemy can kill you if you arent careful. Every level has one boss and one health potion somewhere at the end of it. Since there isnt better loot or a lvl system you need to learn the opponents and get better each death.\n\nTruly challenging and rage inducing like a little darksouls.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498942925, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498942925, "recommendationid": "33101395", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516094", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501050976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 27, "steamid": "76561198139785184", "num_games_owned": 67}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An accurate metephore for life.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493176553, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493176553, "recommendationid": "31368943", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510587", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495616901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 37, "steamid": "76561198127418789", "num_games_owned": 361}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Every machine could run this game, great for some time killing.\n\nChallenging and addicting.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493490957, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493490957, "recommendationid": "31446453", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499090", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505130175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 676, "steamid": "76561198318934333", "num_games_owned": 32}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The trailer said it all", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493485012, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493485012, "recommendationid": "31444483", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495758", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493944147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 71, "steamid": "76561198130807212", "num_games_owned": 70}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is supposed to be a difficult game which I'm okay with but this game is just blatantly unfair.
