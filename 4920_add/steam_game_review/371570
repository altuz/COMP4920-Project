This one does not have the depth of restarting your world and having an ever increasing cycle of options which increases your gains exponentially, but it's also not a free-to-play that is trying to lure you into purchasing more and more to get farther and farther.\n\nIt has a low, one-time purchase price (a real deal if you get it on sale) and it will never ask for another dime.\n\nYou can still pour hours of your life away clicking furiously to get farther, the next boss always on the horizon.  You have three heroes whose skills you can level up, although there does come a point when some of the skills are maxed out (skills that increase % of successes) but the base damage and health can continually be raised.  You also have spells that you can cast to give you quick boosts and the spells recharge on cooldowns.  Although, I did find the cooldowns only worked from actual gameplay time.  If you close the game, you will gain money over time, but the cooldowns will be left as they were when you logged out.\n\nIn addition to clicking on monsters and bosses to lower their health, you can click on the heroes to restore their health.  This means that the later boss battles require you to click on the heroes to keep their life up while they slowly grind the boss down themselves.\n\nStill, it's a simple addition to the clicker genre and if that is your cup of tea then the low price for this title should make it an easy buy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499720374, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499727895, "recommendationid": "33440692", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517786", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505214490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 15449, "steamid": "76561197997527737", "num_games_owned": 266}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Your standard clicker, of the lighter variety. This is a nice little idle game, been enjoying it so far. Kudos to the dev on the artwork, and keeping the game microtransaction free. \n\nThis is the first clicker game i have seen that doesn't tempt you with micros, so that is a plus right there. \n\nPersonally, i feel its worth the $3. \n\nThe only achievement i don't see myself getting is the 250K clicks one, at least, not for a good while. \n\nPlan on trying the other games from this developer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503995972, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503995972, "recommendationid": "34571933", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509600", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1434725448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 8674, "steamid": "76561198003693447", "num_games_owned": 957}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's been awhile since I completed Tap Heroes as I bought it when it first came out, but I had to write a negative review today so I wanted to put out a positive one. Tap Heroes is the basic example of what idle games have become with skills, heroes and ability's instead of buying business. It doesn't really do anything unique or different compared to most of the free ones however I enjoyed it and considered it 3$ well spent. The reason is simple, It had exactly what I was looking for in an idle game. A definitive start and a definitive end, none of these endless updates grinding progression or never ending gameplay.  Most of the negative reviews are from people who got it free or people who don't like that unlike most idle games it has money.\n\nPros:\n-Art style not used in other Idle games, unique and very cute\n-Definitive end, no endless grinding.\n-About 150 hours of game play\n-Steam Achievements\n-No microtransactions. None. (unique to this Idle game in my experience)\n-Already balanced no waiting for balance patches to fix progression walls.\n\nCons:\n-Unlike the other endless slew of Idle games this one costs money\n-No replayability (but its an Idle game, did you expect any?)\n\nUnfortunately those are the only Cons I can think of and honestly getting a complete idle game that isn't in endless development, is already balanced, has no micro transactions and you know you are getting about 150 hours of gameplay I can't really say it's that bad.  Over all if you are looking for a complete experience that wont take months or even years I definitely recommend this as one of my favorite idle / clicker games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500609039, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500609039, "recommendationid": "33687766", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506727087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1269, "steamid": "76561198098752244", "num_games_owned": 77}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty shit...\n\nI like it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504305617, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504305617, "recommendationid": "34670943", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 77, "total_reviews": 124, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 47}}
