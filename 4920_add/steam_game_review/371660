Far Cry Primal (FCP) is a thinly veiled version of FC4, but without the carefully crafted theme-rich story, the sharply drawn NPCs, the stunning vistas and the cultural immersion.

Instead of FC4\u2019s mercenaries for hire option, you now have the assistance of a tamed beast, if you want it. As such, FCP is a pale facsimile of its big brother FC4, but setting it in the Stone Age does steer it refreshingly away from being \u201cmore of the same\u201d.

While it does have some unique elements, you can see the similarities (elephants/mamoths, tigers/sabertooth tigers, etc.).\n\nOne thing I thought when I started playing was that I wouldn't like the prehistoric weaponry.  I have to give Kudos to Ubisoft for making the gameplay/mechanics more interesting than I thought they would.  \n\nHOWEVER... I think they have done enough to make this a separate story.  The storyline isn't very complicated, but, then again, are any of the Far Cry storylines complicated?  There are the usual almost overwhelming number of side missions and pop-up events to keep you busy and able to purchase more advanced weaponry with your gained experience/leveling up.\n\nWhile not overwhelmingly good, I think this was, overall, a worthwhile buy... on sale!  I would not be nearly as happy if I had paid full retail.  I believe I purchased this at 50% off.\n\nRecommended.\n\nNote:  I do not like multiplayer games, so I stick with the Campaign side of games for my reviews.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506386136, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506386136, "recommendationid": "35213164", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505729", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505842861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 1633, "steamid": "76561198030325270", "num_games_owned": 96}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Far Cry Primal I felt was a huge step in the wrong direction for the series, after Far Cry 4 it seemed to be a copy and paste with just reskinned everything and a new map compared to Far Cry 3 and 4 seemed to be obviously made in a year and this wasn't very much better. Primal ditches Far Cry's roots: amazing vehicles, crazy story enemies, an enriching and thrilling story, dangerously fun guns, and then this game centers  so much around taming and controlling beasts that it ruined the previous game's feeling of danger and intensity of hunting down animals. \n\n+I like how this game makes everything subtitled as they aren't prehistoric cavemen speaking English\n+Tameable beasts\n+Rideable beasts\n+Still feels like a Far Cry\n+Some quests are fun\n+Master Beat Hunter quests were pretty alright\n+The high trips that the shaman would take you on were cool\n+Some cool easter eggs\n\n-Felt that the game didn't have much story it all, which is probably hard when you go this far back in time\n-All the main story quests are literally fetch quests or upgrading the huts of about 8 important characters and then killing the two other tribe leaders\n-Felt that the Master Beast Hunter quests were lame that you had to find \"clues\" as to where they were as well as traps appeared to be useless as the beast would never step in them and then would two hit you to then only run away was a lame way to continue the fight\n-Once you tamed a Master Beast I really felt like it's damage or speed didn't differ much from the default version of it's animal\n-I understand it's Prehistoric but it just doesn't feel like a Far Cry or as fun without vehicles or guns\n-Some how the enemies that throw rocks will always two hit or one hit you\n-No story whatsoever besides taking over a valley for your tribe just by doing fetch quests and killing, nothing really else\n-The caves were annoying as several times a specific grapple hook or ledge was purposely hidden which was really frustrating\n-Any beast is completely useless to the heavy armored enemies\n-All the side quests were really basic and a waste of time\n-Several enemy outposts were ridiculous and too hard to stealth or impossible to not be shot to death or insta killed by the armored enemies\n-Honey Badges seems to have a low as spawn only saw like 3 of them the whole game besides the ones during the beast kill quest\n-No Co-Op\n-No character development it all unless you call the cutscenes before and after their numerous fetch quests... something then I guess\n-Removed the over constant question marks on the map with little loot with instead useless locations\n-No DLC's it all for this game there's just an expansion that adds 45mins of more boring quests and some perks and items that aren't worth the money\n-Most annoying thing is attacking some outpost or enemy camp, using for example 6 animal hide to craft more spears only to have 3 left. Die. Respawn as if nothing ever happened at the front of the camp but to still be out of my 6 animal hide and still down 3 spears as if I used them.\n-Several if not all quests have no checkpoints so if you die you have to repeat the whole thing\n-No Steam achievements\n-I feel that the only reason they made these hell sent YOLO mode achievements are because the game had so little to it you\u2019ll definitely spend a lot of time on this\n-Stupid Uplay being added to this game has me allow my computer to accept it every time I boot up the game\n\nPrimal sets itself up as a cool prehistoric adventurous game where you have to survive as a caveman and build his tribe up from the top and conquer the other two tribes in the valley whilst being the personal errand boy and fetching and upgrading his village's huts and needs himself. In the terms of Far Cry if it wasn't for the copy and pasted animations that they have had for the past few games and reskinned enemies and animals it would feel like a basic Caveman Simulator game. There was no story what so ever and the only fun you could really have is taming beasts which isn't even that fun nor are they even that helpful in battle aswell as combat was also hard and unforgiving. The game was set to far back in time and because of that it was so hard for the dev's to even come up with a good enough story let alone gameplay, the game is obviously something they threw together in a year and thought it would be cool since it's prehistoric but I constantly struggled to find any sense of fun in the game and hope that Far Cry 5 doesn't fall this hard. \n       I genuinely feel that the only way someone could like this game is if they've never played a Far Cry before or if they just really love prehistoric shit but if you're honestly looking to buying this game I'd suggest getting Far Cry 3 or 4 they are super similar graphic and gameplay wise and actually have a story with more fun game mechanics than this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505845178, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505845837, "recommendationid": "35069838", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504665", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506566651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 128, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1443, "steamid": "76561198005478926", "num_games_owned": 146}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Majority of reviews state that this game is recycled from previous far cry games.
