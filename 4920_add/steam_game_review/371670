The powerups past the double jump are rarely required, and mostly act make the back part of the game significantly easier than the beginning.\n\nUltimately, however, Rolling Sun felt out of place - in a lot of ways, this sort of 3D-platformer-with-janky-physics is much more common in Unity, and the fact it uses and brags about CRYENGINE is because the unusually pretty graphics are probably Rolling Sun's strongest point, even if the art direction doesn't always hold up. Its \"My First Unity Platformer\" qualities shine through strongest in the incredibly broken menus, which don't remember my graphics settings, don't have sound settings at all, don't show me what levels I've unlocked until I go into the extras menu and back out, and allow me to play the first two bonus levels even though I shouldn't have any of the four unlocked.\n\nI guess it's interesting if you want to see what My First CRYENGINE Platformer looks like as opposed to My First Unity Platformer, but I'd have to say that's not worth anywhere near $5, and the game never really becomes all that fun. I found some of the second level to be the most awkward, but beyond that, once I started getting upgrades, it was never terrible, through the end of the normal game and the first two challenge levels.\n\n(Note: I'm counting this one as a \"finished game\" review, but I only played the 6 main levels and 2/4 of the bonus levels. Some sort of bug let me play Bonus 1 and Bonus 2 without meeting the stated requirements, but I'm not willing to go through levels 1, 3, and 6 again or repeatedly in order to get all of the energy orbs in order to unlock Bonus 3 and Ultime Ascension.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506204063, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506204063, "recommendationid": "35164939", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503123", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499067118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 200, "playtime_forever": 95, "steamid": "76561198027180717", "num_games_owned": 200}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "j", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505862553, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505862553, "recommendationid": "35073841", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 79, "total_reviews": 202, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 123}}
