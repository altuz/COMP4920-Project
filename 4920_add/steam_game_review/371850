You can create your own team and even your own players, pick a year in NFL history and draft all incoming real players from that point on.

It is competent...yet very dry, flawed and unengaging.  \n\n+The game is only a 200mb download and runs in your web browser.  \n-There are no sound effects or music.  The lack of small touches that are missed definitely add up.  \n-The interface and options are bland and simplistic.   \n-There does not appear to be a way to adjust your lineup during a game...wow.\n-Playbook consists of the same 50 generic plays regardless of team.  (There is an option to make custom playbooks however, but also looks dry and unclear how the game will actually let you benefit)   \n-The game is missing a whole lot of \"fun factor\" without much in the way of a distinctive personality.  -In order to have fun with this, the player needs to have a particular personality/mood.  \n-Dealbreaker:  The realism is off big-time.  I played on \"head coach\" difficulty with the 2013 Miami Dolphins for 4 games/2+hrs.  I haven't played any other difficulty setting thus far, and frankly don't care to.  If the game is going to have my field goal kicker kick just 40% from under 40 yards...I have a problem.  If my defense gives up over 240 yrds/7yds per carry on average...per game when I am keying against the run to stop the trend...I have a problem. \n\nI really wasn't expecting much from this game, so it is with exceptional regret that I declare this to be a fail.  In hindsight, I dropped 10 bucks on something so reminiscent of 1997 shareware and should have spent more time looking at reviews/youtube.  For a game with \"2014\" in the label, this is rather sad.
