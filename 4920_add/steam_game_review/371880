So I decided to pony up and buy the game for myself, after not winning it. First of all, even though it looks like an HD asteroids  remake meets a pong ROM hack, the vibrant backgrounds and EDM soundtrack support it, allowing you to stay enveloped in the game.\nUnfortunately if you want to play every mode, you need at least one controller and a sperate human being (unless you're really good at multitasking). And even though the two multiplayer required modes are more for fun and playing around, that is what they are designed to do. The single player modes (which can be played with up to 8 players like the rest) are more focused on survival, which is well fitting. These three modes are Acrobat, compression, and Core Defence, with each mode getting a couple more mechanics than the last, and are varient enough to not get stale.\nAcrobat is a mode where you simply have to not get hit. This is for players who are more run than gun, as it doesn't include the gun feature like the other modes, though this is not a bad thing, as it allows the player(s) to focus on dodging the bullets, or enemies as they're called in the game. This mode also spawns \"Seekers\" occasionally, who will follow you until you die. They are stopped by the center aroun the core, but it's a circle, so they just slide around it, adding a better challenge to the simple mode.\nCompression mode is like acrobat mode, you still have to dodge enemies, but three things are different. 1. You can get powerups. 2. You have a gun mechanic. 3. The walls are closing in on you. There are no seekers, but the walls are a bigger problem. Now touching them won't kill you, but getting squished isn't impossible. The walls move in slowly, but they get closser every time you shoot the core's circle, or the walls, which ou will do a lot, so only grab the multishot power up if it's absolutely neccessary. \nNow Core Defence is different. Veeeery different. In core defence, you are ctually siding with the core that has tried to kill you over and over again, and what do you get to protect it? Defences which I call \"cores\", because it's easier. These cores vary from powerup genorating factories, to the classic shields and turrets. You will have a _lot_ of cores if you can place them close enough to the center core, and there will be many lines close up, and that's good. Now you cannot control when or how you get the power ups, you can just hope you get a good one, but over all it is one of the best modes in the game, and it gets even better from the fact it's the most... \"in depth\" single player available mode.\nOverall this game is just fun, fun, fun, and fun, although I reccomend it to people who have a lot of gamer friends, so you can enjoy it how it's supposed to be played, with friends.
