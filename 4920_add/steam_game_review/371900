It's primarily a puzzle game, but it's also a pretty emotional game, since the puzzles are conveyed via a personality, with personality flaws being a major aspect.  For example, the \"Distant\" personality puzzle is to advance through areas while trying to avoid human interaction.  You're given tools to accomplish that, but part of the fun is figuring those out so I won't explain anything.  When Distant experiences human interaction, the game definitely conveys that it's agony, at least, that was my interpretation.  You don't necessarily \"lose\" if you fail, but if you want to collect all the notes you should try everything.\n\nBut again, the core is the puzzles.  Some of them are REALLY hard, and once again, you're free to skip right past them, but you won't 100% the game then.  Some of the puzzles I spent 30+ min on and still didn't solve, and had to try again another day.  A lot of the puzzles are pretty genius from a design perspective.\n\nOne more thing, the music is outstanding.
