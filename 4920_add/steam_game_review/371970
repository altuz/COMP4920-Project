This game puts a new meaning to that however. It is hard starting out... Like really hard. \n\nI played the game co-op, Healer and a Merchant, we died a lot for the first 30 mins. Don't give up I said. We continued on.\n\nWe get a good run, about level 4 (Which is good for us) and the minotaur kills us. \n\nRip\n\nTry again and we get a REALLY good run. Im talking we get to the end, top gear and shit however we die fighting the end boss (I think its the end boss). \n\nMoral of the story (not really a story), The game is good, however hard. Worth the $10 and a lot of fun with multiplayer. \n\nBuy it. Its lit. \n\nAlso it kinda reminded me of a First Person Hammerwatch.\n\nAlso again, Enemies are hard to kill starting out, which is why its good for multiple people.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505076063, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505076063, "recommendationid": "34870837", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500219", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506917684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 574, "steamid": "76561198006525169", "num_games_owned": 216}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "22", "review": "An interesting title, that is quite broken when played as the developer intended, and very enjoyable when played with Cheat Engine active. \n\nI'm no stranger to roguelikes, like Eldritch, Darkest Dungeon, Rogue Shooter, ADOM, Ancients Deathwatch, Dungeons of the Unforgiven, Demon Souls/Dark Souls, and a lot more. I know they are very RNG prone, where one playthrough will be possible and others impossible, depending on how the RNG favors you and success is often determined by player skill that can often mitigate some of that RNG. However, with that said, this game will generally favor bad RNG and the player will have no way of mitigating it. In most roguelikes I've played, as the game's difficulty ramps up, the player progresses (in terms of attributes, loot, skills, spells, etc) fairly in line with it, provided you are playing the game right. Now it is entirely possible I'm not playing the game right, but I honestly don't think I would have beaten the game if I hadn't cheated (which btw leaves a sour taste in my mouth). I beat one of the bosses, Baphomet, with a level 50ish barbarian, with 300 something hp and 280 to 290 mana and I honestly don't think I would have been able to legimately kill the boss with that character if I didn't have cheats one. Now, you may be asking, why is that? Well I'll explain:\n\n1. All scrolls randomly choose a target for their effect, and can only be an equipped item. So a scroll of repair, cannot repair a broken item, as the moment it breaks, you auto-unequip it. And as far as I can tell, items don't have a durability stat and thus they will only break in certain circumstances... like attacking a minotaur... or a cloak being burned to a crisp.  Similarly, scrolls of enchant armor, randomly chooses an equipped item to apply the effect. True, you could unequip all but one item to ensure it enchants the right item, but that is a huge irritant. \n\n2. The blocking system is broken. Unlike a game like Dark Souls, (of which I really enjoyed and have beaten three times now) blocking in this game is more a liability than a benefit. Enemies lack stamina and can keep attacking forever and when they hit your shield, they do not recoil. Thus, if there is a window of opportunity to strike the opponent before they attack again, you have like 50-100 milliseconds tops... and I've never gotten the timing right in this game and thus I always get hit the moment I drop my guard. Also, while blocking you move at 33% of maximum speed and as carried items slow you down already, you cannot manuever around a target while blocking. Well, except for my cheated character who ran like the wind, and could go from one end of the level to the other in 2-3 seconds. So more often than not, its better to not bother with shields and use a torch instead in your offhand. As a result, melee combat feels very unfair and you constantly feel completely outclassed. \n\n3. Healing is few and far between and enemies can easily do 1/3 to 1/2 your maximum health in a single hit. This results in a lot of frustrating deaths. Oh and that is from being attacked from a basic skeleton mind you. A cave troll will one-shot most characters; I'd know, I had a party of 4 recruited humans and we did a last stand in a room against a troll (troll, not minotaur; those are worse) and the troll killed myself, and all the allies while taking barely a scratch. Also those allies aren't levelled and thus encountering them later on in the game with tougher enemies means that an enemy merely has to tickle them and they die.\n\n4. Item progression is basically nonexistent. Unlike in something like ADOM, where at later levels you start finding mithril or adamantine items, with much higher stats, most items that you initially find that give 1 or 2 armor, is fairly common until the very end of the game. My cheated character, had items with 3 armor, and some with 4 armor and one with 5 armor. My weapons were of course better because I had the artifact bow, artifact spear and artifact mace, but not that much better; the spear was 10 damage, the mace 7, and the bow 12 (in theory; it seemed that a spear jab always did more damage). As a result, enemies scale in HP and damage far faster than you do and you can't really catch up. The only effective way that I found to kill enemies was using spells like Magic Missile, as that did reliable damage even against the minotaur. \n\n5. Minotaurs are nearly invulnerable and are very cheaty. Melee attacks will often deal no damage and may even cause your weapons to break. The thing destroys doors and ceilings and it even hovers over pits. Nothing can slow it down, and it does about 40 damage per hit, and thus will most likely one-shot most characters. The only way to escape it is to enter the next floor. Now it may be argued that you shouldn't try to fight the minotaur or might be argued that you can always disable the mechanic, but the mechanic in general feels out of place here as there is already enough things that can easily destroy your characters.\n\n6. If all that wasn't bad enough, you also have 1-shot kills from boulder traps, infinite depth pits, spellcasters that can easily kill you from afar, and its permadeath of course. \n\n7. The last point I'll raise is the tradesmen/merchants. Each item you pickup has a gold value. However, in order to sell it you need to find the right salesman/merchant. As these are randomly generated as well, you only find a merchant once every 3-4 floors. So, that means you have to lug around all that loot for a long time, until you find someone to sell it to... and theres no guarantee that the merchant you find will accept the items you are carrying around. This leads to a problem, where you don't know what item is actually valuable as if you can't find a gem merchant for your 2500 gold gem, then that gem is actually worthless and takes up a valuable inventory slot. And as all items add weight and slow your movement speed down, it makes it harder and harder to avoid traps, avoid combat damage and escape from the minotaur. \n\nIf the above problems were fixed, I would likely recommend the game, as it is clear the developer(s) put a lot of effort into the game (as I did enjoy the level designs, puzzles, and encounters). But until they are addressed, I cannot see myself legimately completing the game without cheats.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nCombat is broken, itemization is broken, monsters are overpowered, healing is basically nonexistent, and the only class that would likely win the game without cheating is the Wizard, as spells like fireball or force bolt or magic missile are the only reliable \"sources of damage\" in the entire game.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1504988956, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504976445, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504976445, "recommendationid": "34841968", "developer_response": "At the risk of being attacked for defending my own game, allow me to address these issues as fairly but straightforwardly as possible.\n\n1. They actually don't choose a random target. But even if they did, can you think of any way you could control where the effect lands?\n\n2. Matter of fact, blocking is not broken. When you get the timing down properly, you will find it increases your effectiveness enormously.\n\n3. Besides healing yourself (of which there are several methods), there are numerous ways to prevent taking damage in the first place. If you want to spoil yourself on any of these things, I suggest taking your questions to the forum where many fans will happily point you in the right direction. (personally, I have shared spoilers to folks like you so many times I'm kind of over it). At any rate, with proper tactics you shouldn't be taking that much damage to begin with.\n\n4. Actually (again) this is basically false. With enough experience you will find that you can consistently outclass most monsters no matter what class you start out as. Absolutely none of the classes are broken: my favorite is joker, and guess what, like many other players I win consistently when playing him. It simply takes an understanding where to find upgrades, good equipment, proper tactics, etc. which, again, many fans will happily fill you in on if you don't mind spoilers.\n\n5. How can a monster \"cheat\"? Sure, the minotaur is extremely powerful, possesses levitation, and has the special ability of tracking you down wherever you are, but matter of fact, there is absolutely nothing game breaking about him. During early levels, the minotaur was made to be run from, but they can be overcome with proper strategy. If you want to figure out how to do that on your own you will have to try a little harder, or you can just have folks spoil you on the forums.\n\n6. How is any of this a bad thing again? All of these things are defeatable. Victory won't be handed to you without any effort though.\n\n7. It's well known that you can't always find a gem shop to sell your goodies in. This is part of the design. If you find the gems taking up too much space and can't find a gem shop to sell them in, get rid of them. Better luck next time.\n\nFor someone apparently so versed in roguelikes, you seem to be very upset that this game could have any kind of edge over you like this at the beginning.\n\nI will admit this much: our game is very lacking in any form of tutorial, which means many of the subtleties may take a while for some people to grasp, and that will limit their effectiveness somewhat.\n\nBut the fact is, this game is actually significantly easier than many \"classic\" roguelikes: far more forgiving in luck and random factor, and far more limited in the number of ways you can die instantly or come across insurmountable obstacles. If you spend any time at all talking to our diehard fans, or even us developers, you will find we can consistently win the game on default settings without cheating on any class. There is no luck involved. Simply knowledge and skill.\n\ntl;dr: Speak to anyone who's even half-good at this game: nothing that you've listed here is broken. If the game falls short in one major area, in my opinion, it comes down to a lack of tutorial. Even this isn't unique among roguelikes though, so as long as you insist on comparing our game to Angband and Nethack, you're not gonna have much of an argument. Our game is far easier than those games. You're still gonna have to work hard if you want to get better though.", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492500", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 461, "total_reviews": 518, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 57}}
