Evil genius can be described in a nutshell as bond villain simulator 2004. It's a base building game best compared to dungeon keeper, where your base is constantly under investigation by the world powers and if you can send them back home non the wiser about your operation then your \"heat\" level will drop. To this end you can create surface decoys, or train your minions in misdirection and distraction or even build a network of memory tamepering traps. You must also send your minions to various countries to conduct nefarious activity's but the interaction here is only through text and moving pieces around a world map. Still. many of the acts of evil are hilarious and well imagined. Evil genius is far from perfect, the AI is odd at times, the money earning aspect of the game is flawed, the traps don't always work perfectly and are redundant once the deathsquads start dropping in and it screams for more content but conceptually it has no peers and is a unique, stand alone game. It does base building very well, the AI has some great features like the minions spectating torture sessions and the writing is good. The typical bond troupes are such a fun idea to base a game around that the flaws can be generally overlooked and a good time can definitely be had.\n\nGood\n-who hasn't wanted to design an evil lair inside an active volcano?\n-the base building is great, the rooms look good, designing traps is fun and it's great decorating the place with the priceless stolen national treasures that enter your possession throughout the game\n-the special minions are cool and good. Ivan is a jerk \n\nBad\n-leaves you wanting more.\n-just stealing all the money at the start makes the game much smoother and is a pretty good idea but this really screams about how annoying it is trying to get funds once the game starts rolling\n-once the deathsquads come (and they will come) the intricate deathmaze you built is meaningless\n-game could really use a sandbox mode or a scenario editor\n-lots of waiting\n\nOverall evil genius is a wonderful and characterful base builder with some unique twists to the formula and a fantastic design backing it up, so if you have ever wondered about the day to day of super spy villainy then you will probably have some fun with this one 4/5 enjoyable, unique and engaging but imperfect"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505475939, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34969829", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198080815637", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1506424085, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_forever": 892}, "timestamp_updated": 1505475939, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a game I originally bought still sealed from a carboot sale, and boy am I glad I did.

There is a narrator that tells your evil story as you play.  Very humorous."}]}
