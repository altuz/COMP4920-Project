It's good enough that it leaves this impression on me that quickly... for me, this is very rare.\n\nStarship Rubicon is an interesting beast.... it uses a whole pile of different elements that were inspired by many seperate games.  But the thing that makes it so good is that it takes all of these disparate elements, smashes them together... and they WORK together.  They dont conflict with each other at any point.\n\nAt it's base, this game uses Asteroids-style gameplay and controls.  You have a \"thrust\" button to move your ship forwards, and then other buttons to turn it left or right; you also have a \"boost\" function that you can use.  There are even actual asteroids floating around in many areas, which work pretty much as you'd expect, and generally making your life that much tougher.  From there though, the game goes in it's own seperate directions.  Your ship is not static, but is instead made of various \"parts\" that you can equip, that give abilities or change stats, or things like that.  This includes changing both your basic weapon (and you can have more than one) or your special weapon, an activated ability that has a cooldown and also knocks out your shields for a bit upon use.   You cant just equip everything though; each piece of equipment has a shape to it, sort of like blocks in Tetris.  You have to fit these blocks inside the ship properly, or they cannot be used.  What's more, some items are meant to modify others, and will only work if linked to the system they're modifying, which means you have to place it adjacent to that system for it to function whatsoever.  So this can create some interesting decisioni-making when you're changing your equipment.  \n\nEquipment can be either found in battlefields, or bought in stores. Stores are easily the most frequent way to get equipment.  The rate of equipment actually being FOUND is very low... a bit TOO low in my opinion.  You end up not getting all that much total, which is a shame, because it reduces the amount of interesting decisions that you'd need to make.  There's no need to decide between two items after all if both of them easily fit onto the ship.  If you're not getting enough items, you wont be filling it.  So there's a bit of RNG issues here with this system, but it's not enough of an issue at all to detract from how well it works.  There are many different weapons and things to find, so look for them, and try them out, and see what kinds of builds you can make for yourself.  Most of these different items and such are also just plain fun to use.... that's ALWAYS a plus.\n\nBetween missions, you're sent to sort of an overall sector map.  It's very similar to the map that FTL uses, in that you move forward from one node to the next, with each individual node having specific links to other nodes to choose from.  Around each node, you can see icons representing the different enemy types that are going to appear in that area, so it's important to learn these and have a look as you make decisions.  Other things will appear here too, such as hazards, or the existence of items or \"money asteroids\" or shops or various other things.   You can also find other ships to rescue, and if you are successful in saving them, they will join you on your quest.  Each one provides a unique ability that becomes active whenever they participate in a battle with you, and you choose when to bring them in by clicking them on the sector map.  They have a cooldown time afterwards, and can also be knocked out by enemies during battle... so take care of them, when you bring them with you.   The one big problem with them though is that they just arent very bright.  Asteroids in particular will give your AI allies alot of trouble as they repeatedly crash into them.  By the late game, these guys arent as useful, simply due to the fact that they'll be knocked out of the fight too quickly to help much.\n\nAnd on the note of the enemies you face, each type is different from the last, and you quickly learn to recognize each by it's appearance, which is very important.  There are different approaches that you should take depending on just what you're fighting, and what weapon you're using, and there can be many enemies at once.  Some enemies may have beam weapons, or maybe homing missiles, or shields, or even the ability to shield other enemies.   And of course, it wouldnt be a shmup of any sort if there werent gigantic bosses to fight at the end of each sector.\n\nAll in all, there's alot going on for this game, and I think there's plenty of replay value; naturally, everything is procedural when it comes to the maps and sectors and such, so each game will be different.   The campaign is short, but that's typical for this genre, and probably for the best.\n\nIs it worth your money?  If you like shmups at all.... I'd definitely say yes.  It easily lives up to it's asking price and more, I think.   I can definitely recommend this one!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448893420, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448893420, "recommendationid": "19389040", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517031", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453079537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 57, "steamid": "76561197961278114", "num_games_owned": 3206}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Controls feel great.

The time really flies...\nEverything I want to say about this game has already been said via other reviews, but I want to throw my vote into the pile of 100% positive reviews that this game has at the time of this review. \n\nThis game is about forward progression through zones, exactly the way FTL plays. The zones split off, you can choose to pick which direction you want to go. You'll even be granted preview of what types of enemies will await you should you choose any specific direction. Note, like FTL, there is no backtracking, so the choices in direction you make will matter. You might find items on certain paths, new allies, bonus cash, or shops. Each zone is guarded at the end by a boss, so make sure you beef up as you go.\n\nThe ship customization is pretty terrific, it's extraordinarily simple, yet deep. You have limited space on your hull, and all customizable parts are in configurations of shapes, which you can rotate to make fit as best you can. The more parts you can pack into your ship the better. You will be pleased to know the weapons, abilities, and effects you can add to your ship are quite large in number, so the replay value is pretty huge. Some attachments can alter how weapons work, boosting various attributes. \n\nThis game has Neutonian physics, so you can turn on the thrusters, suddenly shut them off, then spin the ship around to fire at enemies behind you, while still gliding in the same initial direction. The combat system is great, everything feels fluid and polished. When you beat the game, you can bank the cash from the campaign, use it to unlock powerful new weapons, or even ships. You can also access a hangar to customize and build your own ships with access to all parts.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437466223, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437466223, "recommendationid": "17152919", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491180", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449950152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 552, "steamid": "76561198142842061", "num_games_owned": 5}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The pixel art creates a familiar game style as well as a clean and beautiful design. It's easy to grasp the basics, yet the detailed physics engine, creative stages and lots of diversity in enemies and friends show how much thought went into the creation of this game. The game is easy to get into and play for short amounts of time but has a lot of depth and complexity to explore that make you play it over and over again. There's lots of ship customizability that makes the game accessible to different playing styles - you can play fast and action-packed, slow and calculated, or luck of the draw by stocking up on weapons that allow you to run around in a confused panic and then deploy all your ammunition at once. The amount of variation between the different ships and types of levels allows for all sorts of challenges, and the ability to save up and unlock new options means that you never get stuck doing the same thing over and over with no progress. \n\nAlso, the game has a lot of style. Both the graphics and music are really captivating. There's a wide variety of ships, weapons, and enemies to interact with. If you feel like tutorials are for chumps you can get pretty far just by ramming into your enemies (and fist-bumping your friends). If you like figuring out the intricacies of a game there's a lot to explore here, from critical hits to reflecting lasers off of inanimate objects and shields to creating your own levels. If you despise fighting and just like drawing cool contrail patterns, you can usually pull that off too. Your onboard computer, who narrates much of the game, has plenty of snaky comments to make when you fail. The allies you can acquire will have conversations with each other, making it fun to gather different groups together. Sometimes, there are biscuitfish, which are like biscuit-shaped cuttlefish. They float around in packs and trill and cycle through the colors of the rainbow.
