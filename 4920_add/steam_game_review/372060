I found it nice and relaxing to take a little break to watch the colorful fish (which I think looks fairly realistic) swim around in the scenic underwater ocean areas (I hope the Developer may add in more though). I can enjoy listening to the water sound and/or I can also choose to play some soothing music to it as well. :)\n\nIf so inclined, there's some interactions like feeding the fish, tickling the fish or sending in a shark to startle the fish. \n\nI think the full price is a bit steep for what this is, but if a program like this seems of interest to you then I could recommend to grab it when it's on sale (like I did). \n\nHere's a video I did of it and playing one of my own orchestral-styled music I've composed:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btbHKhFyyvI", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434201246, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434201246, "recommendationid": "16356554", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546957", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450986563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561198030751248", "num_games_owned": 87}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 30, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Well let's see here, how do you mess up something this simple?\n\n1.  When the scene is underwater, why are all the sounds recorded on a beach, with sounds of waves crashing in?  Why not seagulls?  It'd make just as much sense.\n2. The 1920x1080 resolution is roughly 1700x1080.  Fortunately, the image is centered on the screen and not stretched.\n3. The interface was apprently designed by someone who has no business designing anything.  The options panel in particular is a complete mess.  It comes across as though the designer has never seen a computer interface before, to at least give him some guidelines.\n4. It's probably a Windows 10 or DirectX 11 conflict, but the mouse flickers on and off, large and small, phased and solid, as you move it.  Not a problem if you don't move the mouse, but you're supposed to be able to enjoy interacting with the fish.  I don't miss this feature, as I'm not used to being a dick and tapping on aquarium glass.  But it should be mentioned that it sucks. (hardware cursor is an option, but doesn't help)\n5.  Steam allows tons of garbage to circulate; devs who are empowered by today's easy software creation tools and want a quick buck.  This appears to be one of those projects, where no effort at quality was even attempted.\n\nI put this on my wishlist and waited until it was on sale.
