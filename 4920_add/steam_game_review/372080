Originally conceived back in 2014 on the \"7DRL Challenge\", an event for developers to make a roguelike game in seven days, Ananias became so much more as the years passed by, and it certainly deserves to be in your library if you're a fan of this kind of game. \n\nI have played Ananias for the first time on my smartphone, but it's way more comfortable (to me, at least) on the desktop. You can play the free version on your browser if you wish to know how it is on PC: http://ananiasgame.com/play The Steam version is the best one if you want all classes unlocked and the best price, since it's localized according to your country, and not sold with a dollar tag. \n\nThe game itself is very balanced and it's a joy to play, with responsive controls, an awesome and intimist soundtrack and a lot of secrets to discover. I love how the procedural generation is handled here - it really will surprise you from time to time. Another game I like a lot on this genre is the - excellent - Dungeons of Dredmor (DoD), and despite my love for that game, DoD is more or less the same on some ways. Ananias, on the other hand, is unpredictable. It can throw some very high level monsters at you, put a dress to loot on the floor (even if you're playing with a male character), and make every run feel really unique - it's a real Pandora's Box, and it's gorgeous.\n\nAll in all, you can't beat this price for an awesome roguelike. Play the free version (on browser or on your smartphone) and if you like the game, buy it to support this awesome project.

While it's not incorrect to call it a simplified Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, it also isn't simplified at the cost of fun or depth.\n\nAnanias is extemely accessible and quick to get started with an interface that is clear, concise and doesn't leave you with a lot of questions as to how the game operates. You'll be playing in seconds.\n\nProcedural dungeons and multiple classes should provide a decent amount of replayability. Online leaderboards let you compare your overall achievements with a community. \n\nThis is a roguelike that tried to streamline the process of playing by allowing quicker movement between rooms whenever enemies aren't present. While leveling is streamlined as well and based simply on making it to the next foor, players still have a wealth of weapons, equipment, familiars(pets), bandages mixable potions and more to give more player-choice. Leveling-up also comes with a choice of how one wishes to build their character as you delve deeper into the dungeon.\n\nFor $4.99US, I think this is a fun contribution to the roguelike genre that does a great job of being a little simpler than a \"hardcore\" roguelike, but not at the expense of fun - and it still has some welcome RPG-like depth \n\nYou can see my casual video review on YouTube: https://youtu.be/pCN2l1i-Vdw", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487530010, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487530737, "recommendationid": "30041908", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505555", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489814512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 308, "steamid": "76561197970585953", "num_games_owned": 686}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ananias Roguelike is a other classic dungeon crawling RPG Roguelike. \n\nOther Fun game to play well worth the money cant go wrong 3 pounds for a game. so much to do in this game.\nyou can pick to be a mage. warrior also other classes to pick. this game is very much like Wizhack and Nethack very much in someways. \n\ni love Roguelike games like tihs.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1490046548, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1490046548, "recommendationid": "30642413", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506012", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502043981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 455, "steamid": "76561198180250745", "num_games_owned": 18}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Turn based rougelike with couple interesting classes and mechanics, also has great documentation on how to do different things such as alchemy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489579036, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489579036, "recommendationid": "30523650", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501547", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487102853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 126, "steamid": "76561198026892903", "num_games_owned": 296}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "2", "review": "To simple.\n\nThere are a few magics that is rly simplistic, deal damage, heal you, confuse enemy, restore durability on items, increase max hp (permantly, scroll only i guess).\n\na few potions like heal pot restore magic pot etc..\n\nThe problem is that first magics dose 50-200dmg for 4mana (you restore half your mana after evry lev) so if you have big enuff mana pool u can pritty mutch cast magics on all the dangers and use other stuff to deal with the rest (prob melee) (havent played to far but it might also turn out in spells become to expensive and you make cast 1-5 per level and have to lev up your melee and focus on melee)\n\nthis ends up in seeing no real value off taking non caster class (they may have harder time getting broken armor/wep) but dont add alot to the end char that a magic user cant be..\n\nmost melee start with 2-3 in might, casters start with 1 (after one lev that can be 3) melee start with 44-48?hp casters start with 40..hardly any diffrense..makes more diffrence if u lucky with + perma hp scrolls...the only real diffrense is evasion (fighters start with 5-15% and casters 5% (this seems to be best use of starting points) but thats 10% evasion or having a spell that can insta kill most things ?`i\u00b4ll go with second...\n\ni know this may be focused on a more casual players but like a ToME fan i cant enjoy it sadly", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487103634, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487103634, "recommendationid": "29928049", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502669", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488481697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 72, "steamid": "76561198042418793", "num_games_owned": 192}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game!
