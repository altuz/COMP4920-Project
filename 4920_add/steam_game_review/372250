The premise of the game is pretty cool. The game also appears to be bug free.\n\nHowever, playing the game devolves into tedium quite quickly. The game, in some ways, pulls from Hotline Miami. Pixelated graphics, a top down view, the ability to pan your view out in each direction, and the absurdly quick death animations. However, the gameplay itself is quite exciting in Hotline Miami, being very fast-paced, and the thumping soundtrack almost makes the player feel as though they're in a trance.\n\nTurnover is also difficult, like Hotline Miami, and players should expect to die quite a bit. However, the slow, quiet, unexciting pace of the gameplay coupled with the brutal difficulty lends to quite a bit of frustration. I think this game could absolutely use checkpoints. With Hotline Miami, I was excited to hop right back into the action. In Turnover, I let out a hearty groan.\n\nAdditionally, I think it would be better if the sound made by the player was visible in the game itself rather than down on the mini-map. The necessity of dividing your attention between the main screen and the mini-map grows tiresome.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1499360818, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498501571, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498501617, "recommendationid": "32825345", "developer_response": "A potion of your feedback has been addressed in an update.
