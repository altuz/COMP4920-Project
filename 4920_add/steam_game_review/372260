This trilogy and the Twisted Lands Trilogy are two of Viva Media's best bundles.  There's something eerie and mysterious about the music and scenery  that makes you want to keep playing.  I remember playing a demo of Weird Park:  Broken Tune a few years ago.  The graphics looked dark and grainy.  This Steam version looks much better to me.  I have also played Dark Arcana:  The Carnival by Artifex Mundi.  I thought that game had gorgeous graphics, but many of the scenes didn't make me feel like I was in an old, abandoned theme park.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499061035, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499063969, "recommendationid": "33169201", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448341005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9558, "steamid": "76561198118246997", "num_games_owned": 66}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Excelent classic Style Hidden Object Game!
