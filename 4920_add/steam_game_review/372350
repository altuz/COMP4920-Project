I have to state that it can be easy to complete, but it's still a fun game, combining the elements of an on-rail shooter, with tower defense mechanics, and the graphics are quite nice too. Some of the levels are nicely designed, with a couple I like because of the fact you can take a different route and face different issues to the standard, short \"A->B\" route.\n\nAll in all, a worthwhile purchase if you like trains, westerns, and good ol' fashioned shooter fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498658711, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498658711, "recommendationid": "32936873", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502555", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492586803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 635, "steamid": "76561197982567490", "num_games_owned": 540}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I've never played a game quite like this. In this game you are in control of the Tumbleweed Express, one of the very few remaining trains after the advent of dirigibles has left trains behind. The fellow responsible for dirigible technology has sabotaged most remaining trains, and so yours is a rare sight indeed.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, your train follows the track and you control the main cannon at the back of the train. You can buy different types of cannon as the story progresses, although two of the four types are utterly useless. One cool aspect is that you can add train cars, which increase your income per mission and also allow you to mount smaller, automated versions of the guns you put on the caboose. Every stage is completed just by reaching the end without being destroyed by bandits, rivals, or dirigibles. There are several upgrades you can buy between missions, and you can replay completed missions for more cash. You can also complete side objectives in those missions.\n\nAll in all a fairly simple but also quite fun game. I definitely recommend it unless you don't like aiming and firing cool guns.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492666696, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492666696, "recommendationid": "31250156", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498096", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493053521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10623, "steamid": "76561198229469604", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a great game.

It might not be very long, but every bit of it is fun.  Each track is different, and the extra contracts provide new ways to approach each track, giving some replayability.

It bills itself as a sort of Tower Defense game and while I am usually not a fan of that genre, I loved this game...a lot. The main missions are not terribly long, and there are but 12, but they're replayable as hell and I never once felt like I was \"grinding\" when I was going back to some old levels for loot. The gameplay is fast, thrilling, and challenging (yet somehow never frusturating).\n\nThere isn't much story to speak about, and the characters are lovable yet flat. I did pick up on an underlying theme of \"progress vs the old fashioned way\", and I thought that was very neat, and something I didn't really expect from this game when I bought it. As you deck out your own Tumbleweed to go on your journey, you use more and more fancy gizmos and gadgets, like Tesla guns, a radar, etc. And that line between old and new really starts to get blurred in the game when you realize you might just have to adapt to the new technology to finish your quest. I could get into deeper ideas like \"becoming just as bad as your enemy\" but maybe I'm reading into it too much. All I can say is that I truly was not expecting it from this game.\n\nBuilding up your own train and customizing it in this game is satisfying to the point of nearly addicting. You start with two cars and you get more cars, better guns, armor, and speed boosts. I do wish there were more customization options.\n\nThis is a can't-miss game for $5 bucks. I got it for $4 on sale and that feels like a steal. I would absolutely pay more for a DLC, hell, even a sequel with more train customization, bigger branching levels, more fleshed out story and characters, more weapons....the possibilities are limitless. For their first game Digiriballers have made a knock-out, and I will follow them wherever they go next (which should be Tumbleweed 2 :D)\n\n(P.S. Don't skip the credits!
