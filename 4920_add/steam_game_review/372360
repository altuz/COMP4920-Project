Great storyline for people who become very invested in characters, as well as good character development. Added cutscenes for this PC version that was not in the original Gamecube version, which enhanced it even more. This game is also full of puzzles, humor, and ideals that really make an player think.\n\nReplay value: even though it doesn't add any more additional content besides being able to purchase bonuses upon completion (higher HP, 2x XP, etc. which was the same in the Gamecube version),  a player may now recognize subtle hints from dialogue options throughout the second gameplay. Personally, it made my second playthrough even deeper.\n\nThe graphics may not seem ideal (keep in mind that it is an older title), but once you become invested in the story, it will not matter anymore. \n\nI will not lie, this game takes a little while to get through. However, the tear-jerking moments, character backstory, humor, and fantastic storytelling makes this a game I would 100% recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505458416, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505458571, "recommendationid": "34965760", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498956579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3065, "steamid": "76561198062589572", "num_games_owned": 119}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I love this game, it's definitely one of the games that most impacted my life when I played it on the Gamecube all those years ago. Why don't I recommend it? This port has too many dialogue flubs.\nThere are couple scenes which would make literally no sense if you haven't already seen them. Without giving spoilers, there is one scene which is supposed to be the culmination of not one, but two character's arcs but the devs couldn't be bothered to make sure the correct dialogue occured at the correct points! A few lines are repeated and a very important speech is omitted entirely!\nThere were issues before that point, but once that happened I'm having a very hard time bringing myself to play any further. I waited for a long time hoping against all odds that Bamco would fix these issues, but since it's now been a year since the last update, I'm almost certain they never will.

Like most of the others here, I had fond memories of the original GameCube version, but I realise now that I should have left my memories intact. \u2018Tales of Symphonia\u2019 has simply not aged well at all. The story isn\u2019t nearly as \u201cepic\u201d and \u201cdeep\u201d as I remember, the dungeons are tedious and seemed designed to frustrate, the puzzles are obscure, and the save point system is annoying.\n\nFrom the looks of the guide (which I ended up using because I\u2019d been wasting too many hours of my life trying to figure out those obscure puzzles), I\u2019m only about half way into the game after about 30 hours. This game is massive, but not because it has a particularly engaging story or immersive world, but just for the sake of being long. Clearly gamers had a lot more patience back in 2003 to grind and go through identical dungeon after identical dungeon (I know I did, but I was 18 years old, living with my parents, and working in a games shop when this was released in Europe, so all I had was time). Some people might argue that\u2019s a negative sign of the times that gamers don\u2019t have that kind of patience anymore, and I wouldn\u2019t necessarily disagree.
