It's a cute idea that seems like a blast to play with friends. However, the game needs more people playing it. If you're on the fence about buying it, here is what you should know:\n\nPros:\n-Cheap! Game is a steal honestly. Its not at its peak value yet because of the small playerbase, but it's a tiny investment.\n-Simple concept. Gets the job done with streamlined gameplay that really gets to the core of class based \"shooter.\" Doesn't really fit that title much, but its more akin to TF2 than other games.\n-Quick rounds! Doesn't take long to play honestly which is great! Haven't played with people yet but should be a blast with friends!\n\nCons:\n-Game simply doesn't look all that nice. This helps gameplay by simplifying interactions with very little clutter and helps keep the game running smoothly on any machine, but be warned, it doesn't look any better playing than the screenshots do.\n-Poorly optimized. Even though it plays well on any machine, the game is more sluggish than a well optimized AAA game or even most indie games. Early access does mean some of this is expected.\n-No players. This might bug potential buyers more than it should because the AI isn't exactly great, but buying this game helps in this regard!\n\nAdd me if you want to play, this game is cute and cheap and frankly I think its a good example of what an amateur early access title should look like.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435891745, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1435891745, "recommendationid": "16854157", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524689", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460598682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 44, "steamid": "76561197972685640", "num_games_owned": 462}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This review is VERY VERY early. But Warriors and Castles shows promise. The developers are dedicated to it and are actively working on it. The price is very cheap, and this makes it a great candidate for a party game with friends. The system requirements are modest (though it does need some optimization.) The idea is somewhat like Chivalry Medieval Warfare, though it is much simpler. There are currently three classes, Warrior, Archer, and Wizard. Their functions are relatively self explanatory, and the type of game I've played is a battle in which there are two castles, you must breach the gates of your enemy castle. The dev's are working on setting up dedicated servers, and the game does contain a decent enough AI which does allow the AI to be able to complete any objectives. The Wizard seems a bit underpowered as his abilities are defensive. He can fire a magic missile, which I think does more damage than an arrow. He can heal himself and I am pretty sure heal allies, but Warriors have a spinning attack which can only be countered but a warrior holding his shield up. This spinning attack as a large radious and can wipe out a cluster of enemies pretty quickly. The game is in very early stages of development, it is no where near it's final product. But since the developers are very active and EXCEPTIONALLY responsive to suggestions and criticism, this game is definitely worth supporting.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVGYq0tIvwA\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438101950, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1438101950, "recommendationid": "17268320", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502122", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440443405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 158, "playtime_forever": 117, "steamid": "76561198038310096", "num_games_owned": 612}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Let me begin with a quote out of the Early Access- Era from this game:\n\n\"...We know we aren't making any masterpiece and that's why the game is and always will have a low price.\"\n\nOk the price for the game is 3\u20ac. So i thought it is a really \"cheepy and dumpy\" game, i mean the most games with those prices (IF they are not some %-off) are not really in the best quallity and i more or less \"know\" what i will buy.\n\nWith Warriors & Castles (in short WandC now) i was not really full sure what i will buy with this low price and if the creators themself say something like i quote i only was thinking worse of it, if not even a really \"bad\" game.\n\nHonestly, i played it just some rounds against bots but i had the hell of fun with it.\n\nThe Pros\n\n-VERY very cheap price, i would even buy it for 5-8\u20ac, honestly. I guess the creators just doesnt know what they created! Its really more worth than 3\u20ac.\n\n-Easy to understand. The game has (so far) not any tutorial but its very easy to understand if you played it a bit, its like (at least with the 3 classes i played it) a Rock-Paper-Scissors system, let me explain about without spoiler:\n\nWarrior\n- Good against Archers (coz they have pretty low health)\n- Weak against Magicians (cant block the dmg full from them)\n\nArcher\n- Good against Magicians (they move pretty slow)\n- Weak against Warriors (coz of the low health)\n\nMagician\n- Good against Warriors (they cant block the dmg full)\n- Weak against Archers (coz of the slow movement)\n\n- Simply \"cartoony\" like grafic. Really, it just fits! Its not really the \"best kind\" of grafic but it fits to the game and gameplay, even the splatters from blood and like\n\n- Nothing unfair. It gives (so far) 3 classes which are well balanced and there is nothing unfair so far. Archers have limited range (magicians too), the cooldowns are good set and the building HPs are not to high set.\n\nIt also has some negativs, still...which are:\n\n- The Animations look weird sometimes, like the characters has a \"stick in the A**\", if you know what i mean.\n\n- Not really or pretty quiet \"soundtrack\". It really needs some good bg music if i dont use my own Heavy metal music to give the game some more \"emotions\" on the battlefield X3\n\n(not really negativ but still)\n- this game needs just some more \"love\". Really. more players, a bit more work and done. for 3\u20ac i cant complain about that much\n\n\n\nFact:\nWandC is a hell of fun game for such low price and i wish only it had some more players, really. The animations doesnt look so much right but i guess with some animators or some more work, the creators can still work on that. The Classes are well balanced and not \"to strong\" or like. If you die it is coz youre just stupit or the enemy comes in masses X3.\n\nFor 3\u20ac its VERY good and well made, at least in the gameplay. It really just needs more players and some more \"love\".\n\nI give it a 7.8/10 so far coz it really needs some more active players and maybe better animations. The rest is well made for such a low-price game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440277514, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1440277620, "recommendationid": "17667038", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500722", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456496677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 202, "steamid": "76561198151204395", "num_games_owned": 39}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "i think they are making a good,simple and funny game, it's even better than it looks", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438594044, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1438594044, "recommendationid": "17363927", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502626", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436420822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198080924374", "num_games_owned": 131}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "*Note that right now very few people are playing and there are basicly never servers to play on*\nSo far the game works well at a very basic level.
