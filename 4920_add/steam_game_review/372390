Deffenitly an A+\n\nThis software is easy to use, and it can capture pretty much any fullscreen game, it can also capture the desktop and it has an option to capture VR.\n\nCan take screenshots and it has a benchmarking tool kinda like Fraps. And you can record in many different Encoders and formats.
