I know this review is late, and I don't think returns were a thing back when she played this, but I still wanted to leave a short review.\n\nThe premise of the game is as simple as running from table to table and making sure all the food gets out correctly and on time to ensure the customers are happy. As a bonus, you can play it while your husband is at work, and then you can sleep with people from his unit. \n\nThe graphics are typical fare for this type of game. You won't be blown away by it, and it will probably leave you disappointed, just like my ex-wife. \n\nThe gameplay tempo is fairly leisurely. While \"dash\" is in the title, I think it instead pertains to how quickly your wife will dash to the gym to work out with her affair, even though she doesn't work out.\n\nIf anything, it increased her ability to manage her time while building up her secret stash of cigarettes to lie to me about.\n\nIn all, I would return this game if I could, but then I wouldn't get to look at all the games on my account and mumble angry things under my breath because I am as bitter as the cup of black coffee I drink every morning.\n\nCheers."}]}
