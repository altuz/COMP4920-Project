Despite the unique effects that the turrets apply, the enemy dies too easily and gun turrets are so cheap by comparison to make the other turrets viable.\n\n-End Game can essentially be acheved before Wave 10 by placing max level Gun turrets at each\nenemy spawn point. I had between 5-6 at each of the three spawn points, and that was way overkill.\n\n-100 Waves is a bit extreme since you only fight the same 8 enemies each wave making the\ngame feel tedious after wave 10. Enemy numbers should increase per wave. Maybe implement an option to set wave count?\n\n-Advancing waves quickly will cause a glitch where enemies turn invisible; Turrets within range will fire until despawned enemy is deemed \"Destroyed\" by the game.\n\n-Looking at a max level turret glitches the upgrade button, preventing me from upgrading the selected turret until the dialog box is closed.\n\n-Game tapped out after wave 70 and wouldn't allow me to advance to next wave. Probaby due to advancing waves too quickly.\n\n-Pressing Exit in-game closes to desktop (I just wanted to return to main menu)\n\n-No difficulty ramp despite session being 100 waves. The game should get more challenging with each wave propting the player to place more turrets, upgrade turrets, use different turrets, and possibly even alter the layout and placement of turrets.\n\n-Camera sometimes jumps to abitrary location when selecting turrets.\n\n-Turrets can be knocked into one another while trying to place additional turrets (perhaps raise the turrets up a smidge to avoid unwanted collisions?)\n\n-Enemies sometimes spawn on top of one another and destroy themselves at spawn.\n\n\nI'm going to say No for now, but I want to continue watching the development. The use of Google Maps to create a game environment is impressive and I'd like to see where they go with it in the future.

Each of the three or four totally different versions are very different. As for whether this game is good that's your personal choice. This game provides one new thing that tower defenses have never done before and that's physics.\n\nAre the physics necessary? No. Do they always work out? Typically not. Is it actually inovative for its genre heck yes! Only one person coded this game, with help from his brother sometimes. So having generally working physics at this level is pretty impressive.
