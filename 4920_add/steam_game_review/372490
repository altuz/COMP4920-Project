Instead what I got was a nonsense physics system and randomized levels thus making the want to compete for fastest times die. Why have a game where level completition speed is the focus yet make the levels random AND not have the a quick restart button mapped?\nFurthermore, the UI is bad and the game does bugger all to actually tell you what the fuck you're doing. \nIt took me a couple of attempts to figure out that I wasn't supposed to be going after the gems, but instead the black spirits or whatever the fuck.\n\nDissapointment.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1465906446, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1465906446, "recommendationid": "23551130", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527455", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464435706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 71, "steamid": "76561198024933857", "num_games_owned": 28}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I was hoping for Marble Blast \"the metal edition\". It was metal, that I give credit for.\n\nJudge for yourself in my Let's Play (5 parts in German):\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=781149402\n\nUnfortunately, the game itself is too random, has obvious bugs like ramps not being loaded, making levels impossible, has almost no explanations and too many instant death traps. I could not get past Level A-5 which is a pity as the survival mode only gets unlocked after A-8 which I was looking forward to. I could not get enough stars to even buy one single item. (As a matter of fact I barely managed to find the shop screen at all after I already lost hope and desperately tried to find settings or key bindings which I might have overlooked) The graphics are appealing, though they are not refined enough to qualify the view as a pleasure. The menus are not user friendly.\n\nPlease fix the randomness. Make sure, all blocks and ramps are loaded and the camera does not reset itself. Add some explanations or make the tutorial levels clear enough to learn what is needed to play. Maybe make the map rotating instead of always facing north. Ditch the timer running out. Make it beatable. I could be a nice game, but at the current version 1.0.0, it is just not ready.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464444284, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1479511198, "recommendationid": "23253282", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514618", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
