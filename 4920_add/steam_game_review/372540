Health and and spell resource bars in an easy to see area.\nAnd nothing else. That's literally your entire UI.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nFrom the tiny bit of the game which I've played, the storytelling could be a lot better.\nOf course, the introduction all text-based with no voice-over so it was tedious to read, even as someone who can read and write Chinese.\nThe intro sequence is both too long and too short. For something that's not very engaging and lacking any real depth, it's too long. But as a text-based introduction, it's far too short. Only fluent Chinese readers would be able to read the entire sequence the first time it's shown, and that's if they focus on text only.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nThe best and most redeeming part of the game.\nIt's made in Unreal, so there's already a pretty solid graphical floor.\nMain character design is a bit illogical- Clothes seem kind of restrictive on the chest, and [i]very[/i] loose on the bottom.\nGreat eye candy in animations though. The skirt has some pretty amazing physics.\n\nMob enemy design is alright.\nBoss design is pretty good.\n\nBut we're almost all here to watch the protag show her stuff.\n\nAlso, it's a sickening amount of motion blur whenever you do 180s.\nWhich brings me to my next point:\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nFor a fighter, it could at least give instructions and/or leave a handy tip bar on the side.\nF to dash.\nNumber keys are skills.\nBut all that I could read when it first popped up was that WASD is movement.\n\nAlso the targeting and turning system.\nThere was this 'Lock' option in the options menu which I had no idea what to do with.\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\nIt has the potential to be good.\nBut it's poorly optimized and lacks a lot of staple settings of any game of the genre.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485891222, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485891222, "recommendationid": "29612628", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496739", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487941988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 26, "steamid": "76561198050750548", "num_games_owned": 102}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game has big potential but the optimization is really poor.\nThe enemy AI is basic but you get hit by enemies when you are in the middle of the combo.\n\nAlso the only achievement that this game has doesn't work.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487942116, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487942116, "recommendationid": "30140741", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496806", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487798315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561198219467713", "num_games_owned": 18}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It wouldn't even let my launch the game for it kept freezing everytime I kept trying to start the game.
