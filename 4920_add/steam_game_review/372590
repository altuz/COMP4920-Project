It is a hidden gem though!\n\nWhile I do not work as an artist professionally, I have been creating digital art since the mid 1990s, and in doing so have used a wide range of 2D and 3D applications. My main focus are space and Science-Fiction.\n\nIf am working on a texture for a planet within a space scene for instance, that usually means painting from scratch with the occasional use of my own and public domain stock photos, as well as NASA resources. That is time consuming, and while fun, not always practical.\n\n[u]Grand Designer eliminates two distinct disadvantages:[/u]\n\n[olist]\n[*]It minimizes the time it takes to create a texture, and due to it's randomization features, you won't run into the problem of repeating patterns too much.\n\n[*]When painting a 2D texture intended for use on a 3D object, you usually don't really have a full grasp of what it would look like until you have created the object, placed it in a scene, lit it, and test rendered it. While you can always tweak settings more later, Grand Designer gives you a very good idea of how the end result will look while you are still in the initial creation process.\n[/olist]\n\nThe software is very intuitive, and especially if you have prior experience with 2D/3D software packages such as Photoshop, Vue, Lightwave, Cinema 4D, 3D Studio, and Bryce - to name a few - this will not require much, if any, learning.\n\nIs the asking price justified? A clear 'yes' from me, and I am including the PRO edition in that. One of the main reasons is that this software allows you to generate professional level 16k textures which usually hold up even in extreme close ups. Add to that the real time creation process, time saving, and ability to easily add and remove features, $80 is more than fair. It also doesn't feel clumsy and unfinished like most Early Access titles.\n\nIf you want to expand your horizons, and add a time saver to your workflow, then look no further.\n\n[u]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[/u]\n\n\n[i]I'm not affiliated with the developer in any way; this is an independent review and my opinion.[/i]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451460016, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1451492072, "recommendationid": "20105717", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541619", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437605275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13693, "steamid": "76561198117903435", "num_games_owned": 21}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "From the perspective of what is available, it is great.

I have a middle of the road gaming machine, and previewing at full resolution will drop your fps, but there are options to work at lower quality levels and render your final textures at full res.\n\nI am considering dropping the extra money for the pro version.  I can see this program might be useful for not only planets but heightmaps for terrain generation as well.  If the dev's would consider the feature of generating output textures that could tile on a flat plane, rather than sphere projections, this software could be a one stop shop for both planetary bodies and the fly through terrain to match it.\n\nGreat work!
