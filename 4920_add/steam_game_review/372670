I just actually like this game.\nCan you find other RPG maker games that are different, have more content, or that you might consider \"better\"? Yeah ... but that doesn't keep *this* game from being fun. \nI like battles, this game is almost nothing but battles. It has a battle system that is similar to some other games, yet is somewhat unique. It has a plot that absolutely doesn't take itself seriously. Imo it seems like the \"plot\" is actually just a big satire about how there are so many RPGs, \"RPG Maker\" or not, out there and many of them seem like they were lacking in plot or came from the same place. While it didn't \"draw me in to the world\" with the story, it did make me laugh and have me amused. I have only played the game for like 1.5 hours so far, but I still have really enjoyed what I've played. I just saw that ALL the reviews (at the time I wrote this at least) were negative and couldn't believe it. This game deserves at least a little bit of love. I payed $2 for this game, and have almost put in 2 hours. A movie is like $11 for 2 hours, like the movie or not. I'd say I more than got my moneys worth since I have enjoyed the classes and battle system.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444348233, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444348233, "recommendationid": "18389007", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499923", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
