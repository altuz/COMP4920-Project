After doing a little digging around (there are only like... 3 youtube reviews; the game released today), I decided to take the plunge and purchase the game.\n\nSo what is it?\n\nChiptune Champion is a Guitar Hero clone that exclusively uses chiptunes for the tracks you play to. Being a kid from the 80s, the music definitely brought back memories of summer vacations spent on the NES and Gameboy. There's a wide selection of music to choose from the outset, and the ability to create your own tracks in the track editor or download tracks from the Steam Workshop gives this game the huge potential for massive replayability.\n\nSo that's the good part.\n\nThe bad part is the control scheme. What Chiptune Champion wants you to do is take your keyboard and hold it like a guitar. The 1-5 buttons are used for the \"strings\" while the enter and shift are used for the strum bar. Holy smokes is that unintuitive.\nIt took my wife asking me what I was doing to the keyboard to convince me to go down into the basement looking for one of my old Guitar Hero controllers. And surprisingly, it worked.\nWhile there is no ability to use a guitar controller from inside the game, downloading a free program like JoyToKey will allow you to map the game's controls to the buttons on your guitar, making the control scheme infinitely better and nearly identical to playing Guitar Hero or Rockband.\n\nSo do I recommend the game? Yeah, but only if you have a guitar controller that is compatible with your PC. The game is pretty fun and the music is great. The controls could use a little work and hopefully the game will eventually support an in-game guitar control scheme instead of players needing to use a third party.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452292699, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452317162, "recommendationid": "20407390", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549296", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459223984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 438, "steamid": "76561198002466305", "num_games_owned": 236}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 26, "comment_count": "35", "review": "Note: The developer updated the game to address the two biggest complaints I had with this game. I have updated this review to reflect this.\n\nI'll start off with the negative. Often when I read reviews about a game, I want to know what's wrong with it first and foremost, so that's what i'll provide.\n\nThis game has a few technical problems. There is only one lag compensation setting, forcing you to synch the game to line up visually or line up audibly, just like the original Guitar Hero game on the PS2. Guitar Hero 2, a game released in 2006, had a separate compensation value for the video and audio to account for each device having separate latencies. It's frustrating that a rhythm game released this year has overlooked a problem that its influences have already solved. Additionally, on Windows 10, closing the game crashes it. Some process related to the game remains open, causing steam to track additional playtime for it. If you're on the fence about keeping this game and are a part of the 30%+ people on Steam that use Windows 10, be aware that this bug may cause you to run over the 2 hour window for returns.\n\nThe interface isn't perfect. Many rhythm games will give you a preview of the song you've selected when you highlight it in the track list, but this game keeps playing the menu music for you. It can make it a little harder to find the songs you like.\n\nOn to what's good!\n\nThe developers read my review and took into consideration my feedback, as well as the feedback of others. A patch came out addressing some major issues within 36 hours of this review, which buys them a lot of respect in my book. It's a sign that they care and weren't just looking to dump a game on Steam and never touch it again, as some other Indie devs often do. To be perfectly honest, I am waiting for another patch or two before I personally re-invest in this title. But the soundtrack is quite nice (i've listened to it outside of the game), and reports from other users suggest that the changes to note timing have made the game much more fun to play. I think this warrants a purchase and would recommend this title if you like rhythm games and chiptunes.\n\nI fully anticipate that i'll have to continue to update this review to reflect changes made by the developer. When I re-invest in the title myself, i'll be able to talk more objectively about what I enjoy in the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452328909, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452456080, "recommendationid": "20415989", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541912", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452479880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 35, "steamid": "76561198060361261", "num_games_owned": 693}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A fun game with tons of great songs.

I do want to say that this is only based on the official songs, as I'm sure once the community grows challenging charts will be available on the workshop. The expert mode is not that hard at all, if you've played any other VSRG for even a few months you will easily be able to 100% the expert charts, however like I said this is not really an issue I feel the dev should focus on as it's really up to the community to create harder charts. the steam acheivements are also very easy to obtain and I gained them all in around 3 hours and it only took that long because of the \"clear 50 songs\" achievement which takes the most time.\n\nAnother issue - No mods. not even the ability to speed up a song, I feel even if there were speed modifiers you could at least challenge yourself a bit with the built in charts, but no.\n\nAnother Issue that isn't really an issue more of a \"I wish this feature was in this game\", there is no timing judgements, only \"hit\" or \"miss\",  so there is no real accuracy meter in this game, the percentage it gives you at the end is just the amount of notes you hit, it doesn't go deeper than that. though like i said I don't really think this is an issue that needs to be fixed, more of something I'd like to see in the game.\n\nDespite of all these flaws, I have actually grown to like the game in the short time I've played it.\n\nI feel I've been harsh considering this is not supposed to be the kind of game I went into it thinking it was, at it's heart it's supposed to be more like guitar-hero than anything else and you should really consider that before rushing in to buy it.\n\nThe songs that come with the game are good, and the charts (although not as challenging as I'd like them to be) are mapped fairly well and the majority are honestly fun to play.\n\nHonestly, if you're wondering if you should buy this game or not, it really depends what you're looking for in it.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun 5-key experience with nice songs, nice charts, and you're not really looking for a challenging experience. go for it, the game is genuinely fun.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a new VSRG to play to actually challenge you and maybe improve your 5k skills, I don't think this is the game for you, you could literally go play any other vsrg for free and get more challenge and improve your skill much faster.\n\nSo Overall, I would reccomend this game, but make sure it's what you're looking for, I bought this game thinking it was something it wasn't and initially didn't like it, but I've grown to like it for what it is. I'd like to restate that this whole review is based only on the No-Strum mode and all my points are aimed at VSRG players who are decent at their games.
