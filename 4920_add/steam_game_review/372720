It does not teach you how to write or rules of grammar, just how to speak a few basic things. Never the less, it is a good way to start learning  a language. Of course, a language class will always be better than this, but this may be what motivates you to take those classes.

This app would however make an excellent supplement to a language learning routine, and the competitive features are great for anyone who's learning with a friend. This app makes practice easy and painless, unlike many flashcard apps you can find online, and for such purposes I can easily justify the $5 price tag. Aside from merely using it as a practice tool though, any absolute beginner could use this app to get an introduction to a language. All in all, for the price, I'd certainly recommend this app to anyone who's just getting started in one of the included languages, or who is looking for a more enjoyable way to practice what they already know, however if you're expecting a full featured language course that'll get you fluent, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.
