Rating 1/10. 1 Just for being a game. A sucky one at that. \n\nThis has single player and multiplayer. I only played the single player.\n\nWhen I saw this game on the store page the name grabbed me but I hated the graphics in the trailer and I told the developer the game looked horrible and that he should remake the game in Unreal. Unity sucks. But afterwards I felt bad and since the game was under $1 I figured I'd support the dev and help him buy assets for Unreal so he can remake his game so it at least looks good. \n\nAfter playing the game for a short while. My opinion of the game still stands. \nWhen I started the game I noticed I must of been in a plane crash and landed in the jungle or on an island. Sound familiar? And then I noticed that out of nowhere zombies are spawning and attacking me and they keep spawning from a spot for no reason. So I run and run until I see a beach with a nippa/bamboo dock and when I walk up there are zombies already there. I run and run and am wonder what to do. How can I defend myself. \"Oh look !!. My inventory has a machine gun and a flamethrower already in it.\" Hmmm. Are airline passengers allowd to carry guns on board? Maybe in the country I am in. But flamethrowers? So really if I go on I will just judge this thing more harshly. Oh I went back to the dock and killed the zombies and they just kept spawning at a spot on the hut that is over the water. Hmmm? Whaaaattt?? I don't get it. If the developer remakes the game with way better graphics and game play and animations which are horrible then I will play this again. Possibly good idea for a shooter/survival game but junkie for my taste.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504841176, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504841176, "recommendationid": "34807116", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473774", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 15}}
