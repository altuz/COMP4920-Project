I'll just list everything that is bad about it. \n-Quite a bit of the artwork and animations are poor. \n-The level design is basic.\n-The enemies are either incredibly easy/bugged or are only hard because they are annoying. \n-The gold drop rate seems low so if you want to buy stuff you have to spend a bunch of time mindlessly farming the spawner minions in the first level. \n-There is no strategy, it is just hold down left click and occasionally move based on certain enemy attacks. Maybe this changes later on in the game but I just couldn't sit through the tedious starting levels to find out. \n-The music is actually enjoyable but the clips are pretty short and they just play at random intervals with nothing in between\n\nThere are many other better, and cheaper, rogue-likes out there.  \nWould not recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434847533, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1480301155, "recommendationid": "16569370", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531225", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481699334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 472, "steamid": "76561198154856513", "num_games_owned": 45}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Floors of discomfort is a great game, and very entertaining with different routes to go down.

I liked the art, gameplay, and unlockable characters. The art gives this game a distinct kind of character that you wont find in many other places. The music is also a plus. The characters in this game are diverse, and I enjoyed playing them, especially the Skelewizard. The gameplay is very basic, and easy to grasp. Progressing through the various \"floors\" requires you to acquire items to make up for your character's shortcomings and counter the enemies ahead. I would buy this game if you have some spare change and want something to pass a bit of time with.\n\nThe game has a few flaws, mostly being glitches and a lack of a items. There is a decent amount of items in the game, some you can buy in the store, and some that you must pick up in chests and from bosses. I found that, however, in a short time I had already seen what I believe to be all of the items. It would be nice to see more items added to the game. I am happy with the items in the game so far, as they all feel unique and helpful to some degree (except for temporary boost gems). While there may be some glitches, they were a minor inconvenienve to me.\n\nAll in all, I would purchase this short game if you are looking for a quick fix. While not a completely stellar game, it has its charm, and you can't argue with the price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451365351, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451365351, "recommendationid": "20057167", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502284", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454107958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198074483022", "num_games_owned": 481}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Whoever made the sprites for this game needs to have an anchor management meeting with his therapist", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451508770, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1479941865, "recommendationid": "20127234", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499796", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451970809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 38, "steamid": "76561198101653257", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "review": "The keys do not correlate with the control instructions.
