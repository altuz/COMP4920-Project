The unique asthetics and the design of the world is incredible. The mokos were insanely cute, I loved them to death. The soundtrack was great to listen to. Being able to sense the world form around you in shapes and colors really made me enjoy the game for it's entirety. \nBut therein lies the problem. The game itself is just too short. There is even an achievement for beating the game in half an hour. To me, charging $15 for a game that you can beat in half an hour is just silly. The game is very well made and absolutely stunning to look at, but there just isn't enough replay value or content for me to see that price being justifiable.\n\nThe demo came out over 2 years ago, so I was expecting at least 3 hours worth of game to explore. Yes there are small orbs to collect, and I do plan on going back and getting 100% of the achievements, but that $15 price is just too much for me. I would see paying half that much at the most.\n\nThis is the first steam game I have refunded.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445442130, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445443512, "recommendationid": "18601530", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588622", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469291471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 183, "steamid": "76561198204807504", "num_games_owned": 322}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I bought the game because the idea was interesting and I liked the graphics.

It's a fun puzzler as you use sound to find the path to navigate your enviroment. The use of gongs, crunching leaves, and growling monsters to paint your enviroment is beautiful and unique.
