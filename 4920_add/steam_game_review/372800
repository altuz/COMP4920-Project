Someone typed selling an item in the general chat. Moderators gave him a ban in chat for an hour, there is 200 players and your expected to join 15 channels and switch between each to have a conversation or you will be banned. I made the statement would a level 11 be able to mine gold or will the mobs f me up and my statements were deleted and i was warned of a ban because using a letter from a cuss word is also bannable. This game is marketed towards adults but it seems like its geared towards children with a chat like this. How can you ban every new player in this game when you have a nutty chat system and people who abuse their moderator powers to ban. literally made it 3 days before being banned. If i were the creator of this game and wanted it to ever go anywhere i would immediatly change the chat rules and remove these moderators abusing it.

What do i mean you ask? Well the nostalgic feeling of playing the games you used to play while growing up, yet it doesn't stop there they incorporate a lot of new ideas into the game.\n\n1. Storage/market- the storage or place like as it sounds is a place to store your goods and stuff, but it also can be used to access the market where you can sell your stuff to other players. The market is pretty amazing, lets say you find some grass seeds and you want to sell it. Simply click market sell and see if people are looking to buy any. If they are you can sell it then and there for over the normal price value of an npc. \n\n2. the crafting system. - Its pretty in depth, unlike alot of 2d pixel mmos you see now days, theres alot of stuff to do weather it be you want to be come a fisherman and max that skill or cook the fish you catch. xD there is no end to the crafting. \n\n3. In game wiki - Ever start a game where you're confused about how to get something ? and you ask but everybody treats you like a total noob?  Well no need to fear that. This game has an in game wiki, where you can search all kinds of information.  It doesn't stop there at all, if that isn't enough simply ask in general chat and the people are pretty nice.\n\nI could list more things that are good about this. however to whom ever is currently reading, i ask you this,  Why not simply play the game and find out for yourself?
