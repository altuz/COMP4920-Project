Easy to pick up and understand. Decent music. Not much to say about it. Somewhat neat twist in concept of the standard \"match these colors in pairs/threes\" games, like Bejeweled or Columns, from the Sega Genesis era. While I enjoy it, I recommend it only for the casual puzzle player. The mechanics are simple to learn, and most games pose absolutely little to no challenge until much latter in levels."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1387877345, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487971", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8246586", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007817556", "num_reviews": 263, "last_played": 1362211200, "num_games_owned": 1312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 13}, "timestamp_updated": 1387877345, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's a time waster that I didn't really enjoy.
