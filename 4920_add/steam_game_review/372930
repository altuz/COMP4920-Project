And, on the flipside, I enjoyed interacting with the enviroment, turning keys to open doors, mixing chemicals, rejoining torn papers as well as clicking on puzzle pieces.\n\nOn top of that, there's some nice cutscenes, along with some voice-acting (Though, sadly, Laura doesn't have much of a speaking part) to really paint a picture for new players.\n\nIt's a good balance, there's something for everyone to enjoy.\n\nNow, with all that in mind, I will definitely say that the game was most definitely enjoyable from my end and was worth every penny - six hours for a comfortable playthrough for six bucks sounds fair to me; and with the replay value of revisiting the puzzles and the massive open-world levels with lush artwork, it's almost a steal!\n\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't have some issues, however minor...\n\n-You only have ONE save file, you can't have multiples. \nAlso, even worse, if you're replaying some of the main game again but want to also replay the bonus chapter, the save data for the bonus chapter WILL overwrite your save data for the main game - and vice versa.\n\n-Spilling text on certain documents.\nOn some of the books and journal entries, the bottom of the text runs off of the page.\nThis can prove to be frustrating, I'd like to finish what I'm reading instead of it running off into oblivion or cutting abruptly.\n\n-Bonus chapter's too short.\nI can understand that it's a 'mini-episode' and all, but it just felt like the very end was a bit sudden; Laura explores the underground city and rescues her companion, but, there was no real explanation for what happened to the people there.\nMaybe it's supposed to be left up for interpretation, but there could've been a little more to it.\n\nOther than that, I loved playing through the game; it was nice to sit down and relax with.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435212635, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435281744, "recommendationid": "16691998", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513863", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481900093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 232, "steamid": "76561198027576036", "num_games_owned": 96}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game would be fun if it wasn't glitchy as %$%.
