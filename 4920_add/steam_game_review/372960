It reminds me of Level 22 (guy who is running late for work and must sneak into work) but Robbery Bob is better imo. Haven't used vents, but hide in bushes, under carpets, set off alarms, disguises and more. It also has a few aspects of the Marvelous Mistake. Its a nice basic stealth game, I hope to see more fun games like this and even some more serious stealth robber games too such as Crookz the Heist.\n\nI can't believe with all the stealth games I search for this was not auto-reccomened by Steam (update maybe because stealth was not in the tags for some reason, I added it), I had to search robber to get some more stealth games in my searches.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445633728, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445723354, "recommendationid": "18645860", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536056", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446569254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 190, "steamid": "76561197971102114", "num_games_owned": 1150}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Robbery Bob: Man of Steal  is a Steath game .... giving you the choice to brust forward or use Steath to steal \n\nGreat Story \n \ngreat Music and game play is easy to understand\n\nSkills upgrading  \n\n\n\n\nGreat Work  Devs", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445450061, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445451051, "recommendationid": "18603677", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522324", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475406493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198185881925", "num_games_owned": 23}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Just Buy the mobile version.
