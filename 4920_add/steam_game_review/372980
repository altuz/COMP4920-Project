The only way to obtain recipes is via website and import it into the app or just write it down . They do have an import option , so no worries about that . This app contained syn option which allow you to connect with other devices that is using this app . Furthermore , it have a group syn where you can share your recipes with your family and friend . In summary , it is a note taker with a sharing room . Make you look more professional but actually did nothing much compared to all those free tools out there . For the pro tools , you need to subcribe yearly with a payment of 37 usd . Yes , it does not come along with the app . \nSecondly , dont expect the dev to do anything anymore . This app is already at its final version and no future update is announce. \nThird and lastly , It work just as an organiser . Dont expect anymore from it . If you are the type that like to keep things neat and easy to find , go for it when it is under 50% discount . Else , just get a notepad for free instead . I bought it when it is 30% discount thinking that it already contain the so-called 30 cookbooks pro tool in the description . However , in the cookbook version , there is only ( my cookbook ) . \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nedited\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nI contacted the mastercook website and it said that the steam should provide a 1 year subcription key along with the package . Maybe i didnt get it because i bought it along with other products . So i asked steam to gave me and they did . But when i input it , it said this key doesn't exist.
