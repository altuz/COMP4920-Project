Yeah this was one of the games that made me like games. This was one of the games that turned me into a PC gamer above all other ways to game. This game was the first game that got me into modding and building. This game was amazing. And it's still great. I could just have on nostalgia goggles, but I don't care. I have it in a drawer and could have installed it again, but I just wanted to have it on here too, and wow, it's still fun as ever. Skirmish mode alone is a blast. The alien levels are just so fluid and fun, it still hasn't been replicated, though the recent AvP game was close. This just got it. The audio, the atmosphere, the level design. Seriously worth any amount of pennies you pick it up as, this will remind you of why you started gaming."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505739570, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498598", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35044775", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198413993380", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506126044, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_forever": 1049}, "timestamp_updated": 1505739570, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game love it AVP classic 2000 is a fun shooter that gets the blood pumping"}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505215508, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474489", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34899127", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960323676", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1505213683, "num_games_owned": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 64}, "timestamp_updated": 1505215508, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I went back to play the game since it's been over 20 years since I first tried it. Let me say, my original impression is still the same. You jump right into combat and there's hardly any atmosphere or story. Why is everyone reviewing the game so highly? If you want a good game from the era try Half-Life, System Shock 2, or Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II. Aliens vs Predator 2 from 2003 is a great game and you should try it instead of this. Too bad it's not on Steam."}]}
