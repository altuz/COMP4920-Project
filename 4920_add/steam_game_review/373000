This is a specialized spreadsheet to simplify what is a pain to do.  I like this program.  But lets say Gramps does it better... and Gramps does it well and certainly doesn't hide a lot of complexity.  To me, however, I just want to fill out the really cool 9 generation chart for my daughter which is within the CadStd Pro program for Gedcom files.  She's young... but some day, she'll be older.  If things are simple, I've got a better shot at getting it done sooner, then if things are not.  Yes, it does link to various genealogy links including ancestry.com.  I never got handed a chart of all the way from that city in England, or a family graveyard near me of 7 generations.  If so, I'd only need to digitize what I knew and would probably scoff at other find and seek tools.  However, find and seek is difficult enough... and this exports a gedcom file that is better understood by CadStd Pro than Gramps, so I'll keep using this.
