And here we not only meet Flo herself and all her friends, but we actually play as Bernie, one of the most memorable DinerTown characters, who tries to be a detective. And that means - not only just plain hidden-objects-searching, but quite a lot of other diverse puzzles as well!\n\nThe only drawback of this game is that unfortunately PlayFirst has abandoned PC market for several years already and they are no longer with us to support their great games. Which means - no trading cards, no achievements, no Steam sales, no updates - and many negative reviews from people who couldn't launch the game for some reason.\nAnd I have to add that I had no trouble launching and running it with all the videos on my rather new PC."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1422327142, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505776", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "14186367", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011671142", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1422327110, "num_games_owned": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 25}, "timestamp_updated": 1422327142, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Cannot play this game- tried it on three different computers and it fails to load every time."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1422334931, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498919", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "14187410", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129319561", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1404824934, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 485}, "timestamp_updated": 1422334931, "received_for_free": false, "review": "does not work and no refunds from STEAM or assistance to get it working"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1480905675, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496105", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "28196924", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198043658713", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1480905575, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 23}, "timestamp_updated": 1480905675, "received_for_free": false, "review": "bought this game for my little sister it it wont allow her to pass the story section so she can play the game i am so disappointed"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486437149, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500377", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29753971", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197982923019", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1489198626, "num_games_owned": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 506}, "timestamp_updated": 1486437149, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's a decent enough hidden object game, especially if one gets tired of the photorealistic style of most of them.  \n\n**HOWEVER**, like the Diner Dash series (and presumably others of PlayFirst's catalogue), it has been broken for many years now, ever since the release of Adobe Flash v10.
