The riddles are fairly logical and solvable, nothing too abstract or ridiculous, and no damn sliding puzzles. The graphics are somewhat 2007-ish, but still worth putting up with overall.\n\nEverything else... boy... I really wish those programmers constant harm in the form of resistant genital infections.\n\nIt is NOT possible to exit the game normally. I'm in the main menu, no matter if I got there by ESC in-game, automatically after completing the game, or even directly after launching it. I click \"leave\" and it asks me \"really leave the game\", so I click \"yes\" because that's why I clicked the \"leave\" button in the first place... then my screen turns black and that's it.\n\nNo matter how long I wait, nothing happens. Dead machine. Totally unresponsive to keyboard input, I can press all the usual ALT-TAB, CTRL-ESC, CTRL-ALT-DEL, ALT-F4, etc. hotkeys - nothing. Black screen and f*ck me. The only way to exit this game is by completely rebooting my machine.\n\nOr, and this is the second most annoying thing, by waiting for a crash. No hanging black screen after a crash. In the 3 hours it took me to complete the game, it crashed 5 times. Definitely too many crashes for one session.\n\nThe crashes usually occur after a voice sound dropout. Somewhere along the story, the voice playback cuts out, sometimes during cut scenes, but inconsistently at various places. After a drop-out, moving is  still possible, doing or combining things is possible, background music is still audible. The game basically goes on normally - just without spoken monolog/dialog. \n\nAssuming that something's wrong, I attempt to save the game and restart the application, but as soon as I press the ESC key - dingaling, chime sound, crash and back to Windows. Restart application, continue from last savegame. Yay. Such happy, many joy.\n\nSo: SAVE YOUR GAME EVERY 10 SECONDS! (or so)\nIf the voice audio drops out - it's too late already. Might as well spare yourself having to replay everything from now on and make it crash right away.\n\nWhen trying to open a door or something once, I got an on-screen message instead of audio and subtitle, \"resource missing\" (or similar) with a hex code.\n\nAnd, seriously, I really don't need to hear \"hm, this doesn't look like a musket to me...\" 200 times, if the thing you're trying to combine with something else WILL NOT EVER BE COMBINED WITH A MUSKET OVER THE COURSE OF THE ENTIRE SODDING GAME!\n\nThis feels like a late alpha or early beta version, not a final release, and definitely not like a game that's been released for years now. Was there ever an update, even a single attempt to deal with these issues? I don't think so, but the Steam Discussions for the game are flowing over with the same or similar complaints.\n\nReally. Do NOT pick this game up at full price. Just don't.\nBut still, if you're looking for a story worth following, it's OK enough to not make you cringe.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493586128, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493586290, "recommendationid": "31472771", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502907", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495450900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 184, "steamid": "76561198242876034", "num_games_owned": 710}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Point and click.
