So even now that I'm stuck at world 2 I'm not frustrated since missing the jumps is my fault (the controls are simple and very responsive). I have ignored the story so far but I don't think I'm losing anything groundbreaking.\n\nThe only thing that really annoys me is the spawn pattern of a few monsters, for some reason they will spawn on top of your character or of other monsters turning it really difficult to react in time.

The Mace's arc is so bad, but with the Wind Armor's help it has a nicer angle that can help defeat those shielded enemies.\n\nAll this to say, Caste of the Seven Godsend is incredibly diverse. There are so many different potential playstyles, whether you favor certain god armors over others, or certain weapons over others.
