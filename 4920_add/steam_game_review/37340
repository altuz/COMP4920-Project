I am enjoying it, however, I prefer playing in the windowed mode but it suddenly said it couldn't display that mode anymore (after 300 + plus hours of playing perfectly) ... something about the memory on my video card being full.?????  Can anyone help.  Its not good playing it in full screen mode.  It doesn't perform well.\nPlease help me"}]}
