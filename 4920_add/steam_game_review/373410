It wasn't for me. The help box that pops up was covered by the small map window making the help box useless. I couldn't understand the controls. I've already asked for a refund!!! Cuddos to those that really like the game, but for me the tut was to short, and the concept was lost on me. it got dark almost instanly and then I was really confused. Maybe I'll try again once it's out of EA, but for right now I'm not interested.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1506589852, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506023155, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506023155, "recommendationid": "35112434", "developer_response": "Thanks for your feedback, we appreciate you tried the game.
