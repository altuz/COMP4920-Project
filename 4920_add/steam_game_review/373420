It was different from the action RPGs, like Path of Exile or Diablo, that I'm used to. One of the first things that really threw me off was the movement speed. The slower movement speed just slowed everything down. \n\nBut that just made everything feel more real. \n\nWhat do I mean by real? Your creativity and imagination matters. How you read and interpret quest logs and conversations matters. Honestly, there are so many ways things can go 'wrong' because the game is so free. \n\nThis game doesn't hold my hands as much as other games. It was hard, it was frustrating. Every completed quest felt so much more fulfilling and compelling. You put effort into it, it wasn't a cookie cutter kill x things. Hell, your build might matter, like putting points into pet pal to talk to animals. I loved this game. \n\nBut, holy crap, it got frustrating for me at one point. All progression just grinded to halt. My friend and I had no idea what to do. BY THE WAY, THIS GAME IS MEANT TO BE PLAYED CO-OP. LIKE REALLY. We had completed all the story but hadn't used the bloodstone/starstone thing, and had no idea that it was linked to continuing the quest.\n\nAnd so, what happened is that we completed 90% of the game's main storyline, 'main' because of all the side quests, and we got stuck. We thought there was more quests to do, something we were missing in order to continue. But, after some googling, we figured out the problem and suddenly propelled to the end of the game.\n\nIn another game it would be doing and completing all the game's main storylines and quests without receiving them for the quest-giver. Then after completing everything, you meet the guy who's supposed to give you the quest and find out you completed everything. \n\nThe game has humour too. I laughed when I met a totem that claimed it could show me the future, and it did. \n\nTLDR Great game. Huge time sink. Difficulty is compelling. Freedom for creative use of skills is refreshing. Freedom backfired on us and got us stuck in storyline. Definitely play it co-op. Personally played for story, will not play again. Recommend 10/10. YMMV.

There's no handholding, and subsequently you're offered a lot of freedom. While there's surely an 'optimal' path to take, you can generally approach things however you like and do things super out of order. As the game never really tells you \"GO HERE!\" with a giant objective marker (like in most RPGs nowadays), you must read the dialogue and quest logs to figure out where to go next. It's a refreshing change of pace, actually playing the game for yourself and figuring out things as you go, and it's very rewarding, especially when you finally figure some of the trickier things out.\n\nThis freedom extends to your characters as well, where there are no classes and anyone can spec into whatever they want, and even into multiple different skills at once. You can get some really crazy combinations of skills and abilities, that really make the combat a blast to play. There's a huge amount of depth to it all, that will leave you figuring out new stuff even after playing for 100 hours. My only complaint in this is that the respec system is extremely punishing and only comes around very near the end of the game, so if you mis-spec somewhere down the line (and you typically will), you've pretty much wasted those points for good unless you can justify the cost and hasstle of respeccing.\n\nThe overarcing story can be a bit difficult to follow at times (and the confusing mess of a quest log certainly doesn't help), but the writing is generally very entertaining, with a nice quirky sense of humour, and the newly added voice overs make sitting through the absolute metric ton of dialogue much more bearable.\n\nIf you can find a friend to play this with: do it! Coop is certainly the way this was meant to be played, and it's got to be one of the best damn coop games I've ever played.\n\nI have 160 hours between this enhanced edition and the original version of the game, and even wouldn't mind playing it again. There's a good deal of replayability, not only by trying out new character builds, but also by picking different companion characters and quest options--not to mention the numerous side quests I probably missed, be it by not having the prerequisite skills, by killing some character vital to a quest, or just simply by running along and never finding them.\n\nThere are certainly some annoying bugs in this game, but given the scope and level of freedom it gives the player, it's completely understandable and does not detract from the game in any way. Definitely recommend grabbing this one, just be warned of the game's length--a single playthrough took me 80 hours!\n\nAlso, can't help but mention this somewhere: The music is awesome! Go look up \"battle theme 6\" on Youtube, and you'll see what I mean.

although I give this game a positive I'd prefer to give it a neutral rating\nunfortunately this game has so many stupid frustrating moments it knocks the fun factor down\nby quite allot\n\n-Pro's-\n\n---The graphics are beautiful and detailed and there's a good variety of area's\n\n---Combat is very good, the ability to change the enviroment to match your style\n     is brilliant and a fight can go completely different ways depending on how \n     you plan it, getting caught off guard naturally has pretty bad consequences\n\n---Loot, I personally liked the loot in this game, they did right in giving them \n     colours and they drop often so its always fun to check your gains after \n     every fight\n\n---Quick travelling is one of the games strong points, its very easy to just zip\n     to the shop sell your stuff and them zip back, so travel time in this game\n     isn't much and you don't spend practically any time backtracking\n\n---Small chatter, in the game most groups of enemies with intelligence will\n    chat to one another and its fun to just wait before fighting to see what they\n    are talking about, its also brilliant how every animal in the game can be\n    talked to and can have quests or hints and everyone is voice acted\n\n-Cons-\n\n---Crafting and Blacksmithing in this game are pretty useless, the items you can make\n     are always white, you cant customize them at all, and there's basically two \n     differences, one with strong att and no stats or one with some rubbish stats and\n     less attack, oh and the stats will always be the same even if you make 100 swords\n     you can add the odd enhancement but in general if you make 100 swords there \n     will only  be essentially 2 swords, the only pro to these are you can repair your \n     gear and enhance gear on a whetstone other than that its garbage.\n\n---Some parts of the game have veeeery stupid solutions, now some might say its to\n     make the game hard but no, thats no excuse, the game almost expects you to know\n     what to do, for example, on several parts of the game you'll be expected to know to\n     throw your teleport pyramid through a wall, with no prior clue's, or you'll be expected\n     to burn something despite it never even hinting at you needing to do so let alone you\n     wouldn't think of randomly doing it in the first place, and these are parts essential to\n     to the game.\n\n---Quest markers often get bugged out so dont bother using them\n\n---The difficulty of this game, minus the stupid things your expected to know (looking\n     at you a certain house...) is surpsingly easy late game, like insanely easy, one must\n     know that every enemy in the game can be frozen (Within reason) knocked down etc\n     now although I love this, I also hate it, as the bosses are soooo easy most of them I\n     literally just froze and killed without them being able to do a thing, almost every boss\n     will summon minions to help them but you can knock them down, stun them etc before\n     they even get a chance (Don't want to spoil anything but the last boss will dissappoint...)\n\n---Rock paper scissors, in conversations when an opinion conflicts or if you want to do a \n     quest in a certain way, your companion might jump in and argue, now although I get\n     what this is meant to be for, it gets annoying soooo fast, like ig you decide to let an\n     enemy live, your companion might jump in and if they win there choice takes place\n     you'll just find yourself reloading and doing it again till you win most of the time.\n\n---Perception, My god perception, you had better get one of your character with high perc or\n     your pretty much F'd, heck theres a puzzle thats instant kill and almost impossible to do\n     without abusing the games mechanics on teleporting, and another puzzle that you have to\n     solve as its part of the game thats impossible to pass without perception, its also insanely\n     irritating when your running allong and your character says they've spotted something \n     it doesn't hint at all as to where it is so sometimes you'll be completely lost as to what they found\n     once again you'll be ripping your hair out at the lack of information the game gives heck\n     there's even an area thats incomplete but still on the map so you'll be frustrated trying to\n     fnd ways in just to find the developers left it ingame incomplete -.-\n\n\nSo although I went into a BF at the end, the game in general is a good one, I'd rate it about a 6/10\neverything else can be easily looked past but the stuff they randomly expect you to try is stupid to\nno end and will leave you on the verge of just wanting to use a guide, luckily I perservered in the end\nbut the temptation was so high, and admittingly several solutions I found out of pure luck \n(Looking at you a certain temple....)\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created":

I play mostly real-time action RPG's, you know, like Bioware and Bethesda stuff. I was pleasently surprised to find this gem of a game though. I'll probably play more turn-based RPG's because of it.\n\nWhat I think really makes this game shine is the writing, theatrical voice acting, humor, and thoughtful lore. There's this light-heartedness to Larian games that I'm really starting to like.\n\nI found the gameplay to be fun and challenging. There's nothing quite like beating overwhelming odds with carefully staggered crowd-control, which I imagine to be only possible in turn-based games. (I'm new to this type of game.)\n\nI don't know how the classics compare or if it's typical of this genre, but I have mixed feelings about the puzzles in this game. I'll try to explain as best as I can to give some people a heads up. Ever played classic point-and-click adventure games where there's a ton of pixel-hunting frustration? There's a lot of that in this game. I can't speak for everyone, but I definitely get stuck a lot when questing and it really bogs down the pacing. I can imagine this is a feature for some people, as the questing doesn't feel as formulaic. The trade-off is that the pacing isn't as smooth as the RPG's i'm used to playing.\n\nI guess if you really enjoy freedom, exploration, puzzle and your mood allows for some frustration, then it should be no problem. I think Larian intended the game to be this way.\n\nHowever, the writing and voice-acting is so good that I really wanted to solve those darn puzzles to be rewarded with more content. Overall the game is a very addicting experience. I haven't stayed up late gaming in a long time.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is well-worth the money, even for someone like me who normally avoids turn-based games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506054728, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506054728, "recommendationid": "35120105", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502688", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506120833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 334, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5313, "steamid": "76561197960917709", "num_games_owned": 319}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "- This seems to be broken.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506115317, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506115317, "recommendationid": "35137940", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506477329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 801, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1779, "steamid": "76561197980615971", "num_games_owned": 434}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's hecking dang hecking good heck get it heck", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505771087, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505771087, "recommendationid": "35053529", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2331, "total_reviews": 2662, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 331}}
