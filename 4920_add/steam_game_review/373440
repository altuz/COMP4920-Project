If you liked the classics from the old SNES, you will probably like this game, too.\nIt has lots of content (I'd say 20h+), many side quests, puzzles and is well balanced. It offers visible encounters and three diffculties, so anyone should be fine. There's also a tiny bit of romance in it, which I found nice and lighthearted. The story is well written, and you don't have to go through massiv text walls.\n\nConsidered the price the game asks for, I can't think of any reason not to buy it. The game has also trading cards (but no achievements).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501252189, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501252348, "recommendationid": "33857002", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500637911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 396, "steamid": "76561198092241174", "num_games_owned": 31}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "One of the few RPG-maker games I've bought and actually really enjoyed.\n\n+ Excellent soundtrack\n+ Great sense of humor most of the time\n+ Every character has a different set of abilities that utilise different items/resources\n+ Relatively fun story\n+ A bunch of variety between main quests, from collecting stuff, looking for stuff, battling and even solving puzzles\n\n- Controls are quite clunky\n- Area-to-area difficulty spikes are quite a nuisance\n- A ton of backtracking\n- It's sometimes very confusing where you can and can't go\n\n* Non-story NPC's are a bit one-sided, but that's to be expected\n* Combat with the same units gets a bit stale after a while\n* NPC's may block your path to certain areas at times", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503054421, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503054421, "recommendationid": "34326110", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 21, "total_reviews": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 9}}
