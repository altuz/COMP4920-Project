Well... Not exactly sure. I have played both the normal version, and the beta version. The beta brings it closer to games like Binding of Isaac and similar, which is the version I like the most. The beta version of the game has a lot of potential...\n\nBut the game feels dead now. Last update was in December, 2016. That's over half a year of complete silence. And thus, it feels like the game has been abandoned. So, I do not recommend this game.
