After completing 1993:SM  I really can say the tagline \"celebrating games like Gradius, R-Type and Life Force\" was at least partially misleading: those were great shooters indeed, but no (half) bullet hell they were. \n\nBullet hell did surface in year 1993 but was not a popular subgenre until the second half of the decade. What we have here, to summarize, is a part classic / part bullet hell horizontal shooter cast in Amiga-style graphics, what with all the Xenon2 Megablast references. Well, let's be honest here: I venerate Amiga, and 1993's art and sprites and (shyly used) parallax background are average Amiga fare; but obviouly not even a pumped up A4000 could have pushed so many high-color animated objects on a scrolling screen at once: not without major slowdowns and other problems. [i]Shenandoah[/i] tech demo (grandfather of 1993; look for it on youtube), while remarkable for its time, could not even come close to the level of complexity on display here. I like the archaeological side of the project the developers explained, but the game is clearly coded with modern hardware in mind.\n\nSince Amiga had many great scrolling shooters, but never a bullet hell (unless you count some modern homebrew attempt of a game), you could say this is a sort of [i]ucronic[/i] approach at retrogaming: interesting, for sure, but not completely succesful. \n\nI admit that bullet hell is not my cup of tea, not even in hybrid form: I prefer 100% standard scrolling shooters, by far. I find bullet hells tend to overcrowd the screen with unnecessary debris, particles and tiny bits of whatever that serve only one purpose: a mere trick to distract the player's eye and to unfairly increase difficulty level. 1993 is no exception in this, but fortunately it doesn't have that other typical bullet hell issue: primary-colored, fluoresecent, lisergic, anime-style characters and graphics :-) (which usually I quite appreciate, but not when they make your eyes bleed).\n\nAs for 93 game mechanics, you don't have a clear indication of your status (no classic energy bar) and I found this to be a little off-putting: yes, your life depends on the 8 rotating barrier dots - they regenerate after they're hit, they decrease when your ship is hit. But some projectiles can apparently take your ship down at once, even if you still have dots: better instructions explaining this, maybe? Either this, or I was not able to distinguish what exactrly hit me and how many times it did it - and we're back to bullet hell issues.\n\nSpeaking of instructions, I completely missed that you could summon the armory vessel *during* a level by hitting a small beacon (shame on me!), so I completed 1993 on a much higher difficulty  (big me!) but this granted me no special achievement (hint, hint). So, my 200+ deaths could have been less, for sure, If I had purchased some weapon ehancement in the middle of a level  - because of this, I cannot really express a fair judgement on difficulty and frustration level. For me it was high until I finally beefed up my ship, then it decreased and was up again on last level, but your experience could definitely be much different.\n\nLastly, audio: contrary to others, to me the game sounded not that great. Average (again) techno fare, no real personality to show. 90s shooters had way better music and melodies and all, but this is a general problem with today gaming.\n\nAll in all, I appreciate the effort and the meaning of the whole operation here, but recommending the game is no easy choice: if you are an avid retrogamer you'll probably really like its graphics; if you are a 2D shooter completist, definitely go for it; and a really diehard bullet hell fan could enjoy its different approach and  unusual setting. For all the others it could be too niche. \n\nAs for me, I'd prefer to give no thumb, but alas, Steam allows no draw.  So, thumbs up - but by an invisibly thin hair.\n\n\n\n/edit:s many typos, some rephrasing, bullet hell Vs standard shooter", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495995752, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496011546, "recommendationid": "32026005", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519231", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
