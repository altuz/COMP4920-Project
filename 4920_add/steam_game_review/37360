The game uses the Antique Road Show as a backdrop and uses tilesets like antique items that you match with a few treasures thrown in. The player follows the board like a MB board (Life or Sorry etc) and you follow it around to various antique shows and flea markets, each one having a different layout and tileset, though some tiles are common to all the stops on the way. The end goal is to make it to the big TV show called Antique Road Show where people bring stuff in and appraisers tell them the value, some are worth a little and some items are worth a small fortune.  I consider it money well spent (IMO) as I bought it on sale and I'm still playing it. The graphices are good, the tile sets are clear and the controls are easy and responsive, though a few times I have clicked on a tile and the input (LMB) did not seem to take, it did on the second try though.\n\nIf you like the game Mah Jong, IMO, this one is worth getting."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1377012245, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498053", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2469053", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007817556", "num_reviews": 263, "last_played": 1364626800, "num_games_owned": 1316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 16}, "timestamp_updated": 1385872747, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Too simple and completely uninspiring.
