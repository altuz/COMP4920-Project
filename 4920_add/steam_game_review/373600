Love the metal sound track and the graphics are absolutely stunning!! Way better than what you see in the demo. Such attention to detail and huge cool bosses!!. See that means the devs really care about what type of product they are putting out and that means a lot to me. I just love little small details in the back ground. Trees swaying, enemies breathing all that. Controls great too with a Xbox controller.Kind of reminds me of the old school Contra for the SNES. Great selection of weapons and characters too. And what a steal at only $4.99!! I could say more but i'm about to dive deeper into this sweet little game!! Go buy this game and support these devs!!

I'd go as far as calling it 'good enough'.\n\nThe gameplay is kind of generic. Very simple.\n\nThe story is.... Kinda blah. Nothing special.\n\nThe art style is vibrant and very alien/mutant. Interesting monsters and bosses. Big plus there.\n\nIt's got interesting gameplay mechanics, like the 'rescue system' where you find an ally and carry them to safety. And, the spider-pack was kinda fun. No more obscure firing angles!\n\nThe near miss 'death brushing' system was definitely interesting. I don't recall anything else like it.\n\nUnusual characters with vastly differening weapon and play styles. Kinda nice. Just needs MORE characters!\n\nThe game is short. Crazy short. Replayability and branching paths only go so far.\n\nBut my favorite feature of the game?\n\nThe BRUTAL FREAKING METAL SOUNDTRACK!!!!!!!\n\nA lot of love went into the soundtrack and I was more than happy to slap down the 2 extra bucks to get it. It is good, classic, hard and fast metal. The way metal should be. Especially action-game music. Really driving and invigorating.\n\nThe music saved this game, by me.\n\n7/10~ Will play again if more content/sequel comes out.\n\nSeriously. The music is awesome.

Though I'm not a fan of most shooters where you can die in one hit, as it can oftentimes feel 'unfair', this game has a system I quite like called death-touching. Basically, when you're about to be killed by something time will slow down to allow you to focus on survival until you're escaped the threat. Despite this though, the game can be quite hard, especially on the higher difficulty settings.\n\nThe lives system is quite original as well. You have several operatives to choose from when you start a mission, each with their own unique primary weapon and double-jump. When an operative is shot or otherwise maimed, another is deployed, and you can have the new operative rescue the old one by carrying them on their back. You can only carry one though, so if you die multiple times in a level you'll have to choose which one you want to save in order to use them again later.\n\nAlthough short, this game offers branching paths that lead to 4 endings (one secret), and each level is packed with some of the most original and gross enemy designs I've ever seen.
