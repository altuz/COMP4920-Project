The living systems in this game are beyond anything I have seen. The animals feel real, and do real things, the trees sway in the wind, its just refreshing from modern garbage games, with no living systems. Also what is great is the resources have stats, so everything is different, not every one makes the same garbage. Very great game. I think I will be spending lots of time here. \n\nBtw this game is beautiful looking at 4k with aa on, but your gonna need a decent computer. I have a 8350 amd, and a 480 and its board line going under 60 fps, 80 though with aa off. The animals are really something in this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486952019, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486952019, "recommendationid": "29888470", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499325", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
