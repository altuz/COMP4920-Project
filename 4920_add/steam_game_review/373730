I bought it on sale, and now 3.5 hours in I think I'm done, unless there's a serious update. The reviewer who really sold the game to me was the one that said this game wasn't about conquest, but exploration. Unfortunately, I spent more of my playtime trying to \"explore\" how to do anything. Others had mentioned it was a bit clunky, but it was more frustrating than I expected. \n\nYou start out on an island, procedurally generated like most roguelikes. You get a tent of workers and need to get them building. Your first option is to build a lumberjack's hut. Go grab yourself a snack, it's gonna take a bit. Once that's done, several new options will open up, but none of them matter except the forester, cause you've already chopped down half the trees on your island. Next you need a shipyard, because you're running out of gold, and it'll take a gold mine AND a mint to start producing your own coins to pay your men, and the last game your guys wouldn't even build the mint (why? good question, and I don't have an answer, cause every time I've used the building placement checker thing, it showed placing options for every building but it.)\n\nYou get a free ship with the shipyard, but you'll need a 2nd if you want to colonize another island AND don't want to abandon everyone and everything you've worked for on your first. \n\nI experienced all of that through several restarts in the 3.5 hours I played. I never went into the underground dungeon, and never got any iron or anything that can be built with it, therefore I never got awesome armor/weapons to take on bigger/more enemies, I could definitely reach that point in another 3.5 hours, but I really don't know if I will.

How can I use abilities, when I can't find them anywhere?\n\nWhile combat there is blood everywhere, like half of my island covered with blood from two guys, you can't aim them through that, you can't even see yourself. When some enemies come on your island you have to wait until they get mad, because you cant attack them before that.\n\nBuilding of structures is strange... When you tell your workers to build something, they will start reading newspaper and after a minute they'll tell you they can't build it. You can't know what to build, because there is no information about those structures, only the name and how much does it cost, which is useless, so you have to try sometimes what to build until you can make your camp functional. You can't build two buildings of the group at the same time, even if you have enough workers.You can't build two same buildings, so you will run out of resourses quite soon\n\n\nYour peasants come of nowhere, when you build something there appear someone in the tent and start working.

You need to fight colonists for many reasons, wild animals to get gold and access to islands and natives to win the game. The only problem is that combat is impossible. Colonists, who you have to raid else they attack you later on, will pull you into a fight with a single man, one guy! And then their entire colony comes to kill you with spears, swords, armor. Want to run away? NO RUNNING AWAY COWARD!! As you are forced to click, click, click which is the only impact you have on combat: clicking determing how fast you attack capped by your weapon, you cannot run away, you fists cannot stand up to their weapomns annnnndddddd...... there are about 15 of them for you to fight with your fists. This is incredibly fustrating as a large part of the game's mechanic and your survival is based upon raiding these colonists. While it may be fun to dance with death as you try to do what you can to steal there resources and destroy, maybe one hut.\n\nDungeons. Dungeons in this game are horribly designed. There are chests with very little loot: the basic resources are all you can expect from the chests you can get to. Other chests are either guarded by wild animals who deal 3x your damage, have 4x your hp and lock you in combat as per the stupid mechanic until the rest of the cave is drawn to your fight. \n\nOh yeah natives. The one enemy you can actually click on and not die to. They have a really strange time where they do not attack you and then out of the blue they start fighting you. Do not go anywhere near one of their archer towers, of which you can expect 1-3 of on every island that has any resource you want/need. These archer towers will draw you into combat which again YOU CANNOT RUN AWAY. Only this time it is A STATIONARY OBJECT. They also deal either more or less damage than you, its hard to say but what i can say is that they have maybe 5x your hp so good luck fighting one on your own.\nEnough about combat.\n\nEarly game all you can do is play another game. You can literally press 3 keys, wait maybe 40 secs then press another 3 keys then you need do nothing for the next 5 mins waiting for the 6 keys you pressed to get you resources.\nOnce you get to exploration you can go off frolicking through the world to find the 1 island that isnt dominated by animals, native archer towers or colonists, you then get stuck on that island for another 5 mins repeating the process all over again. Then once you return home you find that either you men have all destroyed their own houses because they dont have gold or your men are dead and the buildings occupied by colonists. \n\nSo if you have read to the end thank you for having the patience to read my rant about another good idea turned into a money grab.\nIf you are the creator of the game to you I say please put in the great amount of effort I know it must take to fix your game. It would be great if even the little it has at the moment just worked.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463010363, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463010363, "recommendationid": "22919203", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508784", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450374756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 232, "steamid": "76561198004521833", "num_games_owned": 584}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "There are definitely some things wrong with this game.  But the main question is...is it fun and worth the money (for me $3.14)?  Yes.\n\nYou start out on a small island and must manage whatever resources you start with in order to expand onto other islands.  Your starting island never has all the resources you need.  After a couple hours, you could have a pretty big civilization going, but there's a big difficulty curve after your second island.  It's pretty hard to manage resources between two islands and if you don't do things perfectly, you might as well start a new game...again and again.  I got to a point where I actually managed to build a fortress, but I didn't have an iron mine going because my second island was too close to a big colonist island.
