The crafting and gathering mechanics are creative, the skill system and survival mechanics are satisfying and well balanced, and the realism is uncompromising and exciting. Plus it gets better every update.\n\nTo the developer (who I think is just one guy): thank you. This game scratches an itch for all dinosaur lovers. You are doing God's work.\n\nI can't wait to see this project continue to develop. If you are interested in a hardcore dinosaur island survival simulator, this is the game for you.\n\nI would have happily paid $60 for this game. Even more so considering how epic the final product is shaping up to be. \n\nMy only wish would be a \"cartoon\" difficulty which doesn't cap your skill points during character creation.

The little tiny micro-details about your character's state of health, the ecosystem, the physical objects, none has been neglected like other games do, and i love that. The way you can see the details of a branch outside and see that it's dry, and cold, or that a certain troodon is old and lower on health, the little details are what make this game so interesting. Although in its current state (which duh its early access of course, i know ^.^) it comes to a bit of a standstill after a while, i can only imagine what fun and exciting updates that the future will bring to this game, which has so much potential. Also, I feel so awesome when I've killed something and quickly drag its carcass away to my cave like the hoarding neanderthal that I am.
