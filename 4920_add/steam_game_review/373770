They're all in one launcher/download.\n\nLiEat is a very interesting game series. Each character has their own little cuteness to them, and you even get to read about each character after each game you finish. The games aren't very long, but are very intertaining and was able to keep my attention for almost 5 hours straight, in which, I completed all except for the last one. These games aren't exactly hard, but do keep you on your toes. I highly suggest these games. The stories are very good, and the combat is fun as well.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506129340, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506129340, "recommendationid": "35141243", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504908755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 293, "steamid": "76561198076157013", "num_games_owned": 171}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a very cute but short game, you can complete it in less than 4 hours if you want to get all achievents and can get them almost in one go. \nFor being an rpg game, the fighting has almost no reason except for the very end [spoiler]in which you need to grind to lv 13 or above to get the good ending[/spoiler] and for most of the game just going throught the forced fights is enough to get you high enough level for the bosses.\nI loved the music, it can be both very relaxing and tense when the occasion called for it. Kinda wish there was also the downloadable soundtrack along with the game.\nThe art style was really nice too, going from still pictures to short animations. It's a simple style but because of its semplicity I find it very fitting with the game scenario and ambiance. Keeping this cute almost childish style considering the rather dark story gives it a weird yet interesting effect.\nI enjoyed the story even though I found it pretty short, giving little bits of the story here and there throught the three chapters and a big chunk of it at the very end of the third, which was a little overwhelmind in my opinion. I would have liked if the series started from an earlier point, like the moment in which Efina hatches to get a better grasp of the characters personality and the why of everything that is going on little by little instead of getting it all thrown at you at the very end.\n\nIt's a very nice game, I surely recommend it but if you're unsure, I would wait until it's on sale for two dollars or less since it's a pretty short game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504911108, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504911108, "recommendationid": "34824713", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502297", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1457050092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 467, "steamid": "76561198089933978", "num_games_owned": 121}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this one has a very good story too it. and i like the style it has. i would have to say give it a go :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505665056, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505665056, "recommendationid": "35027325", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497473", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502398041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 32, "steamid": "76561198089543934", "num_games_owned": 190}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Just do it.\n\nTrust me. \n\nDo it.\n\nMiwashi = good dev.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505536644, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505536644, "recommendationid": "34987587", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500076", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 924, "total_reviews": 950, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_negative": 26}}
