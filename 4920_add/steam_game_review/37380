A 1920s woman who desires to be a star reporter. When she achieves her dream, she gets more than she bargained for. Murder, political scandals, and the mob are just some of the things our intrepid, plucky heroine investigates in her search for her next story.\n\nI'm a fan of search-and-find games like this, so I had to buy it. I wasn't disappointed. The gameplay is excellent, if not very challenging. The objects aren't too hard to find, especially since you can view a silhouette of the object. The ability to recharge your hints through linking items, finding batteries, and a train/trolley ride every level is great, though I rarely needed to use the hints myself. The puzzles throughout the game are not too challenging either.\n\nThe graphics are superb. The backgrounds and the items are all detailed and good-sized, so there's no pixel-hunting. These areas are photo-realistic. The characters are more cartoonish, but still very well-drawn. The scenes in between that further the story are even more comic-like, but not in a terrible way.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game. The plot, graphics, and gameplay were excellent. Though not very challenging, it's good if you just want to have fun and enjoy a game without having to struggle. I highly recommend this game to any fan of search-and-find games, anyone who enjoys a good mystery, or anyone who just wants to play a fun, yet simple, game.\n\nMy rating is 9.5/10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1481375577, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "28288447", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197988928565", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1481375431, "num_games_owned": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 115}, "timestamp_updated": 1481375577, "received_for_free": false, "review": "crashes constantly. its unplayable."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1407035922, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500749", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11529138", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198065923230", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1399530913, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 286}, "timestamp_updated": 1407035922, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Easy to play, standard point and click style of game & finished it in a night - provides enough entertainment to justify purchasing it."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1442535139, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499561", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "18077827", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198034924208", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1442669849, "num_games_owned": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1442535139, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Game continually crashes.
