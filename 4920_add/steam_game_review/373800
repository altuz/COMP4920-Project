When I saw this  in the Steam store I immediatly tohught, another   series of pinball  tables, yeahhhh!.    Sadly my euphoria was short lived because this  set and the other two sets of tables ([i]i.e. Hot Pinball and Soccer Pinball Thrills[/i] were one of   the  biggest   let downs I've ever  had with pinball games since I  made my  first  pinball game using a freeware program.\n\nThe only positve apart from the price was  the ball physics, but even that was marred at times with  a sluggish feel to the  ball movement.  There was little to  keep me interested  in continuing with the game, but   I was determined to try out each table from  all three games so as to be as unbiased as possible, once I'd accomplished that  I had to shut the game down as it was excruciatingly mind numbingly boring.\n\nBasically  all six tables are   similar to each other, with little to keep even the most ardent of pinball fams  interested.      Right from the outset I  could feel I was going to be disappointed; the  graphics were lack-lustre,     the inability to control the initial ball strength, with its  all  or all response from the  ball plunger immediately put me off the game. I love to  try  skill shots, which are available  with all good  digital pinball games.  There's no way you could  get a skill shot  with these tables; that's if they were available, which they are not.\n\nSo, no tweaking  of the  ball plunger to  accomplish that hard to get  shot that you've been trying for  for ages, or attempting to get all of the gates lit at the top of the table.  Basically, It's all down to luck, with no skill required.  There appears to be no  additional features or hidden  puzzles; at least I didn't unlock, or find any  over the couple of hours I spent playing all 12 tables from  the three sets. Everything looks so dull, even tohugh the  tables themselves are quite colorful.   The ramps and rails are  similar in all tables, few of the tables have  enough  targets to hit and most targets appear static with no  lighting effects, there are few animations, and what animations are used seem to be repeated in most  tables  e.g. the ball wells.  The graphics are so so and lack   the vibrancy that we have become accustomed to  with the  two recent additions to the Steam library of    Pinball FX and Pinball Arcade, both of which are fantastic  series and  exciting to play, and which  have loads of hidden extras, brilliant  animations and loads of features, and more importantly  are   worth every penny.  This series of tables are  sub standard so I doubt I'll be playing them again.   \n\nThe only thing  going for it  are  the number of tables you get for the  price.  It is cheap, working out at \u00a30.67p/$0.83cents per table, buying the triple pack  doesn't save you money in terms of tables gained as the two other sets  i.e. Hot Pinball and Soccer Pinball Thrills only have three  tables each.  The  price for the triple pack is basically double the price of the Fantastic Pinball Thrills, though the other two  packs on their own cost more  per table, even though they are the same   style of table.    If you are determined to buy these games, i'd seriously   wait till they are on at least a  50% to 75% off deal, which I'm sure they will be once the  negative reviews stack up, and sales dry up.   I honestly cannot recommend this game, even to the most dedicated pinball player.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter some though, I reckon these tables  are ideal for  those new to pinball  and  maybe even to  the younger  aged 5 to 9 year old player.\n\n\nI will be writing separate reviews for  the other two sets (Hot Pinball and Soccer Pinball Thrills), but they will  not be very different from this one  as they use the same basic targets, the same ramps, the same  bumpers etc. The main difference is the art work and slight changes to the look of the tables.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435443345, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435966907, "recommendationid": "16749037", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539145", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444884024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 139, "steamid": "76561198040828171", "num_games_owned": 58}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": "2", "review": "This game, in a word, is Horriable.  About the only good thing that you can say about it is that it always runs; It Never crashes. Depending on how you look at it though that could be a bad thing, because then you'd be more tempted to play it.\n\nThere are six tables, all of them bad. There are no goals and the ball physics are sickeningly inferior to any other pinball game that I have played, and that is truely saying something. I play every pinball game for very every platform I own that I have been able to find.  I have imported pinball games for various systems from Austria, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and the U.K. My Android Tablet, for example, currently has 8 GB of pinball games. Fantastic Pinball Thrills is tied for worst place along with it's sister games Hot Pinball Thrills and Soccer Pinball Thrills amoung all that I have played. None of them are fantasitic, hot, or thrilling. Just bad.\n\nApart from the mind numbingly bad ball physics are the table designs. As generic as is humanly possible to achieve with no goals what so ever! Zip! Nadda! It does award you points and thus a score on each game, but whatever score you achieve is pointless, because it takes little-to-no skill to achieve. You just flail away at the flippers and hope for the best.  There are no difficulty settings but you can change the angle of the tables. On some angles you can't even see the multiplier drop chutes, not that it matters because the physics are so bad.\n\nAs my friend Manatlow has pointed out, the ball won't even enter/go up some of the ramps. Very frustrating (like every other aspect of this 'game.'\n\nNow for the sound. The music is truely irritating and the voice acting, what little there is off it, is so bad that I turn the sound way down whenever I suffer from memory loss and have forgotten how bad it truely is and start playing it again.\n\nI post all of my high scores at Highscore.com, and as of this moment I have earned over 1,500 high score trophies. Most (but not all) of my scores are for pinball games and tables. I have many friends on Steam that are my friends there. I jokingly dared one of the other pinballers there to try this game. I immediately felt guilty doing so and warned him how bad it is. He bought it anyway, then regretted it big time and asked for and got a refund. Good for him. I wish that I had done likewise, but I bought it too long ago.\n\nI told this same friend that I'd rather go the the dentist then ever play this game again. I was serious - and I need a root canal.\n\n\n*Note: I recently suffered from memory loss and started playing this game again. By the third table I had given up on it. It was making me feel ill. I did manage to beat some high scores, but it wasn't worth it.

I will say up front that if you're expecting the complexity of the Addams Family or Terminator, then you will be disappointed. As far as modelling older-style tables, this game does it well. The physics modelling is quite good, and so is the sound. Once in a while the ball takes some bizarre and speedy bounces, but so do the real machines, hehe...\n\nFor what it tries to do, and for the price (I bought all three) this really is a nifty pinball simulator.
