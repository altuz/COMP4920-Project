This together with the other two  games in the  Thrills  set ([i]not to be confused with the excellent 3-D Ultra Pinball Thrillride by Sierra Entertainment[/i]) are  the worst pinball games I've ever played.  The Steam description says:\n\n[quote]'They are the ultimate joy for fans of action packed arcade rounds. Thanks to state-of-the-art technology you\u2019ll experience a premium physics simulation. Amazingly detailed, right down to realistic reflections, this game delivers the most intense pinball experience.'[/quote] \n\nWhat a load of twaddle, though  to be fair, the physics simulation is about right ([i]apart from the ball feeling sluggish at times[/i]).  There's little animation, most of the targets, of which there are  only a few on each table are  mainly boring and static.  You'd be much better investing in Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX. Both of those games   have a free table. Just watch the video on  the Steam shop page for Hot Pinball Thrills and compare it to  the  ones I mention above. \n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/373810/\n\n\nBasically  all thee tables are   similar, with little of interest  in  any one of them.  Apart from  what I've already mentioned above,  you can't control the initial ball strength, there appears to be no  additional features or hidden  puzzles,  the ramps, rails and switches are  similar throughout not only this set, but  the whole series of 12 tables ([i]from 3 games[/i]).   There are no or little in the way of  lighting effects around the  targets, The graphics are not  what you'd expect from a game created in 2015. This series of tables is  a turn off for me and I very much doubt I'll ever play it again.  I cannot recommend this game, even to pinball aficionado's.  If you are determined to buy the game   I'd seriously   wait till its on sale before you waste your money.   I'm sure it will be on sale  soon, once  the  negative reviews stack up, and sales dry up.   \n\nI don't like knocking games because I think the work that goes into them is intense, with  many working hours  going into the creation of even the simplest of games; unfortunately for me this game ([i]and the others in the series[/i]), were a real disappointment.\n\n\nI will be writing separate reviews for the other two sets in the series, but they will  not be very different from this one  as they use the same basic targets, the same ramps, the same  bumpers etc. The main difference is the art work and slight changes to the look of the tables.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435586209, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435601551, "recommendationid": "16780080", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576447", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456834693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 34, "steamid": "76561198002890169", "num_games_owned": 333}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Middle-of-the-road budget pinball game, part of a series which also includes football- and fantasy-themed sets. The problem is not so much that it offers three tables - that's already more than the likes of Worms Pinball offer - but that the tables on offer are really not very good. Hitting ramps - the most basic thrill of a game of pinball - is so rare as to be a happening, and most of the rest of the time, the ball just flounces around not hitting a whole lot of stuff. The physics don't help matters, as the ball and flippers feel heavy and wooden, rather than smooth, as should be the case in a computerised pinball simulation. \n\nThe rest of the game is equally as unremarkable - the soundtrack is limited to a single, Z-tier Playboy Channel soundalike, while table graphics revolve around the sort of imagery no one over the age of 15 will really be enticed by. What a mature gamer is left with is an extremely pedestrian, if competent, pinball simulation - good to kill 10 minutes, but instantly discardable the minute something better is available. Much like Playboy magazine itself, actually... \n\nNot a hearty disrecommendation, but a thumbs-down nonetheless. If you're after a solid, budget pinball title, seek out Dream Pinball 3D instead.\n\nBest table: Car Wash\nWorst table: Moulin Rouge (good luck getting more than 2.5 million or so on that one, even if you're a veteran PC pinball player!)\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456835611, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456835611, "recommendationid": "21563453", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536142", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482707771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561197995230411", "num_games_owned": 5023}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Like the other two pinball thrills releases, this is a PROPER release for the PC.\n\nResolution Options?

I am fairly confident the developers of this game had a beer in one hand and rhyming dictionary in the other as this table has the most pathetic design I have EVER seen in a table. Girls voices tell you \"I love you\" when the ball is lost (quite regularly I may add) and honestly just like the other tables they are misogynistic in design.\n\nMoulin Rouge - Likewise a very poorly designed table, and game play, has the same music as the other machines, no creativity to me really (kinda feel sorry for the artist as he did the best he could I feel witht he material he was working with). As many of my pinball compatriots can tell you, just steer clear of this \"Hot mess\" (feels cheapened saying somethign that cheesy whil trying to write a serious review of this flaming bag of poo).\n\nBeach - Ugh........lets just leave it at that....oh look a lighthouse........is that another mysoginistic reference to the male anatomy again?1?!?
