This is a PROPER release for the PC.\n\nResolution Options?         Check\nController Options?     Check\n\nThe game has a user friendly UI and plenty of user defined graphic options that the average Steam PC user has come to expect and will appreciate their inclusion here.\n\nThe camera options are more than sufficient and the game runs without any lag or choppiness.\n\nYou get 3 tables which are ALL original designs and eachl utilizes the SOCCER motif. These tables are NOT rules-deep and play more as a fine time waster than anything else.\n\nThe physics. Imagine Peggle meets VP8 and/or Original FP and you will know this isn't a SERIOUS pinball sim but rather an ARCADE rendention. The ball is very LIVELY, and the one element that suprised me, is that the simulation is CONSISTENT, so you can get dialed in and actually have a FUN and CHALLENGING game of pinball.\n\nThis is worth the normal price of $3.99, and if you find it onsale, GRAB IT, you could do a lot worse.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1482606301, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1482606301, "recommendationid": "28606232", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512702", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481255566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 42, "steamid": "76561198031587838", "num_games_owned": 1300}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Got during the Autumn sale for under $1 and it was a lot better than expected, recommended!\n\n6 camera choices, 3 tables, will play again.\n\nFull screen only and no seen plunger if you care about that.\n\nI played this with Windows 10 at native 1920 by 1080, no problems.\n\nYou can turn off the music, which I did, some graphics options, and the ball noise is optional.\n\nIt's a fair pinball game, not up to the quality of more expensive ones, but worth their price, sure.\n\nNot realistic pinball style, if that is what you are looking for, see Pinball Arcade and Zacarria Pinball.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448687082, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1472576104, "recommendationid": "19326016", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503762", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499264809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198115068638", "num_games_owned": 88}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game is not so lame, but is really limited and gets really boring after 10 minutes of gameplay.
