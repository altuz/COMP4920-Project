The screen flickers terribly on normal settings and in every variety of compatibility modes I could try.  The game does not flicker in windowed mode, but you'll find if you go windowed that the play area is tiny if you have a high-res monitor.  In my case, in order to play the game I had to switch to windows and change my 4k res to half that in order to get the game big enough to see and play.  It's irritating, but it did the trick to let me play without the screen flicker.\n\nThe game itself is standard HO game fare with a combination of HO scenes and minigame puzzles along with the usual inventory-based puzzles to complete.  This is a formula that has worked over and over again with this genre of games, but for some reason this game didn't make it work.  I found myself intensely bored after a short time, and only my personal obsession with never leaving a game unfinished made me complete it.\n\nWhether it was just lack of a compelling story, nonintuitive puzzles (I was completely at a loss a lot of the time), less-than-helpful hint system, sloppy map system, or a combination of all of these things, I really did not enjoy anything about this game.  Even the HO scenes were irritating (example: find a jar.  No, not that jar.  Not that jar either.  There were some scenes that had a good five items in the scene that matched the one you were actually supposed to click.)\n\nSo in the end, it's not actually the worst HO game out there, and if you can deal with the compatibility issues you might find it more interesting than I did.  However, if you do decide to try it, I would recommend getting it on sale.  But I would recommend going through most of the other HO offerings on Steam first as there are many better.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453584103, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1453584103, "recommendationid": "20710702", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516034", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1473106803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 247, "steamid": "76561197994587525", "num_games_owned": 1213}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The hidden-object scenes were pretty nice, with the extra difficulty of items switching between several shapes. I also enjoyed most of the mini games - once I'd checked a strategy guide for what exactly it was I was supposed to do in it. \n\nWhich brings me to my next, and fatal, point: The adventure is kind of illogical; it's hard to understand what do do next.  I don't like having to rely on the hint button just to understand where to go next.\n\nI also had to quit the game and start it again once because a room didn't unlock when it was supposed to.

(For me, that's like saying I'm not sure I'm going to finish a book; it's almost sacrilegious.)  It is a cool looking game, but I'm spending as much time b*tching at it as I am playing it.  The HOGs are having some issues such as: not recognizing the correct item (try clicking several times and around the item), bad naming (\"clutch\" is apparently a C-clamp), and multiples of a named item in a scene, but only one is correct.  Some of the puzzles so far are intuitive.  Some, I have no idea WTH I'm suppsed to do.  NO instructions on the puzzles, even in Casual mode with tutorials open (because I thought maybe I missed something).  I really dislike having to look at a strategy guide, not to SOLVE a puzzle, but just to figure out what you are supposed to do.  Also, the having an appropriate tool in your inventory that will work, but it's not the \"right\" tool, is irritating.  So, I will put it aside for now and play something else.
