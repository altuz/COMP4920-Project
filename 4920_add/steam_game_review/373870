I might have enjoyed it more if I was under 7 but I'm decades past that so I found it a bit childish. Quite a long game with a reasonable amount of HOGs but I was constantly wishing it was over. When I finally trudged to the end I was awared with an extra level... and more trudging. The art work was only just passable and the HOGs were reasonably challenging. The hints were required at times and were accurate and relatively quick to recharge.\nI would give it a neutral recommendation if I could as it is too childish but it is a long game so I give it a thumbs up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434263112, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434263112, "recommendationid": "16378861", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515596", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454189271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 344, "playtime_forever": 232, "steamid": "76561197970078168", "num_games_owned": 844}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "There is nothing bad in this game but, nothing exciting  neither.\nJust for fans of any hidden-object game.\nStory line is boring typical and doesn't glue very well the different scenarios.\nGraphics are ok.
