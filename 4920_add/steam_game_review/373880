Largest complaints:  Weapons/tools wear FAR, FAR too quickly.   Animals are quite happy to approach your fire... which should not be the case.\n\nI respawned with my view turned 90 degrees (like I was laying down).\n\nI see no use for the tent.  I was hoping that health would restore faster, but I don't think it does.\n\nI've not seen past the first age, and as with my last spawn the loot bag with my inventory didn't appear, I lost everything.  What a terrible drag that is.\n\nStill a red thumb.\n[finish edit]\n\n\nThe price of $12.99 is too high for the game in its current state, but for early access it shows promise.  If this were a $6 early access game, I would have given it a thumbs up.  There are FAR, FAR better games, in playable states, for less.\n\nThe game has two modes, standard and advanced.  I don't know anything about the advanced mode, but have written the developer to ask.  All comments relate to the standard mode.\n\n\nFirst, the good -\n\nThe crafting system is straight forward. Took a few minutes to figure it out. I like the crafting mode where a template can be placed (for a shelter, for example), and you can add materials over time to finish it.  That's a great game mechanic that I've appreciated in other games, and I'm glad to see it here.\n\nThe environment looks pretty good.  Day nitght cycles, rain...   I saw only forrest... but I assume there are other biomes out there.\n\nAn arrow points toward your spawn point... so you can't get lost (given the lack of terrain features... it would be easy to get lost without it)\n\n\n\nThe not-so-good -\n\n- First... animals should not approach the camp when a fire is burning.\n\n- Tool/weapon wear needs significant tuning.\nClubs should almost never wear... wood or stone.  It's silly to craft five clubs just to be sure you have enough when you go hunting.   The spears should wear... but not nearly as fast as they do.  I'd say *at least* twice as long.\n\n- I never saw any fruit or other forms of food besides wild boar.  Bears and wolves seem to only give hide.  (I did see an elk, but did not have a kill).  Forraging sure is needed.\n\n- I built a Tee-Pee, but it vanished after I returned from a hunt.  The rains had started... did it melt in the rain or something?  That shouldn't happen.\n\n- The spear should be useable in water to catch fish... but currently no weapons can be used, even if you only wade into the water.\n\n- Loot bags seem to simply disappear on their own...  so there appears to be no way in the game to safely store the things you collect... pretty frustrating.\n\n- Hunger sets in too fast given the scarcity of food.  If forage was available this might not be an issue.\n\n- I lost my current game by starting an advanced game... and there are no \"save game\" provisions.  It seems to save your current game, and nothing more.  There should at least be saves for the advanced and standard games, so that you don't lose one when trying another.\n\n\nNothing wrong with the game that can't easily be fixed.
