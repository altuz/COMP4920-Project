Able remember a day when a game was not judged by the size of its empty sandbox *cough*phantom pain*cough*\n2. Accept that the game is linear and meant to tell a specific story. This is effectively an interactive memoir.\n3. Love 40K. This game is spot on with the architechure and attitudes for most of the characters.\n4. This isn't mass effect, the witcher, batman arkham, or dark souls. If you compare small studio games to the triple A's you will constanly be let down.\n\nAll that said, if you aren't a fan of the Warhammer 40k or maybe even Mark Strong, I do not recomend the game. The gameplay is rough, the graphics sub par, and due to it being based on the first part of trilogy one could feel let down in the end. Make no mistake, this game was made for the fans who are drawn forward by the lore. But even for fans, buy it on sale. Its pretty short and flawed mechanically. \n\nAnd pray to the Emperor that they finish the trilogy with some lessons learned.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501752698, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501752698, "recommendationid": "33988623", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526361", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503149913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 438, "steamid": "76561198014435327", "num_games_owned": 4240}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I can't recommend this unless you're big time into WH40k, really want a game in that universe that's not another strategy, are really forgiving, and happen to be lucky so that you can even finish the game. I'm not the last one.\n\nI'll start with the good things.\nThe story is quite intriguing, as far as warhams go. Character and environment design is nice. The main character's voice actor sounds ok (but only when speaking in his inner voice, or narrating. Sounds bad when in a dialogue). Graphics are not the worst, and the game runs very nice - mine wouldn't get below 120fps. (That is, until I had to engage the 30fps lock in the settings to avoid game-ending bugs).\nThere are stealth parts, and you can also solve many scenes using stealth, and even as someone usually bad at stealth and not really liking it that much, this was quite fun. It was often the easiest way to dispatch a gaggle of enemies - you just need a box to hide behind, and then just use your psychic ability to lure enemies one by one to your trap.\n\nNow for the not so great things.\nCombat: Not terribly difficult, but it just doesn't feel good in any way. Could be worse I guess. But they managed to make chainsword finishers boring - there is some blood spurting here and there, but it doesn't come anywhere close to Space Marine's fun brutality.\nVoice acting: By the Emperor, this was horrible. Besides the main character being mostly good, there may have been couple that were okay enough to pass, but the rest was just a mess. People talking to each other with completely inappropriate tones, people who sounded like they were on a Skype call, and some that I presume must've been intentionally bad because I can't imagine that being serious.\n\nStill, I kept playing. I encountered a bug here and there that had me replay from the last checkpoint and ocassionally turn 30fps lock from the settings (you can do it on the fly, that's good) until I reached a point where I simply cannot go on. Nothing that would've worked on previous bugs works there. Couple more folks on the forums having the same problem, with no answers. And it's several combat parts from a checkpoint so I lack the willpower to try for ~11th time. \n\nSo, a low budget game through and through, with some nice aspects, and we need more action/adventure warhams.

If your ok with a barely competent Arkham light than you'll manage well but dont expect a great deal.\n\nNarrative wise it is great as to be expected with it being based on the highly successful novel \"Xenos\" by Dan Abnett and this shows with the best bits of writing being pulled directly from it. This isnt to say the rest is bad, but they are leagues apart in quality.\n\nVoice acting its a bit hit and miss with some characters being voiced extremly well, e.g Eisenhorn, Voke, Bequin and others being rather poor imo such as Lores and Fishig. The main issue with the VA is the entire lack of lip syncing This could be fixed by locking it at 30fps but i havent tested that and honestly, no. shouldnt have to lock and unlock after every section of narrative.\n\nSound design. Poor feels underdeveloped, several sections where sounds feel missing entirely.\n\nAnimation. Model animations are poor. main culprit are necks. heads dont turn the way they do hear very twitchy ive noticed.\n\nAI. Rather dumb can lead many to same area one by one with no trouble in stealth.\n\nTo conclude. if you dont want to read the book and want to obtain the story or just enjoy the book and want to experience it in a different format great, but as a game on its own it isnt good. this product is held up entirely by the great writing of the original book, writing which i feel is not done justice by the game development shown here.\n\nHowever i still feel that while the transition is sub par it is still an enjoyable experience therefore my descision to recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500974924, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500974924, "recommendationid": "33782806", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501946011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 722, "steamid": "76561198007390695", "num_games_owned": 63}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I think most of the negative reviews that this game has received come from a misunderstanding of its nature.
