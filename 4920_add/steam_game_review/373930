What was once a great series of world war 2 strategy games is now an arcade style watered down version of previous games.  The campaign feels weak like it was just a box the dev's had to check off before releasing. The maps are really small compared to previous games and with small amount of units as well. I definitely got the feel this game was made for quick online pvp battles.  So I guess if your into that type of game than you'll prolly like this.

I have played through the whole german campaign, and it was great.  I hope they come out with more missions or open the game up to mods.  I'm not knowledgeable enough to say for sure but it looks like the game advertises \"full mod support\" but only offers a scanty definition of what it could be.  Games like this can last for years with proper community support, just look at supreme commander, total annihilation, etc.  \n\nThe graphics are good and run well on my laptop, which is a Lenovo Y510P.  I wish you could zoom out a little more on the map, but keeping you zoomed in does help with immersion which is probably why they did it.  Some of the buttons were annoying, like putting the \"all exit vehicle\" button next to \"reverse pathfining.\"  The reverse option is probably the most used command as well as \"open hatch.\"  The view distance needs to be tweaked, the tanks need more realistic view distance, and they should be more durable.  \n\nThis game is essentially tank battles, so the tanks should be tougher.  I dont see why they couldn't have signifcantly more units and/or more durable units.  The game forces you to play it a certain way, scouting with infantry.  Better would be a \"binocular\" option where the tank commander can look further in a specific narrow distance to call targets.  \n\nIt was super frustrating to loose all your infantry and then your tanks are sitting ducks that can't see squat.  I would also like the ability to drive through buildings, over infantry (to kill them)  The pathfinding was frustrating at times, for example a blown up building that is only foundation presents an entirely impassible force field to a tank.  Very silly.  Once a unit is spotted it should remain out of the fog of war, so you can target it.  Similar to first person shooters like metal gear where once you mark an enemy he remains visible.  Maybe not mobile units like tanks or men, but definitely emplacements.  Scout planes should indicate last seen positions as well.  \n\nThe most frustrating thing about this game was the fog of war.  Fixing that combined with more durable tanks would go a long way in making this game amazing.  Still, it is great fun and reminds me of the old sudden strike games.  Ultimately, even when a game like this frustrates you, it adds to the joy of finally completing a hard mission.
