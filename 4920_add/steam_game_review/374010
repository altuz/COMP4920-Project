The less fooling around you do the best score you achieve. Once you have enough evidence you go to the judge and present your case. That's pretty much it. There's nothing else.\n\nThe game is short and with little replay value, other than get a better score. No bugs or crashes. Works fine on win 7.\n\nThis stuff is so vintage that is really funny. Also is entertaining. I recommend it for casual gamers and Sherlock Holmes fans.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504797940, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504797940, "recommendationid": "34796483", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 18, "total_reviews": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
