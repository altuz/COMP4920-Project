This game has a very good classic soundtrack. The graphics and atmosphere is also alright. Not a lot of interaction. I would call it more some sort of short movie game. However the story is confusing and did not really captivate me. I had problems to identify with the main character too. Overall the game is very short, maybe 2 hours first playthrough. Not a lot to see.\n\nI liked the atmosphere and the music, so I am fine by recommending it on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504737621, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504737621, "recommendationid": "34784414", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526988", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506127677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 233, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 337, "steamid": "76561197992906798", "num_games_owned": 9774}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "While the story may be interesting (though confusing), the constant head bobbing is almost unbearable. \n\nI strongly recommend against buying this game if you are prone to motion sickness.

That might sound boring, but believe me, it's not.\n\nThere are so many little memorable moments I could go into, but I don't want to because they're all something you should experience for yourself.\n\nThe way the game cuts like a movie is amazing. It's absurdly well done and it seems like everything in the game was designed to contribute to that cinematic feeling. That includes the score - it's a perfect accompaniment to the action.\n\nMy only realy complaint is that there is really no agency at all. You can explore and delay moving forward to some extent, but there aren't any real choices. I think the game would've been more compelling if there were.\n\nVirginia is an experiment in narrative game storytelling.

I'd say that this is an experience. A journey. A movie. An emotion. A feeling.\nVirginia.. It's like watching Twin Peaks and X-Files at the same time. There are so much stuff that will be familiar. Locations, details, situations. But most of all - a narration. I had a feeling that I'm in a story written by Lynch from the start.\nThere are 2 main stories here, one deeper than other. And much more things between the lines.\nChange of scenes and chapters is brilliant. Soundtrack is a 50% of game's experience.\nVirginia is a handmade gem.\nI've finished the game twice. And want more. I'm impressed.\n\nP.S. Variable State.. No, guys, you haven't made a strange, but interesting game, no. You've made a masterpiece. Please, don't stop. This game has a soul.

It barely qualifies as interactive. It's trying to be a movie. The problem is that it makes for a terrible movie. The environments look good, but the animations are pretty clunky and lifeless. There's no dialogue only awkward looks between stiff characters while classical music plays in the background to try and simulate drama. Any time there's information that might finally give you some some context to what is going on in the form of say an FBI file there's going to be a smash cut to you staring out the passenger window of a car when you're a paragraph in.\n\nConstantly shuffling the player through empty environments and forcing narrative contrivances isn't mysterious or artsy.
