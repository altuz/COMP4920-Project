There were plenty of issues, but those are to be expected in an EA game. So I tolerated them, waiting for the developers to work out the bugs and add missing features.\nNow, however, that they've gone into full release... I can no longer show any leniency with it. And seeing the positive reception, I feel the need to make my thoughts on the game known.\n\nBehind each game, there is a motivation. A thought that caused it to form. Sometimes it's \"I want to make people think\", sometimes it's \"I want people to get together and have fun\", sometimes it's the infinitely less desirable \"I want to make money.\"\nFor this game... It's pretty obvious that the thought was \"I want to make something pretty.\" The game does look nice. Pretty bland and kind of mobile-y if you ask me, but artstyle is a much more subjective issue. The real problem is that the people behind the game strike me as graphics designers, not game developers. Because while the game looks nice, it is littered with beginner mistakes gameplay-wise. Allow me to list a few.\n\n- The game is an INSANE grindfest. Resources are divided into tiers (portal blocks, ores, gems, etc. all follow this model), like copper to iron to gold as you might be used to if you play any game like this. But here's the catch... Each tier requires more resources. You need more ore to craft a bar, more bars to craft certain items, more portal shards to craft a portal block, and so on. This means that each new tier requires you to spend more time grinding and effectively makes them feel gradually less valuable. You only need to spend a little time gathering copper, but gathering titanium takes forever. And if you play with friends, don't expect to stop whacking those ores with your pickaxe any time soon.\n\n- Random crashing. Sometimes, for no apparent reason (only when playing online as far as I have experienced), your character glitches out entirely after which the game shuts down, sometimes with permanent in-game effects like a loss of money. I remember seeing other varieties of crashing, but that's the only one I distinctly recall. What's worse, sometimes after crashing the game won't even start and you have to reinstall it. This is not acceptable for a \"full release\".\n\n- Unbalanced classes. The ranger is garbage. Objectively. The mage gets spells, the warrior gets \"shouts\" that are really just \"warrior spells\", and the ranger gets... what? In a similar sense, its equipment appears to be worse, it overall underperforms when put next to a warrior or mage, and perhaps worst of all... resin. Because the game wasn't grindy enough. At one point in development, the terrible decision to add resin to the game happened. And now, rangers need to run around chopping down a ton of trees in order to craft most of their equipment. Meanwhile, the equipment of both warriors and mages requires much easier-to-get resources for the most part. Still requires excessive grinding at higher levels though.\n\n- Awful GUI. Look at something like Minecraft. How smooth its inventory management is thanks to a handful of easy-to-use options. Now look at Portal Knights. Its inventory management is terrible. For the longest time there was no way of separating a stack of items, and the best they've done at this point is add a \"split stack\" option. That's not enough. What if you just want a single item from a stack? You'll have to split it over and over. Why not do it almost exactly like Minecraft? Well, one reason is that right-clicking a stack in this game brings up a menu of options. However I'd argue this menu isn't necessary. It has options like \"drop\", which already has a special slot for you to put items in. And even if they wanna keep the menu, at least add more useful options. Like the ability to type in the number of items you want to withdraw from the stack. Also, your inventory as well as storages are WAY TOO SMALL for the abundance of items in the game. Prepare to make a ton of chests. And forget where things are constantly.\n\n- A painful lack of variety. The game consists of you moving from island to island, biome to biome, collecting what you need to upgrade your equipment and move on to the next island. However the islands are not distinct enough to make this worth it. The most prevalent reason for this is the enemies. There's only a handful of them, as well as biome-specific varieties. After a handful of islands, you'll barely ever encounter another brand new enemy save for the three bosses. Only cheap reskins with different elements and maaaybe a slightly different attack. And since the game relies so heavily on this exploration, this \"journey\", this gets monotone very quickly. If there were more side activities, perhaps some that tied into each biome to make them more worthwhile, then this might be more forgivable. As is, the worst part of every new save is having to unlock all the islands. Which is a problem, because it's the main goal of the game.\n\n- Mediocre combat at best. Click a lot. Click nearby if you're a warrior, click far away otherwise. Step to the side when the enemies do their thing, maybe sometimes step backwards or run around a little. That is basically all there is to the combat. Save for the bosses, however they instead all rely on the same tactic. Do a thing, and attack them while they're stunned. For the first and third boss, the thing is to attack something other than the boss. For the second boss, the thing is attacking it in a slightly different yet obvious way that makes it extremely easy.\nThis level of combat might be acceptable in a game not focused on combat, but well... this one is. And I think the biggest problem isn't what I described here, but the fact that enemies have a huge amount of health, even if your level and equipment is appropriate for the area. The chore of having to wait for each one to die only adds to the grindy feeling of the game. The aforementioned lack of variety also makes it worse, especially in the dungeons which circulate between only a handful of enemies. Of course, another big issue is something that I felt the need to make its own point...\n\n- Plain stupid enemy abilities. This is one of the more evident signs of the developers' lack of understanding of video games. Let's start with blocking. Some enemies have the ability to block. When they do this, they become invulnerable to all attacks. The problem? They randomly do this for several seconds. Which means that once they do it, you just have to stand and wait for them to stop. Blocking should be something very brief, when an attack is expected. The way it's done in this game, it only disrupts the flow of the fight. A more extreme example is the Kupongo enemy (renamed \"Alp-Utan\" for some inexplicable reason, even though I personally like \"Kupongo\" way more), which at half health freeze themselves in ice and become invulnerable in the same fashion, for waaay too long. It's a pointless, annoying mechanic that only makes combat even worse.\nI think the worst offender however is probably the Fallen Wizard. When these guys die, their resurrect themselves. Not once, not twice, but INDEFINITELY. The only way to permanently kill them is with a weapon that deals Light damage. And here's the thing... There's no in-game indicator that this is the case, and I imagine a lot of players won't bother with Light weapons either because of roleplaying reasons or more likely because there are better alternatives.\n\nI could go on with more examples, I could elaborate on the intolerable lack of swimming in water, other balancing issues, the pointless forced class-specific nature of equipment that prevent multiclassing (which was added in an update, a big mistake like the resin if you ask me), etc. but the character limit is fast approaching... So in summary... This game in no way qualifies for a full release, and I get the impression that the creators have no idea what they're doing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504777441, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504777963, "recommendationid": "34791219", "language": "english", "votes_down": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594548", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507122904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1118, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3249, "steamid": "76561198041100695", "num_games_owned": 279}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I was really into this game back on early access and it showed great promise.\n\nNow it's very dissapointing:\n\n> Combat is dull, boring and repetative, you would just spam attacks and dodge and thats about it. \n The boss fights lack variety as well, it's been dumbed down to wait for boss to attack, dodge and evade everything, hit something to stun the boss and repeat. Talents have no consistent build to increase one aspect of play style. \n\n> The game has become a class only equipment (unlike when it was on Early Access) where you are limited to the equipment for your class. Sometimes the equipment is absolutely useless and has no variety, this applies to armor as well.\n\n> Random Crashes that can reset progress far back (The \"All You Can Mine\" Event, I mined about 200+ Gold and 75+ Titanium and around 3K xp only for the game to freeze and crash, launching the game again my inventory and stats were rolled back to before I did the event and the event no longer available) <This is also the basis of why I am typing this review>\n\n> Lack of variety for events, there are a good number of events that appear after a number of hours but most of the time its either 1) Kill X number of enemies or 2) find the hidden treasure\n\n> The game has become as grindy as an MMO where it becomes painstakingly taking to build better equipment and to level up\n\n> The GUI is horrid. Managing inventory to the crafting is difficult and very clunky. (Having one entire menu for a storage space and one for the backpack and not being able to see both at the same time makes storage meticiolous and annoying) <There is a send to chest option via right-clicking an item> Sending an item directly makes the item take a empty slot even though the same item already exists in the storage\n\n> Exploration has no reward or merit. The main idea of the game is to go through world after world fighting monsters, collecting resources and sometimes the dungeons. But worlds or places lose value as you aim just to find the portal and move on. There is no reason to stay in the forntier (current level) worlds or the previous ones because there is nothing there, its just a blank canvas with a slightly different resources depending on the climate and level. The added NPCs are just static quest gives or merchants that do nothing important to affect the game.\n\nI will aim to get this to 100% achivements and forget about this game and move on.

The mage class besides having the lowest armor in the game what i hate about this class the most is at the begining you start with a fire element wand and the monsters are not a nature element but usually they are the element that counters the fire which is water and later on its the same thing so i dont want to do less damage and die alot because of the low armor and bad attacks so in order to do damage instead of assigning all of the attribiute points to hp you have to assign them all to do more damge and you will die after 1 shot.\n2.The warrior class is a class based on survival so you pretty much never die (you still die alot if you dont dodge form attacks) the warrior does alot of damage which i enjoy of it also the armor looks soooooo damn good but spell damage ressistance +2% in most of his midgame armor isnt something that worth it unless there is more things like crit damage and chance or even a perk. he has some nice perks that are good at multiplayer like the commander perk(+15% damage to you and every ally nearby 5 meters) i think warrior is a good class if you want to die less and if you are playing multiplayer.\n3. The ranger class. The ranger class was always my fav class in everygame and i dont know why but i can only play with a ranger otherwise i suck. The ranger's armor looks so great and the class is about critical strikes and if you land a critical strike that has also multistrike well you pretty much 1 shot everything i almost never die with the ranger just because he is attacking from far far away but i did a mistake but i made the potion of void so i reset my attribiute points  i gave 15 points to hp and it helped me alot and the rest i dumped into attack and 10-15 to speed his armor in mid game is broken and ithink this class is a murderer! i suggest you start playing with a ranger calss but if you are in a multiplayer then i suggest a warrior + a ranger because while the ranger does most of the damage the warrior can give him the 15% bonus damage with his commander perk and damn ranger is broken!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506183524, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506183659, "recommendationid": "35157734", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500658", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506735788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2510, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2510, "steamid": "76561198301993956", "num_games_owned": 34}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Portal Knights is an amazing game.
