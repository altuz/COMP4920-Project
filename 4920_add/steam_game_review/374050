By that I mean the game is too static and you don't feel or see exploisons of the enemy or damage to your ship in a way that was immediately apparent to me. Enemy ships fire tiny shots at you (for the most part) and your only indication of being hit is seeing your shield or armor meter at the top of the screen decrease. There is no obvious impact sound or jarring of the screen or klaxons to indicate \"Wham! We've been hit!\" That really broke immersion for me.\n\nIt all feels very impersonal, like you are controlling something far away. Furthermore, the game feels incredibly artificial and gimmicky in that enemy fighters are only effectively harmed by one type of gun, cruisers by another, and battleships by another. It is quite chivalric for the enemy ships to remain in specific quadrants dependent on their ship class and dutifully do predictable damage over time while you crunch the numbers to determine the most efficient deployment of turrets and fighers to defeat them within a given time frame. \n\nThe numbers and mechanics behind the game are far too transparent and it feels very gamey and like a pretty spreadsheet more than actually being a weapons officer on a super advanced human warship fighting against all odds to prevent the genocide of the human race. \n\nThe ship doesn't feel like a ship full of people, it is a stationary blob that magically cranks out turrets and drones. It just all felt very flat and prosaic.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468988677, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468988677, "recommendationid": "24419477", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521483", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468538027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 57, "steamid": "76561197987664319", "num_games_owned": 438}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty cool tower defense game.

Different weapons can reach into different ranges, and have different firing rate and damage ratings. There are even defensive weapons to shoot down enemy torpedoes/shots. Upgrading the ship adds turret mounts (up to 8 per each of the cardinal directions NSEW) as well as shield and armor.  There are even \"coordinated fire\" bonus when you place identical turrets next to each other.  And obviously each turret can be upgraded. There's also super-tech and fighters. Supertech are limited duration for like double salvage, shield shot (sacrifice shield for super-shotgun damage for all enemies in that direction), armor recharge, and shield recharge. The fighters comes in 3 types: bombers (got after capital ships), fighters (after enemy fighters and gunships), and defense interceptors (goes after torpedoes). Deploying the right thing at the right time and upgrading is just as important here as in any other tower defense game. There are even more advanced tech later, like decoy, defense satellite, and more. \n\nWith multiple levels of difficulty, star ratings per mission, and even arcade/gauntlet mode, there is a lot of game in this package, with excellent graphics.

The main drawback to the game is the arbitray limitations of each weapon systems` firing ranges - there are four engagement ranges, and each weapon engages only at one specific range. No matter the nature of the projectile or beam, get too close or too far and your weapon will not shoot at the enemy. Maximum ranges in space games are reasonable, but such mechanics here seem regrettable. Wrapping one`s design head around more conventional treatments of engagement ranges would have made/would make Infinium Strike much better. Also, often you are without play recourse in the face of incoming attacks - that is, you feel removed from play against whatever is coming at you. You set up your turrets, upgrade them, launch fighters, and yet still feel as though you`re missing something as each enemy attack blasts your hull. Infinium Strike is still fun for what it is, and its a nice exploration of a customized (static!) capital ship action game.

This is basically it, and it feels good, though you are stationary.\n\nSimple concept: Aliens want to kill you. Build towers and send out drones to stop them from doing that. \n\nAdvanced concepts: Four quadrants of attack, three ranges (close, medium, far) for each. Plenty of differences between the enemies that show up. Defense against projectiles thrown at you, vice just preventing enemies from getting to you. Basically, killing things before they get to their optimal zones to engage your ship.\n\nThere are some things that are rehashed from other types of the typical Tower Defense game: Fast but low damage turret, Slow but High Damage turret, and Deuce Medium turret. However, along with the speed and damage of each turret, you also need to worry about the ranges in which they can defend your ship. A lot of the rapid turrets do you no good if the enemy battleships are sniping you from afar. \n\nAlso, the ways in which the aliens engage can change in the middle of missions, which forces you to be quick about how you set up defenses. Combine that with the fact that you're defending four different quadrants of combat, and you have a concept that makes you multi-task well, keeping up with projectiles coming in, switching between different zones, upgrading turrets, sending out drones, and activating the special ship abilities in a timely manner. \n\nIt's pretty awesome, but there are a few nitpicks about it, such as the inability to skip the AI's briefing before each mission. You could skip the Captain's Logs, but they sound pretty decent, especially in later ones. The game has enough of a story to justify its setting and its mechanics, which is something I haven't really seen in the Tower Defense genre. It's like they actually cared about it, and put a bit of effort into it. Not too shabby. \n\nThere's at least one issue: sometimes when trying to exit the game, there's a weird UI overlap issue that makes me also click on a mission, when I'm clicking to, well, \"Exit Game\". Shouldn't do that, but, I'm willing to overlook it. \n\nI'm not sure if I missed anything in the Tutorial, but I would appreciate a way to activate ship abilities and send out drones from the Strategic View (where you can see all four quadrants at once). It would make things a little simpler, and allow for the more accurate timing of those necessary Super Salvages and Shield Boosts. Having to click out of Strategic View, and then click on the Ship Abilities or the Drones individually is a little bit of a pain, but nothing that supremely affects gameplay. Again, not sure if I'm unobservant, or the ability isn't there on this one. \n\nAll in all, I like it. Space-themed, Well-Twisted Tower Defense with an active and passive management of waves, good resource management, and a bit more complexity than your standard of this genre. \n\nTL;DR\n\nBattlestar Freedom Strike. More complex than initial concept.
