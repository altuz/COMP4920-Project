And in all honesty it probably could have done with picking up the pace a bit faster. So it's not a bad game, just be warned that you will need to wait for things to pick up. If your not the patient sort, then this is probably not going to be your cup of tea.\n\nWith that said, once the game does get going its actually pretty decent - with good voice acting, middle of the road puzzles and very nice visuals. Although it is build on the UDK engine so it should look damn fine, but I did get some screen tearing and the odd stutter here and there. At least the controls are mostly smooth and responsive,. apart from the occaisional catching on objects.\n\nSo overall, if you can suffer the limping start, whilst not a must play, the game is a decent enough purchase for its price range.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502138180, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502138180, "recommendationid": "34089186", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503827", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504386174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 90, "steamid": "76561197981640564", "num_games_owned": 126}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Stay away from this folks!
