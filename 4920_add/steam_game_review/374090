Seriously, they are underselling their product by calling it a trilogy.  Sure, it's a trilogy of games, but that one game \"Winter Sports\" contains 11 different games and 18 disciplines.  The other two games, biathlon and downhill skiing, are included in Winter Sports as well, but the mechanics are not as detailed as they are in the solo versions.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pWhZed2qr8\n\nThe best part here is that Winter Sports 2009.  It contains Halfpipe Snowboarding, Alpine Skiing, Ski Jumping, Speed Skating, Biathlon, Bobsleigh, Luge, Skeleton, Figure Skating and Curling.  Each one of these sports is done very well, easy to understand and play in arcade mode, but they also include competitions, career, and campaign modes.  There was so much content here that even playing 1 race in each mode took 1.5 hours.  That's substantial, I can't wait to try out some of these other modes as well!\n\nThere was only one flaw out of the whole package: in Ski Jumping 2007, it detected my secondary monitor's resolution instead of using my main monitor.  Specifically, I game on my primary 1080p display and my secondary is a 1680x1060 display so I was not able to game on my primary in true 1080p.  I'm sure if I disconnected the monitor it would have worked, maybe I could have used a config file or done some other workaround but that was the only issue I had.
