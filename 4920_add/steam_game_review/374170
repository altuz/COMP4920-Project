Not a traditional FPS as you snipe from a couple of fixed points per map (like different windows from a building for example). It claims to be like Lemmings with guns but that's not really accurate either. The hostage you're trying to protect only moves when you shoot so you really have to decide who to shoot next. It's further complicated by patrolling guards so timing is key as well. What results can be infuratingly difficult at times but extremely satisfying when you get it right. There's also equipment upgrades (sights, weapons, tripods and the like) to add a bit of grindability to it as well.\n\nIt's early access at the moment but what's there is easily worth $5 already. The Dev has been very reactive in squashing reported bugs and hopefully with more levels and more equipment as well as the challenge of trying to beat the best scores per level (online) the longevity should be more than adequate for the price being asked.

I can say \" Sniper Tactical \" has a blessed future.\n\n2/1/2016 *Message to the Developers, I have perfected  \"Sniper Tactical \" i love the work you did with this game, i have a Suggestion if it is possible can you make a addon/mod or anything like that where we can edit our own maps? I have beat the maps and levels you put , it stops on 11, i love your game and would really love to see it continue on with more non-stop action, if you can add some more maps it would be great, but then again we will beat them too. but if you put a map editor, we will have non-stop gaming action. A opinion if you do see this message, please put a option in the map editor where we can not only place the npc but also make him walk/run to other places, because a npc just standing is a too much of a easy kill.

Let's start with the basic aspects.\n\nYou are a sniper, shooting enemies from fixed positions. Most of the time, you have two vantage points to choose from during a mission, with one of them likely revealing enemy positions not visible from the other.\n\nThe shooting is relatively simple. You place the reticle over the target and press the left mouse buttons to shoot. Moving targets require leading, and the basic aim is not steady but it can be stabilized holding your breath or buying better equipment. So far, so good.\n\nBut here comes the unusual part. The primary objective is [i]not[/i] to kill foes. It's to escort or protect NPCs. They move on a fixed path divided into stages, and your shot is the GO-word for each. You need to work out the best order in which to attack the opposing force and time your shots in order for patrols not to encounter and attack your rather defenseless ward while moving (or waiting).\n\nAnd you are not invulnerable yourself as your rivals may have counter-snipers among them who attack you should they be able to pinpoint your location.\n\nSo. Protect the NPC, protect yourself, shoot targets in correct order and accurately. Accurately because depending on that you will earn more [i]coins[/i] which you need to unlock better equipment like rifles, scopes or bullet-proof vests.\n\nMind you, the game's not flawless, performance could be much better IMO. The game uses the Unity engine, like many others. Amongst those is e.g. Interstellar Marines, an FPS which runs much better on my machine despite requiring much more calculations conneted to lighting, movement and whatnot. This should become considetably better in later versions of the game.\n\nThere are also some other bugs, like enemies getting stuck, weird ragdoll behaviour and a tutorial which does not forgive being hasty...\n\nIt's nothing game-breaking, though. And considering this is early-access with bug-fixes being released regularly, I am confident this will eventually present itself in a polished state. Well worth the price already, and it *should* just get better.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454265861, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1454265861, "recommendationid": "20878630", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506599", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492223081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 103, "steamid": "76561198032568324", "num_games_owned": 24}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Tutorial takes a few tries to figure out, and the messages disappear way too fast.
