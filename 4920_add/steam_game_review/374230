The gameplay itself is very simple, but the level design becomes more challenging (naturally) as the game progresses - that, combined with the energy management aspect, adds another level thinking to completing each puzzle.\n\nI haven't played much yet, so I can't say how much more complex the game becomes, but so far it has been pretty simple; as such, I'd like if it were a bit more dynamic and challenging, but again, that may yet become the case as the challenges progress throughout each level.\n\nI made a first impressions video for my YouTube channel, check it out if you want a sample of gameplay to help you make your decision! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsPCgXT4mkE", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438965121, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438965121, "recommendationid": "17431037", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498836", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452557394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 21, "steamid": "76561198240304434", "num_games_owned": 65}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I was hoping this would be a challenging puzzle platformer but it just seems too basic.
