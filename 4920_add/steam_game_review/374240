You can't strafe so the only way around this is an item that lets you attack in an arc or luring enemies around a corner. It gets repetitive really fast.

I enjoy the action-roguelike genre, having put more hours than is healthy into Binding of Isaac, Our Darker Purpose and the like, but this entry doesn't really stack up well against either of the aforementioned. It seems unfair to say it's due to unappealing graphics, because an independant developer can only do so much and putting out anything at all is laudable. Items seem alright so far, and I've not progressed far enough to tell how much variety there is in what exists. Nor the controls; I messed them up myself thanks to wishing to use more than just the left hand while playing, so any following issues with menu navigation are a personal fault. And the soundtrack as heard so far is servicable, no better than that but certainly no worse.\n\nIt is a good game. That might be the problem though: it's only good. In today's indie market one is placed in direct competition with excellence at comparable prices. Whether an average experience is enough to satiate a player is a matter of personal taste, but I am left with deep buyer's remorse.\n\nTL/DR: 5/10.

Technically speaking, it isn't impressive. It opens in a window and goes to full screen upon reaching the main menu, has borderline no options in the settings menu and looks a few steps ahead of a flash game. \n\nYour mileage may vary, but as with games like Rouge Legacy, you are doing things for the greater good of a progression system which will then enable you to win the game, currently (8/2016) set at 100 floors. That's the point, you aren't supposed to beat it in one go. You go into a small, tight room, which is always randomly generated. After clearing it by usually killing everything in it, you earn XP and cards. The XP is for your overall level, which contributes to unlock tokens for passives such as better attack, defense, speed, etc.\n\nThe card system is interesting enough. Say you have an ax as your primary weapon with no skill attached to it. The card drops (red are rare!) vary, but perhaps you got a sword with a skill on it. You can choose to equip the sword, which will destroy your ax card. You can also steal the skill from the sword card, destroying the card, but letting your ax have the skill. Or, you continue as you are, which then stores the sword card for use on your next run. Confused? Don't be, it's harder to understand in text than in practice. If you save a bunch of sword cards, for example, you can then salvage them, and assuming you've unlocked a rare weapon card, use those parts to get it for your next run.\n\nThe bosses are tough, but fair. You can block, you can roll to dodge, and that's about it.\n\n\nAnd in the end,  when you mix all of that together, you get something that's well worth 10 dollars, in my humble opinion.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1470548516, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1470548516, "recommendationid": "24754226", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 14, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 6}}
