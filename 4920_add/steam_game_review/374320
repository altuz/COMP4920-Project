Well, game developer From Software did just this with the release of the Ringed City DLC for Dark Souls 3. To put it in retrospect, this DLC is on par with the Artorias the Abysswalker DLC from Dark Souls 1 and the Old Hunters DLC from Bloodborne. The Ringed City adds four new bosses, each one some of the best bosses in the series, some of the most beautiful areas in the souls-borne franchise, and adds some cool and unique items. Without a doubt, this final piece of Dark Souls content will push the skill of any souls player to the limit. From Software really did an amazing job wrapping up the Dark Souls franchise. \n\nNarrative \nSince this is a Souls game, there isn't much in the way of narration, other than item descriptions, NPC dialogue, and even the placements of certain things in the world. But, the main story of the DLC is that you are chasing Gael, a slave knight and uncle to the unnamed painter from the Ashes of Ariandel DLC, to get the Ringed City, which is where the Dark Soul is said to be located. However, there are many other parts of lore uncovered that reveal more of the overall Dark Souls story. \n\nGameplay \nThis is a Souls game. So, if you are going into the Ringed City DLC thinking it'll be just another nice little RPG like Final Fantasy or Pok\u00e9mon, then you'd be wrong. In fact, I'd say that the DLC is actually more challenging than the base game, in terms of bosses and some enemy placements. \nBefore I begin talking about everything good, let's get out of the way some of the bad things in this DLC. Firstly, the DLC did not add any new rings. Instead, they just added +3 versions of previously existing rings. Secondly, some of the areas in the early part of the DLC, such as Earthen Peak, felt dull and unimaginative. It just felt like they wanted an excuse to shove another poison swamp area into their DLC. And thirdly, the Dragonslayer Armour waiting for you in swamp area in the Ringed City is a straight up copy and paste of the boss from the main game, which is just plain lazy. \n\nNow, on to the good aspects of the DLC. The Ringed City area itself is absolutely stunning, and it's obvious that a lot of time and effort went into creating these areas here. As you progress, you will unlock shortcuts to previous bonfires and other areas of the DLC, something From hasn't done since Dark Souls 1. The weapons and armor sets are some of the coolest in the game, for example the Ringed Knight set and all their weapons and shields. There are also many throw backs to Dark Souls 2 in this DLC, with the appearance of the Earthen Peak, Desert Pyromancer, and Ruin Knight set. And the bosses are some the best in the entire series. \n\nLet's start with the first boss you encounter in the DLC; the Demon Prince. This boss fight is an example of a good gank fight, similar to Ornstein and Smough from Dark Souls 1. The fight starts off with two demons: The Demon in Pain and the Demon from Below. Each demon has a buff and relax state. In the buff state, the demons will have fire attacks, and in their relaxed state, they use toxic attacks. Now, depending on which one you kill first, determines what type of Demon Prince you will get in phase 2. If you kill the Demon in Pain first, then you will get a Demon Prince with laser attacks. If you kill the Demon from Below first, you get a Demon Prince with fireball attacks. The second boss in the DLC is a PvP boss fight, which is where another online payer is summoned in to be the boss. This works through a covenant called Spears of the Church, which you get from killing Darkeater Midir, the optional boss in the DLC. Midir is a dragon fight, and has some of the most health in the entire series, so be ready for a long fight. Nevertheless, the fight is a good one. The final boss of the DLC, Slave Knight Gael, is probably the best boss fight in the game. He has 3 phases. In the first phase, he acts very similar to Orphan of Kos from Bloodborne, with how erratic he is in this phase. However, in phases 2 and 3, he becomes more like Arotrias from Dark Souls 1. This fight is perfect, and a great way to end Souls franchise. \n\nPerformance and Graphics \nThere isn't that much to say here. The DLC didn't improve any graphics issues because, there weren't any, really. Also, in terms of performance, there was a patch before the DLC came out to fix any performance issues or bugs with the game, so that it would be compatible with the Ringed City. \n\nAudio \nLike the rest of Dark Souls 3, and any Souls game, for that matter, in terms of music, there isn't any, unless you're fighting a boss or something. Audio is done minimally, like the rest of the Dark Souls games. \n\nFinal Thoughts \nThis DLC is absolutely amazing. Everything from the unrelenting boss fights, items, and areas, this DLC did the Dark Souls series justice as the last piece of content. This DLC will put your skills to the test with the hardest and most rewarding fights in the game, while still being fair to the player. \n\nThe DLC is not perfect, in any sense of the word, but it sure comes pretty close to it. This is what a good DLC is, and I applaud From Software for making the final piece of content really amazing. Also, since you have to have completed either the base game or Ashes of Ariandel to access it, it makes beating the DLC all the more exciting. This DLC is definitely worth it, for hardcore Souls players, and even those just starting for their first time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505000790, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505000790, "recommendationid": "34849307", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505776525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6414, "steamid": "76561198065875895", "num_games_owned": 60}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An amazing series with a variety of weapons, builds, enemies and bosses.\nYou will face NPCs and boss battles that will challenge you to think strategically and creatively.\nYou will not be held by the hand and you will have to overcome some (seemingly) insurmountable hurdles.\nWhat's not to love?", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505416696, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505416696, "recommendationid": "34955539", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505348030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 10939, "steamid": "76561198047862592", "num_games_owned": 311}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "my number one for best games i've ever played\n\ni'd highly recommend it, it may seem terrible at the start but after understanding how to play it gets even better.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505417972, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505417972, "recommendationid": "34956008", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501838", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506921149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 517, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4917, "steamid": "76561198028085714", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This entire series has ruined videogames for me forever.
