Takes a bit of time to get used to the interface, which is my least favourite of the AGeod games I played so far. If you struggle with the honestly not very deep tutorials (but how can you make a tutorial for such a deep, complicated and engrossing game) please head to the Ageod forums and you will find the best gamers community out there and very useful tips) but I had such a great time with it! Ageod games are for hardcore fans of history who want to relieve how commanders felt back then. I must admit its a steep learning curve (took me a while to understand what was going on and almost gave up) but once you get the basics, you can pretty much play every Ageod game easily. I can't stress enough how helpful is to head to Ageod forums or check amazing AARs like Narwhals and Lokis and youtube videos by Charles Cummings and Gilmer. This is one of my favourite games of all time, bit rough around the edges (something Ageod resolved from Civil War II onwards in my opinion) but never had so much fun with a game! The sort of PC game when you stay up late at night and 'just one more turn' lasts till it's way too late and you're gonna be knackered next day at work.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497830159, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497830159, "recommendationid": "32552974", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525649", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502642481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 14974, "steamid": "76561198058127281", "num_games_owned": 73}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I like it a lot - while it suffers from the problems of the AGEOD engine, mainly (avoidable but inconvenient) crashes, it's a lot of fun in single-player and PBEM, and it's the only computer game I've found that does a really good job of - at least the military aspects of - the Russian Civil War.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494679617, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494679617, "recommendationid": "31723316", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513776", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 17, "total_reviews": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 8}}
