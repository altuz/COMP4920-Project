Try that first, it is daft not to, the free version does not expire so you have plenty of time to give it a good work out. \nAny settings you make,  profiles created or or downloaded in your free version will be saved and appear in the paid or steam version whan you purchase it later. \n\nHere's the comparison chart for Free and Pro versions \nhttps://www.voicebot.net/Compare/\n\nHere's the download page \nhttps://www.voicebot.net/Download/\n\nLicense Terms:\nPro 3, Steam version license is personal or company, unlimited computers, primary user is you and Steam is installed) Lifetime license valid for all future versions.\n\nDoes it work well? \nA lot better than just using windows speech recognition macros by themselves, as it ignores anything you say which is not a proper command in the game or application voicebot is currently focussed on and it has a sensible, plain and un-fussy interface for setting things up and making new profiles.\nMicrosoft voice recognition software built into windows can be a bit mediocre with some accents, so it may take a little bit of time to \"learn\" your voice when you first use it.\n\n\nNot just for games:\nGreat with Steam Big Picture and not just for gaming either, eg Kodi Netflix Skype Spotify, Windows of course, and there are pre made profiles for all of these and plenty more which you can use out of the box or modify to suit yourself, then share with other users if you like to.\n\nexample of downloadable profiles: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=954246951\nI've used the free version a lot and it is easy to configure it for most games or applications that I have tried it with.\n\nOne very useful feature is Global Macros to provide always-on commands, like 'close window', 'volume up', 'mute', 'lock desktop' etc. Useful common Global Macros are included, or you can create your own.
