This is the same idea, solve puzzles by dragging drawn assets of things on the board. The drawn aesthetic and blank page background get bland and somewhat grating quick. You have none of the freedom that one might expect coming from a drawing/creative inspired game. For that I think you are still better off with Crayon Physics.
