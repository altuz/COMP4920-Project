You can change your role in a party by choosing different skills (purchaceable with in game gold) before an adventure.\n\nWhile the game is fun, it seems to feel slightly lacking at times: The game lacks the ability to rebind controls or even a menu explaining them (even though there arent many). No resolution menu. The variety of monsters even in the begining feels a bit scarce. Hopefully the devs will add different drops from crates as they only seem to yield 1 gold at the moment (perhaps a  droplet that gives a tiny bit of energy for singleplayer? since you cant regen energy alone). It would be nice to have different basic weapon playstyles like bow, staff, bombs...etc- that you can choose from in the begining vs just unlocks later in game. While the dungeons are a quick smooth crawl it would be nice to see chairs/scattered scraps/bookshelves to add to the environment.\n\nThat said, this game is quite fun as a multiplayer game and questria doesn't \"hold your hand\" when you run out of HP potions, so player's cooperation, skill and timing are important.\n\nIf you enjoy your gauntlet style games and don't mind a bit of a plain experience for now, add this game to your collection and surely in no time (with updates) this will become your party crawl game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447112767, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447121232, "recommendationid": "18978772", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522326", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
