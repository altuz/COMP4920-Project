This game is so far -- even only half an hour in -- is not bad.  It's similar in vein to Papers, Please in that you have a set job, a set accuracy for the day/week/whatever and you have things to study.  Only with S.O.R.S you're a doctor.  And to those of us who love watching House, you know how bad you wanted to be a doctor -- and to tell everyone they're an idiot.  The game starts off easy enough, telling you that you can diagnose \"life advice\" to patients with mental health problems and soon progresses into Diabetes and somehow you get the treatment /after/ learning how to officially diagnose people.  I can't say too much about the game other than that the plot also involves the Hospital being hacked and some hacker emailing you (yes, EMAILING. *gasp*) about not trusting anyone.\n\nI will update this review as I go through the game and possibly one day complete it.\n\n[EDIT: The medical knowledge in S.O.R.S is well done, it really is.  The reference to Papers, Please actually tickled me because as I mentioned earlier in my review, S.O.R.S and Papers, Please play very similarly.  So, onto my edit-- the hacker will fuck you up like your parents when they told you Santa wasn't real, followed by the Easter Bunny; so all the entities of yesterday will hunt your parents asses down and hack into their lives and ruin them.  The hacker will screw up the way your scanner works and even down to what's listed on your panel.  Diagnoses will be changed or missing and you have to have them memorized.  It's pretty well played and a nice concept that's furthering the plot and making me more interested.  To that, well done devs.]\n\nBut so far:\n\n+ everything is hand-drawn so it plays very nicely like a flash game from yesteryear\n+ the medical lab is kind of cool; you type in conditions you diagnose (through medically accurate explanations, I might add!++)\n+ The email system is kind of neat too -- you make your decision through a day-to-day, shift-to-shift kind of way, though the impact of said decisions are not known to me yet\n+ No voice acting!  Which is pretty nice, but reading is good too. ... and healthy.\n\n- The email system is a little wonky to navigate as old emails do not get deleted\n-/+ Scanning is sometimes a pain in the ass but you get the hang of moving the cursor around\n- Can't tell patients they're an idiot\n\nSo far: 8/8 would tell patients it's never Lupus again", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457136141, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457210447, "recommendationid": "21630348", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549207", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1457282796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 159, "steamid": "76561197972136158", "num_games_owned": 468}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty cool game.

The scanning gets tedious soon enough, slowly moving your mouse is simply boring and does not feel like a skill. Rules are not as expansive as Paper Planes' and memory is a secondary concern.\n- Story is not as good and personal as Paper Planes. Characters you meet are not engaging. However, the setting and background story is interesting and original enough.\n- Failing or the level of success (number of patients healed etc.) does not function into the gaming as it does in Paper Planes (how much money you made that day). It is simply pass or fail compared to \"ok you managed another day but you now have to be even more careful or 'you lost your son\" or you will be disadvantaged or advantaged in the next level)\n\nPros:\n- It feels like the designers cared enough to put out the best game they thought of\n- A type of game that severely lacks from the gaming world (hence I do not totally regret paying for it)\nCons:\n- The designers fell short of the premise they come up with, this game could have become much better with something like upgrading options or preferring a game mechanic of speed vs. tedious mouse movements (Note: This is not about being impatient, it is just that the slow scanning does not necessarily make you feel like a doctor or anything nor does it feel skillful)\n- Easily becomes frustrating\n- The game simply lacks depth\n- The in-game mailbox system is not user-friendly \nDisclosure: Have not fully completed the game yet, but it is not hard to estimate how much is left and where this is going", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458865859, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1458865859, "recommendationid": "22033115", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491183", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1457342014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 81, "steamid": "76561197989931539", "num_games_owned": 639}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really wanted to enjoy this game, and I certainly enjoyed Papers Please, but unfortunately I found myself getting extremely frusturated with a number of the mechanics, and it just wasn't the same as Papers Please to me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457342096, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457342096, "recommendationid": "21682422", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476789", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
