I had no real expectations that it would be anything other than a relatively casual factory/automation sim. \n\nUnfortunately it really isn\u2019t a very good game, which is a shame since it could have been something quite entertaining.  \n\nI\u2019ll summarise my thoughts as a serious of pros and cons:\n\nPros\n\u2022\tIt\u2019s fairly cheap\n\u2022\tVery easy to get up and running in the game \u2013 it\u2019s quite simple and self-explanatory.\n\nCons\n\u2022\tFar too simple and the automation side of things is very limited.  Loading things into boxes only seems to work some of the time so I still had weapons spilling out onto the floor.\n\u2022\tThe sound effects are horrendous.  I actually ended up switching off the sound after a few minutes of playing.\n\u2022\tThe controls are very clunky, having to drag and drop things that have fallen of conveyor belts one by one isn\u2019t much fun.  Would also be nice if the conveyor belts etc remembered which orientation you last had them in, although that\u2019s just personal preference really.\n\u2022\tVery, very repetitive.  Really it shows it\u2019s free to play roots and from what I can tell it\u2019s been switched over to a paid model with few changes.\n\nTLDR:\nDon\u2019t bother with this game.  If you really have an automation itch that needs scratching wait for Factorio to come on Steam (or buy it from their website now).
