IT DOES NOT WORK. GO BUY THAT BIG MAC MEAL YOU WANT FOR THE MONEY, IT WILL SATISFY YOU MORE.\n\nI've been using blender for over 4 years, I can rig and skin a mesh manually. I have been using 3D modelling software/CAD for well over 25 years - I am not a noob let's put it that way. This program will not load any OBJ files I throw at it, no matter how low poly or simplistic - not one single mesh file has loaded properly (either a black/white checker and a hung program) or it just outright crashes. \n\nWhether it's one of my meshes or one I download, from anywhere .. anything over 1mb crashes the program. Even a 300k simple human plain body mesh crashes it sometimes. \n\nBottom line - I CANNOT DO ONE THING that you see in the demo video other than open the program, which has absolutely no settings and a bare bones menu with hardly any options besides import, export and exit. \n\nI bought this program to hopefully cut down on some of my workload but no... all it has done as cost me a regular Big Mac meal combo and some lost hair.
