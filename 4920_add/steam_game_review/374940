Each unit has a maximum strength of 10, with attack capability diminished as strength is reduced.  The scale is tactical but unspecified with no unit stacking.  The combat system is odds-based with some variability in outcome, better than similar games which are entirely dice-based.  No headquarters or command-and-control implementation.  Many mini-campaigns included allowing you to play the U.S., British and Germans for many hours.  Some scenarios are tough nuts to crack.  Competent AI with three difficulty options.  High playability, low technicality.  If you like HexWar's other games, this won't disappoint.  Just beware that no multiplayer option is available.
