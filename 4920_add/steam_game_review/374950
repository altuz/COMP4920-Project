It was so simple and incompetent, such as ADventure Lib.  The game is just a linear point&click. When you start the game, names of the all entities in the game are being scrambled randomly. This is the only novelty of the game. The plot is extremely simple. Replay value is zero. Sounds are below par. Hopefully I've bought it in a bundle and it drops cards. If you want the cards, waste your money, but don't waste your time by playing it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501366848, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501366848, "recommendationid": "33891495", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500474962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1973, "playtime_forever": 219, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 4956}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Tags: Sidescroll - Adventure\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nIn a nutshell: Low audiovisual quality sidescroll quest game where you must use objects with other objects. Uses keyboard only, control scheme, UI, and interactivity all poor. Voice acting amateurish. All hotspots, interactable objects and NPCS have their names randomized making the already tedious process of solving classic adventure style puzzles all the more painful. Setting is just the most basic adventuring premisce, summoned by the king, go defeat the X, it is dangerous to go alone take this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500475125, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500475125, "recommendationid": "33652641", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 17, "total_reviews": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 25}}
