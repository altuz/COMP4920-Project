Although the description references Diablo and Borderlands it is actually a very standard (length wise) 5 levels top-down shooter with Rpg mechanics mixed in. You level up, get some loot and allocate points in skill trees with the usual critical strike, armor, shield and such stats you would find in a typical Diablo-like. So while it's not the big adventure you might expect, there is some interesting theorycrafting to be made.\n\nPros\n\nSuper smooth framerate\nGood variety of loot and stats\nWeapons feel great\nYou get a massive regenerating shield which is a relief when tons of bullets are fired your way\nControls fine with a gamepad\nPretty cool music\n\nCons\n\nThe backgrounds are really minimalist and repetitive\nSome bosses are op, some are jokes, could use some balancing\nGamepad in menus controls the mouse cursor, might as well use the mouse?\n\nAll in all I'd recommend it, just don't expect a full blown RPG but rather a small top-down shooter with Rpg mechanics.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435412155, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435412155, "recommendationid": "16740076", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516704", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435198201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 42, "steamid": "76561197996804933", "num_games_owned": 85}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 36, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Ok i usually don't spit on games i buy but this one can't stay untouched.\n\nEverything from the control to art is terrible.\n\nThe sound will make your ears bleed to death, the controls are approximative at best.\n\nI never really care about art or graphic quality but when it does hide the bullets or the enemies there's a problem.\n\nA really bad mobile game that should have stay rotting on his garbage support.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435198350, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435198350, "recommendationid": "16689257", "language": "english", "votes_down": 28, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525828", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462913847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 202, "steamid": "76561198008649172", "num_games_owned": 698}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "When I first booted this up and I saw the auto-fire kick on, I figured this shmup wouldn't keep my attention long, but I've been pleasantly surprised. Some elegant RPG progression elements needed to advanced past challenging (but not impossible shmup-like) levels has kept me coming back for more. A decent varity of common and boss enemies, weapons, shields and powers gives this little game a good amount of depth.
