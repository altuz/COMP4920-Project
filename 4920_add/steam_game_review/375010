If this sounds interesting to you, read on!\n_________________________\n\nEnergy Balance takes the standard minimalistic approach as other recent puzzle games do - light on explanations, yet simple in mechanics. The basic levels are also part of a vague story, which I found helped to break up the gameplay and give it a bit of a setting. Your spaceship is in trouble and you've got to fix all the components (engine, cloaking device, etc). \n\nLevels consist of rows and columns of numbers - all linked together. The numbers in each row and column have to add up to the value specified at the end of the line of numbers. The object of the game is to select a number in a row (or column) that doesn't tally correctly, then switch it with a number that will help bring the tally closer to what is required. While this is all you can do, there is actually a lot to it at later levels, often requiring a great deal of thinking on your part.\n\nNormal levels consist of single digits in the +8 to -8 range, but hardcore levels could possibly ask for rows/columns to tally +/-100. (Hardcore #2 was exceptionally hard for me, taking around 2 weeks before I finally got it.)\n\nVarious strategies can be employed to make number swaps work for you. A row that adds correctly, linked to a column that doesn't, may benefit from a swap of the number in the shared square with another from the row, effectively only altering the sum of numbers in the column... whereas a row out by -2 and another row out by +2 might better benefit from a direct swap from one to the other. You might find yourself more likely to be out by +1 though, and in only one spot, making swaps entirely useless. \n\nPerhaps the most fun feature I discovered is that it is impossible to go online hoping to find a solution. Why? Because every time you quit without finishing a level, the numbers will randomise into a new puzzle when you go to try again.\n\nSo when you see someone has 100% achievements for this game, you can be pretty confident they earned it.\n\nI digress though. I have mentioned normal and even hardcore levels, but while they are relatively few in number, they will take time to complete, and there are still further puzzles that are perhaps a bit less taxing and a bit more fun - a kind of reward for getting through hardcore. There is no story accompanying the hardcore or bonus puzzles, but they can still take time to complete, and fill out the game to make it worth its cost.\n\nThe accompanying puzzle music is surprisingly good - I found myself leaving it on more often than not. It has an outer-space feel to it that is enhanced by the background behind the puzzles - a moving, travelling-through-space backdrop that consists of stars passing you by, and a nebula in the distance. It is easy on the eye and doesn't detract from you trying to concentrate on your sums.\n\nIn short, it's a good game for anyone that likes puzzle games, the achievements aren't too difficult and it makes a nice break between larger games such as rpgs. It could benefit from additional puzzles, and perhaps an artwork gallery. 8/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438672234, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438672234, "recommendationid": "17378934", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538911", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441919458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 606, "steamid": "76561197971341065", "num_games_owned": 2715}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a fairly simple math puzzle game where you have to get the sums in all rows and columns to match the required values by shifting around the numbers in the grid.

The second row of puzzles can be pretty difficult and I often resorted to leaving it and coming back to get a new set of random numbers/puzzles to see if I got an easier set.\n\nGenerally the interface is limited but functional, but somewhat annoyingly it forgets if you turn the sound off the next time you play, the graphics are not great but they do the job, the storyline was forgettable, although a couple of times the cat's reaction did get a slight chuckle, and there isn't really any variety in the gameplay/puzzles.

You do this by switching numbers around on correct lines so that the crosslines start to add up; sometimes you can switch out numbers with extra spots that aren't used in any sum; and sometimes you need to carefully switch out equal pairs so that you can free up numbers you need elsewhere. The learning curve for this is ultra steep. Each level is randomly generated numbers on a pre-configured grid - if you leave a level, you'll get new random numbers the next time you play it.\n\nSince the audio is a synthetic space background music track, the feedback is purely visual; and that is only in terms of animation, correct squares, lines or results don't change color, they just spawn some fireworks (in addition to some general blinking going on, so don't play this if you're sensitive). It works somewhat because the fireworks along the lines is fairly discernible.\n\nNote that when playing this game, you first have to click through a bunch of dialogue that is you talking to your space cat (press space and a \"skip\" icon appears), which you will do as you enter each level, each time, before you get to the numbers grid. Your reward for finishing a level is the ability to access the next level and see more space cat dialogue.\n\nThe game is realized with Unity, and it scales up nicely to 1080p fullscreen, or you can play it windowed (albeit non-resizable).\n\nThe problems I see with this game are poor visual feedback, and no audio feedback; a steep learning curve because there are no handcrafted levels that would slowly add difficulty, leaving the player to flounder with trial and error; and I don't like the graphical style and background music much.\n\nRecommended if you like doing simple sums for fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436424666, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436454023, "recommendationid": "16954072", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500580", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453185387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 156, "steamid": "76561198030151179", "num_games_owned": 80}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pros: Easy to pick up and play, Simple mechanics, Easy badge (only 5 cards, you get 3 from drops) and the soundtrack is pretty cool.

Restarting to generate another set of random numbers in hopes of getting a better set seems to be the way to win. When you finally get one that doesn't take 20 minutes to solve 1 part after completing all other parts you'll praise RNGesus. I'm serious, this game requires so much backtracking it's not even funny.
