I say stand alone as this runs on a different premise which is basically a Hidden Object Game (HOG). Each HOG which requires you to find 12 items in a picture which is a crudely drawn low graphical quality landscape and the said items are camaflouged somewhere in amongst the 500 littered items or more which serve as a redherring. Hence to find the tasked items youll often be squinting like a China man looking directly in the sun. If you happen to survive the HOG without a cornea transplant then you immediately get treated to a puzzle in the form of a jigsaw, a puzzle slide, a rotating disc slider, or a find the 20 differences puzzle. Once you complete that you recieve a postcard and you get to do the whole thing again and again 25 times until you collect 25 postcards from 25 different landscapes from Anozira.\n\nThis brings us to the story. Anozira contains 5 main characters all demonstrating b grade voice acting skills coupled with acute brain damage, probably due to incest as they have been cut off from the main world for far too long and want to drum up tourism. Our main protaginist of the game has a light bulb decision to create 25 postcards and send them out. What this has to do with finding 12 items in each landscape and solving a puzzle I will never know. Neither will I nut it out how postcards will bring the masses to this fictitious town filled with grand dad jokes worthy of the skip button being mashed with your forehead.\n\nEach character apparently has a different dialogue and so if your game and want to go blind you could play this 125 times just to find out all the secrets of the town. The only secret I want to know is why the main characters at the beginning have mouths that move like their some sort of ventrilloquist puppet where the puppeteer really has his hand jammed up in there and is desperately trying to get it out. Seriously their head and mouth have an eplipetic fit like a hummimng bird being electrocuted and then out of sink voices start coming through. It would not have started to surprise me if their heads suddenly did a 360 turn and green stuff came out of their mouths.\n\nIn all seriousness the game was really easy since you have 5 hint possibilities and 5 time extensions which you can constantly build up and even over the 25 landscapes youll eventually gather 5 skips which will allow you to skip a puzzle completely. Surprisingly I found the timed version of the game very relaxing, but apparently there is a no timer option also available, which is very, very, very, very, very, very relaxing. This is for red necks so dumb that their dogs teach them new tricks.\n\nHaving said that it works. Its cheap hand drawn style is befitting. It was a novel way to spend a few hrs and I did enjoy myself. Definitely better products out there though, but if you are a diehard HOG fan then wait for a sale.\n\nBelieve me that was me being nice...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468503461, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468503461, "recommendationid": "24314754", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504249", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1473004202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 167, "steamid": "76561197994587525", "num_games_owned": 1213}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is by far the ugliest HOG I've played.
