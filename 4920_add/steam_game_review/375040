Crushed dreams aside, let's try to be objective and put this as simply as possible:  Some of you may actually enjoy this, but I can't in all honesty say that I did.  \n \n   It's...well, for starters, it's a \"deathmatch\" game.  And a really simplistic, limited, super-repetitive one at that.  With only one \"map\", as far as I can tell.  It also has the usual complete lack of storytelling logic which practically all such games have...I mean really, who's honestly going to be out harvesting corn when they know full well that there's a homicidal, demonically-possessed tractor roaming the fields?  Sure, there's a half-arsed attempt at justifying said premise on the Store page, but there really is \"clever\", and there really is \"dumb\".  Not that any of this lunacy would greatly hinder my enjoyment if there was actually some to be had...but it's mostly just a frustrating experience, in which you can never quite tell what direction the bloodthirsty farm equipment is barrelling down upon you from, and I also could not for the life of me work out why I ran at a perfectly good clip at certain times, and at a snail pace at others.  \n\n   I'm sure I could persevere and suss the game out some more, but that would require time.  And patience.  And given that I'm a dole-bludging university student who's only got one assignment to go before he's on three-and-a-half months' worth of holidays, I frankly don't have either.  I have other, BETTER games to play, darn it!  Having said that, there's always the remotest chance that the devs will make significant enough improvements and/or embellishments to render this a worthwhile buy...but at the moment, I'd say it's a wait-for-98%-off proposition at best, and even then mostly 'cause it's got cards.  Nice gimmick, but not nearly amusing enough in execution, I'm afraid.\n\nVerdict: 4/10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446201458, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446255795, "recommendationid": "18760397", "language": "english", "votes_down": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522992", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484179601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 405, "steamid": "76561198183346791", "num_games_owned": 37}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Well, ever want to be a farmer? here are some tips to become good at that job.\n1.

Having to collect things while being chased by a demonic tractor is a decent prospect; that is, if you were making something that gave off more of an arcade feel to it, and if the tractor was actually menacing, not Hot Topic's cheap remodeling of a John Deere product.\n\nThe game is incredibly repetitive with very little to actually collect. It's just corn. You're just swiping at corn. That's it. No other special vegetables you could look for, no real points system, no powerups, no rotten plants you should avoid, etc. Those are things I would have imagined with some creativity, but I couldn't find any of that here. Just corn.\n\nThe sound design is dreadful. I could not differentiate any sound based on distance or orientation. It's just noise coming from you, or the center of the map (do not go near the center, you will go deaf). Noise pollution is not scary. It's just really frustrating to put up with.\n\nMultiplayer is just a host-or-join setup, but you can only join YOUR friends. And even if you know someone else who paid for this, you have continuous voice-chat with eachother. No push-to-talk, no keyboard options, no exceptions. You have no selection for the levels, but they're all the same map size, so it doesn't matter. You have different player models, but you can't select them, and they're all the same in-game, so it doesn't matter.\n\n[b] VERDICT: [/b] I think there are plenty of games out there that are less than $4 that are worth your money more than this. There's really nothing interesting here after 20 minutes. If more content was here to play with, it would be a different story, but I doubt anything will be added to this game anytime soon.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUnRGrFY3-Y", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447348230, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447348230, "recommendationid": "19035707", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505747", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487303357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 149, "steamid": "76561198355998573", "num_games_owned": 14}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "well its an old game.
