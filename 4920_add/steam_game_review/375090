No saves, but that's not a big deal considering the game's length. Some grammar issues in the text (particularly the overcompensating use of \"whom\") and sound balance problems (the voice acting is much quieter than the music, with no way to adjust it). The puzzles can be a bit frustrating; although they make logical sense and it's generally clear what you need to do, it's sometimes hard to figure out [i]how[/i] to do it when you have approximately 1.5 seconds to find the relevant hotspots before you die.

I am supposed to like Raw Gut, or at least not gag whenever I say aer/her name\n- gold-brass brass-gold gold-brass everything\n\nBasically the written parts need serious workshopping, or at least not to be hammered home by the community-theater stylings of the narrator.\n\nOn the other hand, I love the puzzles.

The aesthetic is fantastic and the world building though small does give details that satisfy my interest. The Game was an hour long from start to finish with me playing it.\n\nThe Challenges were simple but they required reading into to find their solution so the game has that credit. One fault I did find when playing the game was the transitions during the action sequences being a little too sudden, Having to replay it over and over a few times due to their jerkyness. The Puzzles themselves didn't provide a consequence for failure and just allow you to try them again, For those who want to blaze through and miss the details in the objects you interact with. Which brings me to another point. \n\nThe Arrow to click continue sometimes obscured some of the text making it hard to read. It's still readable but it can be troublesome especially for those who may have a hard time reading the text.\n\nA lack of options Menu really detracted from this game, As with my thoughts on the voice acting. I'd like to hear the songs proper themselves without voices in the way. Another feature I feel is missing that each scene could have a remove visor option as to view the entire scene without them obstructing the view As they do obstruct as much as the arrows over the text in some places.\n\nThe Price point for this game I feel at the time of writing ($8.00) Is a little steep for an short 1-2 hour experience but the experience is worth it for the brief time you play it feeling a bit like a good short story you'd be able to pick up in a book store. \n\nPros:\n-Beautiful traditional art style\n-Good music.\n-Not too complicated puzzles. Challenging enough.\n-Decent lore and world building\n-Good atmosphere at specific parts of the story (Won't reveal much as to prevent spoilers)\n-Trading cards give quite some insight to the characters and settin if read. (Gotta collect 'em all!)\n-The characterization of the cast.\n\n\nCons:\n-The game is very linear.\n-The voice acting was rather weak in some parts.\n-The price point.\n-The Credit Sequence (which honestly made me squirm a little due to the drastic change of style)\n-The Puzzles were a bit too easy. And rather Trial and error with no major consequence for failure.\n-Animation Transitions were jerky\n-A lack of Options Menu\n\nI feel it's a good introduction to the creator's career, But there is obviously room for improvement. I would reccomend this game for those who like a short story, If you can personally justify the price.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434156961, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434156961, "recommendationid": "16343759", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500377", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436014037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561197993649037", "num_games_owned": 449}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Charming little game, though sadly over before it begins.

There is a nice little message at the end of the game which made me think twice about my actions and words used. Other than that I felt like the game lacked a lot of depth that it could have achieved with a little more development. The world is very cool, I liked everything about it from the characters, to the environments, to the creatures. I felt like the writing was a bit...eh...much. I felt like I was listening to someone read off their first non-fiction work in freshman english in highschool. BUT, that's like my singular complaint on the writing. Everything else was good.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe gameplay is simple and straight forward. You go through a series of slideshow cut scenes listening to the narrator read off the text on screen allowing you to look at the background art. After the slideshow cut scenes you get to use your characters Sight Goggle thingy to solve puzzles. Every encounter begins with time paused allowing you to observe items in the environment and their function as well as the character you're going against and additional information on them. Once all of your information was collected you can resume time and procede to activate the various items and solve the puzzle. The puzzles progressively get more difficult beginning at ridiculously easy and straight forward during the tutorial to still pretty easy with the final encounter. \nThe puzzles being relatively simple is easy to forgive, at least for me, mostly because I enjoyed exploring the items in the environment and reading up on everything I could. The game ends with an odd, almost out of place encounter where you get to make a few choices which are supposed to affect the ending. I wish that these choices actually did something and that there were more of them. That's actually this games greatest fault (yes, more than the writting), it never really reaches it's fullest potential. There are so many cool concepts and so many neat themes and interesting lore but there simply isn't enough of it. I was left at the end of the game wanting much much more. \n\n[b]Visuals[/b]\nTake a gander at the screenshots, if you don't like what you see, then there you go. I personally was okay with it. The art doesn't add to or detract from the game its self or the narrative, it was just kind of there. Felt more like rushed concept art to me, but like I said, I was okay with it. \n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\nGrade: C\n\nI give this game a C because the writting and narrating deals a pretty damaging blow. Fortunately it recovers with cool gameplay and interesting lore and world. Unfortunately again the game takes a hit with the immense lack of content. \n\nI wanted more of this game. It's worth the price tag, give it a whirl and spend an hour or so enveloped in an Earth that could be. \n\nAlso...potato erotica...so much yes.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467350579, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1467350579, "recommendationid": "23975395", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 9, "num_reviews": 9, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
