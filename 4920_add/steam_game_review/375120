Levels and bosses oscillate wildly between pushover and punishing, resulting in an experience more frustrating than fun.

There are better games out there like Jamestown.  Go buy that one.\n\nI thought I would like this game.  Great graphics, bullet hell.  But the puzzle element is not fun. It's a slog because so much of it depends on luck.  One shot starts a chain on a normal enemy, but enemies that shoot at you take multiple bullets, so if you don't count your shots, you will start an accidental reaction that can box you in and kill you. \n\nSince you can only gain upgrades and gems until you kill the boss, you are forced to suicide if you haven't collected them all, thereby playing the same boring stage 10-20 times.  I played this for only 20 minutes or so and was bored and annoyed to quitting.
