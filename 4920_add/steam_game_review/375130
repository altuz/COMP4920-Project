I have to say this one if by far one of my favorites and only Champion of the Gods is able to stand on par with it. When I first started it, I thought the story was going to be boring as the pacing seemed to be slower than most games. I realized as I played it's due to the amount of content in the game, and sticking wtih it, all of it really does come togther and a rememberable way. I highly recommend this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500282597, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500282597, "recommendationid": "33603835", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 188, "total_reviews": 194, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
