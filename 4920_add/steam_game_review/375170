Although it is called a puzzle game, prepare to solve the puzzles in short time, since some puzzles require  you to change your layout after you've lit the fuse.

Clean presentation and smart levels make it an easy recommendation. The game doesn't strike me as being particularly long but I haven't beaten it yet nor do I feel like I'm all that close. The music could use some additional variance but what is there is pleasant and didn't irritate me. It's an all around solid package for the asking price (sub-$10). \n\nI streamed this game for a couple of hours and had a couple of folks watching.

The first few levels teach you how to play, without obviously being a tutorial or babying you along. It is extremely gratifying to complete the puzzles; blowing up piggy banks and a safe is a lot of fun.  Each level has a time limit which is often challenging, and this adds to replayability.

Along the way you must also remember to destroy any piggybanks you find, as pigs are 100% haram and must be exploded along with Grimshaw\u2019s many safes in order to please the prophet Al Robini Bin Hood (PBUH).

Even gave the hubby a laugh when he asked: \"What are the pigs?\" \"Well, those are the bag guy's piggy banks.\" \"Why are you blowing them up?\" \"So he can't finance his world take-over plans, of course!\" \n\nI'm enjoying the puzzles. They start simple to learn the mechanics, then increase in difficulty at a good rate. They aren't so difficult that I pull my hair out, but neither to I always get best time + 3 piggies on the first try. \n\nMy only gripe with Gunpowder: the sound! I like to keep background/environment sound on while playing games but at a minimal level, with sound effects just above that. Gunpowder is an all-or-nothing setup for sound, and I was nearly blown out of my chair when it started up! The default volume was WAY too high! Even the sound effects were blasting. So that I had some game sound, I had to turn my system volume and speakers nearly down to nothing so I could play without wincing. My hope is that there will be an update later on to incorporate volume sliders. \n\nOverall I'm enjoying Gunpowder, and would recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games to pass the time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437932460, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437932460, "recommendationid": "17238605", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500162", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481424961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 235, "steamid": "76561197992834388", "num_games_owned": 624}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Quite a fun little game.
