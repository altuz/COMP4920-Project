If Unveil was more evenly balanced or offered variable difficulty settings, my recommendation could change, but, in it's current form, it's really more of a death simulator than a survival simulator. If that appeals to you, then this might be the game for you.\n\nSome mechanics, however, seem to be fatally unbalanced. For example: Fishing. Avoid it at ALL costs! Why? Because it costs 2 energy to dig for worms, you only get a worm about 25% of the time, the rods cost a LOT of energy to make, and the fish you catch, once cooked on a campfire that costs 5 energy to light (to say nothing of the pickup costs on the wood fuel), are generally worth only 5 energy each. So, you spend a good 50 energy, minimum, getting fishing stuff and end up with a handful of fish worth half that cooked, if you're lucky. Fishing is a good way to die quickly, and is basically an utterly useless skill because of this. It's just not worth the energy it costs.\n\nThat said, there are other game mechanics that, at least, will keep you alive in some scenarios, but you starve incredibly fast. Even in Subnautica (where you are swimming all the time), you don't starve this quickly. In my humble opinion, this game is just too difficult, and that makes it hard for players like me to enjoy. I gave it a fair try, but I can't bring myself to recommend it. In four hours of gameplay, I managed to clear the first two \"Tutorials\", after having to restart each at least a half-dozen times. Here's to hoping it improves one day (as it's an interesting game concept), but, for now, I'd advise others to pass on this one.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498336212, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498336314, "recommendationid": "32742407", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505738", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 25, "total_reviews": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
