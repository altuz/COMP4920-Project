No Xbox360 pad support. Game does not fullscreen perfectly with visible sidebars and weird graphical artifacts in those sidebars. However the americanized japanese style voice delivery from the protagonist the adorable retro sprites, the effective pipeline puzzles that stimulate the mind without frustrating too hard and the rather awesome electronic music all come together to make this a compelling tablet port. Would really like for the feature set to improve through patching however", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494671419, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505094222, "recommendationid": "31720792", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "total_reviews": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
