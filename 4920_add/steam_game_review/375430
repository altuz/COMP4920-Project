The player still get stuck with one of the most boring variations of combat mechanics that remain unchanged for far too long.\n\nOtherwise, this game suffers from things that plague most JRPGs, especially cheap indie ones: bad controls, a lot of unnecessary walking (this time, without a chance of random encounter even), boring equipment, lack of dialogue trees,\n\nI expected this to be more like \"Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher\" - which is the game you should try instead, if you're looking for really interesting \"word-based\" battles.
