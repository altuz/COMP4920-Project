Im starting to question whether any of you have actually played a KOEI game before. This is exactly what you would expect from a historical simulation. KOEI is by far the best at this genre. Play anything else and you sell yourself short. I guess some people who bought Sphere of Influence might be disappointed if they thought that the interface or game maps appearance would change drastically and that this would be an entirely new game. Its not. However the improvements in AI, revamped battles adding siege and naval, and the \"start as an officer\" play mode option makes this by far a better option to purchase. Especially considering original SOI and Ascension were the same price at the time i purchased. I played every other KOEI game on console (playstation1-3) and was concerned that on the computer controls would be janky or just not as easy to manuever. No worries. Still easily accessed menus and overall control of the interface. I would suggest KOEI include controller compatibility in future games considering they already have the games mapped for that on console. I mean why not include controller function if its the code is already there? IDK maybe there is a legitimate reason but i cant figure out why. In summary this is a great game and exactly what i come to expect from KOEI over the years. Anyone familar with KOEI or this genre of games should buy regardless of $60 price.
