And this one is really fun and satisfying.\n\nYou pick between four classes: Berserker (melee fist-fighter), Warden (an archer, basically), Templar, and Warlock (combination of a mage and necromancer).  Each class has multiple talent trees you can invest points in that result in different active and passive skills and damage types.  I'd recommend trying them all; I typically dont like melee classes but I'm loving my Templar.\n\nYou start off in a building called the Chronicon, with a merchant and several other NPCs that offer services you can unlock as you progress.  You grab the first couple quests, and off to the dungeons you go.\n\nDungeons are filled with enemies (duh), loot from said enemies and chests (double-duh), traps, and mini-dungeon rooms.  Enemies can have different buffs applied to them or be a rarer quality which makes them give better loot or have different fighting mechanics; for example, one buff might make the monster explode after you kill it.\n\nLoot is broken down into tiers: Ordinary (white), Enchanted (blue), Rare (Purple), Unique (Pink), and Legendary (Red).  As with any other game, higher tier loot offers better stats and sometimes interesting passives, such as a pet, or a floating orb that does damage to targets near you.  Loot also consists of Crystals (currency), multiple tiers of multiple colors of gems, and some other weird crystal currencies I haven't found a use for yet.\n\nThe game offers 5 (I think?) difficulties, and I've been played on the third/fourth highest right from the start and the game feels balanced enough.  Rare monsters and boss fights will have you chugging hp/mana pots like no other, so make sure you buy lots from the merchant NPC.  Boss fights actually start to have mechanics once you get past the first one, so be aware of their abilities, how the combo them, when they're going to use them, etc.\n\nLocal multiplayer is REALLY fun if you have a friend to speed-run through the dungeons with and build up monster-gibbing exp combos.\n\nOverall this game is really fun, the pixel art is nice, and there are LOADS of puns and humor to appreciate (for example, a miniboss that's a Bat named Outahel.  Get it?  Or a treasure-hoarding goblin that drops a Unique ring, named Mollug (LOTR fans, anyone?).  The game is really charming, the music is relaxing and catchy, and the combat gets really fun.\n\nThat being said, here are my suggestions/cons:\n\n-Early game combat is REALLY dull.  The first 10 levels or so on a Berserker and Templar are especially boring.  You do very little damage, the only attack skill you have sucks, and drains mana like no other.  They really need to do something about the early-game.  The game should be fun right from the beginning, not 10 levels in; and some of the people in the reviews have mentioned this as well.  However as soon as you get your 2nd/3rd skills, fights get really fun.\n\n-The loot filter could use some work, and its buggy when you play local multiplayer.  When I use a keyboard and my gf uses a controller, after you defeat the first boss in the secondary zones I cant click the names of the loot to pick them up like 60-70% of the time like I usually can.\n\n-More classes would be nice.  Even if you had to split the Warlock into a Wizard and Necromancer and give them each different skill trees, or add some kind of spear-wielding mid-range class, or maybe some kind of assassin.\n\n-I'm not sure if it happens later on, but more loot that gives pets or active skills would be cool.\n\n\nI really love what you guys have done with this game so far.  Excellent work!\n\nOVERALL RATING: 9/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504589533, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504616399, "recommendationid": "34750262", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505117630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 393, "steamid": "76561197970153763", "num_games_owned": 554}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game, pretty great, you can play with click to move, wasd, a controller, there's a billion items/monsters/etc, it has a good feeling feedback on crushing enemies, a nice slow power curve so you can appreciate your time spent etc. For 10 dollars, a steal.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505035435, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505035435, "recommendationid": "34857340", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501744", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507081162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 144, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2188, "steamid": "76561198028354069", "num_games_owned": 165}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I picked up Chronicon while cruising through my discovery queue and hoping for a rogue-like or Diablo clone that might be more fun than hassle.  And though it took me a little while to get into it, once I did I LOVED it.  Playing a warlock and laying waste to hordes of enemies is so fun!   I have to try the other classes but plan to (and I've already gotten well over the price I paid in hours of fun just on this character).\n\nOn top of that, the developer really seems committed to making a fun game--and it shows.  He's got such a great attitude, and every time I see him in the forums (frequently) he's either to help or to listen.  This game is moving in the right direction and frankly I'm happy enough with it just the way it is (but from what I read, it's getting even better).\n\nGive this one a chance if you like the genre, and don't let early access scare you (it tends to scare me away lol).
