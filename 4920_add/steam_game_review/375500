Clicking help on character creation tells you most of what you need to know.  You must bring a rogue if you want to pick chest locks.  Combat got much easier once I saw you could backstab with fighters and rogues.  Health and Mana regen slowly but there is an abundance of health/mana potions you can make.  Learn the shortcut keys for attacking so you aren't clicking all over the screen.  The game has some quirks like M will open the map but M nor escape will close it, you have to click on close.  Using keys, picks, and pickaxes is tedious as you have to open the inventory, double click the item, close the inventory, then click on the object in the world to use it on.  There is plenty of UI real estate, a quick item bar would have been great.  Still, a fun game!  Off to find myself another dungeon crawler now!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497918046, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497918046, "recommendationid": "32579581", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523647", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497447486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 70, "steamid": "76561198062643678", "num_games_owned": 270}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Why.Does.It.Play.Like.I.Am.Running.In.Treacle.\n\nEvery action has a delay, so the feedback feels really disconnected.

That, and I enjoyed the humor that was shown in the videos.\n\nAnd I am sad to say, I am disappointed.\n\nOverall, the story and set up is great.  There are secrets and puzzles that are awesome.\n\nThe combat?  Blows.\n\nYou cannot move around quickly like you do in Grimrock.  You need to WAIT until all your characters have ended their combat refresh before you can move.\n\nThere are literally no way to heal yourself outside of Potions.  And, to really make it hurt, you have a chance to football style slam the flask on the ground after you drink!  WTF??\n\nMy mage has zero spells.  The only thing that makes her worth it is her ability to mix potions ... if I could ever find any ingredients outside of one small area.\n\nArrows cannot be retrieved.  So when you are out, well .. you're SoL.\n\nYou get one skill point when you level, which isn't even explained to you.  So whoopsie if you put that in the wrong spot!  No reversing it.\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone.
