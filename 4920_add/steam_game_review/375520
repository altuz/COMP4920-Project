But fun! The jumping onto ledge mechanic works really well, and the double jump mechanic works well too. The 8 bit art and chip tunes isn\u2019t for everybody, but it works. But my one complaint is the voice. I don't think an 8 bit style video game should have a voice acting but, really other then that!

Not very good.  Visually it's okay, and the music is nothing special but functional.  Controls are mostly fine, though wall jumping is a bit annoying (very little height gained if you're holding toward the wall) and weapon switching could use some fine-tuning (pause menu to select would be nice).  There's just tons of glaring flaws that hurt the game though.  Most of the enemies and bosses are pretty plain and don't really do much.  The level design is really hit and miss.  Some stages are good, others are more mediocre, and a couple are incredibly annoying.  The story is pretty awful too, but as an action-platformer, I don't really concern myself too much about hat part.  I picked up this game with some spare change at 85% off on a steam sale, and it was entertaining enough for the price, but it's probably not something I would play again.  If there's a good sale on and you want to finish cleaning out your wallet, then go for it.  It'll be a few hours of entertainment for under $1, so you can't really go wrong.  There's lots of better games out there though, so I wouldn't recommend this unless you don't really have anything else to spend on.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501541155, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501541155, "recommendationid": "33937610", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500571", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500503570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 31, "steamid": "76561198140069666", "num_games_owned": 47}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "good", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1501074153, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500502885, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500502885, "recommendationid": "33660630", "developer_response": "And negative review?:(", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480782", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 7}}
