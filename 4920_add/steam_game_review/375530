If you aren't setup and know what you're doing from the start, gonna have a bad time.  Don't level up right?  Gonna have a bad time.  No way to undo mistakes and just snowballs down.\n\nI really want to like this game.  I find a lot of mechanics cool but more frustrating.  The way the game plays out is a prime example, you feel helpless when the team has the ball.  Advanced tactics seem to allude you, IE moving to players at once.  Shootouts are just RNG.  I find myself having the most success letting the AI do the matches, so actually watching the matches is really...boring after the third time.\n\nThe 'x-com' element is really just boils down to how can i make a shot in 3 moves.  If you have an ai opponent that is just smashing you on one saide there aint shit you can do about it until the half.  Any moves you want to make for a defender means you aren't movign the ball up and the same AI will just steal and shoot in the same move.  Boiler player 3 moves per side doesn't cut it.  Maybe 1 move each.  I think the dev's have watched a few matches but don't realize every action on the pitch has a reaction on both ends.  Offsides really isn't a thing.  fouls are just RNG, no slider to effect your chances on how aggressive you want your players.  \n\nthe way you level up your 'coaches' with fame is the same way you're leveling players...which is drip fed at a slow pace.  you can get 'maybe' 2-10 fame per match and every upgrade is n+2.  Meaning whatever upgrade, from whatever coach, is going to need 2 more than the last.  By an hour in, each upgrade was 50 fame and I was getting maybe 4 fame?  To upgrade a player its either 2 seasons of play or...200 fame.  At this point I was over my head and nothing I could do but lose.  I ended up leveling up my players, but then when they were retiring the players i could buy were woefully crap.  So I made it to the first league (3->2->1), then had to drop down to the second cause i had to rebuild.  But because I wasn't getting good replacements well I was still losing.  I find myself either woefully underpowered or smashing everything.  \n\nIt doesnt make sense that you use fame instead of money to pretty much level up everything.  EPL is known for throwing money at any problem but this is pretty much a no-op.  The jumps in spending are insane.  10k -> 100k -> 370k.  The most I got from a match is maybe 22k.  Most players cost 200-500k.\n\ngameplay loop seems to be simulate all the matches, and inbetween make minor adjustements on injury or training.  End of season buy your new team then hope it was enough carry over.  if not, well you'll relegated to a league you smash so you build up your $$ (not fame) again.  \n\nto the devs, who gives a fuck about face engine when you don't even see your players on the pitch.  I didn't even realize that one of my star players had a mowhawk until I had to renew the contract.  You're exponential costs for upgrades is absured.  Make coaches like players where you hire/fire them.  Remove the fame system and make everything money.  If you want to keep fame, then do it in building your arena more.  Use it to attract fans.  Why can't I build buildings?  Where is the training camp.  Where is the locker room.  Where is the coaches meeting room.  There is absolutely no reason for me to keep a player at age 34 when he retires in a year when I can ax him for a 6 figure payout most times.  When a player retires with the team, that's fame.  When Thierry Henry retired he got a statue.  When Ian Wright retired there were documentaries.  When a player retires here, he's just deleted.  Fame in real life is built by the player sticking with the club and it's ignored.\n\nI really want to like this game.  I will come back to this but for now it's not enough.  Even the demo isn't enough. It gets you from league 3 to 2 which is just a cakewalk.  I won the league by simulating every match and made 2 changes to player positions at the start.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1505374657, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505333270, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505334261, "recommendationid": "34926425", "developer_response": "It's a pity that your first experience with the game wasn't good. However, I hope, you will change your mind later when you master the game. \n\nI want only make few notes which might show you that the game is not what it seemed.\n\n1) Football Tactics gives you the easier way to manage your club than Football Manager. But it is not a casual game in the meaning of easy wins, easy promotion etc. Football Tactics is a football world which lives by itself. And you as a manager have different ways to develop your club.\n\nYou can try for the fast promoting from league to league, but it has the consequences. You can slowly build the foundation of your club, but it's slow. You can develop through the transfer or through the Youth Academy. You can be a footballers' farm (train weak players and sell them for big money) etc.\n\nSure, you have to know how the game works to make better decisions. Mastering the game is part of having fun.\n\n2) The Amateur league is simple and has no tactics. But winning in the higher leagues requires tactical approach: using skills, previewing the opponent and finding his weak spots to counter them. Every match needs a preparation. \n\nCoach's notes describe the tactical elements, but I'll leave there few important notes about skills:\n- train skills for your players\n- learn how skills work and use them a lot because they give +1 actions for your team if performed successfully _against an opponent_\n- in the first turn after kick off the skills are not available because players have to concentrate\n\nWatching is a good mode when you know what are you doing when you prepared your team for the match. Also, if you have players with the skills, watching how AI plays with your team might help you to understand how to play better. We taught our AI how to better use different tactical possibilities.\n\n3) Again, read the coach's notes, they explain many important things. For example, fouls are not just random. They depend on the direction of the tackle. They depend on what action or skill do you use to tackle (Sliding tackle is more probably end in foul than usual Tackle). There are many other things to take into account regarding tackles and bookings. Also, there are offsides.\n\n4) If you don't like the RNG, start a new campaign and select \"Less random\" option. It makes the results more dependent on the players' attributes. The matches become more predictable. \n\n5) Amount of fame depends on the league you play, on the goal difference, on the opponent's power. It's hard to earn fame, but it's the same in real life as well. Also, as FT is not a casual game which allows for easy and unfair progression, upgrading the trainers is not granted. The better you play, the more possibilities you have to improve your club. As FT is a strategy, you have different ways to develop. You can put all the fame in the Forwards' Trainer, or put it in the Transfers assistant, or make all trainers average. Your choices make the club develop differently.\n\n6) You can make money not only by selling tickets to matches. There are sponsors, for example. Select less risky conditions (like money for every match) to earn at least something. Also, you can sell your best players. It's a very good way to earn money in the real life as well. Especially for the lower league clubs. \n\n7) One of the important steps in the gameplay loop is preparing to the next opponent. Without it, you just blindly send your players to the match with hopes for the victory. However, the game gives many \"tools\" to counter the opponents' formations. Put your forwards against the weaker defenders. Learn how different skills work, and use players with the skills in the places, where these skills are most effective. Make a good defense. \n\nSimulating the matches is a good way of playing only if you know what is happening in the match. When you master the mechanics, when you know how the skills work, how to position your players, you will be able to predict how the match will go. Simulating matches is the same as watching matches. AI makes the same things but you spend less time. So when watching matches end as you planned, you can start simulating them. And so your preparation for every match matters a lot.\n\nWithout understanding how to outsmart opponents tactically, simulating matches is a roulette which is not fun.\n\n8) We are still working on the updates. And soon (around 1 month) we will release a huge update which will make the game even deeper and much much more tactical. \n\nYou can play a beta version of the update. It is still rough on the corners but main new features work. Also, the beta has a footballpedia which explains game mechanics in details.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/games/375530/announcements/detail/1451703867052346225\n\n- - - - -\nHope, you will give the game another chance. We know that the game did not explain its depth well. That's why we have many negative reviews from the players who played 3-5 hours, and many positive reviews from those, who played 20-200 hours. We will improve the tutorials in the next update. Meanwhile, I'm open to help and answer the questions. FT is our dream game, we have a lot of fun playing it, many players have a lot of fun playing it. And it would be a pity if someone dropped the game not having a chance to understand how fun it is.", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493744", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 367, "total_reviews": 405, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 38}}
