Still much work to do for the devs, but you can get 4-5 hours of awesome gameplay - and much more time after every update (during alpha they were fairly frequent).\n\nPros:\n- Easy to start and pretty hard to master;\n- Very cute artwork;\n- Neat balance. It have been changed every update, though...\n- Different mechanics for different weapons;\n- Various opponent's ability combos in late game;\n- No loading screens throughout gameplay;\n- Intensive and beautiful battle music;\n- Losing is fun!\n\nCons:\n- Still not enough content to unlock - waiting for more;\n- Quite long initial loading time - hope they'll fix it;\n- Slightly repetitive gameplay on earlier levels;\n- Poor sound effects;\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436441644, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1436441644, "recommendationid": "16956660", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513808", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460371261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 60, "steamid": "76561198012763347", "num_games_owned": 239}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Dark Souls 2D with dungeons and rifts.
