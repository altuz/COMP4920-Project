I'd recommend based on a low price and a decent new spin on a time based survival game. \n\nIt can get pretty difficult and getting used to the auto craft system is rather annoying but having said that, the auto craft allows for a degree of pace to the game that I figure the developers were going for. \nIt's pretty simplistic with the crafting and the goal to escape the island is pretty clear, they've even tried to add story elements which is pretty good considering it's in early access.\nThere is a lot of potential here, much like minecraft in it's early stages to be fair. \n\nIf you were interested I have recorded the intro and turtorial as well a the first day (after I learn't to play it!) As I find videos are quite helpful in helping me decide to buy games etc.\nhttps://youtu.be/HgcWrLMYBAU \nAs well as a full playthrough with the ending on the same channel. \n\nThe game itself is pretty short, but with generated terrain every time you play is something a bit different. The turtorial isn't much to go off of and you are left learning on the fly which, again, adds to the degree of pace of the game.\n\nI'll defo be checking up on it's progress as it updates and keen to see what it becomes. \n\n5/7", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495202248, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495216778, "recommendationid": "31840740", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498796092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561197994474384", "num_games_owned": 1471}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "4", "review": "The crafting system, while new and interesting, has a lot more issues then benefits. Like dragging a thing to another thing to make a new thing is nice but if you are even a little bit too close to something that that thing can combine with [strike]boom your day is borked[/strike]. \nI have been told that if you middle click on a crafted object it will be un-crafted. This can make the game's crafting better but with the time table being so fast seconds crafting and un-crafting could get you mauled by shadow chickens. (which was fun to type)\n\nThe graphics are something that could be over looked but with how little is on the screen as it is it would have been nice to have some better looking sprites.\n\nThis game is tagged as a \"Casual\" game however that is not true. This is a game with a far bit of difficulty. Although the difficultly is high it is the lack of enjoyment out of said difficultly that makes me not recommend this game.\n\nBottom line is this I can not recommend this game to most people as it will have very little reward for getting past the difficulty and the fact that it is tagged as casual when it is clearly not. Unless you are a lover of getting your rump kicked because of poor mechanics DO NOT buy this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498868351, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499120464, "recommendationid": "33061562", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491724", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
