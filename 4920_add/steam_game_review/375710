For starters, the graphics are absolutely stunning, with Bobley himself being one of the most aesthetically pleasing characters this gamer has ever laid their eyes on.  Gameplay wise, you will find yourself constantly faced with daunting moral dilemmas that will make you question your definition of right and wrong.  The puzzles are delightfully balanced so as not to be too easy or too frustrating; just the right amount of challenge for everyone.  And the platforming, oh my the platforming.  What can I say other than that it's absolutely splendid.  It will remind you of classic platformers like Super Mario 64 and Jak and Daxter, all while still maintaining a unique feel all its own.\n\nThen there's the story.  As already mentioned, the moral questions The Adventures of Mr. Bobley poses are very intense and profound.  If you are an innocent soul then this game might be too much for you.  I myself was shaken to the core by the time I reached the end, at which point I went on a month-long journey to find the meaning of happiness and self-worth and have never been the same since.  If you can find the strength to push through the hardship though, I promise that the rewards you'll gain will be life-changing.\n\nNext up is the music.  This game features a soundtrack so heavenly and pure that it would put Mozart to shame.  My words really can't do it justice but you will fall in love with it, I guarantee you.\n\nLastly, I wanna talk about the technical integrity of Bobley.  A lot of times games like this have a variety of glitches and odd bugs as a result of being too far ahead of their time.  This masterpiece, however, is the most  stable game I've ever played.  44 hours invested at the time of this review, and not one problem whatsoever.  Everything works exactly as intended and runs supremely smoothly.\n\nIn sum, The Adventures of Mr. Bobley is about as perfect as any game can hope to be, and playing it has made me a kinder, wiser person.
