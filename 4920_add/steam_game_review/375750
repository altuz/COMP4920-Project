The game's mix of invisible movement, abilities, timing and sound based guessing forces players to make fast decisions and react immediately. Every prediction shot is a gamble that pushes the risk/reward balance between killing your enemies and revealing your position, this can be quite thrilling when you have to make these calls while simultaneously having an eye on what is happening on the map and keep track of your own invisible character.\nContrary to my expectations the game is a lot of fun when played online with random people, I originally thought of it as a pure couch co-op title. If you still want to be in voice with people to have some laughs about botched shots or marvel at impressive moves, there is an active community server on discord. Finding a public game also hasn't been an issue for me and playing from Europe on other servers like US East also provides you with a stable connection. [i](Update: Apparently I had some luck in the beginning, consistently finding public games isn't so easy after all. Still I was always able to find game through discord.me/invisigun[/i]). In addition to the multiplayer modes there is an extensive single player challenge mode with 3 difficulties, that can get you through an online drought.\n\nIn short: Invisigun Heroes is a highly entertaining and fast multiplayer game you can enjoy online or with friends, that really nails its concept and gives you single player content as a bonus. Definitely worth its sale price, just grab it and have fun. \nIf you miss the sale but have any interest whatsoever in the concept or have enjoyed indie multiplayer titles like Duck Game or Towerfall: Ascension, you're almost certain to still get your moneys worth at full price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504577808, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504765659, "recommendationid": "34748078", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507717", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505600627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 92, "steamid": "76561198065303206", "num_games_owned": 211}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Truly great game. Easy to learn, difficult to master. Wish I could play it more. Fucking pains me to admit the only drawback to this game is that there aren't enough people playing it and its core experience is a multiplayer game.\n\nFor fucksake, you only need 3 other people to play this great game, which makes, \"fixing\" Invisigun a matter of fixing matchmaking. So how to fix the playerbase issue? \n\nInvisigun matchmaking needs to be an immediate and immersive social experience, because that's what makes multiplayer games fun. \n\nMake Invisigun great by amending the client with the following features:\n    Kill the broken automated matchmaker that killed your playerbase. \n    As a player I can browse hosted games, \"rooms\" from a, \"game browser\" or create my own, knowing others will see it. \n    As a player in a, \"room\", I can communicate with others via VOIP and text communication. \n    As a player I have a widget that allows me to quickly locate my friends and join their room or game.\n    As a player I can join a game with less than 3 people and it will kick a bot at the beginning of the next round.\n    As a player, I can join, \"rooms\" with more than 4 people, but when the game launches only 4 will play (as decided by the host) and the rest will spectate under the new spectator rules.\n\n\nFix your game.

Obviously this is great party game but what surprised me is that the AI is pretty good. I saw a move from the AI last night that was so crafty, I had to watch the replay just to see how that it happened.\n\nReplays make this game great. You can study exactly what happened and what you can do to get better. But what I really like about replays is that you can easily save them in game as animated gifs to share with friends. A simple nice touch that makes this game all the better.\n\nThe variety of characters to choose from also give this game a great added layer of depth. While this game reminds me of the old bomberman games (which were great), all the characters were the same. Here each hero has uniquely different play styles. Some more aggressive for close quarters play. Some more sneaky and subtle. It's fantastic as there's a play-style for everyone.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. It's clever, unique, easy to play when you're short on time to get a few games in.
