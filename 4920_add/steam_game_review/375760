The gameplay is very simple,upgrade your city to level 3 and win the game, there are several ways to go about it though. The AI doesn't really slouch around and let you win either, I've only won 2 of the 10 matches I've played.

As for what i got well to be quite frank, its not a good game. Firstly i would like to point out that i only logged 27mins in game, but for good reason the game is simple boring no strategy. The reason for such little game play is cause i beat the game 4 times in a row in 27mins, never challanged. Secondly there is no game here you just build you city up and be the first to level 5 for all your buildings, it is so simple if you just save your money for city upgrades and skip the shares,politics, and police raids=Game Over you win.\nIn summary sorry i bought this game, but if i can stop any others from making this poor choice then i guess it will be worth it, unless your the type of person who likes boring no challange level rusheing types of games then this is your game. If you like fun and emersive games then NO!!! pls do not purchase.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435856438, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435856438, "recommendationid": "16846437", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505936", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435386015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561198012068872", "num_games_owned": 192}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, they killed all your men, you lose. \n\nFun for a bit.
