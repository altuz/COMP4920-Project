Rather than selecting choices from a menu, you decide when and how often to make use of an interesting mechanic in which the main character can read the minds of those around him.  What he/she learns or doesn't learn dictates how he reacts to different situations.  It's a nice change from the usual modus operandi of visual novels.\n\nThe story's themes are rather existential and interesting, framed in a somewhat typical science fiction setting.  The art is rather hit or miss, with some of it being really beautiful and other aspects being rather poor.  Personally, I was a little creeped out by the way smiles were drawn on the characters.\n\nOverall, it's an excellent entry into the visual novel genre.

These things determine the ending you'll got.\nI don't want to spoil the story for you, but it's really good.

It gives the reader the chance to read minds of different characters throughout the game and develop different relationships depending on how you use your gift.\n\nThe story in itself was pretty decent. Long story short: A guy gets kidnapped, he learned that his society was corrupted, he joined a rebellion, he developed the gift of mindreading, he uses the gift for either good or evil. It isn't the best story but it isn't bad either.\n\nStory: 6/10\n\nThe background is another story though. There are very few backgrounds throughout the game which is bad in itself according to me, but all of them legit looks like someone scribbled a little on a paper and then just didn't care anymore. You can't even make out what the background are supposed to be, even with the text describing the background.\n\nBackground: 1/10\n\nThe characters all have been made pretty decent according to me. They all have some kind of personality that reacts realistically depending on the situation. The character artwork was definitely better than the background but it's not good. \n\nCharacters: 7/10\n\nUnlike most Visual Novels, your choices doesn't appear as text boxes, but when you read the minds of other characters and when you do not. These choices might also result in significant changes in the story. \n\nIf this is your first time reading a Visual Novel, I would suggest you to not start with reading this one as it might give you a bad first impression of them. Instead, start with one of the masterpieces like the Danganronpa or Zero Escape series (assuming you don't feel like anime artwork is a problem). I would only recommend this novel to someone who have read many different VN before and wanted to read something a bit different. \n\nGame overall: 5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488634381, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488634475, "recommendationid": "30314763", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503693", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486842743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 322, "steamid": "76561198314909236", "num_games_owned": 125}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Okay, I'd like to start with saying that I absolutely LOVE Woodsy Studios. That being said, this game is really not worth the full price. If this is your first Woodsy Studios game, PLEASE DON'T JUDGE THEM BASED OFF OF THIS. This was their first game, and that fact is made evident throughout the gameplay.\n\nI actually couldn't bring myself to finish this game because I lost interest.\n\nThis review is purely my opinion, but I reccommend buying it at a reduced price if you choose to buy it for yourself.\n\nPROS:\n\n.Nice soundtrack\n\n.Variety of characters\n\n.Good overall plan to differentiate it from similar games\n\n.Choose whether MC is male or female\n\n\nCONS:\n\n.Atrocious illustrations (but you can adjust to them as you play)\n\n.Unrelatable characters/character ambitions not explained or given motive, just emotionlessly change opinions\n\n.Differences in dialogue dependent on when you choose to look into people's minds - as good as this feature could've been, the MC sometimes acts rude or erratic depending on what they've read in people's minds, and give away what they've learnt through mind reading; but all the other characters remain aloof, even though there's no way the MC should know half of what they do.\n\n.Only character I actually liked was not in it much and ended up amounting to nothing (yes i'm salty)\n\n.Poorly executed idea, with characters who change frequently and without an obvious reason to\n\n.Boring dialogue (I ended up clicking through a lot of it, which is something I usually try to avoid because I love visual novels)\n\n.Very detailed - I know this is not usually a con, but I sometimes find it is when stories are written too intricately. As someone with a short attention span, despite the visuals, I still got fidgety. A lot of plot points were explained in an elongated way when there was no need.\n\nI usually replay games to earn the achievements, but this is a game that I most likely will not replay.\n\nIf you want to play Woodsy Studios' more recent games, play Serafina's Crown (which is a bit slow paced at the very beginning, but you can skip through without missing much) and Echoes of the Fey (which is amazing and ongoing so get into it now so you can brag to your friends that you played it before them)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487620467, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487620543, "recommendationid": "30064986", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438414509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 193, "steamid": "76561198047825747", "num_games_owned": 124}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Disappointing...
