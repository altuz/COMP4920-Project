It has serious control issues with heroes being deselected depending on where you click and you won't know until after you click. (near mines, near invisble hitboxes? bad terrain? Who knows?), some pathing issues. And no hotkeys.\n\nYou have a few skills that cooldown about every 15 seconds, it's a common mobile mechanic that depends on you tapping the screen every now and then. On a PC you MUST have hotkeys for this kind of thing! And not being able to even select your hero with a hotkey is almost game breaking.\n\nYou could play around the other issues if there only were some hotkeys, rebindable or not. \n\nOtherwise it seems to be a decent game with a clunky mobile UI slapped on top.
