I've played about an hour total and want people to know about it.\n\nIt doesn't quite fit the cliche of a simple to pick up yet deep platformer. It is more of a skilled puzzle platformer from the get go and it took me a bit of time to adjust to the controls. Experiment and be patient and you'll be into it in no time (if you like difficult platformers). I played just under an hour according to my stats and reached level 10 maybe? Bite sized levels similar to super meat boy. Much more challenging than meat boy, although the more I get used to controls it may become easier. If you're worried its too puzzle oriented and not skill based enough, don't worry as you need more skill to see through the execution of your path. \n\nThe introduction of new controls (new jumps etc) is beautifully introduced in the context of the level you're in. Experiment. Die. Think some more. Execute poorly but realise you have the right idea. Sucessfully execute. Reward. Next level.  \n\nI recommend to people who enjoy n+, meat boy, fenix rage, life of pixel, etc. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462935319, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1462935319, "recommendationid": "22905376", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506695", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
