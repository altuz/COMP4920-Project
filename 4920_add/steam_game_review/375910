It is a supply chain management city builder sim. The vast majority of the game is managing supply chains for various resources while maintaining a positive income. Depending on how good you are at the game, you can end up waiting VERY long periods of game time to do anything because your income is only a hundred credits a minute or so and everything costs a lot more than 100 credits, or you can very rapidly expand.\n\nHow do you make credits? Your income is entirely based off of taxes. The game is balanced so that your temperate regions will generally have a positive income while the arctic and lunar regions will eat credits (but provide resources you can ship to your temperate regions to make more money by upgrading your population).\n\nPros: \nSupply Chain Manager. \nMore forgiving than other games in the series.\nCombat can be mostly ignored if you do not have the DLC that allows your regions to be invaded.\nYou get the feeling of success that comes with expanding your company from nothing to controlling a number of regions.\nGame does not \"end\" as you can always improve on your optimization.\nSignifiicantly variable difficulty.\nPretty graphics. \nCampaign is not pressing but has a truly awesome reward.\nEach region is slightly different in management because of regional projects, bonuses, and \"negatives\".\nAddictive for people who like to optimize / perfect stuff.\n\nCons:\nLimited combat that is repetitive. \nNot a lot of variance in building appearance.\nGameplay can get repetitive quickly for those who do not like managing supply chains.\nStock Market DLC can be very annoying in spite of large benefits.\nSpace Station DLC will drive you insane if you like to have full supply everywhere.\nTundra DLC gives you a \"benefit\" that in most cases is actually a detriment.\nMultiplayer gameplay does not exist.\n\nThis is personally my favorite Anno game because it allows for a larger degree of error in supply chain management than the other games so it is more forgiving for people who do not enjoy micromanaging but still like supply chain management. I also do not often play multiplayer in anything so the lack of multiplayer does not bother me in the least.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505059994, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505059994, "recommendationid": "34865568", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523005", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506493594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1451, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15837, "steamid": "76561198084111143", "num_games_owned": 45}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I love all Anno's before this one and generally this type of game, but I can't get over not being able to save it as I go along.

The developers improved the production chain management issues from the previous version, where it became impossible to determine whether you're over-producing or under. But in doing so it has dumbed down the whole game quite a bit. Now in the later game, it seems, you're just playing around with numbers and not really doing playing a game.\nThe combat is a disappointment, there is no planning/preparing an army and attacking anymore, there are just standalone missions that you go and finish. These become repetitive very fast because there are only 3-4 of them, but you have to keep playing them to get some much needed resources.\nNot sure why the maual save game was removed. Now you can't take risks and see how that would turn out to be. Instead you have to play very conservatively, the entire time, so you don't go bankrupt.\nLate game pretty much becomes a drag because you're left with nothing to do. There aren't any factions ether. So you don't feel like playing as another faction, which was a major plus in earlier games. I guess the different zones (arctic, temperate, lunar) are their replacement but they still take some replayability away. If each sector had some unique achievement/reward then there'd be an incentive to finish them all, but right now there isn't at all.\n\nOverall I will still recommend it because of city planning and building. The graphics are pretty impressive, zooming in on a production facilities and watching what is going on is quite cool.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506873082, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506873082, "recommendationid": "35386837", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502426492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2034, "steamid": "76561197995511608", "num_games_owned": 76}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very fun but needs patience.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505789095, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505789095, "recommendationid": "35056738", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498424", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493375483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 15, "steamid": "76561198337838260", "num_games_owned": 81}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Beautiful Graphics and Game Play!
