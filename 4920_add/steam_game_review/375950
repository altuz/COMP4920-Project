They give you a free random plant every week or you can buy them, cheapest for me is 0.12$cdn. You can also buy multiple pots and really get your grow on but entierley not nessisary as I find one pot more than enough. Its also educational, I had no idea of the diffrent types of succulents let alone their latin names, and you can rename everything.\n\n Just having this game on for the music is awesome.

The pots have cute designs, but they're definitely not over complicated, the plants are unique and all have detail. Even the little snail that happily chugs his (or her) way around your pot looks adorable! This game has a cute factor that's actually mind blowing, it's the ultimate stress reliever, even in the graphics department.\n\n[h1] Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis is a game that's all about patience. You can't go into Viridi with a mentality such as an action or adventure game, this game requires patience because your plants will grow in real-time. Yes, real-time. You water your plants once a day (even your snail if you like, but he's pretty good on his own so I wouldn't bother the lil guy). You watch the background change in real-time, it follows your system clock so if it's night time outside, it'll be dark in the game, same with day time. Viridi has a simple mechanic for gameplay, you water your plants, you listen to the calming music, and you enter your happy place. \n\n[h1] Story[/h1]\n\nCompletely nonexistent. You make your own story out of your plants and your little snail friend, that's the bottom line.\n\n[h1] Mod Support[/h1]\n\nAs far as I know, this is also nonexistent.\n\n[h1] Summary[/h1]\n\nSo what are you getting with a game like this? Well, this is your happy place. you go to this game from time to time so you can relax from the natural stress in your daily life. The gameplay is simplistic, the visuals are beautiful and you will absolutely love this game if these things sound appealing to you. Also, there's achievements available, they take time to accomplish because of the real-time aspect of the game, but they're rewarding once you achieve them!\n\nDo I recommend this game?
