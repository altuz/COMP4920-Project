Offers gameplay about on par with something like The Magical Silence. \n\nGame holds your progression hostage until you complete a series of scripted illogical click action that result in surreal and sometimes useful results. Useful consisting of being able to get a block to put in the door acting as a doorkey. I understand that the surreal theme does not blends itself well with logical puzzles, but they could have at least tried to tie things together with a plot, or some kind of an exposition but no such attempt was made. The vaguely physics related element were interesting to play with but did not really bring anything to the table in terms of gameplay. I ended up too frustrated to play and watched a lets play. The guy beat the game in 10 minutes most of which was just waiting for slow animations to be performed by the engine. The art and presentation of some of the levels had some eye catching elements to them and thats about the only thing I can give this game. As it stands it is too thin an experience to even warrant the clutter in library."}]}
