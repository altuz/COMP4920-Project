I've finished the game in 70 minutes without using a walkthrough (I've checked the built-in hints once because [spoiler]the cottage on a beach is really hard to spot[/spoiler]).\n    [*]The story is one of the main selling points but is feels more like a teaser for some proper full-length game. Also it's hard to feel any emotions for anyone in such a short timeframe.\n    [*]The minigames feel out-of-place, most of them have no reason to be there.\n    [*]There is one dexterity based minigame, basically a QTE where you have press indicated buttons and if you fail you have to start over. It's quite difficult and it took me about 15 minutes (from the overall 70 minutes!) to complete. Such thing has no place in a point&click game!!\n    [*]The character repeats the same sentences over and over again. He should react in a more clever way, indicating why the action isn't allowed. Sometimes it's downright confusing, like when [spoiler]you're supposed to burn a door but when you use matches on it, he says: \"It won't burn.\"[/spoiler]\n[/list]\nI don't like giving a thumb down to a small indie dev but this game is so subpar I just can't honestly recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492344320, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492418989, "recommendationid": "31176792", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503054", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 10}}
