Is it me or the price has become something like 10 times less than when I bought???\n\nThe more I play, the more things to fix is there...\n\nThe control is somewhat clumsy, the voices hurt your ears (and you can only disable voices that comes during the matches, not the annoying machine voice of main interface), you can't leave even a centimeter when you're trying to capture a ressource building and being two doesn't make capture quicker nor makes the one who came after to capture to earn some cash(but the bot is dumb so it'll come capture with you although it doesn't help at all), the single player card system is just abusive when there's not many people in multiplayer(it always indicates there's about 590 to 605 rooms that's a huge scam. You can now invite people but that serves nothing because most are AFK and there's only a very few that will join you). The reward for playing other modes than Bosses is so-so when you're high level.\n\nThe reward for boss mode is a bit low when you have to have some powerful units (I strongly recommend M270 for the KingKong boss)\n\nThe ammunitions are STILL quite expensive and disappear instantly (mostly multi-projectiles) but earning ore is a harder task and coin ammos are a waste of...coins.\n\nThere's two way (possible) to earn ore :\n1. The ore refinery in your base (900 ore for lvl 1 refinery + 100 each level) you can activate for every two damn hours. No need to upgrade it, it's only a waste of ore and time! + you have to upgrade the command center as well. Ore Refinery needs a serious buff! I would suggest to put 1000 as base value and each level would give 1000 more ore but the upgrading fee would be the same as upgrading the M270's base missiles (which is quite expensive as well)\n\n2. grinding missions. (especially boss modes) The best farming mode is the KingKong boss one and the best map for this mode is the Base Island (quite small map but has more cover)\n\nFree coins? Tasks are only few, very demanding and the reward is deceiving. but the coins ammo are so expensive, the units too and the gear as well. (6000 coins for AC130 and 10k for the Raider. LOL)\n\nThe Challenge game doesn't worth playing. The reward is too low, you can't invite people to come and the Boss Corps I mode has too low time so you can't win even if you're playing with the 6 top ranked players (I'm the highest ranked player as of now btw)\n\nThe firing system is really boring. You can change target in range with the E key but you can't calculate the trajectory so this acts like a huge con for mortar/artillery type units as moving ennemy will always avoid your slow mortar/missile shell if you're far.\n\nThe ammunitions are also kind of meh, they are expensive as hell as mentionned previously and the projectiles type (machine gun ammo or rapid cannons) has real bad accuracy in far range and uses as much shells as you fire (ex. a M270 will use 6 missiles). You will be playing with missiles for the most of the time for this reason (expensive as well but better than auto cannons and it's aimed)\n\nThe mounting equipement system looks great...but when you get to see how much coins or ore you have to get before being able to research them, you'd say \"F*ck\" (and there's restriction on level too)\n\nUpgrading your weapons uses quite an amount of ore/coins as well but only upgrade the damage point by 1% per level + upgrade your research centers every 10 level of weapon upgrade. And coins ammo will need coins to be upgraded as well. Greedy!!!!!!!\n\nThe challenge with Boss corps I is impossible with only 5 minutes! there should be more time, at least 9 minutes!\n\nIt's also a meh when the bots are OPed with infinite coins ammo...\n\nAnd the biggest point is : I don't really want to pay more for a game I already paid to own. I would have said nothing if this game was a free2play but nope.\n\nP.S : You put kingkong boss mode, invite a few friends, start the game and suddenly other people you haven't invited has come in and the mode has changed into tangled warfare or something else. This is a big bug that happens quite often.\n\nP.S 2 : there's several bugs with the sounds, I've mute everything but sometime (and quite often cuz every 20-40 seconds) the sound will still come.
