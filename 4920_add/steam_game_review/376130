I have yet to inspect the full elements of the game but so far have the basics pretty down. The point of the game so far as I can tell is to gather intelligence through formats of info such as pamphlets, discs, etc. You may also be given the objective to kill a specific man in the world. You are fighting back to learn more information of the truth and you do so by rampaging throughout your world killing all you see. Everything represented by letters and/or symbols of the text appearance and plenty of objects being made out of them.\n\nPros:\n-The game's controls are tight and responsive.\n-You can immerse yourself into the game as you progress.\n-Different variables to the game to assist you and thus adding more possibilities such as money.\n-The style of it is very easy on the eyes and something I have yet seen be done. \n-Such as any Rogue like game you have the need to explore every nook and cranny to advance and  gain better equipment.\n-Potential of endless hours of enjoyment.\n\nCons:\n-Level Design is limited and possibly seems repetetive.\n-The AI is a tad forgetful once they see you as soon as you hide behind a wall they forget all about you and just stay.\n-The AI gets tuck a lot on just simple corners.\n-I see a lack of much variety in equipment so far only have gotten a hat and not very specific kind either, it's a hat.\n-The aiming is a tad awkward as it seems your aiming for an enemy but in reality your shooting the corner of a building, so the gun shots themselves are more to the right than they are centered.\n-Keys for doors seem pointless as you can just kick them down.\n-Depending on the color of the enemy you may or may not see them as they just flat out blend in with the enviroment.\n-Immersion can be broken easily when you have to reach for 'I' to open the inventory.\n-Yet to have customizable controls.\n-Have yet to see any story or plot whatsoever as you continue on.\n-When you spawn you best be ready because more than likely you'll be surrounded already.\n\nIf you have the money to spend buy this game if you're looking for a decent time waster. If not then wait for a bit if you're not that super excited over it. The game could have potential but it is VERY limited. Not one of the best Rogue Like games, but it's decent enough for it to not be terrible.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439318728, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439320095, "recommendationid": "17492385", "language": "english", "votes_down": 52, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575512", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439445011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 36, "steamid": "76561198023560768", "num_games_owned": 182}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "review": "You'd think a game about the Illuminati would have some substance.\n\nYou wander around procedurally generated (read: shit) environments, trying to find 5 Quest Items so you can go to the next level and do the same thing.

The world is like my mind, deep with uncertainty, a void that is filled with logical nonsense.

I truly believe this is a beautiful masterpiece that will stay hidden and only a few of us will be able to carve into its inner beauty. Give it a shot, you might like it, you might not, but don't say I never warned you to stay away or to cave in. Numbers and letters have always been the answer to everything, what we made.

Unfortunately the gameplay is quite poor, making it difficult to enjoy the good bits.\n\nEnemies have no pathfinding, guns don't seem to have much variety, the gunplay is slow-paced and doesn't feel like it involves any skill, I couldn't even tell what increasing my stats was doing. Most of this game is just walking around cautiously, hoping that if an enemy sees you it gets stuck on a corner and can't shoot you.\n\nIt's worth a few dollars to try it out and soak in the novelty of the well-crafted ascii world, but I can't recommend it at its non-sale price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466808716, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1466808716, "recommendationid": "23772152", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502229", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471717785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 179, "steamid": "76561197985747138", "num_games_owned": 474}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The heavy-handed \"Wake up, The Man is always watching\" theme drips of fedora cliche, which would be fine if the gameplay were smoother.\n\nVisuals are an odd combination of ascii symbols and simple 3D models, the latter of which reminds me of that old 3D Windows maze screensaver. I found myself wishing this game stuck with a single one of these art styles, or at least fully committed to using ascii only for important objects. This seems to have been done to some extent, but only enough to cause confusion when you can't intaract with something that looks like you should be able to. \n\nThat said, I must award points for including a toilet that I can both flush and kick into pieces.\n\nMenu navigation is clunky: To use an item, press I to open inventory, Enter to use it, X to continue after having used it (why?), then I again to close inventory. This doesn't sound awful, but X is only ever used to dismiss these messages, and Esc doesn't close the inventory or stat menus, which means you have to move your hands out of the standard WASD + Mouse location to do anything in the inventory. This may be picky, but it's just more unnecessary button presses for simple interactions.\n\nEnemies all have perfect accuracy, which means that you've probably already taken damage from anything nearby if it sees you first. This can be especially frustrating when you're up against a wall and find that they can see and often hit you through solid objects. \n\nRandomized wall/structure locations sometimes put doors right up against other buildings, which makes navigating those spaces confusing and awkward. In a few cases, I think the only entrance to a building was blocked by another building, so I wasn't able to get into it and find what I presume was the location of the last clue I needed to beat the level.\n\nThere are some interesting ideas here, but Illuminascii lacks a certain polish that keeps me from recommending it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1471566617, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1471566617, "recommendationid": "25002841", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500259", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445488616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 41, "steamid": "76561197985767005", "num_games_owned": 183}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An interesting attempt to blend genres, simply put - it's a rouge-like with bast\u00e5rdized fps elements.\n\nThe game is overall pretty sparce, you run about completeing three different types of missions on procedurally generated levels, whilst levelling up your similarly randomly generated character.
