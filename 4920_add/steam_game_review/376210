In the end I was planning to spend maybe 2-3 hours playing the game and getting the hang of it. 8 hours of play later here I sit reviewing the game. It may still be early access from what I can see, so yeah theres more work that could be done on it, but you know what, I think this has some good potential. It may not be for everyone but then not everyone is into these sorts of games so is it worth the $10ish I paid for it? Hell yeah definitely. Is it worth the $20 they have it on the market for?

Yeah it may not be the most \"Supreme Action Hero\" type of game but I spent about 7 hours playing, met a couple of chill new peeps and had some fun just chatting, strategizing, and carrying on. It may not be what you \"action junkies\" might find entertaining but we had some damn good fun and made some new friends doing it. So that being said, was the game fun like a game should be? Yes. Did you get to play your game with a friend? Yes. Did you make new friends playing said game? Yes. Win. Win. Win\u2026.

I've had many fun times, and met some pretty cool people along the way. That is why it sucks to have to make a review like this after all this time.\n\nThe optimization, graphics, dino models, sounds, and animations are all spectacular.\nIt can be aggravating as far as how other players interact with you, but that's all expected in an online game. Along the way The Isle has gone through an overhaul that I believe to be for the worse. \n\nLife, and other games got in the way so I found myself shelving The Isle for a few months. I played it again just a week or so ago, and the new format is absolutely aggravating, and a total timesink. To \"progress\" you stay alive for about a minute at a time to collect points. You start as the lowest tiered dinosaur for either the Herbivores, or Carnivores. You're looking at essentially playing 30 mins minimum to rank up to the next tier as a Herbivore, and an hour to rank up to the next tier as a Carnivore. That's just Tier 1 to Tier 2. A lot longer to go up from there, being about 5 or so tiers to max.\n\nOk, not so bad, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nNot only must you be alive to collect those points, but if you die just once, you reset back to zero. Even if you rank up to another tier, you reset back to tier 1 starting all over again. There's a thing called nesting which enables you to stay that same species as a \"save spot\" but finding someone, or even staying alive long enough is a total struggle in itself. \nOh, here's the other thing. You have a health/thirst meter. Not a big deal, it's a survival game after all. The devs tweaked the meter to start you from 75% full, to now starting at 50%. Which falls dramatically quick. You have to essentially kill anything in your path (that you can) and hopefully find water out of the gate after spawning to survive at all. Causing many species to cannibalize themselves just to stop starvation as the map is huge (again not a problem, except for the current state of the game.)\n\nDue to this The Isle is not recommended  by me. If you're somebody like me that has 1-2 hrs tops of free time to spend gaming per day/night this is NOT the game for you. If you don't care about the struggles it takes to actually progress to the point of enjoying all that the game has to offer, than it is.\n\nA little sidenote. One of the main devs is fairly combative/arrogant, and his personality through streaming turned me off a lot early on in The Isles development.

Things change all the time, models, gameplay, stats. This means that in different updates there will be a different type of gameplay, and at times - you will love it. But it also means that some updates, you will simply hate.\n\nThe isle is a game for you who is tired of playing as a human, you who love dinosaurs, you who love survival. It is based around an eating/drinking system, wich means that you as a carnivore need to kill for food. As a herbivore on the other hand, you will do your best to survive.\n\nThere are plenty of servers to choose from, and plenty of gameplay styles. \nProgression - Where you survive with the best of your abilities to progress to higher tiers.\nRealism - For you who wants a more realistic approach to the progression of the dinosaurs, where certain rules apply to make players play as realisticly as possible for each dino.\nSandbox (Deathmatch) - For you who want to kill and train with other players the best techniques to battle, or simply enjoy killing.\nSandbox (No killing) - For you who rather make friends peacefully, nest babies and talk, just hanging as a dino of your own choice.\n\nAs the game updates there might be more - or less playing styles added.\n\n\nI\u00b4ve both loved and hated this game. I\u00b4ve met new friends and I\u00b4ve had a blast at times, but then there has been updates that tore down complete servers or changed stats so everyone wanted to play as something else. But when I dont agree with an update, I simply wait for the next one (who usually isnt too far away) and usually it get\u00b4s better.\n\nThe game is open to mods and with time hopefully there will be more and more of them. This means that new maps can be created, fun content added, etc. Not too much out there yet. \n\nGame has potential. I know there will be humans and \"cannibals\" added, and I\u00b4m not sure of how that will be yet.\nBut for now, dinosaurs are the way to go! And new ones are added every once and a while, spicing things up. \nThis game is a good time-consumer from work, school, or life. You will probably meet friends and at times you\u00b4ll be increadibly frustrated with the game - as it requires time to be put into it. You will love it at times and you will haaaaaaaaate it at times.\n\nIs it worth it? I believe so. I like the changing factor, I like the long progression times and I like that it constantly grows. It makes it very hard to get bored of it when it forces you to take breaks and to always adjust after new playing styles, new trending dinos. I feel that\u00b4s better than a game who\u00b4s always the same that you can get tired of in a week.\n\nSo should you buy it? That\u00b4s for you to decide. I did buy it, and I dont regret it.
