The story is a bit dissapointing. \n\nThis is a masterwork of interactive fiction. It took me about fifteen hours to beat it, with only a handful of hints. (mostly because I'd missed a piece of description somewhere, and didn't feel like wandering around examining *everything* again.) There were only one or two 'ye can not get ye flask' moments; the nuances of how the players attention was directed was, for the most part, very well done. \n\nThe 'repeat anything' mechanic is, frankly, amazing, and the sort of feature an entire IF parser could be built around. The world is exceedingly well-realized, and the puzzles are brilliantly designed. \n\nAll in all, this was a unique and interesting experience, that I'll look back on fondly... as a puzzle game. \n\nMy biggest problem with this is, in fact, the 'fiction' part of 'interactive fiction'. The story was... eeeeehhhh. I dunno. Maybe I'm weird for wanting something like 'closure' and/or 'denouement' in my narratives, or thinking that trying to tell a story through dribs and drabs of half-connected hints is a bit frustrating for the reader. Suffice to say, this story felt more than a little pointless, and rather was a rather large let-down for me upon reaching the end. Maybe I wouldn't have been so dissapointed if the rest of the game hadn't been so great...? I dunno. \n\nIf you like puzzles, (and since that's most of the game, I do recommend it for that,) play this for sure. If you like fuzzy 'bring-your-own-interpretation' litfic, you might even enjoy the story. But if you're expecting a narrative that's as concretely tangible as the atmosphere, execution, and puzzles... you may find yourself dissapointed.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493016140, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493016140, "recommendationid": "31334510", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
