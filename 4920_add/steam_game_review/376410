Stuff like friendly fire is most of the time not understanding the abilities. Yes i shot myself in the back a couple of times, but it was poor placement on my part, not the game f***ing up...\n\nIt has some deckbuilding, it has some RPG-leveling, it has some advanture stuff and it has a lot of mech tinkering! The last part is the core of the game. Find/buy new stuff, edit your mechs, see what works!\n\nIt is well worth it's money!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501625750, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501625750, "recommendationid": "33958763", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506903", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503087319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 611, "steamid": "76561198045503284", "num_games_owned": 111}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I guardedly recommend Acaratus. It's not a brilliant game, and it has a number of flaws, but it's entertaining enough. Now, the details:\n\nFirst of all, though this game touts the use of cards, it's not a Collectible Cards Game in almost any sens. Indeed, cards here are the same things as potions in other games: consumable items that you buy in stores, the only difference being you can't buy concrete cards, but have to settle for a random set from a 'booster'. It's not to say this detracts from the game greatly, but it's just something to keep in mind: there are no deck from which you draw cards here, no randomness.\n\nThe storyline is acceptable, if not particularly interesting. Though I must condemn use of voiceover-only cutscenes. Please provide subtitles! Cutscenes are animated 2d art, and are done quite beautifully for an indie game. Generally, I must say that Acaratus looks good - it seems that the team had some talented artists.\n\nThe combat mechanics are relatively interesting and varied, although you don't really need to build and rebuild your mechs for every battle: a general assortment will usually do. Building mechs is nice, but the UI gets in the way a lot. For example, I couldn't for a very long time understand why can't Pierce Cannon be used with most Cores (it's because it needs to be mounted in the Front slot, which is only available on a few Cores).\n\nA few mechanics seem to be tacked-on, or underdeveloped. For example, all Quests involve fighting small number of enemies and have the same reward - a key, usually used to open a way to Forge, where you can create rare mech parts. Also, all dungeons have exactly one enemy location and one chest with treasures.\n\n\"Crafting\" mechanic, which is basically just gambling slots, is somewhat frustrating, especially in the beginning, when you have little money to spend on it. And at the end of the game it becames useles, because it's almost impossible ot craft item with level > 3 (you need two slots around the item to roll \"+2 ranks\"), and all Merchants and Forge eqipment is at least level 4 by that point.\n\nThe game also features a very confusing \"falling stones\" mechanics in a few levels. Some players called them real-time in other reviews, but the developer clarified that the stone falls every time a mech moves a single space. It's completely non-obvious, but fortunately, only 2 or 3 levels feature this hazard, so it's not a big deal.\n\nUI in general is... strange. Some sub-menus are closed by pressing the same button that opened them (Hangar, Deck), others with a special button (Blacksmith). Comparing mech parts is hard.\n\nThe game suffers from a few graphical glitches when a texture atlas flashes ons creen or fonts become corrupted for a second inside combat, but I noticed nothing game-stopping.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503088169, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503088169, "recommendationid": "34336076", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
