It bridges a lot of aspects I like: CCG's, RPG elements, strategy, ect.\n\nCombat (when it works correctly) is an enjoyable experience. \n\nVisuals and sound meet what I expect from a game in this category.\n\nCons:\nBugs. A lot of them. What did it in for me was several game freezes in a row. Add in my auto-save not working well, and I'm out a few hours. I'm currently locked into only the second campaign mission because of the game locking and issues with saving.\n\nI'm frustrated because I don't feel that I can get far enough into the game to test the complexities and strategies of the combat system.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505251571, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505251571, "recommendationid": "34908811", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503184", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 6}}
