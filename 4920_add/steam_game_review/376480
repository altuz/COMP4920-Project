And before it gets said, yes.. I did grow up with the older games like Castlevania, loved Super Meatboy, beat N+, Dark Souls was a blast, etc\n\nBut this game... no save function. 3 Lives that are easier to lose then pocket money on a candy machine, controls that give you carpal tunnel, sloppy mixed gameplay shifts that feel very messy and unbalanced, etc just make it a hell to play. And it pains me to make a claim for a refund, because I really wanted to like this game, and I'm sure under all that mess there's something to love. But unlike old classic hardcore games, it just feels clunky. And most of my deaths felt unfair, trial and error, or even unexplained. Even when I figured out the shoot 'em up sections... I died right as I had my charge full. From reading through, the game developer seems to love that section merely for the music alone... please, get play testers, and listen to their advice. In fact, seeing the theme and everything, I wouldn't mind playtesting for future games myself to help suggest things that could clean up the mess.\n\nTo anyone wanting to venture forward, goodluck. I hope this game hits the right frequency with you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494882559, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494883511, "recommendationid": "31776597", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510413", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
