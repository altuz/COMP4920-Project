Very quick however, and there's little replayability though. \n\nI bought it because well, i'm a huge fan of the novel. The connection this hidden object finder has to the book is minimal, but it's there. Wish it could've been expanded upon more. \n\nHonestly not worth the 5$ i paid for it, but if you find this on sale for a buck or so and you enjoy a quick Hidden Object game, it's worth. Minigames are kinda fun.\n\nThe only highlight of this are the few segments where you get to visulize what Gatsby's house looked like before his demise.\n\nBut yeah. Buy if you're bored, and you like The Great Gatsby. But don't blow 5 bucks like i did.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495263023, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495263023, "recommendationid": "31854516", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508633", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
