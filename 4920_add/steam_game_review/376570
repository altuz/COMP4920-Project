But if you want a high skill cieling game that has dark souls level of gratification after downing a boss this is the game for you!\n\nSuggestions:\n1. FIND A GUILD - The best place to find a guild is through the wildstar reddit. Head over there and try to find some people who are like minded. Having people to help you and guide you into Wildstar is an absolute must!\n2. USE CHAT - Queing sucks in this game but the community is awesome! If you're trying to get something done do a /n to enter nexus chat and ask. Most of the time people are totally willing to help.\n3. MAKE FRIENDS - This compounds with 1 and 2. Bolster your friends list with people to play with! Hell you can add me and hit me up if you need some help. IGN: Tearie Hex\n4. TRY THE MOUSELOOK MODE - So this is a mode that makes the game feel more like Tera or Neverwinter turning your left and right mouse click into skills as well as locking your camera to your mouse. This little feature can make a HUGE difference for a lot of people and it could make the difference for you. To enable this go to the escape menu > Controls > and check the top 3 boxes in the mouselook mode section.\n\nI hope these little tips help you when starting out!
