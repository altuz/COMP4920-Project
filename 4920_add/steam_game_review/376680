The load screen (guy looking at the jewel) pops up then an error pops up \"From 6001, Not enough faction (4) for the number of player selected: 6\".  I click ok, and it closes the program.  I've tried everything, restart, uninstall, reinstall, etc.  This was about 2 months ago.  I contacted the customer support for Steam and the game itself, Days of Wonder.  In the last 2 months, I got one email back from Days of Wonder support (2 weeks ago) and immediately responded explaining (again) my problem.  I haven't yet gotten a response.\n\nThe game is ok if you just want to grab a quick game of splendor. The game mechanics are faithful to the board game and there are some challenges that are pretty cool.  If it weren't for this problem I have where the game won't even load now, which I imagine is not unique, I'd recommend the game, but the customer support is total crap.  It isn't worth buying a game for $10 then having it fail 2 weeks in and not be able to get any support for it.  I'd never buy it again nor any other game from Days of Wonder after this experience.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491691810, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491691810, "recommendationid": "31028135", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493279", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 30, "total_reviews": 48, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 18}}
