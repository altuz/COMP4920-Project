No alternate firing modes and way too much ammo to have to really strategize with them. Monsters spawn in flashes of light and explodes in amorphous blobs of flesh and femur bones flying around. Everything is faux-grim with sand and stone color palettes, obese ... demons? They really are big obese guys that slowly tumble towards you or throw clumsy fire. There is also a ... infernal flower pot creature? enemy design is not great. Overall I would say this game is 30 years late to the party, and even then it would had struggled to compete with the big names of the time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493697918, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505092194, "recommendationid": "31499639", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493501797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 225, "playtime_forever": 119, "steamid": "76561198043693378", "num_games_owned": 660}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Didn't know if I should recommend this or not.
