Another FPS classic. This one is obscure just like the game Nam that also on steam. Made by the same Developers. Uses the Build 3d engine.\nI have played this game for hours and hours before this steam release. \n\nThe game has many maps, and two campaigns to finish. The weapons are a great selection of WW2 weapons and items. There are objectives in some maps so its not just running around shooting enemies. Levels are nicely made and very diverse from open fields, towns, trenches, etc. You also have friendly AI that can follow you and you can give out special orders, medics can heal you. \n\n I highly recommend this game. Game can be really challenging and put people off, but I have created a guide that will help new players with gameplay tips and help with the low resolution dosbox has by adding a sourceport.

The over the top lethality would be awesome given the setting and themes, but World War II GI is only hard by way of stuffing every nook and cranny with soldiers to the point that every level is less \"FPS\" and more \"Simon Says\". You just have to memorize where everyone is each time you die and constantly be quicksaving. The game is a sequel to NAM and I'm not saying these kinds of situations never ever happened in WW2, but you can tell the developers just reskinned everything from their previous project. It doesn't transfer well at all, despite kind of working in it's favor with the Vietnam flavoring. \n\nOne of the worst parts of the game is that the artificial nature of the  props and enviroments is badly evident  Everything is just so fake looking. It's like the community theater version of World War II, and it's crazy, because as said, the engine could do way better with more talented developers(just look at Blood, Shadow Warrior, or even Duke 3D, which this is essentially a mod of). It's not like it was experimenta new technology either, considering this was released in 1999 and outdated even then. There's just no excuse for how cheap and lazy the whole thing is.\n\nThe one thing GI really has going for it is that getting a kill is incredibly satisfying, with good gun feedback and death animations. However, even this is spoiled by the extremely off hit detection(which is never a problem for the enemies, of course). World War II GI is just irredeemable garbage, but I guess that's quality in it's own way.

But let us put that aside for a moment.\n\nThis game is fustrating, unfair, confusing and incomplete. But it is still one of my favourite retro fp i have ever had the pleasure of playing. The saving every 2 minutes in case you die should not be something you have to do in a game, but i'm ok with that. The enemies are impossible to attack front on and the fight comes down to a 'who can shoot the fastest and hope the gun doesn't miss competition', but again i'm completely ok with that.\n\nThe thing that i love most about this game is that it is Doom + Medal of Honour. The computer allies is one of the biggest things i adore about this game, even if they don't actually move on their own and follow a basic programmed scripted. I don't care. The level design is interesting and offers a non-linear map, where you can choose your own path through the level to reach the end.\n\nOverall this game is looked down upon because it is heavily dated, but if you are a classic retro gamer like me, you'll love it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1479636558, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1479636558, "recommendationid": "26709615", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462899459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 744, "steamid": "76561198011957402", "num_games_owned": 336}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "World War II GI is a first-person shooter set during the events of World War II, developed by TNT Team and published by GT Interactive Software and released in 1999 as the direct sequel to NAM.\nWorld War II GI was later re-released on Steam at the end of 2015, with Retroism and Night Dive Studios as the publishers.\nThe Steam version of World War GI  also has the Platoon Leader Expansion which contains three single player levels. One WWII Pacific and two Vietnam War scenarios with many new effects and features not seen in the original game.\n\nIn World War II GI you play as G.I. (Government Issue) Corporal Gerardi of the 101st Airborne Division, sent in to wipe forces of the Wehrmacht and Schutzstaffel (SS) soldiers. The game sets the player in the middle of  World War II scenarios like the D-Day beach landings during the Invasion of Normandy, assaults on equipment and supply depots throughout 30 levels divided into four episodes.\n\nDuring the game you to deal with different types of enemy infantry, mine-fields, air strikes, tanks and many more that will block your path towards the end of every level.\nDifferent from NAM is that when you pick up medic packs, you have to stand still in order use you bandage to receive health, the environment and weapons and their functionalities.\n\nFor me the game was very exciting but quite hard. I had a hard time dealing with the first mission on D-Day to get through because there is little to no cover. I noticed that several weapons functioned strange and it looked like it made use of a burst mode. Sometimes I clicked but the gun didn't fire as if a trigger did not respond . I also had find it hard to deal with tanks when not having rocket launchers but only C4 charges which makes the game quite challenging.\nSaving multiple times while playing World War II GI is a good thing to do but don't do this when you are being shot or wandering through large open areas otherwise your saved progress can be a total disaster by limitless dying when the save game is being loaded.\n\nI really enjoyed this game because of the complex level designs and variation of locations and scenarios like assault or defense. If you have played the Doom series, Duke Nukem 3D, Blood (One Unit Whole), Shadow Warrior, Redneck Rampage you will probably like this game because of the Build game engine.\nI highly recommend this game to people who like challenging retro pixelated first-person shooters with great gameplay and level design, certainly when the game is on sale!\n\u2003\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463828193, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463828193, "recommendationid": "23114290", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502351", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481975171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 161, "playtime_forever": 87, "steamid": "76561197971261412", "num_games_owned": 1544}, "votes_funny": 11, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The Wally World Walmart WW2 FPS of 1998", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447876838, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447876838, "recommendationid": "19149300", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491542", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485013061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 55, "steamid": "76561198117501043", "num_games_owned": 85}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "great game", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1490387489, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1490387489, "recommendationid": "30712152", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492606", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501903182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 11, "steamid": "76561198085684233", "num_games_owned": 127}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Thought this game was going to be a blast but all i encountered were Allied soldiers that looked like Cardboard Cutouts and other issues like HUD not showing but that was because i had to mess around with some Controls to make it show and to get the controls tuned for my keyboard\n\nI liked the game after i got it all working.\nBut the German Wehrmacht that i thought were going to be ruthless were just Hitscan soldiers that Plugged you on the FIRST Mission.

Like NAM, it's on the Build Engine, and if releasing a game on that was audacious in 1998, it was nuts in 1999. Also like NAM, it's really bad.\n\nMost of World War II GI is exactly like NAM, but in World War 2. You have to configure the controls beforehand to not be completely stupid, it reuses a lot of Duke Nukem 3D assets and mechanics, there are 2-3 kinds of enemy, the game is a constant storm of explosions and white noise, there's a woeful attempt at a plot, there are two short episodes, and you die constantly because of things you could not possibly have seen coming (unless you use Godmode, like I did). Therefore, the rest of this review will just be the handful of things that are different from NAM.\n\nSometimes a few buttons, like Fire, Jump, and Weapon Select, just don't work.\n\nThe enemy and weapon sprites are digitized instead of drawn now, which makes them look even worse somehow.\n\nAt least the land mines and airstrikes are gone now, or at least far less common. It'll mostly be soldiers you didn't see killing you without warning, not unpredictable explosions.\n\nThere's some sort of Morale stat that I couldn't figure out, although drinking and smoking seem to raise it.\n\nThere's an escort mission at one point, which is unforgivable given the game's faults.\n\nI also couldn't find a list of levels or walkthrough anywhere on the Internet, which I think makes this the most obscure game I've ever played.\n\nSo yes, World War II GI is just a reskin of NAM.

My problems with it are the inaccuracy of the weapons, the amount of damage you take, and the placement of enemies. The weapons are more inaccurate then if you based E.T. for the Atari on the movie. The only semi-accurate weapon is the mp40 and even then the mp40 isn't even that accurate. Now on to the damage you take. In my experience no matter what difficulty setting you are on you still take half of your healthbar per bullet. This makes the first level near impossible. Part of this is because of the ammo placement. By the time you lose all of your ammo you are basically forced to use god mode because of how quickly you die. Some but not all enemies are placed in the most douchy places you can think of. Usually any enemy that is not an mp40 soldiers is around the corner of a wall ready to shoot you down.
