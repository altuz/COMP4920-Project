Though dated, it is still a reliable source of content that isn't liable to melt your child's brain. Geography, Language Arts, Maths, Science, and other subjects are covered through small games available to play throughout the environment.\n\nI remember playing this game for hours on end, and at that age I thought the animations were amazing.
