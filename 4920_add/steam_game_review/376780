It was, but not too much for videogames, since this kind of stuff was suffering from replay value and that was it demise. Interesting, also, these games were released, late 90's, for regular DVD players.\n\nHonestly it looks just like old TV shows, cheap ones. The main thing is to solve a mystery using clues from newspapers and visiting suspects. The less fooling around you do the best score you achieve. Once you have enough evidence you go to the judge and present your case. That's pretty much it. There's nothing else.\n\nNow, is this any good? Yes, if you like retro stuff. Yes, if you're a Sherlock Holmes fan and you just like anything with SH on it. Yes, if you also like very casual games and rather short ones or just taking a break from your usual high-time cosuming regular games. Yes, if you find the cutscenes rather funny than primitive. Yes, if you're OK with the short experience you'll get considering the price also matches the content. I, for one, think I got what I paid for and was kinda entertaining to play and burn an hour or two.  You should consider getting this when on sale and get the pack including the three SHCD games since that is the best value.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491814878, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492086205, "recommendationid": "31056494", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501194", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
