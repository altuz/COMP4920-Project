The adventures you encounter throughtout chapter 5-8 is berly connected to the rest of the story nor is it connected to eachother. That nessecarily dosen't make it bad on it's own but locking ep 6-8 behind a DLC wall is just plain evil. This made me take a break from the game and when i finally came back and cought up the money to buy the DLC chapters, the little illusion and faith i had in the game was gone. From there on out i really started to se the flaws in the \"gameplay\" and how 2 dimensional the charachters relly were.\n\nIt's kinda sad really beacuse even tho i don't play minecraft anymore it still have nostalgic value to me and telltale is a developer who has made several titels that i really do enjoy.\n\nThis is a Telltale titel i whould not recommend", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506108620, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506108620, "recommendationid": "35135786", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501482", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488645176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 166, "steamid": "76561198354077846", "num_games_owned": 98}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is like THE WALKING DEAD but wit lowest graphics.\n\ngood game though", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506334681, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506334681, "recommendationid": "35199918", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502154", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464062313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 269, "steamid": "76561198280185835", "num_games_owned": 55}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "10/10 story\n10/10 gameplay\n10/10 everything\n\nThis game really gives you a hard-on for true story based content and not these \"gameplay\" oriented games. Fuck gameplay man, I want to sit through a 6 minute cutscene of a combat scene that has potential to be an awesome free experience from the player. I played this by myself on my dad's work Macbook Pro, and it really made me appreciate Telltale's effort that they put into games nowadays. They've improved so much from that shitty \"Tales from the Borderlands\" game that is complete and utter garbage. It even surpasses the original minecraft because:\nIt has a story\nIt has items that aren't in Minecraft, like the Gauntlet Jesse and the gang use to find the Mythical Order of the Stone!\nThe Order of the Stone is also the most awesome superhero minecraft group of All Time, like this one guy can train enderman to do stuff and this other black guy can kill stuff really cool.\nI think we have to also thank whoever wrote the characters, such memorable characters such as Reuben and Axel, the fat piece of comedic relief. Character development in such a game is to be expected, as a story like this can not be complete without such amazing characters to defeat the legendary Wither Storm, an entity that consumes their entire world and them wanting to do nothing but help other people and save their home.\nLet's get to the real part, playing the game. On a Macbook Pro, this game still runs D!ck tickling well at a smooth 20 fps, but Im sure people with DESKTOP macs could run it at 30 fps. In my experience of playing this mastapeece, I played on ultra graphics at 4K for the optimal minecraft experience, of course. I had to save often, due to crashes and computer overheats, and had to take my dad's computer to the apple store because the battery had melted. He even took my allowance to pay for it, whatever dum-dum at least I still get my Mineshaft story mode.\nIn comparison to the minecraft books, this storyline takes the cake. For once it's not steve, it's Jesse! You can also play as a girl for some reason, which is stupid because girls can't replace the REAL Jesse.\nAt last, I'd like to thank DanTDM and stampy cat for showing me the game. Without them, I'd have never found my favorite game (besides FNAF 3 and Infinite Warfare campaign) I want to get it on xbox to, because this game deserves all of my allowance for being so fun!\n\n9/10 reuben dies", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505436998, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505436998, "recommendationid": "34961032", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499673", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465082836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 623, "steamid": "76561198126078799", "num_games_owned": 66}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Game is boring as hell.
