The atmosphere really sucks you in, and the physics of the ships feels just right - so much that it really aids the feel of the game. Watching the shells from your weapons arc across space is amazing to see, and you soon learn to target a little in front of where the enemies are (using the HUD... umm, weapon lead display that attaches to the enemy).\n\nI'm playing around with controls a bit, and mapped CTRL to DOWN, and SPACE to UP (as in strafe up/down). Seems to give a bit more maneuverability and easier than using the default Z/X for it. May try WASD as Up/Down/Left/Right with SPACE as forward, CTRL as back, X as BRAKE.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506140627, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506155699, "recommendationid": "35143850", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505139", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
