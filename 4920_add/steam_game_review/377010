Then you take the pretest. Go to where it suggests. I had to start at the beginner level. That's cool. But, when I quit the program to do other things (away from computer) it was still running in the background. Couldn't get it to start again. Turned off computer & booted it up again. Uninstalled & reinstalled. Worked a little better. Had to repeat the test again just to get to the pronunciation lesson. Did a little more work. Turned app off. Went back later, clicked on desktop shortcut. Said it was already running. Apparently it doesn't shut off. Turned off my computer again. Booted it back up. This program now won't start at all. I tried this several times today.\nSo I deleted & uninstalled this program.\nDon't buy this software here at Steam! It is missing quite a bit! It will crash! Your playtime will continue to accumulate even when you turn off this program! I went over the 'refund playtime limit' because I was trying to make this work.\nOh, hey! I deleted & uninstalled this from my Steam account. But I bought it from a different online store. Guess what? It freaking works great! Everything is there! No crashes. None of the problems I had with it through Steam. All the files (yes, lessons too!).\nMy recommendation:\nBuy from a different store, not through Steam.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1484846452, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1484856897, "recommendationid": "29359697", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591789", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
