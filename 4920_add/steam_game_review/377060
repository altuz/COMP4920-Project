If you enjoy action sport games or the SKATE francise, this might be for you. \nHowever, the game is still very much in Alpha phase but with enough feedback and testing this can become something truely awesome.\n\nThing that work great so far:\n- The park editor\n- Waypoints in Freeroam\n- Object placer\n- The tutorials\n- Different maps with different settings\n- Different characters\n- Different grinds, grabs, slides, etc\n\nMy main \"problems\" with the game ATM are:\n- No balance meter for grinds, you just have assume from the player model what way to lean.\n- No remapable controlls\n- Clunky movement (being able to skate on walls and bouncing meters high when hitting an wall, etc)\n- Bad momentum. This might have to with my limited playtime with the game but this game could do with more momentum and fast decision-making by for example: Gaining speed faster when holding/tapping A or having to hold the jump button less long to get a high jump.\n- Unlogical menus, this is very much a personal thing but it took a fair bit of searching to find a tutorial at first.\n- Mission hud not woking properly. When completing the first heat of events with multiple heats, the menu to either continue or stop doesn't work, instead it controlls your character in the background.\n\nI won't comment on maps for now as the devs have stated themselfs that they are still polishing them.\n\nI do however recommend buying this game very much!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504644918, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504816976, "recommendationid": "34764491", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477916", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506886542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 131, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 288, "steamid": "76561197969481587", "num_games_owned": 124}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is shaping up to be a true dedication to the sport of aggressive skating.
