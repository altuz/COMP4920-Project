Have yet to beat the game but it offers a challange with having to figure out the controls yourself which is easy for any true PC gamer. The atmosphere of the game is very unnerving and unsettling. If you do not like older games I would not recommend it to you since it is much like an old style game with new graphics. I love the puzzles and how far the saves are spread apart.
