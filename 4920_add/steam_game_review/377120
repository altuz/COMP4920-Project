Is it the best story telling? No, but I enjoyed it depite the predictability. I think that my 8 year old neice would really enjoy the story though as although it isn't complicated, it isn't babyish.\n\nI bought a few of these games when they were reduced on sale, I'm not sure I would pay full price for them (they seem to be about \u00a34-\u00a36 normally) but for \u00a32 on sale? Bargin!\n\n* I did not encounter any bugs with the game that were mentioned in older reviews.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505917428, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505917630, "recommendationid": "35084952", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "total_reviews": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 10}}
