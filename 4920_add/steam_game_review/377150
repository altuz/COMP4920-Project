The objective of the game is to capture your enemy's capital before they capture yours. You play on a hex-grid map with towns that you can capture to expand your production limits. The game is played in turns with each player taking their turn. In order to capture a town, you must send your unit into it and it will be considered captured the following turn. Your units can be upgraded to gain either active skills or passive skills.\n\nConclusion, wait till this game upgrades a few more stages before buying it. Pixeltales.ru needs to improve this game by a lot to catch up with other hex-grid games. It's too far behind at the moment.\n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. Potential\nI would say that it could grow into a much better game. However, there are many kinks to sort out.\n\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Pay To Win\nUnits and Heroes are locked behind a pay wall requiring one to pay cash to unlock heroes and types of units. E.g. Chief Engineer (Hero) and the Necromancer (Unit)\n\n2. Graphics\nVery dull. It's the plain kind. You need to spice it up to make it look more interesting. You could refer to Endless Legend or Age of Wonder for hex-grid battles with decent graphics.\n\n3. Tedium of Upgrading\nWhy do I need to click on my unit, find the super tiny upgrade button and click on it, just so I can choose which upgrade to take?\n\n4. Movement\n1 tile followed by another tile. Why can't I just click on the tile I want to go to and the AI will fill in the movement in between?\n\n[h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Units\nSpec an initial build so units that are produced come in that build, rather than having to upgrade mid battle\n\n2. Movement\nFinal tile movement, that's it.

The majority of top players have never paid us real money. We chose the FTP model because the game is multiplayer-oriented and players themselves are interested in this model, if they want to find opponents for games.\n\n2.\tThe three basic units are enough to play strong; the other units just add the variability. Also to prevent our game from becoming P2W, we add the possibility to select the rating group for searching the opponents - you always can play against players with similar levels as yours!\n\n3.\tMoreover, the game has the tournaments mode, where every player can earn gold, using all what the game contains right away. If someone thinks that the reason of his defeats is the lack of units or heroes, he can play tournament mode up to 3 defeats in a week.\n\n4.\tThe need to specify each hexes is critically important for our game, because each step can change the outcome of the game. At the time of writing this review you have been playing for 0.2 hours. In the description of our game we placed the particular emphasis on that fact that this game focuses on multiplayer. If you had played several multiplayer games, the most of your questions would have been settled.\n\n5.\tUpgrades during the battles are critically important precisely because our game is not P2W! We strive to create the same conditions for all our players, in such a manner that no one has a priori the more \"powerful\" units, than the opponent has. And that's the way it is for players who play tournaments mode as well as for players who have unlocked all upgrades in the game. Besides, different ways and methods to upgrade units during the battle add lots of variability.\n\nWe emphasize once again that we have already written on the game page, in the video and etc., to prevent players, who aren't interested in that kind of game, from even downloading it in vain: our game is intended for those players, who are interested in turn-based multiplayer. For those players who prefer other kinds of games (not turn-based or turn-based but in single player mode), there are a lots of interesting games, much more interesting than \"Tactical Genius Online\" and we don't even try to compete with them.\n\nThanks for recognizing the potential of the game :)", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492869", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485649771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 74, "steamid": "76561198041499813", "num_games_owned": 107}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "How to win at tatical genius online:\n\nPlay a rogue.\n\nBore the other opponent to death.\n\nThis game is boring.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485648653, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485648653, "recommendationid": "29553136", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478951", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485277240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 701, "steamid": "76561198331149062", "num_games_owned": 4}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "fun lazy game, really worth trying", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485097994, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485097994, "recommendationid": "29423983", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 15, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
