I'm going to have to fall on the side of not recommending it, but if you are bored and have a spare 2-4 hours it's not a bad experience by any means.\n\nPale Echos is one of those cases where even though the game may quack like a duck, waddle like a duck, and look like a duck - it's not really a duck. Yes it's an rpg maker game, and yes it is a blend of a story, a combat system, and a progression system of sorts, but it I wouldn't want to compare it to other rpgs. \n\nThe game is divided into locations, and you will visit each location in turn until you reach the final location and end the game. Other than choosing whether or not to visit an optional location every now and then, you do not really get a choice of where to go next. You choose the next location on the menu, and away you go.\n\nAt a location, you will explore two worlds - the world that is, and the world of memories of what was. Everything is contained in a single section that is roughly the size of a typical jrpg town. You build a \"party\" out of the memories you find in these two worlds, but sometimes are asked to lose a memory to proceed. Upon talking to some of the memories, instead of joining you they will fight. There are also secrets to find on the map, so check every nook and cranny.\n\nCombat is not what you will expect. On each turn, you summon memories out of your party to fight, but they will fight on that turn only. If you run out of memories to fight, the combat is over. You have health but memories don't. Each memory has a different set of skills that work best in a given situation. So the most important aspect of doing well in a fight is summoning your memories in the right order. Since you will be losing memories on the location map in order to progress, they are also the main resource of the game. You don't want to leave yourself without a particular skill.\n\nThe story is where the game really falls down for me. The premise is a kind of healing of the land after ait has been completely obliterated, while also trying to learn why the world ended. I like games about restoring a world, but the story structure here is lacking something. I never felt empathy for the world that was lost or the main characters of the game. Certain aspects were interesting, but not enough of it was truly engaging. I found myself playing until the end because the aspect of making sure you find all of the codex entries and collect all ofthe memories was addicting enough.\n\nThe combat also is not quite as good as I think it could have been. Although you collect many memories (your party goes up to about 20 large) none of them feel distinctive. The abilities they have are all very similar, to the point that as long as I could get away with it, I summoned them at random just to get through combat quickly. You restore all of your health afterwards, so there is little incentive to do well at combat, besides making it through. While the puzzle aspect of combat was very cool, about halfway through the game it became gimmicky and stopped interesting me.\n\nBut overall it's a pretty fun romp with some pleasingly fresh twists that make it stand out, despite not being as good as it could have been.\n\n+ zero randomness in combat - solve the puzzle\n+ collect and lose party members - decide who to say goodbye to\n+ collecting things keeps you going\n+ several new game plus modes (I didn't quite like the game enough to go for them)\n\n- repetative combat and areas\n- story about big topics fails to sell it\n- very linear\n\nIt was OK for a 3 hour game. I'd love to see the developer make another game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501737484, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501737484, "recommendationid": "33985613", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505371", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
