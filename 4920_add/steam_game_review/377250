The game looks great, love the story, love the premise.  Has a unique feel to it.\n\nI do find the controlling the drone unnecessarily challenging.  For example, the drone moves a bit herky jerky at times with the right stick, and trying to hover over things to collect them is harder than it needs to be.  Smoothing out the controls along with adding a snap to grid type system for the drone when hovering over and collecting items would make more sense.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443203558, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1443203558, "recommendationid": "18188986", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502982", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443129066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 582, "steamid": "76561198082548144", "num_games_owned": 271}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "get dosh or die tryin'", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446954892, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1446954892, "recommendationid": "18944899", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
