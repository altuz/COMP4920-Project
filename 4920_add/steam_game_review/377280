The battle arsenal contains few upgradable towers and on some maps a maze that you can define yourself.\n\n[b] Gameplay & Story: 3/10 [/b]\nSadly this game does not offer a story at all, like some other tower defence games manage to do, instead it just throws you into the level with some minor tutorial on how to place and upgrade towers. The gameplay overall is absolutely boring since each level is almost the same - hordes of enemies walking down a pre-defined path that in some cases you can alter by building a maze on the way. It takes quite a while until you unlock all the towers and their functions and that makes the game feel rather slow.\n\n[b] Combat & Challenge : 4/10 [/b]\nIf you played any TD before, you will most likely build on the right spots from the first try even on hard difficulty. The worst part about the challenge in this game is that sometimes one single tower of a single type at special time decides if you finish the level without leaks. On the first level for example you build Arrow-Arrow-Cannon-Arrow. If you build for example 3 Arrows, you will leak. If you build two cannons - you will leak. That makes the game feel absolutely static and without multiple alternative solutions like it is mostly in good TD games where you can use different strategies for building your defence levels.\n\n[b] Graphic & Interface : 3/10 [/b]\nThe graphics in this game are simple and sadly look absolute lifeless. Its like chess pieces moving on a board - nor the enemies nor the environment have any special details or graphical immersion effects.\n\n[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 3/10 [/b]\nAs stated before, the progress is simply based upon waiting for enemies to run into your towers and if you leak, you simply restart and build another tower in the same order.\n\n[b] Audio & Immersion : 3/10 [/b]\nBoth the sound and the music are absolutely boring. The narrator/advisor voice starts to get on your nerves after few minutes aswell.\n\n[b] Side-Notes [/b]\n[list]\n[*]This game is single player only.\n[*]This game contains no steam achievements.\n[*]This game offers none to minimal replayability. Once you passed the level, there is no reason replaying besides finishing it without leaks.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Summary [/b]\nAlarameth TD is a boring grindy tower defence game, without any real strength but quite some weaknesses. There are tons of tower defence games that offer you a story, better sounds and immersion, far better progress system than simply retrying same level with same order and just witching towers one by one until you figured perfect combination for finishing without leaking.\n\nI hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game.
