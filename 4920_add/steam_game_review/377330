So much so I even went to get the goodie bag. What got me into this game was I saw a playthrough on youtube of Red Haze, and I heard this game was related to it, so I thought I'd check it out. I'm glad I did!\n\nI'm someone whose been into the horror genre since I was twelve, despite being a pretty big weenie myself, haha. Close Your Eyes managed to scare me, but it was mostly due to the sounds and atmosphere, it kept making me feel like something was gonna happen, like some kind of freakish monster was going to pop out of nowhere and chase me. The soundtrack in my opinion was great, it had an uneasy air to it, where as the songs in the game were pretty catchy. I'm talking about the ending credits and the pancake scene here. \nThe artwork is also pretty good, and does well for the style of the game. Close Your Eyes has multiple endings as well, all of which are pretty easy to obtain. (Except for maybe like, one or two.) I managed to complete this game with all endings in around 4 hours, so it's pretty short. Probably would've been shorter if I wasn't lost in the teleporter maze, searching for the \"Totally Canon Ending\".\nMy last pro for this game would be the voiceacting. Gosh, the voiceacting. It was really good, especially for a freeware game. The Host in particular was amazing!\n\nNow, as with every game that has pros, theres of course cons as well.\n\nAlthough darkness can add to atmosphere, I felt the game was too dark. It was really dark almost throughout the whole game and it made it really hard to see where I was going most the time. \nTheres a couple good puzzles in the game, but about two had me sitting there, scratching my head in confusion. I'm glad there were guides for those two segments because I felt I probably would of been stuck otherwise.\n Now, theres also a segment where you're in a mansion and have to collect a bunch of keys. I personally didn't have trouble with it and found all the keys rather fast, but I can see how it could get a little irritating for some people. I feel it lasted a little too long and may of been made to artifically make the game longer.\n\n My last con for this game would be the deaths. The default ending screen isn't bad, but my complaint here would be it doesn't make sense for every scenario. Like if you get shot by a gun and bleed to death, it doesn't exactly make sense that there would be a death screen of you being hung. I think a good way to counter this is to make different ending screens for different ways of dying. (An example of a game doing this is Kio's Adventure, though not the best example, it's one I can name off the top of my head.)\n\nI felt this game was pretty dang good, and it's unfortunate it's not well known. I hope it'll increase in popularity over time, and I'll continue to support the developer! \n\nI recommend this game to those who enjoy rpg horrors or would like a relatively quick game to play in their sparetime, and if you enjoy the game enough, I also recommend to get the goodie bag dlc to support the developer.\n\n\nA side note: Marshmallow Monk is adorable and I love him.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504664437, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504664437, "recommendationid": "34768191", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 67, "total_reviews": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
