It is truly a walking simulator. You keep walking. Once in a while there are puzzles to do, some of them wthout sense. As you proceed you learn a story about a family. In my pc version parts of the narration were missing.

Aiming the \"orb\" is a bit annoying though, but you get used to it fairly quickly.\n\n\nAll in all, I thought this was an \"okay\" game and I was on the fence about recommending it.  While I cannot recommend this game at the full $15 price, it's worthy of playing if you get it cheaper and you are into walking sim/puzzle games.  My first play through took about 2 1/2 hours, but I did wander off multiple times checking for picture pieces... so a quick playthrough would probably take about 90 minutes if you weren't interested in those pieces.  However, playing a game like this shouldn't be rushed, it's best if you take your time and fully immerse yourself into this world.\n\nI would like to see what this developer comes up with in the future, while this game was a bit on the mediocre side, it did show me there is potential here.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503258372, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503359737, "recommendationid": "34380951", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507703", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 9}}
