The game methodology is fairly straightforward. They mix up hexagonal, colored wheels, and then you put them back in order. The hexes are in color (there is a colorblind option as well that includes patterns on the hexes) and the hub of each of the wheels tells you what hex colors go there. There are also mixed colors (yellow and red = orange; blue and yellow = green; red and blue = purple). The mixed colored hexes are, as you\u2019ve probably figured out, for where the wheels overlap. The first two puzzle rounds show you how you will solve the remainder of the puzzles, and then you go through four grades of 12 puzzles.\n\nPRO: Very easy to learn, very relaxing and enjoyable. Good graphic representation.\n\nCON: No additional downloadable puzzles. Once you\u2019ve gone through the 48 puzzles you can go into the options menu reset so that you can run through them again, but there is not a more difficult level to put to the puzzles. I would have loved to see more combinations.\n\nWorth the money? I would say a bit high, but I would like the programmers to give me more content so I would say it is fair enough. Would I pick it up on a Steam sale?

I did complete the game in its entirety with all challenge stars, and felt like I was playing a flash game the entire time. That's not inherently a bad thing- there are some very good flash games out there, but this just felt... average when compared to an average pool.\n\nThe only gameplay mechanic is rotating a group of 6 hexes around predetermined centerpoints, to recreate the starting colors. Red touch red, Orange touch red and yellow, and so on. Points where all 3 colors connect are gray instead of the expected white, and only show up late. This mechanic works very well and feels almost like unraveling a Rubik's Cube: but ultimately it came down to solving a few hexes on the edge and working to the other side. The final moves were a matter of fiddling around until it worked, which wasn't terribly engaging. I suppose I could have logically worked out a series of moves that would swap two arbitrary tiles, but I never needed to.\n\nThere are 48 levels, grouped into 4 groups of 12. At first glance it looks like there are twice as many puzzles as this, with 1 and 1-star: but the starred puzzle areas are exactly the same but with the ability to get the time and move stars (most of which are calibrated WAAYYYY too loosely). Why aren't these always accessible?\n\n4-11 was too large and felt very tedious. I was on autopilot- I guess that's fine for a relaxing puzzle game, but this just felt like a timekiller.\n\nI've played other pure puzzle games for far longer without them getting old- Everyday Genius: SquareLogic is literally just Kenken, but there are some novel additions and most puzzles felt different. HexCells is very similar to Minesweeper, but again, the puzzles felt fairly distinct and there were twists added to keep the interest high. Prismatica starts off average in terms of interest and only decreases from there.\n\nI played the entire game on mute. Couldn't stand the soundbyte that played on beating a level.\n\nNote: this is me not recommending the game. This is not me saying this is a bad game- it's not. But I wouldn't call it good either.

The gameplay is pretty much shown in the trailer.

I don't really listen to the music when I'm playing puzzle games to be honest. The noise after you beat a level is pretty great though. It makes you feel like you accomplished something phenomenal.\n\nOnly minor issue with the game is the wrong cog may turn sometimes which makes it rather hard to do things quickly unfortunately. Also, if you are anything like me and you get in to the zone and accidentally rotate the wrong cog you might freak out and try to correct it and end up rotating another wrong cog and just completely ruin your puzzle. \n\nThankfully there's a color blind mode because the orange doesn't look like orange and I'm sure color blind people would get a kick out of this game too. $5 seems a little steep to be honest, however the $2 i got it for seems a little on the cheap side since there's 8 worlds with 12 levels each (that I can see right off the bat.)
