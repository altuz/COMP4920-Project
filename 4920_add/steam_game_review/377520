The reviewers may have had slightly too rigid notions of what might happen in a real war, but for the most part I do not disagree with their comments.  My defense of Pike & Shot regarding these objections is that the developers have done a fantastic job of balancing realism with playability and balance.  In fact, I feel that the game is incredibly good that way.  In my opinion, fixing small realism issues is not worth the risk of reducing the playability and balance.  The progression of the difficulty levels is good.  It has been a lot of work to get good at the game, but very rewarding.  Easy enough to get started, a lot of work to get better, but a ton of fun getting there.  And still a lot of fun to keep playing even though I have recently reached a plateau in my mastery.  And you can see how many hours it took me, although you should divide the number by 2 or 3 because I don't think that the hours played is sensitive to inactive periods.\n\nThe place that I have come to is to play Campaigns, at Lieutenant General difficulty (difficulty 4 out of 5).  After a recent campaign where I struggled to win in 17 game-years, I feel like I should be able to win at this level in 3-10 game-years on the first try with any new combination of opposing army lists.  There are 5 campaign turns per game-year.  I much prefer campaigns for two reasons.  Firstly, the typical multi-player opponent seems to be much better at it than I am.  Secondly, I like the opportunity to recover from mistakes and build on successes and develop the skill level of units.\n\nKeep in mind that the \"Campaign\" element of a campaign in this game is very light.  It is mostly a string of battles, good old-fashioned board-game-like battles as some other reviewers have said.  No research, no management of the economy, no resource types, none of that.  But keep in mind that these facts probably made it feasible to develop a game with such good balance and playability and re-playability.\n\nIt may not be your cup of tea.  As a variation on this metaphor, you may like tea or you may like coffee, or you may like both.  I like both.   I love this game but I also look forward to trying some of the games with real depth to the strategic and economic aspects.

Because the military tactics of this period are not familiar with most people, knowing how a cuirassier would match up against a tercio isn't straightforward. That said, the tutorial will get you on your feet and the manual is excellent.\n\nBattles are won by thoughtful pre-planning and making calculated decisions in chaotic situations in order to break enemy morale and rout them from the battlefield. One key feature that makes this game unique from other games is that you lose direct control of your units once they engage in melee. It makes sense from a realistic standpoint; armies would often pursue routing armies after winning a melee skirmish.\n\nThis may sound like an annoyance, but it adds more weight to your decisions. It might seem like a good idea to engage in melee and rout the fractured enemy unit in front of you, but you could be easily flanked by enemy calvary sitting behind enemy lines. Taking this into consideration and executing a successful plan is really satisfying.\n\nThere's a TON of content in this game. There are hundreds of hours worth of singeplayer content in the game and many more in the form of player-made mods. Some of them look really cool, like Napoleonic or Victorian era skirmishes. The vanilla campaigns and skirmishes themselves are awesome and it's a really fun way to learn about a period of history that is rarely covered in games and other forms of media. The random battle generator is excellent. This game also runs really well on low-end hardware.\n\nIf you pick this up, I recommend you get the sound and music mods on the game's forum. The base SFX and music are really weak.\n\nI really hope the developer continues to support this game in the future. I'd LOVE to see achievements and trading cards, and I think an ironman mode would be perfect. \n\ntl;dr: Excellent turn-based tactics game, definitely worth a buy if you like strategy with even a small interest in this time period.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492522037, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492522219, "recommendationid": "31218436", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510969", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496384698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 702, "steamid": "76561198090322645", "num_games_owned": 61}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I play mostly offline, so don't be mistaken by the low hour count. I don't recommend this game, for two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that the game leaves you very little choice in how to play it. That starts with force selection: The number of units of a specific type is strictly limited, with several already being pre-selected by the game. No, I don't want those horse dudes, I want more foot skirmishers to screen my Tercios. Well bad luck; the designer doesn't allow me to.\n\nAnd he doesn't want me to set up and command the units as I wish. The setup zone is quite small, and the way units interact with one another once combat commences further limits your choices. Whether or not you can charge an enemy, for instance, is dependent on whether your unit type is allowed to charge the enemy unit type (many infantry units are not allowed to charge cavalry), and you can charge only if the targeted unit is your unit's \"priority target\" (i.e., the greatest possible threat). That in effect means the game prevents many choices you could make and tactics you could come up with. Not being allowed to charge those pesky Cuirassiers theatening my flank because my perfectly positioned infantry unit has only 40% pikes (still leaving me with more pikemen than there are Cuirassiers) really sucks.\n\nControl you have over your units is further limited by close combat (which ends either by victory or rout, not by you choosing to disengage), by fleeing, which can spread panic among neighbouring units, and by pursuing, which you cannot interrupt. Thus, there will be battles in which you spend entire turns looking at your units doing stuff you didn't order them to do. All this greatly limits your choices and your freedom as a player. Furthermore, battles effectively end when one side realises it is about to lose. That means, again and again: You fight off the enemy onslaught, move your units into position to deliver the final blow and eagerly click \"end turn\". Now it's payback time, you think with an evil grin on your face. Well you think wrong. The game will end the battle because \"the enemy lost heart\", depriving you of all the joy of smashing him to tiny bits. No fun at all.\n\nTo be fair though, much of the criticism above is against design decisions that are comprehensible, and even laudable in their own way. I do have some knowledge of warfare in the 16th century, having read Wilhelm R\u00fcstow's Geschichte der Infanterie, Delbr\u00fcck's History of the Art of War and Oman's Art of War in the Sixteenth Century, among other books, and lots of stuff on the Military Revolution debate, and I acknowlege that the designer has done some very respectable research into the mechanics of pike & shot warfare and early modern army composition. Thus, if you won't find too many foot skirmishers in Western European armies prior to the French Wars of Religion, that's actually quite accurate; if you quickly lose control over your units during combat or find units refusing to charge, that is spot on, and if battles are won by panic spreading after a unit routs, not by slaughtering an unbreakable enemy to the last man, that is realistic. 16th-century armies are neither Borg nor Space Marines. And they didn't set up in the map corner to prevent flanking.\n\nThus, the game design has its purpose. And there are genuinely good aspects about Pike & Shot. One of these is the simulation of unit cohesion. Unit cohesion in the early modern period was arguably more important for battlefield effectivenes than individual weapon skills (which separates the Pike & Shot era from the Middle Ages, or European armies from Oriental ones). The game simulates that; units in the game can be \"steady\", which means they fight at full effectiveness, they can be \"disrupted\", which greatly reduces their effectivity, or \"fragmented\" which almost nullifies it. There were those cases in which a Tercio's arquebusiers sought protection under the pikes, involuntarily pushing them upwards, which then made the whole unit vulnerable to a cavalry charge. This is exactly what the \"fragmented\" state simulates: A unit which is ineffective not because of the number, training or equipment of its men, but because order and coolheadedness have been lost. An effective way to win battles is to concentrate fire on a single unit, causing fragmentation, and then charging in to cause a rout which might spread panic among the enemy.\n\nObviously, the way the game works is due to design decisions which value above all else historical accuracy (or rather, the way the designer interprets and simulates it), not so much player freedom. That is very respectable and will find its fans, but I'm not one of them. Furthermore, I don't quite see why in a skirmish mode battle I am not allowed to try an army composition I prefer.\n\nThe second reason for me not liking the game is the combat results it produces. And this is what kills the game for me. I constantly have the feeling that the computer cheats (which it doesn't; you and the AI are treated as equals by the game engine). A single light artillery units takes one shot to cause monstrous casualties and \"disrupt\" my huge 2000-man regular Tercio, two more salvoes by Dutch 500-man battalions (250 musketeers each) rout it; swapping forces, I never cause more casualties than 9 (prediction: 1-63) to a huge Tercio with my heavy (!) artillery at short (!) range  and can never even \"disrupt\" it, and my Dutch battalions are whipped from the field in two turns. In other battles, my noble Gendarmes charge an average quality Cuirassiers unit and lose the melee, Tartars wreak havoc among my troops with their bows, whilst my firearms cause neglibile damage, and so on. \n\nYes, fortune is fickle, especially in war. But the casualties a unit causes and takes seem excessively random to me, as is the chance of it getting \"disrupted\" or \"fragmented\". That is arguably an issue within the (boardgame-based) game engine. After my elite Spanish Tercio Viejo, charging on even ground an average quality Dutch late Tercio and outnumbering it almost 2:1, was unable to rout this enemy in several rounds of melee combat and took as many casualties at it caused, I quit playing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495391682, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496157390, "recommendationid": "31888495", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520776", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504020790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 409, "steamid": "76561198020050631", "num_games_owned": 140}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "i really really wanted to love that game, i only have a few hours in but no more interest in playing.\n\nit just feels like this game constantly needs to put the player at a numerical disadvantage. either the enemy flees from battle or gets insane amounts of reinforcements.\n\ni'd rather have a good AI\n\nalso:\nthe combat dosnt't make sense too often, yourinfantry cant meele cav, even if said cav is itself in meele with your own right-effing-in-front-of-them.\n\ncav generally breaks super easy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496353480, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496353480, "recommendationid": "32116071", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504129", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497990845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3947, "steamid": "76561198080482213", "num_games_owned": 23}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game has such potential, but has problems with the combat system where luck always prevails over quality. \nI am a wargamer and though I like the period did not want to buy figurs and paint etc. So this game looked good,\nSadly this is not the case, I dont mind losing... but when your playing easy mode and the AI opponent with less\npoints outnumbers you and his poor units hammer your elites.
