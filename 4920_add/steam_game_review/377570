I don't recommend this game simply because it feels unfinished. I would expect an indie game to be a little unpolished, but this one is too much so. The developers have a great thing going and I could see this being very fun if they just finished making it. \n\nFor example, asteroid defense gives you limited shots, but does not display that anywhere, the \"asteroids\" are just squares with no curvature at all. Race mode does not show what lap the player is on. I had a little trouble even figuring out what the track was.\n\nThe game is lacking some basic animation as well. Unlike the Asteroids game we know and love, the asteroids do not break apart or even appear to explode. They literally just disappear when hit. Not even a few pixel dots scatter. \n\nSo overall I found it disappointing to say the least. An otherwise great and probably well-selling game fell short due to some lazy programming. I would say to the creators to pick it back up and just focus on user experience.
