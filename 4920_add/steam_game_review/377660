Sounds easy but I assure you it's much more complicated than that. Some of the blocks are bolted down and can\u2019t move while others are forced to move when moving a different block. This type of puzzle is not the kind that you end up getting frustrated at when you can\u2019t solve it since the game lets you progress to the next level if you can find the hidden pear in every level. The soundtrack is very nice and goes with the game very well and can even be purchased on Bandcamp if you wish.\n\nI found this in my discovery queue and was instantly reminded of the original Blockwick that I played on iOS a long time ago. Kieffer Bros. has another game on iOS called Aqueduct and that\u2019s how I found out about them. Since I was very familiar with this developer I decided to give this game on steam a try and I think you should to. And if you decide you don\u2019t love this beautiful masterpiece of a game you can always return it if you want, that is if you haven\u2019t played it for too long.\n\nAlso really hoping that even though Aqueduct was made natively for iOS and Android I hope that the devs decide to port it over to steam.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498709734, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498709952, "recommendationid": "32972246", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507793", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "total_reviews": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
