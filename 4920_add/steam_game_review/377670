I'm glad I listened to the raving endorsements of my fellow VN-loving friends and didn't give up a second time, as pushing through to the meat of the narrative was well worth it.  I can't remember the last time a VN (or book for that matter) had me up until the wee hours of the night unable to pull myself away from the intrigue.  The Devil on G-String is a compelling crime drama that had me second guessing everything I thought I knew for almost its entire length before smacking me with a gut-wrenching finale that stuck with me long after I was done.  \n \nIt's difficult to offer a short description of the story without giving anything away, but I'll try.  Our protagonist is Kyousuke Azai, a young man living a dual life of high school student in the day and yakuza underling at night.  Kyousuke isn't your regular yakuza thug, however.  Adopted by one of the organization's most ruthless leaders, he's stuck in the precarious position of paying off old family debts while trying to drag himself out from under his foster father's abusive thumb.  When an awkward young woman transfers to his high school class, life spirals out of control as he's dragged into the vendetta between Usami Haru and the mysterious criminal mastermind named Maou.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1083518166  \nThat little synopsis doesn't even scratch the surface of the story as the plot twists and turns in ways that will have you dizzy before long.  Kidnap, murder, betrayal, deceit, revenge - there are very few atrocities not touched upon, and the writers bring it all to life with fast-paced action, vivid imagery, and lively banter between the characters.  Even the narration is excellently paced with a rhythm that ebbs and flows with the action.  Rich descriptions and familiar cultural references that don't feel ham-fisted leave little question in my mind that the translators did one hell of a job localizing this brilliant piece of fiction.  \n\nUnfortunately, the side routes are where the excellence falters.  Serving as little more than fluff-filled diversions from the main plot, they slow down the narrative and prevent the reader from getting to the meat of the story for far too long.  Yes, they add some back story to Kyousuke, but it's not enough to make the amount of time you'll spend reading through them worth it.  When I do read it again (which I indeed will at some point), I'll be skipping them entirely.   \n\nThe overall presentation is phenomenal with gorgeous artwork and so many CGs I felt like I was watching a movie at times.  The voice overs are also extremely well done, and I'd suggest picking up the voice pack if you happen to have the extra dollars (though the story is good enough to hold its own without them).  I only wished the soundtrack was a little more memorable.  I know that sounds odd considering it's comprised entirely of arrangements of classical masterpieces, but I feel like the sound quality of the instrumentation used just doesn't do them justice.  At least they weren't disruptive to the story at all.   \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1083517450\nI really wish I could delve further into explaining just why you NEED to read this, but doing so would only ruin the experience.  So I will leave you with this: If you enjoy well-written thrillers that will have you on the edge of your seat one moment and holding back tears the next, then you need to read The Devil on G-String.  It really is one of the best visual novels I've read in quite some time.  It's disappointing that relatively few people have read it, as it truly is an underrated gem that needs to be appreciated.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500606508, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500640521, "recommendationid": "33687168", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625694", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500993476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2449, "steamid": "76561198110568856", "num_games_owned": 64}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you like any of the following:\n\n-Crime busting\n-Mystery\n-Thriller\n-Romance\n-Intense drama\n-Tear jerkers\n\nThen this VN is for you.  If you said yes to all of them, then this VN may have literally been made just for you.\n\nG-Senjou no Maou is a really good story which I won't even spoil a shred of because you won't want me to.\n\nThere are 3 side routes which diverge from the \"one true ending\".  Actually, nothing in the one true ending seems to happen  in the other side routes.\n\nThe 3 other routes are mostly fluff.  (Mostly) sweet tiny romance stories about three of the other characters that are there along your story, two being school friends, and one being your step-sister.  However, it's important to play them at least once, and you'll know why once you finish the main route.\n\nI have one and only one warning.  This game has been perfectly made.  There are quite literally no drawbacks.  You could say that the long dialogue is a \"drawback\", but every bit of dialogue in the game is important, so if you're there for the story, it won't matter.\n\nThe warning is that you will think about the game.  You'll question the way you think.  With the ending that it has, you will question your sense of justice and your sense of right and wrong, and you'll probably stick with this question: \"Was it really fair?\"\n\nG-Senjou no Maou has [b] the most bittersweet endings in any story I have ever read or seen. [/b]  Whether it be anime, other visual novels, manga, light novels, novels, chapter books, biographies; you name it, it won't outdo this.\n\nGranted, that's just what I've seen, though I've gone through many stories.  Even all that said, G-Senjou no Maou has, hands down, the most bittersweet ending that I have ever witnessed, and I couldn't hold back tears at all.  Tears and anger at the unjustice of it.\n\nI won't spoil much.  In fact, I don't think any of this has spoiled anything of the story, but you're free to let your mind wander.\n\nMy real, true warning is that if you can't handle, in your current mental state, a story that will tug your heartstrings like a puppeteer playing cruelly with its least favourite puppet, then don't start now.  Wait until you're better.  Wait until you have someone to talk about the ending to and hold.  You'll need that someone.  [b] Trust me.
