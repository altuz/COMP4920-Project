While it doesn\u2019t do anything especially original, it tells an enjoyable story, with fairly serious and tasteful approach to relationship arcs and rather timid, but well thought-out eroticism. While it has love scenes, it\u2019s presenting them with literary descriptions rather than explicit artwork (illustration stops at partial nudity) \u2013 the approach I very much appreciated.\n\nThe artwork in general and music, while somewhat simple, complement the story very well and some situational illustrations were a joy to look at, even though they weren\u2019t super-heavy on details. The \u201cindie\u201d feel is very much present through the whole experience, but never gets in the way, even if sometimes I had a feeling that the writing could be better if a larger team worked on it. I think I\u2019ve also seen rare misspellings and strange grammar. It wasn\u2019t a major complain though and the story itself was very much gratifying \u2013 while short, it didn\u2019t lack amusing dialogues, good character development and rewarded multiple playthroughs, uncovering new lore, showing the major story points from new angles depending on the player choices and offered a bunch of distinct endings.\n\nOne thing that made me wonder is the portrayal of yuri romance itself \u2013 while I think that the writing for the main character seemed solid and believable in most ways, her (and other female character\u2019s) sexual attraction towards women is never explicitly mentioned/elaborated upon. As Aria is a high-schooler, she\u2019s either atypically certain about her orientation or the writers just didn\u2019t think to add that angle to the story \u2013 and I think it would benefit from it quite a lot. She seems uncertain about her feeling and don\u2019t properly read her best friend Melody\u2019s intentions, but the way it was presented in the story makes her feel just dense, rather than properly confused by her unusual feelings. Other than that I find all the characters rather interesting and having decent depth for such a short story (although it shows mostly if you follow their separate romance routes).\n\n[b]In general, I\u2019ve found this game very enjoyable and I can recommend it to anyone liking VNs or just looking for a nice romance story to read. I\u2019ve bought it on -50% sale though and it felt like pretty much the right price for the content offered, $15 could have been a bit too much[/b].", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503150484, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503790098, "recommendationid": "34350860", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503026812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 849, "steamid": "76561198092621084", "num_games_owned": 41}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's not a perfect VN. The biggest issue that perhaps the final route is a disappointing patchwork of reused scenes and only a smattering of genuinely well-written, unique scenes. But taking the rest of the game into consideration, it's got solid writing and a very unique, attractive art style. Characters are all loveable in their own way. One of the most attractive well done aspects is that the all the love scenes are thoughtful, touching, and sexy without being gratuitous. Also, the music is pretty good. Would recommend if you like yuri VNs.

You play as Aria, who is your typical  teenager. She has three romance options, and she has lots of choices that influence the game and what ending you will get. Choices are varied and there is plently of these choices.  The story was engaging, and the setting really fit with the games overall narrative. Music was well done and the artsyle is unique and I quite liked it. Each character including Aria had a distinct personality and they all had some depth, and didn't feel one dimensional. The story ended with a great conclusion, and there is a decent amount of replayability. The only thing that was lacking was there was no voice acting, nor any dialog sound. Everything is silent, besides the background music and the occasional sound effects.
