I bought this because I thought it might be related to this Grisaia thing I had been hearing about. Then I found out it was  a separate universe, so I decided to read it first. It is a kinetic novel (no choices), and while the topic should be serious (save the world stuff), it is written more as a comedy. Especially with the main character being a complete airhead...\n\nFor and example of some of the comedy... early on Michiru is hit by a shooting star. This is the statement the novella makes: \"The reason her body appears unscathed, despite receiving a direct hit from that star, is because we don't want to have to mosaic out 90% of the screen. Probably.\"\n\nAnyway, it is a riot... and has enough action (which I suspect based on the cliffhanger ending will ramp up in Volume 2).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501817875, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501817875, "recommendationid": "34007216", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "total_reviews": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
