Have this game since I was 7. I am close now to 22. Had it on my birthday. It's expected I would have beaten it by now, but nope. It's the only PS1 game that I still haven't finished to this day. PS1 broke, PS2 broke, PS3 doesn't read memory cards. Won't get past CD3, as i was near the end of it anyway.\n\nBut, I did buy this game as soon as it was released on steam. Shamefully, the backdrops quality are a bit lacking, for an \"HD Release\", so to say. Good thing is, a user made \"HD\" backdrops as a mod for the game, which makes it more bareable to play, and I haven't put it off since getting that mod. Only reason I put this game off for a while, was due to school life. Haven't grabbed it since, as I have a few other games I want to finish first, before grabbing FF IX once more.\n\nStory wise, I consider IX the best of all FF games. \n\"Better than VII?! Are you mad?!\" I hear some say. Well yes, yes I am mad, but here I will state my point: Final Fantasy IX for me, is a fantasy game. More than VII was. More than X was. It has the personality of the older FF games, with the refined stories of the more recent games before the release of IX. VII had great characters. VIII had them too. IX perfected it's story telling, the individuality, troubles and griefs of each character. No one seems the same, and all seem unique.\nMaybe I am biased, since this was the first Final Fantasy game I own, and it has a deeply emotional attatchment to me, but I cannot feel the same emotions with FF VII's death scene, as I feel with FF IX's \"You're not alone\" scene.", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1506381482, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506381482, "recommendationid": "35212255", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502194705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 832, "steamid": "76561198046513997", "num_games_owned": 112}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "EPIC GAME!!!! it seams different when i played as a kid!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504599148, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504599148, "recommendationid": "34751946", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504514", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506635588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2358, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5031, "steamid": "76561198007356037", "num_games_owned": 333}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Probably the best in the series.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506635780, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506635780, "recommendationid": "35274088", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507153523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1540, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1979, "steamid": "76561198169569108", "num_games_owned": 45}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Bloody love this game ff at it's best \ud83d\udc4d", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506875394, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506875394, "recommendationid": "35388349", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506905241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561198052006705", "num_games_owned": 668}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Apparently \"Remastered\" means putting a graphics filter over the characters and leaving the backgrounds a shitty mess while adding a few simple things, like the option to skip videos and battles..
