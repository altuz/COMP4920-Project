Well the story's not over yet! Lots of newer models out and DLC guests included too even from familiar games! There's also several remixed pieces of soundtrack along with original songs back from previous games. There's also still Beam Duels (i.e: previous Darius games, and Metal Black)\n\nNewbie Cadet, are you not good with the Scrolling Shooter games much? Or is this the first time you've seen one and thought \"that looks fun!\" or \"geez, it looks hard...\"? Well fear not, there's a special \"Infinite Lives\" mode so even if you can't fly properly, you will never see \"Game Over! You Lose!\" on the screen no matter unless you quit the game, or the only other \"Game Over!\" you'll see is because you successfully beaten the final boss of a path and your mission is over till the next one. This also helps vets alike too for some solid practice, and you can go with the family on the fly too! (I actually did recently!)\n\nLooking for a story mode? This one has a massive one: Chronicle Mode is immense and you can even gain points to purchase different fighters for the situation, lots of replayability, varying challenges, etc.\n\nGreat game, one of the top 10 shooters I recommend on my favorites list, and 1st place for even a new flyer to fly like a bird!
