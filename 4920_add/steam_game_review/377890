The game play is sort of a mix between Galcon and a RTS game.  \n\nPros.\nGame is very easy to learn.\nThe fleet management system is very good yet simple, and I think will be copied widely.\nProduction is simple to manage and balanced such that its importance does not trump stratagy.  \nThe maps are easy to comprehend and are not so large that you cant see the whole map at once.\nThe pace of the game is excellent.  Not fast enough to turn it into a frenzied order fest but fast enough to play a game in a few minutes.\nFun to play even if your being thumped.\n\nCons.\nThe game screams out for a multiplayer function.  It would be AWSOME.\nThere is nothing to tell you if different planets have different values, they might, I dont know.\nits difficult to move the mothership around as its almost always under a pile of other ships.\nThe waypoint systm for planet production needs a shortcut key.\nThe AI is OK but needs work.\n\nI liked this game and I look forward to see what else they add to it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439099812, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439099812, "recommendationid": "17453301", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507170", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466639794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 71, "steamid": "76561198010807802", "num_games_owned": 89}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I can't be to harsh on this game, as it was fun, It wasn't what i had expected.\nThe concept of the game is really cool, controls relativly easy, point and click or click and drag.\ndefinitly consider getting this game if on sale!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466685018, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1466685018, "recommendationid": "23725499", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.993345", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441331508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 93, "steamid": "76561198088454073", "num_games_owned": 55}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "4", "review": "This game was ok at first but it wouldnt install on my mac pro just kept giving me a error.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442046117, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442046117, "recommendationid": "17994693", "language": "english", "votes_down": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441899", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438311163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 29, "steamid": "76561198144986666", "num_games_owned": 122}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "fairly enjoyable i am liking it and has some fun mechanics reminds me of some older strat games i played when i was younger could definatel do with mre work and as is right now you could argue it isnt worth the price it is at but i am opeful it may eventually get some more updates that can make it able to be played longer but as is right now its a charming little game and i will be watching it i hope it gets better since i am enjoying it though i can see that some people may complain about it being a bit dull as it lacks many things to do after you send ships to fight", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438284489, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438284489, "recommendationid": "17303548", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
