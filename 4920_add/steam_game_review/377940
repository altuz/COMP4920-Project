As a player you control which side of the board the gravity is pulling. It is basicaly a slider puzzle in 3D with some soothing music behind it. You have a target block and a goal tile and they have to be on top of eachother in order to complete the level. The puzzle can be solved in numerous ways but in order to get all the stars you need to find the solution with the least amount of moves (i.e. changes in gravity).\n\nIt is currently in Early Access (EA) because the devs want to balance out the puzzles and they thought that EA would then be a good idea. It does mean the game is as good as it is going to get except for some tweaking in the puzzles. \n\nI did enjoy it somewhat. The game looks nice and it is quite satisfying to see the objects slide across and stuff but there is just not to much to it. Some of the puzzles can be really challenging but most can be solves very quickly. I struggled on 2 of the ~25 puzzles  that I did. The game slowly tries to ease you into some of the obstacles that pop up but before it gets really tricky, the game moves on to the next stage with new objects and looses the dificulty. I hope this is what gets changes when it gets out of early access.\n\nThat being said, I do recommend this game to anyone looking for some light puzzles to solve. Just do not expect to much of a challenge or hours worth of puzzling :)\n\nIf you would like to watch some actual gameplay, check out my video below of the first 2 chapters (out of 6):\nhttps://youtu.be/4cernVHjaUQ", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438677007, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1438677007, "recommendationid": "17379640", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514357", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490561201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 68, "steamid": "76561198036250410", "num_games_owned": 800}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really fun to play in VR - by setting the height and scale appropriately the levels can be turned into something like a table you can walk around, and it has a great sense of presence. Very simple mechanics, and easy to pick up: every interaction comes by gesturing in a direction, and everything that can move in that direction will do so until it hits something. Most of the puzzles can be solved in multiple ways, so trial and error would be enough if you just want to get through them, but finding the optimal solution for many of them will require more careful thought. I'm a fan of well-designed puzzles that are trivial to pick up but challenging to solve, and this fits the bill nicely.\n\nNot finished it yet in over an hour, so it's definitely better value for money than a cinema ticket when it comes to straight \"hours of entertainment per \u00a3\". Some people will get more gameplay out of it than others of course - personally I'm determined to get all the optimal solutions even if that means spending ages retrying one level over and over. If you only care about finding any solution and then progressing, then you'll get less gameplay out of it, but I'd still say it's easily worth the asking price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468447299, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468447299, "recommendationid": "24304034", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472063706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 61, "steamid": "76561198021494247", "num_games_owned": 442}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "well if you like games like quell or sokobon clone youre gona love this has 8 chapters with 5 - 8 or more in each one and at the price i can t fault it it is a brill puzzle game simble and hard in further level to get it in the right amount of moves", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468230020, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468230020, "recommendationid": "24250088", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504092", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468347263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 12, "steamid": "76561198040524003", "num_games_owned": 203}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nice puzzle game.
