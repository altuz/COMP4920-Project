To be completely honest there is not much of a story going on here at all that isn't defined in one complete sentence.\n\n\"Cyberpunk junkie has lost their memory and is trying to find her deeper meaning among gender/species bending characters in an anarchical hacker underworld \" ... I wish there was more to it, however there is not.\n\nFyn's character design is straight up \"Jane\" from the tv show \"Daria\". Full of angst, cynicism, bad attitudes, and awkward humor. Her dialogue comes out of a whiney, teenage goth girl's diary, who just thinks they're so much better than you because they're so \" A E S T H E T I C \". \nThe typos and grammatical errors are extrememly annoying simply for the fact that you can see all of the effort that went into creating such a visually beautiful game. Why not follow through to the very end and not allow your work to come across as though you've given up and that you don't care?\n\nDesigning another character after Hunter S. Thompson was an interesting touch given the main topic of the story, quoting a Cure song called \" A Forest \" ... I can't tell if the awkward placement of this was intentional or due to the lack of having any idea on how to progress the story further.\n\nGameplay drags out far too long, having to revisit places over and over again, one minute the character can run, the next she can't .... the puzzles are a mess to figure out .... most have nothing to do with the story at all, and I feel as though this occurs only for the need to make up for the fact that the story is quite hollow.\n\nEven the characters in the story don't really know what's going on.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game and gave another chance within hopes of the second episode carrying the story.\nIt just didn't happen.\nI can see the dedication behind the art. It's just not enough in my opinion. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500670912, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501460114, "recommendationid": "33705768", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519501", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501194294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 341, "steamid": "76561198035543751", "num_games_owned": 321}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really nice and atmospheric Point&Click game even though it does not have the deepest or most complex puzzles. \nPeople are downvoting it for its unlikable characters which might be true to some degree, but people should also understand the setting of the game and what it means. \n\nDystopian, cyberpunk-ey and post apocalyptic movies, novels and games are dark, grim and dirty on purpose. \n\nYou can't expect Monkey Island humour or light hearted characters or too much character development in settings like the ones stated above. Foul language and actions, crimes and violence are all common and expected in a somewhat serious game. The main character still changes throughout the game (Even though we still have to wait for episode 3) and starts to think more about what happened / is happening and her punk attitude also changes, which should make her more likable.\n\nI think this isn't an adventure game for everyone because of that. \n\nThe art style and music are great and create a dark and gritty atmosphere. \n\nThe idea of being able to purchase episode 1 seperated from the others is a nice addition as well, since people can check out the game before buying the full game / season pass. Episode 1 is quite short and doable in under 2 hours, so if you don't like what you see you can still refund it afterwards.\n\nI hope that the team won't get discouraged because of the mixed reviews and continue to deliver unique games / music / maybe even comics? like Void and Meddler.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499988095, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500553158, "recommendationid": "33524144", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504528", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486429089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 372, "steamid": "76561198022879562", "num_games_owned": 747}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is all about atmosphere.
