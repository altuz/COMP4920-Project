This is a 3d puzzle in which colored pieces drop onto the field while you spin the field so the pieces land on a group of like colored spheres, which will then explode. Detonate a group surrounding another colored piece, and that piece will explode upward and then drop, burning away like colored spheres, and possibly causing more explosions. Quantz's one unique feature is that your pieces are mostly free moving. Shake the field and the pieces move. Shake hard, and everything goes flying, before resettling into a (hopefully) better position. For a puzzle game, Quantz is pretty easy.

Visually the game has aged remarkably well, slowdown on some transitions aside, and the audio is pleasant, if repetitive. In fact, 'pleasant but repetitve' sum this puzzle game up quite neatly. It has a decent amount of content for a puzzler, is easy to pick up and play, and has a fairly interesting premise. It just gets dull too swiftly.\n\nThe idea is to fling coloured balls down towards a cube that you can rotate at will - a match game with the twist that you can reposition the balls already in play by spinning the cube. This sounds good, and you can do some bizarre and wacky things with the physics, but in practice you're cracking a nut with a sledgehammer. The game was designed for a touchscreen, and it's difficult to finesse individual spheres about the place; mostly you'll resort to flailing the cube wildly and hoping that everything resettles in a more favourable configuration. There are other gimmicks to spice up gameplay, but the tried-and-tested formula is always present.\n\nI spent a decent amount of time with the game, and found that although Action and Strategy modes both have twelve distinct worlds, they may as well be the same game mode. You'll very rarely run out of time or balls in the latter, so you can treat it in the same manner as you would the former. I blitzed through the Action section and had a decent time of it, but things got stale pretty sharpish. The Puzzle mode consists of preset playing fields with a very low number of balls to play with...you'll have to caress them with a delicate touch, and complete the eruptions in as few strokes as possible. Ahem. It was a welcome distraction, but ultimately when things got difficult (and some of the achievements are absolutely dastardly), I found myself wondering why I was still playing.\n\n2009 wasn't exactly an eon ago, but in terms of games on Steam it's about as ancient as the Steam Age itself. QuantZ was probably facing a less cluttered puzzle field back then; nowadays, with so many other options available, I can't recommend a game this limited."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1365398430, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495061", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "1484429", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197993676094", "num_reviews": 402, "last_played": 1382005270, "num_games_owned": 1598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 188}, "timestamp_updated": 1365398430, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It sucks! 5/10"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1322932084, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493893", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "4812593", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198042095650", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1352275200, "num_games_owned": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 158}, "timestamp_updated": 1322932084, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Similar to games like: Tetris, Puyo Puyo, Meteos, and Lumines."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1381751480, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495952", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "7385342", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006836183", "num_reviews": 259, "last_played": 1376445662, "num_games_owned": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 262}, "timestamp_updated": 1381751480, "received_for_free": false, "review": "oui"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1313716138, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495952", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "741206", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197977081885", "num_reviews": 370, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 20}, "timestamp_updated": 1385415315, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Bobbin dem bubbles\n"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1335904888, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493103", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "3661305", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025726362", "num_reviews": 62, "last_played": 1335942000, "num_games_owned": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1070}, "timestamp_updated": 1335904888, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ok casual puzzler \n\n65/100"}]}
