The achievement system is also rather nifty where you actually have to play as other characters and meet certain criteria in order to unlock. \n\nOh, the game can also run fine on a toaster - personal experience - I don't even think the game utilises more than 50% of my graphics card. \n\nProbably raked myself an additional 50 or so hours on mobile too, so there's that.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492383958, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492383958, "recommendationid": "31188588", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505739", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 20, "total_reviews": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
