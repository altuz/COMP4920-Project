Right now it's kludgy and awkward, but after a few months of polish ironing out some of the stuff I've outline below, this game will be so fun.  Getting into the abstract shapes outside of a city would be so fun.\n\nThere's not enough vibration for the controller. I'd expect the controller to vibrate on boosts sure, but then whenever a web is connected, whenever I press down on the jump button, and whenever I hit a wall. This could be the biggest thing missing beyond the animations.\n\nThe web should be bend a little, it seems like it's always in a perfectly straight line. You'd think there'd be a bit of a bend in front of you as you get pulled along, and then chasing behind you a little bit as gravity takes over entirely.\n\nThe tricks seem like they only make you go down, in the interest of building up boost, it's too much negative reinforcement, I'm looking to stay up in the air, and doing a straight X or Y trick costs me way too much height.\nIt's not obvious that Up and Down on the D pad is supposed to rotate you, since you can't be moving the analog stick at the same time. It makes sense once you know, but its frustrating to spend time to figure it out.\n\na lot of the time my web cuts on on me and its not immediately clear to me why not. I'm assuming that the angle got to sharp or I turned around a corner, but having some sort of feedback on why that's happened would be nice. \n\nAnother place to add vibration too, wire tension. This is probably a big reason why the game feels so strange. Half the time I boost in a small space the web gets broken and I don't understand why. Its more negative reinforcement of the boost button.\n\nHaving an instant reset or at least kill button. I don't want to watch my ragdoll fly around for 3 seconds at a time, I'm looking to get back swinging asap.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440807155, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1440807155, "recommendationid": "17762991", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507033", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1470725509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 265, "playtime_forever": 77, "steamid": "76561197962082784", "num_games_owned": 1321}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Simple enough: It's the Spiderman 2 web slinging only with environments that take advantage of it rather than an open world city that just uses it to get to point A to point B.\n\nIt's ugly. It's janky. The on foot movement is greasy, like you're in some sort of crazy momentum based skateboarding game with on foot patched in at the last second. The camera is almost nausea inducing and a near constant battle to control. Your character looks like a downie.\n\nBut it's pure grappling hook bliss, fun enough to explore aimlessly without an objective, much less do crazy challenges on. The whole thing feels like a one man project, and I am pretty sure it is close to one-man working on the basics, but different artists do each level, so each has a different feel. You got a sci-fi dockyard, a couple of cities, and a canyon to muck with. Stat upgrades, extra levels, and linear challenge levels are all had through completing these challenges though.\n\nBut this is the technical, no cloud grappling, pure web slinging game you've been hoping for.

At first you can't swing from things very far away which really makes the swinging seem like it's bad and more difficult than it actually is, but you just need to do a few challenges to increase that.\n\nAlso, get to the second level as soon as possible.

It feels a lot like a cross between THPS and Spiderman 2's swinging mechanic. But you probably know that already.\n\nThis is a game made by a single dude, and you have to judge it as such. If you come in expecting the polish of a $100M game, you're going to have a bad time. It's an indie game, and the mechanics are solid!\n\nIt takes a bit to figure out, and the game doesn't really hold your hand, but once you figure out all mechanics and you get your swing down you will have a blast soaring around. If you're the type that played Assassin's Creed or Prototype or Spiderman (or any of those sandbox-type games with creative movement controls) and you found yourself wasting hours and hours just running/jumping/flying/tricking around and seeing what kind of crazy moves you could pull off instead of playing through the story, this game is for you! You get this incredible sense of freedom and speed, and it really is beyond satisfying to swing and fly yourself from the streets up to the top of the level's tallest tower.\n\nIn addition to free play in each level, you have a host of challenges to choose from. In addition to in-level challeneges, there are also VR challenges (i.e., no big level; just a challenge course) you can find in each of the main levels that are a great way to learn the ropes...honestly I would love to see a VR set of training levels to start you off and teach you the ropes, but knowing how long and hard Mr. Fristrom has worked on this already, I completely understand if that never happens.\n\nA couple tips for beginners to get good as quickly as possible:\n\n1) Unlock the second level (Southstar Island) ASAP as it's a much better environment to learn to link a bunch of swings together IMHO.  It's much bigger and much more uniform, so you can really get the mechanics down. You can do that by doing just a few challenges in the starter Gravship Dock level.\n\n2) You aim your energy hook left/right with the left joystick, not the right. Once you figure this out the whole game opens up. This realization took me longer than I'd like to admit :)\n\n3) When you're just starting out, instead of relying on the momentum of swings alone, throw in a jump/boost at the end of each swing to keep you high in the air and keep your speed up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445903062, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1445903062, "recommendationid": "18703590", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 12, "num_reviews": 12, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
