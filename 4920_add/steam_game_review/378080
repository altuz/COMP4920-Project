The gameplay is the topdown cam you see on the video, you shoot things out, do some puzzles and have a really few upgrades to go around. Don't expect progression since there's most likely none, like i said, there's a few upgrades and they don't even make that much differece. The game can get quite boring cuz of this lack of progression but it's short enough to not get bad. Aaaaand that's it, at least with the discount i bought it, i recommend this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503797674, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503797674, "recommendationid": "34518335", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502633", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 33, "total_reviews": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
