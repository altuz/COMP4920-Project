A little too simple shooter (level design is varied a bit but never gets creative; no secrets, not even mini secrets). Avoiding the somewhat charming bad acting of Dead Effect, Putrefaction has no acting at all, with the tiny bit of story in two text blurbs at the start and end. The many holes are left to your imagination. Enemies are cool, some towards the end with some interesting mechanics. End boss is cool but can be frustrating. Game is short but it does have a nice feel overall and it does scratch the shoot stuff itch for a while.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496543790, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496543790, "recommendationid": "32166251", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482178503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 504, "steamid": "76561197989290281", "num_games_owned": 1203}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "https://youtu.be/VnKu05TvlWY\n\nIf you are in the mood for an old skool insired FPS then putrefaction is definately worth adding to your collection. The controls are smooth for the most part, the performance is good and there is a decent enough selection of enemy and weapon types to keep the game interesting.\n\nThe visuals whilst not outstanding do a decent job, and the enemy types are easily distinguishable from each other which is essential for fast and frantic gunplay. Audio is limited but decent enough.\n\nMy big critisisms are the smalishl level area's and the complete lack of secrets - both odd choices for a classic style inspired shooter. But for the low price, the four hour campaign is playable enough as well as a wave mode that make it a solid if not outstanding game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492460504,

"votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I discovered this game thanks a video of one  of my favourite youtubers.Besides the fact he didn't like the\ngame,i decided to give it a change anyway.As a veteran of games like Doom,Wolfenstein 3D,\nQuake,Hexen,i expect to find elements from these games,see this game is \" heavily inspired by old-school shooter classics.\" \nSo,in first place,here a list of old school elements i found and not:\n\n1-Great arsenal of weapons?\nYes,it is huge.I found 7 weapons during the campaign,that are:\n-Axe\n-Assault rifle\n-Shotgun\n-Minigun\n-Rocket Launcher\n-Plasma gun\n-Freeze gun\nEvery weapon have two fire mode,as in Blood or in Rise of the Triad:Dark War\nThe pick up of the ammo are too similiar from each other and you cannot recognize a box of shells to one with plasma.A patch with a little change of textures would be appreciate.The bobbing is similiar at the package of \"Ultimate fps creator\" and some sounds are pretty familiar.For example,when you pick up a minigun i can ear the same sound for when you select a rifle on Medal of Honor:Allied assault.\n2-Great and labirintic maps?\nUnluck no.Levels are pretty too much linear and small,without puzzle or locked door who slows\nyour progress\n3-Presence of secrets?\nNope.In some levels i tried to explore as much as i can but i didn't find nothing.I tried to shoot\nor interact with some walls but nothing.\n4-Backtracking?\nSometimes,see you are not always able to back in rooms yet explored.For the rest,in various levels i did well to spare\nmedikits in previous room for take them later.\n5-Fun and Hard?\nYes,it's pretty fun but not so hard,even if still need to play it at toughest skills.Is only pretty annoying the silent spawn of the enemies right your back or even forward at you.\nA nice thing was to put a teleport effect when a monster spawn,for give the feel that enemy was\nsend from an other dimension.\n6-Epic music?\nIs nice and atmospheric,but not memorable as ost like \"At the Doom's gate\",\"Going down to the fast way\" or \"Get them before they get you!\"\n7-Is the game pretty much long?\nI finished the game at medium skill in 82 minutes(the same lenght of a my normal run of the first episode of Doom \"Knee-deep in the dead\"\nBesides,you can always play the survival mode or try toughest skills.\n7-Great variety of enemies and different from each other?\nI count eight different types of enemies(less or more)and two bosses.\nEnemy ai is pretty stupid but in various level spawn in huge number forward and back you,so be a little careful by the way.\nThe enemies will attack you in only two ways:melee or projectiles.No enemies have hit-scans,see you can dodge the bullets of armed zombies.Every enemy have his own model for be reconizable,speed,agility,sounds and health.\nYou can kill all the enemies with every weapon you want,only one enemy need to be for first freeze and later be damaged with the otehr weapons.\n8-Gore?\nYou can tear up enemies with weapons as the minigun,axe or rocket launcher even after they died.(As in Serious Sam HD)\n\nThe game have little tecnical problems as bad collision in various points,music that randomly stop without no reason,some fps drops and cannot change the gamma(There is a level too fucking dark and i was forced to close the window of my room see the missing of a gamma option in the menu)\n\nSo,at the end,i suggest this game?Yes,i do and the price is pretty honest in my personal opinion.\nIs not an old school game well made as the masterpieces we know,but neither a total  disaster.\nIs funny and godible and can be relaxing to play for an hour or two.On a my personal score,i give at this game a \n\n6/10\n\nLet me know if there are some mistakes in the rewiew(Besides obviously grammatical errors,see english is not my\nfirst language and i apologize for that)and if it was useful for you. \n\nThe video i was talking about:(Warning,is in italian)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIVs2eBnhvM", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492440686, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492441839,
