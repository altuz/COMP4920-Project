Pong. I remember the horror on my Daddy's face when I told him I was gonig to connect it up to *his* TV. He swore I was going to blow it up. LOL. Later I went thru the Atari 2600 phase and then in 1993 I found the internet via a 2600 baud modem, my phone line and my computer. Shortly after that, the WWW was made and the internet exploded. By 1998 I was building my own computers because I had learned that store bought just didn't have the quality 'guts' inside that some of the games I enjoyed needed.\n\nI will turn 60 years old on July 23rd, 2017. It's been a wild ride watching the game industry develop and become what we all love today. Yet, as I think thru all of the games I have played thru the years, which would number in the thousands, there are only a few that really stand out and call to me. You know what I mean, that special game you played and played and just never really got tired of ... but then lost in a hard drive crash or something, only to find out you couldn't find it again online!\n\nWelcome to Chromadrome 2. This is one of those few games I got 10 years ago when it was first released, loved, played and then lost in a crash. The next 5 years I thought about it so often, wishing I could play it again to experience the excitement of the race, which is enhanced more by the great soundtrack, then add in the vivid optical effects and colros and just .. WOW!!! I finally did find it again not long ago via the Developer's website, but only found him, via the greenlight section of Steam. I bought it immediately from his site, but that was a one time deal and not secure for future downloads like Steam, should I ever have another drive crash. You can be assured I will be one of the first in line to buy the game again as soon as it's available in here! I so love this game, the challange it gives me, along wtih the frustration it gives when I'm just sooooo close to the finish line, then make a wrong move. Heh, there's no other game quite like it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493916651, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493916651, "recommendationid": "31544200", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544292", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
