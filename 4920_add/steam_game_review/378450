The visuals are crisp and colourful and the soundtrack is great; it fits the action perfectly.  It's fun bunching up a load of robots around one of the explosive barrels and taking them all out with a well-timed shot. I can imagine the game would get a bit repetitive after extended play; best enjoyed in short bursts.
