It simply lacks the polish (and I am not talking about the graphics, they are fine for an indie game at this price point).\n\nA good example is the combat. Like many modern RPGs, it has a time-dilation effect during combat., but due to the limited control you have over your group (limited even further by the way the interface is implemented), this effect is often far more annoying than it is useful.\n\nThe game really needs a way for you to control your group members without having to track them down in 3D space (and hope nothing is obscuring the buttons on their heads). Something as simple as putting the three buttons next to the icons in the group slots on the left of the screen.\n\nSome other little quality of life items that would go a long way to making the game playable:\n\n- A quest journal, and removing quests from NPCs once completed.\n\n- The ability to sell items to vendors beyond their inventory capacity (this is debatable, but due to the way purchases are implemented it is kind of necessary in this game).\n\n- Better check pointing (I gave up on the game after constantly being pushed back three major fights. The save slots seemed to do nothing).\n\n- Allow the time-dilation to be disabled. As much as I can see that this is meant to be a major part of the game, there just isn't enough control over the group to make it worth it. Leave it for people who want it, but make it optional. It would need a complete overhaul to bring it on par to the time-dilation in other group based RPGs.\n\n- A proper targeting system. You really only have 1 direct attack spell for most of the game (lighting strike), and it is extrodinarily hard to target at monsters that aren't on the same level to you, or who are far away. A more traditional RPG action system of \"click to target, numbers to cast\" would be much more workable.\n\n- A better way to compare item's stats / more consistency in the colour coding of items.\n\n\nHaving said all this, I do give props to the developer for the ambition and combination of ideas. I think it is a stretch to call any given element of this game innovative, but the combination of mechanics is interesting.\n\nThe tower defence / vaguely-MOBAesque elements mixed with a more tradition group based RPG present some interesting possibilities, and while none of those possibilities are fully realised within this game (or the parts I have seen), they were intriguing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488041275, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488041275, "recommendationid": "30172042", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435806085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 256, "steamid": "76561198053167360", "num_games_owned": 265}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "WHAM is like Heroes of Might and Magic, but in REAL-TIME, 3rd person and a slow-time system for amazing strategic battles! Dota styled (single player) combat for the outposts.\n\nSo after playing the game for 4 hours i can say the game is good for one guy doing it. Its fun and can be hard the UI is pretty hard to get used to very hard to heal when all units are grouped up. Gameplay is unique it is like homm but just real time. Units are unique have power and spells only that unit has. For a small indie game by one guy its pretty well done.\n\nSNow area is where its like dota u need to build turrets and fill up barracks with units than it will spawn creep waves based on stack of units in the barracks..after understanding the moba elements in the game its no so bad. just get over the whole AAA stigma you want this game to have. Can it be better well yes but could it be worse and thats a yes as well. Overall its a fun deotur from the normal games in this genre its unique and different in good ways. Rough but not bad.\n\nI would say if your curious watch some videos and do some research its functional and works which is more than what i can so for alot of AAA titles recently. Its obvious from the start its a single mans game cuz its rough but by no means unplayable or bad just lacks polish but in the end its different and unique and if u like homm or kings bounty it is very similar.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435790715, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435808739, "recommendationid": "16834639", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488806", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
