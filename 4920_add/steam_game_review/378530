The key things for me are:\n\n- Customisable load out and hats\n- Responsive controls\n- Different modes (Survival, Penguin Protector and Kitten Rescue) keep gameplay varied and fun\n- Consistent graphic style\n\nAs per other reviews, initially I was finding the gameplay a little on the easy side, but as soon as I got to higher waves, the Zombies became faster and harder to outrun and the bosses became tougher to defeat. I really like how you have to keep your player on the move and restock ammo.\n\nOne of my favourite elements are the different rage abilities, my favourite is the duck who creates a tornado and wreaks havoc on all the zombies. Here's an example of said ability: http://www.gfycat.com/WindyGrimArabianoryx\n\nReally looking forward to the devs unlocking more levels and challenge modes, this is the sort of game that will benefit from challenges and will increase the game's re-playability.\n\nOverall, awesome work and looking forward to more content!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437894561, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1437894561, "recommendationid": "17232368", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501442", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500856709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 420, "steamid": "76561198048623313", "num_games_owned": 135}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Very fun game but sometimes a bit frustrating if using a mouse and keyboard.
