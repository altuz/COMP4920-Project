It takes the FROM-soft formula and adds a lot of new and unique mechanics on top of that, though doesn't always do the best job of teaching how the new systems work.  Combat is more interesting with a mix of limb severing, timed blocking, dodges (movement as well as ducking or jumping over attacks), counter attacks, and a basic combo system.  Regular enemies are a challenge through out most of the game, often times more so than bosses, which to me were a weaker aspect of the game.  That said, looking for the \"hard\" way to beat a boss and get a unique weapon does given them depth, shame there is a very small number of them to actually fight.  I enjoyed the level design, how every area only has one Ops Center (bonfire / hub point / etc) and everything wraps around to it via shortcuts and good level design.

So far I found it very enjoyable. It's definitely souls-like, although I'm finding it much easier than any game on the Souls series. Dark Souls 1 is probably where the authors took most of their inspiration, seeing as the level design in this game revolves around shortcuts and the combat has a similar feel (with the added fun of dismemberments).\n\nThere were some reviews that almost made me not buy this game, so I'm going to address some of the negative points on those:\n\n1) Lack of enemy diversity.\nThis one is true, but it didn't bother me much. Combat is fun enough and the animations are so detailed it's underestandable why they couldn't create more enemies.\n\n2) Lots of backtracking.\nThere is some backtracking built into the plot, but it felt natural to me; it's not about having to fetch some mcguffin you left three areas behind and had no way of knowing was neded later. There is also some optional backtracking required if you're a completionist (there are collectibles locked in areas you'll only be able to access after acquiring end game equipment), but it's entirely optional.\n\n3) Lack of a map or proper direction to progress the plot.\nI guess people who complained about this aren't fans of Dark Souls. Not only it didn't bother me, but I found the progression in this game almost linear. There are frequent branching paths, but they are mostly shortcuts back to the Med bay and short paths to hidden loot. I can imagine having trouble getting my bearings if I stopped playing for a while, but it shouldn't be much of an issue for someone with an average memory.\n\n4) Regular enemies kill you in one hit.\nThis one had me worried the most. Some guys wrote that they ended up only using running attacks and then backing of, because enemies were so punishing; it sounded terribly boring. Fortunately I found that this can happen, but it depends mostly on the armor and implants you use: if you use light armor and don't equip a few implants that raise your health, you will get one shotted by most enemies; if you play with heavy armor and equip health impants you'll be able to survive a couple of hits from even the strongest enemies.\n\nFinally, I just want to vent about a particular mechanic, that I think detracts from the overall game experience: weapon proficiency. Weapon proficiency boots your damage with a weapon type, is gained through using that weapon type and doesn't seem to have a cap, so it punishes using different weapon types. It's a damn shame this mechanic exists, because I tried all the different weapon types for an achievement and they were all pretty balanced and fun to use.\n\nP.S.: I played this game with mouse and keyboard and it was fine.

Instead of the souls 1-2 style weapon combos, The Surge features an actual combo system. By combining vertical and horizontal attacks (equivalent to Light/Heavy attacks in DS) you can create some really cool 4 or even 5 hit combos. The tradeoff here is that there are 6 classes of weapon, and each class shares the same combos with only slight variation between weapons if any.\n\n There's a big focus on targeting limbs and using executions to get specific gear parts for crafting, the executions are brutal and fun to watch, if you like them as much as me you can set them to be \"slo-mo cinematic\" every time you use them, sometimes, or rarely. If you're not into the whole finishing moves thing, you can turn that off and just let them play as a part of your combat.  \n\nI personally like the gear system, most of it looks really cool and they encourage wearing whole sets together for set bonuses. You gather schematics from enemies and craft the gear yourself, so you don't have to worry about not finding a matching set. The interface for crafting isn't particularly engaging so if gathering materials isn'y your thing you may not like it. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the game IS difficult, but for a reason I can't place I found it easier to defeat enemies after you figure them out, very much the same way I felt about DS1. Like, the enemies will definitely whoop your ass until you really get them down, but once you have fought the same enemy enough times they literally become a non-threat, even the harder ones. I didn't really feel that way about DS2&3, there were plenty of enemies that would destroy you without careful timing and quick reflexes no matter how many times you had fought them before.    \n\n\nThe game seems to have a decent length, I'm 22 hours in at the time of this review and I'm definitely less than a third of the way through. As of yet I can't really speak for environmental variety, but it seems fairly bland in that respect. It's hard to make unique environments when the game has such a niche theme.

I finally took the leap and bought this game when it was on sale. This game has its flows and abit rough around the edges but l enjoy it nonetheless. My biggest complain is the maps and level design, I spends hours just try to find where to go next or to find the way out. Overall I did enjoy it as I said but I would not pay a full price for it. I suggest you give it try if you can get it in sale. 30$ or less will be a reasonable price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505588975, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505589434, "recommendationid": "35004825", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501329", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 681, "total_reviews": 933, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 252}}
