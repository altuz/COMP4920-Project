I can somewhat understand it being OK on a mobile device when you have some time to kill on the bus or train but it is a bit silly to run it on a pc.\n\nFirst of all, there is not really any music to acompany the robot, which I think is a bit sad! The little guy is on a mining trip, he could atleast whistle a merry tune!\n\nThe mechanics are a bit simple and dull. There is a prize somewhere that you need to find but there is no real challenge of getting the prize. Yes, you run out of energy and equipment but is super easy to just hop back to the surface and replenish everything instantly without any cost. \n\nAs long as you keep a lazy eye on the energy level and can count to 9 (amount of ladders to get back up again), then you can beat the game quite easily. The levels are just a matter of time then. I did not play a whole lot of it, as I got bored with it within 5 minutes of playing this. Not a good sign for a game, I feel.\n\nNot a very enjoyable experience, I'm sorry to say.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434478612, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436854487, "recommendationid": "16450400", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520996", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1434034979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 44, "steamid": "76561197982942764", "num_games_owned": 1405}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This adorable \"short\" little game takes place in a 2d enviroment, and it have a lot of potential. \nAs it is right now, I don't see the price to be fit to the title :I Very little gameplay, and overall minor mechanics.\n\nThe idea is, you're a robot, you're digging for THE BIG DIAMOND - Once you've found it, you'll be taken to a larger maps.\nBut there is danger in the caves you'll create, the boulders will fall unless you support it with a metal beam.\n\n**Video of it's current state**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfIJeJcavpI&feature=youtu.be\n\nOverall gameplay RIGHT NOW (3/10) \nBut will create another review when/if the Dev will make some major updates :)!\nLISTEN TO THE PEOPLE!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434034822, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1434035731, "recommendationid": "16308095", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495357", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1434240721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 55, "steamid": "76561198083815221", "num_games_owned": 191}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great casual digging game! I had it on my phone a few years ago and it hasn't changed much since then, which is awesome! The keyboard is not rebindable, which is sad. The arrow key  movement is okay but the mouse movement is hard to use because you accidentally dig things or use ladders unintentionally. They added WASD movement, which is great! I wrote about how the dev (devs?) should add WASD movement in my last review so that shows that the dev(s) actually read the user reviews. \n\nOne thing I would really like to see in this game is fullscreen support!
