Survival gauges without a zombie apocalypse. Keep fed raise, your cubs. Execution is botched \n\nOpen world version of Shelter2. You are a female cougar competing with other female cougars. You mark trees to prevent them from spawning but that feature never worked for me. Does not matter since I never saw a female cougar other than my own char.\n\nJust a large open map really with spawnpoints for wolves, bears, foxes, bear, aligator, hunters+wolves. Food vanishes within less than a day so a lot of hard work to keep a reserve will be for nothing. Food can also disappear right out of you rmouth as you carry it from place to place which is kind of annoying. Large preys clip through the character's sprite, draw distance for field of vision is too short and unpleasantly truncates your surroundings in a very chopped out manner, with bits of the background sometimes popping on screen while nearby items remain obfuscated. Combat was floaty and imprecise. Using the targeting reticle helped some, and I found out I can one shot bears and decimate entire wolf packs, and even be a serial killer of humans. Humans miss a lot but if they hit you once you are dead. Managed to find a mate. The censoring of the mating act was crudely done and obnoxious, not helped by the fact that you have to trigger the mating 30 times in a row to get pregnant. After that you gotta go to a hotspot to give birth. Then to another hotspot for your cubs to grow more. You get chased by killer males during shelter transition. I found that whenever a large prey or predator was near me, the camera would default to a topdown perspective with a large field of vision which allowed for quick reactions where you can outmaneuver dangerous animals, use the strafe and pounce to good effect. Camera control was good for that. All in all going from hot spot to hotspot is just tedious, the minimap is not very well executed either. It is not hard to hunt for food other than stuff vanishing, and most of the AI characters are minor annoyances at best. I liked where the concept was going but the mechanics are a little bit on the thin side, boiling down to managing survival gauges. The forest did not feel like an ecosystem at all, just a bunch of hotspots with spawns. The audiovisual presentation had major issues and was not very satisfying to begin with. The map also is not procedurally generated and starting a few games you will start to know where the spawns are. Would probably be interested in a better sequel but as things stand I feel like I have seen all there is to see here after about an hour. \n\nFor those who have trouble with combat, the animations do not matter, just spam left click and right click as fast as you can and you will just tear through any HP bar.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503948859, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503949001, "recommendationid": "34560478", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503283", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499548460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 275, "steamid": "76561198216464079", "num_games_owned": 17}, "votes_funny": 8, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Recommended only when on sale. \n\nLove the call of screaming, ungrateful kittens who don't understand that mommy has places to go and animals to slaughter? Well well well, welcome to Untamed! The cougars here are seriously Untamed. Like, they have to be \"untamed\" 30 times just to get the whiny little cubs. \n\nAnd what happens when those tiny, little, precious cubs are finally here? Time to hunt, of course! But not only do you get to hunt, you also get to run from a feral male cougar trying to kill your family! Yay!\n\nOnce you finally get away from the male there's a good chance you've lost a cub or two (honestly not the worst thing in the world, I chose favorites anyway.) And after that you better get to hunting. Soon your cubs will be in the next stage of life, and will actually be able to walk at an acceptable speed. Oh joy! \n\nThe male will return, you'll have to change dens again, and any sort of social life mommy cougar had before will fade away just as quickly as your cubs' health will. \n\nIn time the little bitc- I mean your precious angels will grow up and leave you behind. Hey look, you gave up your life to raise cubs for nothing! Woo! And after that what does mommy cougar do? Hunt, increase stats, try not to die a lot. Currently the only way to have more cubs is by starting over with a new character.\n\nSummary: Overall the game is fun for a playthrough or two and occasional play after the cubs are gone, but I don't think it's worth the money unless on sale. It's not always the most realistic either; predators and prey spawn at every turn. Also you can't eat the hunters who try to kill you.
