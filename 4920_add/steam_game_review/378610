After a while of happily exploring the beautifully arranged environment you start to encounter hostile creatures and at one point the game literally sent some chills down my spine (which only a few games have achieved so far). \n\nThe storyline is pretty good and brought across via audio logs and notes you can find throughout the levels. A twist at the end changes your view of certain aspects of the game and provides some \"oh-my-god\"-feeling.\n\nThe graphics aren't perfect but fittingly beautiful. Excellent world detail and lighting never fail to convey the right mood.\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome and adds to the atmosphere of the world.\n\nThe controls are decent and make running, jumping and grappling-hooking come to you naturally. Whenever you fail, it's because of you, not due to clunky controls.\n\n\nThe only thing I would have really liked is the possibility of exploring the valley as a whole and not only via the different level sections, since it feels like a complete world, waiting to be discovered. BUT the more linear level design makes for some pretty cool and well-timed moments that would be hard to achieve with, for instance, an open world game.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, I am glad to have bought this game and I can happily recommend it to anyone who likes something a little unconventional but all the more beautiful.\n\n\n\n8.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504747917, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504747917, "recommendationid": "34786248", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513035", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497040684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 460, "steamid": "76561198188662443", "num_games_owned": 282}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Yes, yes, yes, YES!\nOne of the best games I have ever played.

You can't put it down. But all the boring reading crap is replaced by A1 voice acting, beatiful scenery, and running around at near-mach speeds in a pair of robo-legs.\n\nOnce you start this game, you won't want to stop playing it until you finish the story because the story is really really good, and so is the gameplay to accompany it. I found this game extremely enjoyable to play, and I absolutely reccomend it.\n\nThat being said, it's also like a book in that once you've finished it, there's not much to go back to. One does not finish an award-winning novel and then think to themselves \"Man, that was great! I can't believe the plot twist at the end! I can't wait to go back to the beginning and read the whole thing again!\"\n\nThere's pretty much no replay value. There's the story, and that's about it. And even then, the story won't take you more than a couple hours to complete. If you're looking for something that you can go back and enjoy for hours on end, this probably isn't for you.\n\nSo tl;dr, This is a short and sweet game that I'm certain you'll enjoy if you pay attention to the plot. 20 bucks is a pretty heavy price tag for a 2 hour book, so this is a game that you should only buy on sale, but still should definitely buy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506284987, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506284987, "recommendationid": "35190243", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505144919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 488, "steamid": "76561197984814503", "num_games_owned": 221}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "From the people who brought you Slender: The arrival!? Are you kidding?  \n \nThis is hands down a 10/10 must play experience. I've played a lot of atmospheric and unusual games but this... this left me breathless... I am at a loss for words for the Valley's beauty. I could only silently mutter \"wow\" in shear awe more times then I have in a long while.  \n  \nThis game dreams so big you wouldn't believe it, and it gets so much farther then you would realistically expect for an indie game. The only tell it's not triple A is it's brevity and originality. Valley also has possibly has the best sound track, audio cues and active layering I've ever heard in hundreds of games and tens of thousands of hours.  \n  \nThe spectacle starts strong, lures you into slower speculation and exploration before ramping up to a stunningly explosive finale. The ending is WELL worth getting and after everything it still took me off guard with how well executed it was.  \n  \nValley will leave on a surprising powerful and humbling note, though possibly a bit simple it's truly memorable. This game overflows with passion and creativity. Personally my game of the year.  \n \nMy hats off to the developers who I really want to thank, for a small indie studio that reached for the sky and made one of the best games I've ever played.

Most of the bad grades I gave were to students who either hadn't learned, or wilfully ignored, the basic building blocks of how to write an essay. How to structure an argument, and how to use sources. How to start with a thesis statement, how to support it, and so on. I never felt bad about giving these bad grades. I may have felt bad for those who were never taught how to write, but ultimately I was there to grade what was turned in. And yes, of course, sometimes there were some good papers too.\n\nEvery now and then, though, I got the kind of paper that I absolutely hated. This kind of paper was technically sound on all fronts. It had a thesis statement, and a body of supporting statements. It had citations for sources, and the general structure of an essay. It met the required word count. On paper, it hit all the criteria needed. But then I would read it, and it quickly became clear that the person writing this had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. Imagine a generic Freshman level Sociology student who just found out about Karl Marx, and writes his big paper on why Communism is the only true system of government that can serve the people, and that's why Mr. Robot is the best show on television, because it's all about bringing down Capitalism. \n\nOn a technical level, the paper is solid. But in terms of content, he has no idea how and why Marx's Communism failed, and failed badly. He has not taken an Intermediate or Expert level Sociological Theory course to learn more about why Marx's Communism can likely never succeed. He's given no thought to what governmental or economic systems Communism was derived from, nor any idea of the various semi-Communist states that have formed that are very different than what Marx intended. \n\nAnd so I was left with a technically proficient essay in which everything was wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\nThat's Valley, in a nutshell.\n\nTechnically, the game is fine. It runs like a dream, the movement is fast and fluid and satisfying. I encountered no glitches or bugs. The... story... such as it is, has a recognizable beginning, middle, and end (don't laugh; Batman v. Superman couldn't even manage that). \n\nBut after about the first fifteen minutes, I started hating the game, and almost everything about it.\n\nLet's get the biggest complaint out of the way first: the game is called Valley, so you'd think it would take place in a valley. And about 30%-ish does. The rest takes place in generic abandoned warehouses and factories and military bases. All grey and dark and bland, filled with incredibly loud and grating sound effects. One could argue that making my ears bleed from screeching metal doors over and over again was intentional, because they wanted to contrast the beauty of nature with the monstrosity of machines. I would argue that (a) they could make that point WITHOUT making my ears bleed, and (b) any parts of the game set in nature are spent running so fast you can't actually hear any beautiful nature anyway.\n\nThe Valley is in a perpetual state of really late sunset, which means you get a nice orange glow where the sun hits, and total friggin' darkness everywhere else. Be ready to crank up the brightness, or play in the dark, or both, if you want to try to find Acorn doors on canyon walls. And be ready to drown at least a few times because the underground is so dark that even with the brightness up, you can't see where the water you're supposed to run on is.\n\nThe gameplay follows an unfortunate rhythm. You get a few minutes to run and jump and play out in the open valley. These moments are the best. Running down hill to build up steam, leaping off a ramp and flying through the air, feels amazing. Then after a few minutes of this, you're forced into small cramped areas with \"combat\" that amounts to litttle more than \"aim at the thing, click on the thing\". Find the generator to open the door. Climb through the vents. Listen to audio diaries. Read notes. Open crates. Are you falling asleep yet? I am. This game does one thing amazingly well - movement - yet it spends most of its time putting you in situations where you can't use this movement in any interesting ways. \n\nThe life-and-death mechanic feels much like the Edicts in Tyranny - clearly they planned to do something bigger with them, and just never got around to it. At no point in Valley was I ever so low on energy that I had to drain a living creature or tree to get ammo back. If it was meant to be a moral choice thing, it failed because I was never even tempted to suck the life force out of anything. The mechanic may as well not have existed. Just gather orbs and shoot stuff. Problem solved.\n\nSpeaking of which, holy hell, the LEAF suit grants you super speed, super jumping, AND POWER OVER LIFE AND DEATH? This is just one of many unintentionally gutbusting moments during the story. This must be the result of a late night \"Wouldn't it be cool if?\" brainstorming session in which no one had the heart to tell the guy everything wrong with that idea. If Quantum Immortality sucks the life out nearby living things to bring the user back to life, why the hell wouldn't you just send ONE LEAF SOLDIER into a battlefield? He dies, life from enemy soldiers gets sucked out, he revives. Repeat until he single-handedly wins the war. What on Earth is the running and jumping even for, if you can literally point at a living thing and drain its life force?\n\nThe gameplay demands the running and jumping, because that's what Valley does best. But the gameplay has no real use for the Life-or-Death mechanic. Conversely, the story cares a great deal about the Life-or-Death mechanic, but doing so means the rest of the LEAF suit makes absolutely no sense in the context of the story. \n\nSpeaking of the story, it's... functional? The writing isn't terrible, I guess? I'm struggling to come up with compliments here. The only really annoying thing is that the voice actors were apparently directed to read each audio diary as if the characters themselves were pausing and emphasizing for dramatic effect. They don't sound like people recording diaries; they sound like people giving line readings for a stage production, full of ACTING~! Also, just a thought: Virginia, if you're planning to sabotage the Astra plant, maybe DON'T record yourself talking about your plan? Maybe? Just a thought.\n\n---\n\nThe whole thing reminds me a bit of Thief: The Dark Project, and not in a good way. For you young whippersnappers who don't remember, Thief: The Dark Project was a game about a thief, Garrett, in a medieval steampunky kind of world. The first three or four levels had you breaking into Ye Olden Homes to steal stuff, and get out undetected. It was awesome! But the developers were worried that players wouldn't play a whole game like that, so starting in level five, zombies and monsters start showing up, and the whole thing goes off the rails.\n\nThat's Valley. It does one thing really, really well, then spends so much time getting in the way of that thing. It's like the developers were worried that the movement wasn't enough to make a game around, so they needed to add hidden collectibles and audio logs and running-sideways-on-walls platforming puzzles and \"combat\" (I use that term loosely) and the whole life/death thing. Like Thief, they didn't trust that the core gameplay conceit was enough to keep players hooked, so they started dumping in everything they could think of. \n\nI like variety in games. I like it when games give me lots of different things to do. But those things have to be fun, or at the very least, interesting. Every time Valley abandons the valley, the game becomes completely and utterly generic. If you took all the footage from the game's interior sections and told me it was from some Steam Greenlight shovelware called Base Escape, I would believe you.\n\nCan't recommend it to anyone.
