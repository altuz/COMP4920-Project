So, I dont recommend gettting it.\n\nYet I still leave this a positive review, as the 2 released episodes are truly great. This is by far the darkest, grimmest and most violent take on a Telltale-style story. Got to love the dark atmosphere, and the situations way too grim and ugly for big game publishers to touch. Little touch of steampunkiness also makes the Film Noire world an interesting place. Most importantly, the story is very intresting and keeps you glued to it, and darkness of it makes anything possible, this is not your generic Hollywood story.\n\nShame and sad that this game was never completed. The developers should have found a publisher to fund the whole game, instead of relying on the sales of first episode. Their business model failed, and everyone lost.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504609991, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504609991, "recommendationid": "34754231", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502048", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505257727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 140, "steamid": "76561198161056587", "num_games_owned": 195}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "such a shame this game didn't get to end the whole series.
