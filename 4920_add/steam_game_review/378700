I have to say Its somewhat short, as I finished it in an hour. The length to price ratio aside (and addressed below), Its a well made exploration game with professional dialogue, great atmosphere, and perfect mechanics. If your looking for a long term investment this is not for you, but as a quick adventure for an otherwise empty week night its great.\n\nWithout spoilers, the ending is a bit sudden and I really had to think about it to make sense of what just happened. It seems like an origin story to something larger, as if another game could continue from exactly where this one leaves off. It reminds me of games like Firewatch and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. While Neptune Flux was very entertaining the first play-through, I didn't want to replay it myself as much as I wanted to throw my friends in and watch them figure it out. Its like watching someone trying to solve a simple puzzle in nearly complete darkness - actually, that is exactly what this is. This game would make for an interesting speed-run.\n\n[h1]Final Note:[/h1]\nAt this point in time VR games are still pretty new and making them is not cheap at all. I can justify paying up for this game because I know that the developers needs to make something after Steam's cut in order to afford this level of content for us early adopters.

You pilot a mini-submarine. and explore a limited number of locations near your undersea base. As you explore each location, strange things occur, and you get to try to solve a mystery. You can pick up salvage along the way, to earn money which allows you to buy two submarine upgrades (better headlights and low-energy consumption sonar) and various consumables (flares, \"energy nodes\" to extend the reach of your sub, and speed boosts).\n\nOverall, I did enjoy the game, and feel it was worth the price (it was on sale for $6). It was pretty much the cost of seeing a movie at the theater and took about as long.\n\nHowever, the game does have some shortcomings. I played this on the HTC Vive, but I had to hook up my Playstation 3 controller to be able to play the game. I think it had a keyboard/mouse option too, but I'm not sure. The PS3 control scheme was pretty standard if you've played any FPS games. One joystick moves your sub around, while the other joystick rotates the sub's point of view. You can also move your head in real life to get a slightly different view, but since you're stuck inside a mini-sub, I just sat in a chair in real life most of the time.\n\nIn VR, the submarine itself isn't much to look at from the inside - if you look around, there's a few things to see (oxygen tank, first aid kit, stuff you'd expect to find inside a mini-sub) but you can't interact with any of them. Fortunately, the sub has a huge window in front of you, and that's where all the action happens. Through the window, you interact with the ocean world. The first part of the game has you moving your sub around to fix a water purifier (or something like that- I can't remember).  Interaction with the undersea world consists of nosing your sub next to something, and then hitting the \"interact\" button. Disappointingly, there isn't any animation of a mechanical arm coming out of your sub to manipulate anything. \n\nThe sub controls are intuitive and very responsive, probably far better than a real mini-sub would be. Personally, I prefer the lack of real physics in the interests of better gameplay. This is my first VR game where I was able to pilot a ship. Even though the sub moves slowly, I still got motion sick after a while. I did build up a tolerance over time though, and I did have a lot of fun just piloting the sub around.\n\nWhile your sub has a great big window to look out of, there really isn't a lot to see. Maybe this is how the deep ocean actually is, but there are very few fish and plants to look at. It's actually pretty desolate out there. You also initially start with rather dim headlights on your sub, which you can upgrade later, but there just isn't much to look at. I found most items by using the sonar (which highlights items of interest) rather than the headlights.\n\nThe sub's range is limited, since once you leave the \"energy matrix\" around your base (as evidenced by a giant, glowing, blue shell), your sub switches to battery power. I never actually ran out of power, but another reviewer mentioned that you lose some money and re-start back at home base. Later in the game you can buy and install energy nodes in a few places that extend the energy matrix and give you more cruising range, but I think I was only able to find around 5 or 6 places to install the nodes. \n\nThe voice acting is pretty good, and helps advance the storyline, which was interesting, but not great. \n\nThere are a limited number of locations of any interest to explore - maybe 6 total. And finding each location can be a bit of a challenge, since your visibility deep under water is limited. Consequently, the game is only around 2 to 3 hours long. I took my time just exploring, picking up salvage, and zooming around in the sub, and it took me around 3 hours to complete the game. As other reviewers have mentioned, the ending is a bit abrupt. It feels like the developers just ran out of money or time to finish the game. I don't think there's any replayability to this game, once the mystery is solved. There just isn't that much to look at or do. \n\nOverall, I give this game a thumbs up, but only because it was on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486134073, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486134073, "recommendationid": "29671040", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502333145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 87, "steamid": "76561197975739756", "num_games_owned": 111}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really enjoyed the game but...
