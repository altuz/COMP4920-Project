The amount of lore through the quests is very interesting and makes you want to try and see all events at least once.  The combat system is fun initially, but starts to feel grindy after a few times.  The downside is that different challenge types all use the same combat system just with different stats so if you fight someone or try and convince someone you do the exact same thing.  I also love it that every game is different and you can customize the difficulty to whatever your heart desires!\n\nPros:\n  - Great lore\n  - Unique combat system (although can feel grindy after awhile)\n  - Customizable Difficulty with many starting options\n  - Loads of crafting recipes\n  - Loads of character types\n  - No forced timeline (As in you have x amount of turns to complete things)\n  - FREE DLC\n\nCons:\n  - A.I. is virtually non-existant\n  - GUI is... clunky, especially during crafting.\n  - Replay value after maxxing out all Gods is very very low.\n  - Multiprayer (Multiplayer) is dull.\n  - Extremely easy  (Difficulty only seems to slow you down, not stop you)\n\nI saw the kickstarter for Thea 2 and am probably going to back it.  I hope to see an improved GUI, better Multiplayer support like creating public lobbies so you don't have to find someone on your own outside of the game, more crafting recipes and/or materials, give children something to do, and maybe make it so that you don't end up doing the same strategy every time because it is the fastest way to win.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505438431, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505438431, "recommendationid": "34961351", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530381", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459495268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 835, "steamid": "76561198020135537", "num_games_owned": 96}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 26, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I like Thea's concept, but the inventory micromanagement ruined the fun. The monstrous scale of micromanagement required is beyond ridiculous; and this from someone who loved the original Settlers and similar games. I have never, ever spent this much time trying to organize and reorganize inventories in a game. Not even Dungeons and Dragons Online which was pretty bad inventory management and incredibly time-wasting.\n\nThe devs could have created a way to optimize gear with one button, but chose not to. So instead you'll spend most of your time trying to optimize gear so your people don't die permanently faster than they otherwise would.\n\nThe game - beyond that major complaint - is fun and innovative, with definitely interesting twists on the 4X tropes. But because of the inventory problems, I can't reccomend the game. There are other, better 4X games out there to \"one more turn\" in.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505204867, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505204943, "recommendationid": "34897058", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518997", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504336850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1556, "steamid": "76561198108100947", "num_games_owned": 126}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great strategy - RPG - civilization game\n\nIt's confusing at first (sorry but the tutorial sucks... all text) but once you get the hang of it, it's awesome. It's a blend of cilization : you have a village and have to expand and sruvive, and strategy RPG : you can embark your villager on an expedition to gather resource, gain level, and clear quests. I would love if each gods have distinct difference other than bonus (e.g. unique building or units). \n\nThe only cons is, althought the land is randomly generated, it doesn't feel unique because the quest, units, techs, buildings are always the same. I finished once and thats it. Also, villagers have tooo many stat. I can't really calculate the \"strength\" of each villager and most of the time just skip the battle.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504931982, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504931982, "recommendationid": "34829048", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506263", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507166506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2068, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2298, "steamid": "76561198019375244", "num_games_owned": 81}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A good turn based mix of RPG and Builder/Explorer.\n\nDeveloping your village at the start takes some time, but as you gather more people, you will eventually be able to put multiple exploration groups out.\n\nCombat is an interesting stylized card match. Half your squad is randomly in the front line (round up), and can thus attack twice in the first round.  The other half can only join confused, getting one attack in the first round, but can instead use their skills to modify the battlefield. I prefer to knock out my opponents cards when possible, and confuse powerful enemies, if done right, you can set up precise kills without wasting damage.\n\nDo watch out, taking even a little damage can have negative effects, so save frequently. Iron man mode game, one save file, although there is an autosave.\n\nCrafting in village is also an interesting part, since once you get mutliple resources, you can craft your particular item crafting to make exactly what you want. I recommend turning OFF use new items automatically, and manually turn on things you DON'T want to craft with, which is just about nothing. Let your people eat nothing but base food and burn cheap wood, save the good stuff for crafting.\n\nI'll leave the story line to you, so as not to spoil it.\n\nOverall if you like party management, resource gatherer, or explorer games, there will probably something in this one you will like, if you like all those, this is a definate get.

Thea isn't even in the 4X genre.  I would say Thea is mainly a turn-based RPG in which you scavenge and plunder resources from the surrounding world to strengthen your team by crafting more powerful gear for them.  You can use this power to complete the main quest chain which will lead you to fulfilling one of the three Victory conditions of Thea, and then a second if you choose to keep playing after the first is complete.  Of course you can also just ignore the main quest and do what you please, sandbox style.\n\nThere is no expansion through the building of additional settlements.  Instead, your one settlement serves as a home base where you can bring the resources you earn during your travels.  It is also important to ensure your home is adequately defended, for you will lose the game if it falls!\n\nEach patron god in Thea's Pantheon earns EXP when you complete a game with them, unlocking new bonuses in future games and adding replay value.  Additional replay value is added by the randomized world of Thea.  Aside from the randomization of the map itself, random events will trigger as you go, each of which can be solved (or failed) in multiple ways.\n\nYes, combat is not the only way to deal with the problems Thea will throw at you.  Apart from Warriors, various classes in the game specialize in different non-combat skills, such as stealth and magic.  There are social skills to talk your way out of troubles, and also healing skills to combat sickness and death by injury.\n\nOne thing Thea does have in common with Civilization is the insidous \"one more turn\" mentality that can keep you playing for hours longer than you realized.  It is an exceptional and unique RPG, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys turn-based games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506554525, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506554525, "recommendationid": "35251071", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483829145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5100, "steamid": "76561198025275052", "num_games_owned": 127}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A fantastic game in almost every regard.

After reading every review good and bad I decided to spend the 20 bucks.\nSo far I have nothing negative to say about it, but will update my post as I work through the game. \nI have 20 hours in game and I have to say I am impressed, I have picked up a few lower grade RPG's over the past year and with such to contrast; THEA is Delightfully engaging, leaving you with a suspensful urgency to help save the Mystical World of THEA, the game play is not as involving as I would have thought, meaning that All I really need is a mouse which makes it a wonderful thing of relaxation. Graphics are good and so far the only glitch I have had is after a four hour stint of being in game it will punt me to the desktop Not sure if it is actually the game or if it is something else maybe a bootstrapper issue but I just click the window tab and I'm back in without any complications.
