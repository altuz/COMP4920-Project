Lower end laptops will need to drop the settings back and might get some framerate hiccups occasionally, but nothing that would make it unplayable. Keys currently aren't fully remappable, but Degica seems to have a good track record with addressing player concerns.\n\nBeyond that, I just want to run through some of the things that make Eschatos stand out to me.\n\n- The game is forgiving. It's not an easy game, but extra lives are fairly plentiful. You never really feel like you need to restart after losing a life, or that you end up in an unrecoverable situation. There's no getting sent back to checkpoints or getting reduced to an unusable power level.\n\n- The scoring mechanics are straightforward. Essentially, you increase a multiplier for killing entire enemy waves, and your multiplier drops when enemies escape the screen. There are some other considerations, especially in Advanced mode, but the multiplier's most of it. There's no barrier for entry to playing for score.\n\n- This isn't the kind of game where you can just memorize the levels and get through it. You need to learn how the enemy patterns work and react to what you do, especially if you want to keep your multiplier going. \n\n- Enemies all feel unique. Even the popcorn enemies. The scoring mechanics emphasize not letting any enemies escape alive, enemies are built around being inconvenient to kill, and they achieve this in a variety of ways.\n\n- You have three attack types -- a wide shot, a frontal shot, and a shield -- available at all time. They're all have distinct purposes and they're all useful.\n\n- Bombs are used as soon as you pick them up -- there's no bomb stock.\n\n- The game is as much about managing your shield as it is about dodging bullets. \n\n- The game likes throwing weird camera angles at you and it actually works. Weird camera angels in SHMUPs do not usually work.\n\n- Time Attack mode isn't a time-limited caravan mode like you usually see in SHMUPs, but instead is more like Outrun. You get the whole game here, and you have a limited amount of time to finish it. Clearing areas/beating bosses/picking up 1-ups gets you more time. Getting shot makes you lose time. \n\n- The way the music is used is noteworthy. The soundtrack itself is excellent, yes, but in game, it's almost like the enemy waves are choreographed to the music? I don't know if it was intentional, but it's cool.\n\n- A goodly amount of unlockables. \n\nOh, and definitely go for the bundle with Judgement Silver Sword and Cardinal Sins -- they're both wonderful titles", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442646379, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442646379, "recommendationid": "18095024", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545209", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492121472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 156, "steamid": "76561197989101741", "num_games_owned": 206}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Bought it because of the soundtrack.

I have been waiting a while to be able to get a chance to play this game, and so far in my first couple of trial runs it has not disappointed one bit. Eschatos is a spiritual successor to the Wonderswan STG Judgment Silversword and as such is a vertically-scrolling wave-based shooter, with a hectic pace and lots of cool boss fights. There is a long-range straight shot for dealing with more powerful enemies, and a short-range spread shot for dealing with the waves of weaker enemies (popcorn, \"zakos\" or whatever else you would like to call them) which will swarm at you from all directions. The game is fairly high in its bullet count however the game goes lengths to not feel like a \"generic\" bullet hell title that you may see from other developers.\n\nAll of this is backed up by a sharp presentation with hectic perspective changes and a stunning retro-inspired soundtrack by one of my personal favourite videogame OST composers - Yousuke Yasui.\n\nSo overall I would recommend this title based on my experiences thus far.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442620223, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442620223, "recommendationid": "18091374", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502553", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497115272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 581, "steamid": "76561198016859256", "num_games_owned": 430}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Eschatos is a 2d bullet hell shmup that fuses oldschool design fundamentals with newschool depth and polish. Unlike many modern shmups, which focus entirely on dodging and esoteric scoring mechanics, Eschatos prioritizes balancing offense and defense with its unique weapon and shield mechanic against unpredictable enemies who's quirky movement makes them as challenging to hit as they are to dodge against. \n\nPlayers have the ability to shoot a long ranged and powerful straight shot, or a short range but blind-spot covering wide shot. Combining these two attacks allows you to create a shield that destroys bullets and enemies alike, but that must be recharged whilst not in use. Enemies come in waves, and the faster and the more completely you destroy these waves, the higher your score climbs and the faster the games pace accelerates.\n\nEschatos's weapons are double edged swords. Fire straight too much, and enemies will charge you from the side. Cover your sides for too long with the wide shot, and long range attackers will litter the screen with bullets. The shield itself is as much a weapon as it is protection, not only blocking bullets but allowing you to thrillingly charge straight through enemy attacks to more effectively shoot them, or even ram them. Using it too much however, will result in enemies piling up and overwhelming the player.\n\nEschatos's unique  weapon balance, varied and unpredictable enemies (who's attacks and positions are frequently semi randomized, to encourage fun improvisation and nervy reaction), endearing and innocent sounding soundtrack, rapid pace, and deep scoring system make it a game brimming with personality and fusing the best of both worlds from classic shmups and modern bullet hell.

Yes, it's a relevantly simple game on paper, unadorned by any of the complicated scoring trappings of your average CAVE shmup and it's contemporaries, or the elaborate weapon systems of more \u201ctraditional\u201d shmups, but the beauty of this game lies in the execution. I like to think of it as a modern day Zanac (which is one of my favorite games of all time), where underneath the mediocre aesthetics and muted presentation, lies a game full of depth and complexity. A shmup that was crafted with such quality, it became one of the standout examples of excellence in the genre.\n\nOn top of that, much has already been said about the high quality of the soundtrack. Youskue Yasui, usually does good work, and I think this is still his hottest soundtrack to date. \u201cSurvive\u201d in particular has been a regular jam of mine since it was first released. \n\nGet this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442727090, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442735436, "recommendationid": "18111500", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501752", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493143086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1849, "steamid": "76561198212048707", "num_games_owned": 256}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "For those that may be unaware, Qute's ESCHATOS is the spiritual successor to Judgement Silversword and Cardinal Sins.  Those familiar with the predecessors will find many aspects of this game more than a little recognizable.  Sadly, gone are all the judges and sins.  The story line of ESCHATOS can be summed up in about two sentences: Aliens have invaded the earth and captured the moon!  It is your mission to save the Earth! \n\nIt's about the depth of story one might expect from a shoot 'em up.  One might say it's even preferable to have a bare bones story.  After all, if you're playing a shmup do you really want to see things like dialogue and cut scenes?  Having said all of this, I would have liked to see them build a little bit more on the judges that they introduced in the previous games.  It would have been more unique than an alien invasion.  While the judges themselves may be things of the past, it isn't entirely fair to say that they're gone.\n\nMany of the enemies in ESCHATOS are recreations of the ones in Judgement Silversword.  Not only are they similar in appearance, some of them even have the same attack patterns.  When a mirror shield showed up I didn't recognize it, but as soon as it started firing I knew exactly what it was.  I was prepared to fight it too, as the ship in this game works almost exactly the same as it did in the earlier games.  It has a straight shot, a spread shot, and a shield.  The main differences are the shield being far more useful and the spread shot having significantly less reach.  It's also no longer possible to combine the straight and spread shots through rapid button tapping.\n\nThe game has three modes of play: original, advanced, and time attack.  Original is a very traditional mode that features screen clearing blue bombs that can be picked up without penalty.  Time attack is what it sounds like, you try to clear the game as fast as possible.  Advanced is a little more complicated than normal.  Your ship starts off very weak and can be strengthened via pickups.  The power ups will raise your attack power, lower your shield power, and increase your score multiplier.  There are two screen clearing bombs in this mode, but picking up either does the exact opposite of a power up.  A blue bomb will simply destroy everything on the screen, but a gold one will transform bullets into purple shards.  The shards can be picked up for points or transformed into temporary damaging orbitals by activating the shield.  It was a little tricky for me to figure it out without any instructions but it's a lot of fun once you get used to it.  Original and advanced have the following difficulty options: easy, normal, hard, hardest, and endless.  Whether you're completely new to the genre, or an arcade veteran, there will be something here for you.\n\nThere has been a major update in graphics since the days of the Wonderswan.  This is easily one of the most cinematic games I've ever played.  The stages flow into each other so effectively that it almost feels like watching a movie about a lone ship taking down an alien invasion.  Unlike many games there aren't really breaks between stages, the whole game is continuous.  It is handled very well, however there were a few perspective changes that I initially found to be very confusing.  After playing a few times I got the hang of it, but I can imagine some players finding it frustrating.  In addition to the  perspective changes, there is one bullet type I had trouble with at first.  I didn't find the semi-transparent green homing ribbons to be as visible as they probably should be considering their danger level.  Much like the perspective changes I was able to get used to them eventually, but I believe the developers handled these projectiles better in Judgement Silversword.  Aside from the visuals, it would be remiss of me not to mention the audio.  The soundtrack is so outstanding I've found myself listening to a few of the tracks on repeat.\n\nWhen I first started playing ESCHATOS I wasn't so sure about it.  As cool as the cinematic game play was, the perspective shifts in several stages really had me questioning the style.  After putting some time into it, it has really grown on me a lot.  The scoring system is based around killing every enemy in a wave to increase your multiplier.  I found it to be straightforward, challenging, and a whole lot of fun.  It's a shame that this game doesn't seem to be very popular. It's a very solid shoot 'em up.  M-Kai and Qute have done a great job here. I'd certainly recommend it to fans of shooting games.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review?

The patterns are fun, the adrenaline's pumping like crazy, so it's easy to get lost in it.\n\nRecommended for anyone wanting to dip their toes in the shmup genre. \n\nApparently, it also works incredibly well with NVIDIA 3D Vision, going by the forums.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443016172, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443169092, "recommendationid": "18158939", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.998948", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475290979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 247, "playtime_forever": 206, "steamid": "76561198071421958", "num_games_owned": 476}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "My favorite bullet hell/SHMUP.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe OST.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1473152719, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1473152719, "recommendationid": "25377596", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1461433411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 356, "steamid": "76561197963238951", "num_games_owned": 345}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A really solid traditional vertical STG from Qute with an incredible soundtrack by Yousuke Yasui.

The gameplay and control scheme is very similar to its predecessor: you have two types of weapons, being one more concentrated and long-range and other more spread shot, but short-range as well as the shield. Both the weapons and the shield are activated by pressing buttons on the controller. The gameplay offers good challenge and it's fun. The graphics are ok, but the great highlight of this game in my opinion is the great soundtrack beautifully crafted and pleasant to hear, making this game a truly immersive experience.  Eschatos is therefore more a good shmup born in the harvest of the seventh generation of consoles.

No, its not as pretty like Crimzon Clover but dont let that stop you from enjoying this fantastic shmup. \n\n+Excellent 90's arcade style soundtrack gets me pumped everytime\n+Optional DLC arranged soundtrack is fantastic too\n+Difficulty is really well done. Its challenging but not like a bullet hell shmup. *Btw this is NOT a bullet hell shmup*.  \n+The progression system is laid out extremely well, which in my book is a HUGE plus! (Some shmups just give you unlimited continues from the start which to me kills the experience of challenge). \n+Even at full price ($14.99) there is a LOT of game here\n+Achievements are fun and controller support works perfect. \n\n-Nothing really bad about it, some people may complain the graphics are somewhat simplistic but the gameplay is what counts here.
