Japanese companies putting their products on steam is a good thing, especially for those of us who like JRPGs and Visual Novel type games.  This game was finally released so I bought it, again wanting to be supportive.\nI already have the Japanese version of this game so I knew what I was getting before I even played this version, but play it I did.  \n\nMy major complaint about this game is that there are issues with the English translation.  It's not the greatest translation in the world and there are some issues with weird spacing (as is obvious from the screenshots) and there is some weirdness in the tutorials and there's that 'graveyard expression' line (which made me smile), but there are translated games with much worse translations out there. (Mangagamer's release of Shuffle! and stuff by NISA anyone?)\nAside from the issues with the translation, the other obvious thing is the removal of the hentai content, but this is steam so it's to be expected.\n\nThe bottom line? Buy this game if you like japanese games and want to support the eventual release of more japanese games in the west, oh, and also, buy it if you like hacking monsters to pieces with a couple of cute mikos... damn... almost forgot the most important part.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445614857, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445614857, "recommendationid": "18641022", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519783", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478214407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 265, "playtime_forever": 1156, "steamid": "76561198160868511", "num_games_owned": 433}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An excellent rogue-like with solid mechanics,a randomly generated loot system,character progression and customization,two different characters each having many unique skills and awesome boss battles,some of which tie directly into the game's plot,which is told via lenghty visual novel segments that could easily be a game on their own,in case you have no interest in the story you also have the option to skip them of course,also it bears mentioning that the aforementioned visual novel part of the game is fully voice,but only in japanese.\n\nIf you like rogue-like games you'll have a blast playing this one,even more so if you like visual novels as well.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1478124388, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1478203048, "recommendationid": "26380853", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515334", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446922078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 95, "steamid": "76561198053210555", "num_games_owned": 297}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Some early impressions (mainly to keep notes for myself for the final review)...\n\nI played Izuna 1 & 2 on the Nintendo DS and this game caught my eye since I loved those games and this is a Rogue-like with the same sort of style. KD so far seems a bit more simplistic but it's not a bad comparision. Unlike Izuna, who wields many weapon types, here you have two characters and each only uses one weapon type: swords or spears. Both games also use talismans/symbols but whereas in Izuna each one had an untranslated name that added a kind of puzzle element to figuring out and memorizing what each one did, here the names and effects are clearly given. So far the talismans also seem a lot more limited (E.g. healing, identifying items, basic stuff whereas Izuna had a plethora of different effects and were also essential to weapon upgrading. I might just not be far enough into the game to find interesting ones, however.)\n\nThe gameplay is very standard Rogue-like so I won't go into great detail on the mechanics. It plays very well on my gamepad, which is great. The buttons are only explained for keyboard, however, so figuring out some essential button combos like turning your character without using a turn or passing time without moving take some figuring out. The game deviates from being a hardcore Rogue-like with some very newbie-friendly difficulty options, however. \"Hard\" is a full reset of your character, though I believe you retain story progression so you have to level up and renew your inventory but not completely start over. \"Normal\" allows you to retain equipped items but you lose your level and inventory. \"Easy\" allows you to retain everything.\n\nThe story is delivered through VN cutscenes... LONG VN cutscenes. Be prepared to sit down for long story segments or skip through them if you aren't really interested. When you start the game, the first hour is something like a short cutscene, two very short tutorial levels and then another cutscene for the rest of the hour. Don't expect to dive right into the action unless you want to skip it all.\n\nAs for the translation quality, this is a first-party translated game and it's a mixed bag. It's better than a Google Translate job but it also stumbles sometimes. Overall, you'll know what they're saying but don't expect a top-notch professional localization. Lastly, it should be noted that this was originally an h-game/ero-game/whateveryouwanttocallit but all the adult content has been cut. I'm not sure how much it affects the game, if it all, since this is an early impressions. It's worth mentioning it, however.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446923670, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446923810, "recommendationid": "18936927", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483907", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446783155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 271, "steamid": "76561198063975851", "num_games_owned": 817}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A great classic rougelike with a sort of visual novel style to it, so far the charactors are fun, the gameplay, while nothing new, is great in the sense its simple and solid.

Then there is the anime? visual novel parts with the japanese voices. I find it all very lovely and funny. Although sometimes the topics diverge to weirdness.

The gameplay reminds me of two DS games; both involving the same bossy ninja girl. I think her name is Nazuna. Anyways, Kagura uses similar game mechanics and tactics so it was easy for me to get into the game. This game is very fun to play on all 3 levels of play, though beginners might find the leveling up mechanics of Normal and Strong mode to be a bit frustrating at first. The story is very enjoyable with even a couple of OMG moments (those who have already played it through will know what I'm hinting at). \nMy biggest disappointment is the story's short length. Don't get me wrong, you'll need a lot of time and finesse to complete the game at Normal and Strong mode. It's the plot that's short. I wish the developers had included at least 3 complete and varied strories before releasing the game. Sure, the game would have probably cost more, but it would be more satisfying. There are hints of possible follow - ups, but thus far, my research has not turned up anything. \nIn all, it's a very good game that's worthy of sequels.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1473053714, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1473053714, "recommendationid": "25359032", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488578059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 276, "steamid": "76561198150537561", "num_games_owned": 291}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "recommend games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468732119, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468732119, "recommendationid": "24366170", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463580", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447681005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 141, "steamid": "76561198175940870", "num_games_owned": 73}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Moe Game But Need More Map or +    +", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447413570, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447413570, "recommendationid": "19049343", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483663", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 8, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
