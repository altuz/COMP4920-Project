The game allows you to control a police force, buying and upgrading units and the facilities to deal with the daily random issues, from riots to murders. \n\nThe big issues I had with this game that puts it in the hard to recommend is the following: \n\n1. A.I - I found many times that the A.i were extremely buggy such as when tasking a unit to arrest someone they would sometimes just simply stand in front of the enemy while the enemy just stands there preventing the mission from completing. I also found that having units patrol sometimes doesn't work as they would drive around the area only to bypass crimes that were right next to them and in their line of sight. \n\n2. Path Finding - The A.i when driving seem fine with going to locations but sadly on foot it seems like a different story as units can phase through buildings while others get stuck on pretty much anything. \n\n3. Game breaking Bugs - One issue I had were having units at base resting only to have them stuck there forever.....even when dispatching all units to a crime, I would have a few just standing in base unable to move or even get rid of. Another issue were missions as sometimes even though clearing out all the enemies..it would sometimes take a few minutes before the mission updates to complete. \n\n4. Unclear Mission Objectives - many times I got fustrated with the side missions as they would ask me to investigate one area only to find out the area marked isn't the right area. Yeah I had one mission where it told me to search in this yellow area for the suspect only to find out the suspect was 4 blocks away from the marker and the only reason I found him was thanks to me watching a patrol unit driving around and seeing a suspious person standing around doing nothing. \n\nAgain overall the game is a hit and miss for me. I really want a good RTS police game but sadly this game has a lot of issues that it killed the immersion for me. It has a lot of good ideas but sadly the execution was poor.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505986696, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505986696, "recommendationid": "35100863", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543832", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506392911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 47, "steamid": "76561198155505843", "num_games_owned": 24}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game has a great concept, but that is about the end of it.
