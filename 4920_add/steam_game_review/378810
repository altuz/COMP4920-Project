If you're a fan of physics based puzzle games then this is well worth a look, particuarly if you enjoy the steampunk theme.\n\nThe gameplay has an interesting mix of turret based \"pinball\" shooting combined with a movement mechanic (I'd call it light platforming without jumping if that makes sense). While the sections focused on movement are not the most enjoyable parts of the games they are integrated into the puzzles in a manner that's more integrated into the puzzle than the simple \"clear a path to the exit\" that you get in a lot of puzzle games.\n\nMy primary complaint with this is probably the length. I was able to complete the entire game (including achievements) in just 7 hours the first time through. I'm not opposed to short games in general but the problem with short puzzle games  (including steamroll) is that a short game means that you don't really get a chance to build up a repetoire of tactics that you can use in future puzzles. That's particuarly noticeable here, each level feels completly different and for the most part strategys and tactics that work on one have very little impact on another.\n\nNow saying \"each level feels different\" does sound like an odd complaint but for a puzzle game I like it when later levels build upon skills and tactics that have been taught and used in earlier levels because it generally means that the puzzles have a greater level of depth to them. Steamroll doesn't really have that, each level and to some degree even each turret spot has a single, relatively unique solution to it that probably won't come up again.\n\nOverall though this is still a solid game. The gameplay is fun, the plot is decent and the artwork is solid.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462167188, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1462167188, "recommendationid": "22756455", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503363", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502670180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 318, "steamid": "76561198115226378", "num_games_owned": 128}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I was a bit unsure about it at first but ended up quite enjoying it.
