The story appears to be a story with another. The princess has made a pact with a demon, but now needs to break it by hunting down demons across the world and killing them. But all of this is a tale written by a girl who is fighting her own demons in this way (through the story she is writing).\n\nWhether that is a glimpse into the actual author, or another layer of storytelling... tricky to tell.\n\nStill, it appears to be a good game.
