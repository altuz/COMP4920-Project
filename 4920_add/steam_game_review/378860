I haven't played it for long yet, but I never got along with the first game and much preferred Assetto Corsa. Project Cars 2, however, is very likely my new favourite. It's the first driving game where driving the car is easy but gets harder by the right amount as you go faster. \n\nSome sim racing titles are actually harder than driving a real car on track because they spend a huge amount of time on a realistic tyre and physics model, without considering that the player doesn't have any of the sensations that they would have in a real car. Too much realism without the visual cues and physical feedback  a driver gets from the steering wheel (and seat of their pants) isn't fun. This game is fun. It is not arcade or simcade, it's a simulator with the right amount of realism in the right places.\n\nMy only complaint is that the tyre noise rarely shuts up. It's not as bad as Forza or GT in thast respect, but it's still a bit much. Racing cars don't squeal like banshees every time they go round a corner!\n\nPlaying on Oculus Rift with a Thrustmaster T300RS, this game feels and looks great.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506037670, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506037857, "recommendationid": "35116283", "language": "english", "votes_down": 48, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667673", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506538263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1503, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1503, "steamid": "76561198011727539", "num_games_owned": 233}, "votes_funny": 10, "votes_up": 343, "comment_count": "44", "review": "My suggestion to everyone reading reviews right now is just to ignore them until the game settles eg. gets updated and properly optimized (FOR A TON OF HARDWARE THAT EXISTS ON THIS PLATFORM). You cannot really expect a true review from someone who doesn't even have an hour in the game or the people that just write a negative review because of their own PC problems. One thing I can disprove is the \"bad graphics\", people really need to get their heads out of their a**es. It has the best graphics in sim racing genre. Idk what Forza and NFS fanboys expected OUT OF A SIMULATION. As mentioned, just ignore the reviews for now until the game gets some \"age\" and updates. I will update my review as I play! So far it's a great sim!\n\nUPDATE #1(I am playing on G29 with pedals and shifter): So far the game is an amazing experience! FFB is absolutely amazing now(compared to PC1) and it's pretty comparable with AC.(Note: Most people with DD wheels still have issues, but DD wheels take longer to adjust because they are much more complex than consumer wheels). Tires are squealing at proper moments but they sound like exorcism, good thing is there is a Tyre slider in audio options so thats a thumbs up! Also note that there are bugs and glitches, after restarting a session, damage stays on the car and icons for TC and ABS are gone on the HUD gauge.\n\nUPDATE #2: The default throttle sensitivity feels too high since even when using the Stable tuning setup cars tend to go sideways. Another bug after session restart I found is that the lap time counter some times starts sometimes doesn't. Also digital display doesn't work on GT86s gauge cluster\n\nUPDATE #3: I don't know was it the game update or the Logitech software profile, but FFB feels now better than ever(tested on the same cars I drove day 1). I also tried multiplayer and participated in a GT3 race...and I was blown away, it was amazing. Debris on track after crashes, weather changes, pit stops, overtakes, I'm just blown away by the sensation. Also cars don't feel that slidey anymore. I assume this is the \"Day-1 Patch\" that fixed most of the issues. Also note to NVIDIA users, using GeForce Experience to \"optimize\" game messed up a lot of stuff in game.\n\nHere are screenshots of my video and audio settings: https://imgur.com/a/g9y3H\nVideo: https://youtu.be/Cj3-aKN8Z6E", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506039600, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506532720, "recommendationid": "35116720", "language": "english", "votes_down": 95, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692867", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506978907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1845, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1845, "steamid": "76561198336325477", "num_games_owned": 27}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 126, "comment_count": "9", "review": "I'm not so good at writing reviews but I will attempt to do so, because PC2 don't deserve a mixed rating.\nI feel a lot of the 1.2-1.7 hour reviews are just here for a quick test and thats it. Won't even attempt to give the game more than that.\n\nI'll start off with saying im very pleased with the game. I have about 200 hours in first game and loved it.\nGoing from PC1 to PC2 was not an easy task, ill tell you that much. I have now spent 3.5 hours into the game and im still not comfortable driving. But I've gotten way better than the first hour. With some in-game adjustment to wheels, cars etc it feels really good. \n\n\nSome opinions, rather than pros and cons:\n\n\nGraphics - Not a huge - mind blowing difference, but a very noticable upgrade. I play the game on ultra and it looks and plays amazing. (Note: On PC1 I suffered from major lag spikes both in solo and online play, I did not notice a single lag spike on PC2. So thats a huge +) Specs below if you are curious.\n\nGeneral Gameplay - As mentioned above, you can't really get a feel and get used to a game within 2 hours. But my opinion is that it feels good after getting a little used to and after you have tweaked some settings. Driving a car in PC2 is very different from PC1 and needed a major change in driving style.\n\nSounds: I have no clue what so ever what the other people are saying, the sounds are fantastic IMO. The menu music is also 10/10. Get some good speakers, to you who are complaining! \n\nTrack / Car selection: Mind blown, so many tracks and cars to test and have fun with!\n\nAI: I did not get rammed yet, even if I were slower or faster. Maybe give the faster cars a line to pass you? :)))) In general the AI feels more consistent and drives more even. I also noticed some random crashes etc which IMO is just great because it adds to the realism. AI avoiding crashes at all cost is just boring. I did however notice that they are holding back when they are right behind you out of a corner.. So that's a minus. Might just be my difficulty setting, in the 3.5 hours spent I left them at where the game put them.\n\nOnline: Again, went into a few races. And it was non laggy and very responsive. I do think however they might work on the collision models because some GT3 cars flew up in the air. I didnt have a chance to see what caused it but. \n\nThe breaks were sort of odd to me, as they locked straight up. Even with and without the assistance. I tweaked some settings with my pedals and the car brakes but didnt get much difference.. Will have to look into that further, probably just on my end.\n\nAll in all guys, if you did read trough. Project Cars 2 is a really great game with tons of variety, beautiful graphics, sounds and great online gameplay. This is launch day after all and some things will be tweaked. But it was a really good experience and it's worth buying. See you on the track! :-)\n\nEdit: Specs: GTX 1080 OC, i7 6700k 4.0ghz and 32GB RAM.

However, I do occasionally enjoy some single player action and in that regard, I find PC2 to be very good and is well worth the purchase. Here is a quick bullet point layout of my thoughts:\n\nPhysics -Grade B and much better than PC1\n\nForce feedback - Grade A, I was very surprised to find this is outstanding and easy to setup \n\nCars / Tracks - Grade B+, certainly not up to iracing's laser scan standards but very good\n\nEasy of use - Grade A, I'm highly impressed with how easy it was to setup my Accuforce and HPP pedals and custom button box. WAY better than PC1. \n\nDynamic track - Grade B, pretty good, but I some things like curbs and grass simply don't react realistically. Like one wheel touches the grass and it's like a magnet or a simply painted curb is like ice. \n\nWeather - Gade B, very good but honestly I don't have much to compare it to. It is very cool to change tires in the wet, but I wish my pit crew did a better job of telling me if and when I should switch tires. \n\nAI - Grade C, still better than PC1 and very playable, but it needs work for sure. Def not a deal breaker as others have suggested. \n\nVR - Grade A++, absolutely the best VR experience to date. Everything from the ease of setup to the game menus works perfectly. \n\nPerformance - Grade A, I run a beastly computer with GTX 1080 and simply don't have any issues even in VR. \n\nBugs - Grade C, I have to admit, there are a fare share of bugs in the game right now. Nothing game breaking, but I get crashes all the time when switching menus and there are a few graphical anomalies. However, I'm sure these will get worked out over the next few weeks. \n\nMultiplayer - Grade NA, haven't tried it and doubt I would over iracing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506271570, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506271570, "recommendationid": "35185583", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511612", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 439, "total_reviews": 618, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 179}}
