If you own a HTC Vive and launch this game, it will automatically turn on your Vive as well for some odd reason and run the game in VR mode...? After disconnecting my Vive I then managed to start up the game, but everytime I change the settings from window to fullscreen mode it just freezes the game.

But I was let down so very bad by what the game offers out of the gate. \"Partial Controller Support\"? Nowhere to be found. Push a button on my wired 360 controller, character jumps. Push any other button, nothing happens. So there is clearly no controller support here (false advertising?). I don't see any button mappings for controllers, and no way to edit the key bindings. So either I play with mouse and keyboard, or I make do with one button. \n\nScreen resolution is at a severe loss - game does not take into account that not everyone has a huge screen size. If I want to play at a resolution at anything close to my maximum resolution, I have to settle for black bars on the screen, which utterly kills the immersion one would expect from a game like this. Seems widescreens like mine don't get factored in. My top resolution is 1366x768, yet the only usable one is 1280x720 or 1024x768 - and those black bars. Oh, those black bars. The lack of widescreen support also kills the game for me.\n\nThe fact that I cannot launch the game before experiencing these problems leaves me wondering what else may be wrong with it - but I'm not willing to stick around and find out. I love horror games, even indie horror games, but this was a letdown out of the gate. Let's Play videos made this game look good, but unfortunately my first experiences (which have the biggest impact) were a huge letdown.\n\nI'm sorry, but I just cannot recommend this game.

The biggest problem is that nothing is explained at all. I'm not sure if that's because I didn't play the first one or what.

I only played for ~50 minutes but I saw around 10 individual monsters. It played like a knock-off Amnesia: Dark Descent. \nOh and fuck those poisonous plant things, what a fucking joke.

I must say for only costing me $5.99 it was a great horror game. The atmosphere and scares were all there and trying to survive in the world the devs created is very challenging but not so much that it hurts the game in any way. So basically for scares, atmosphere, and just overall fun it was great. BUT....\n\nI was seeing other people post how not playing the game on epic settings can make it glitch and not work correctly. So I tested that out and if you don't play on epic settings the game is very buggy and sometimes just will crash completely. Make sure to PLAY ON EPIC SETTINGS!\n\nLastly (WARNING SPOILERS... KIND OF) the end is very rushed it seems. The game was paced well throughout playing it but then at the end all of a sudden everything is summed up in about 5 sentences. I really wish the game would have had one more level after the school to smooth it out and make it completely better. \n\nBut besides those things I loved the game and would reccommend anyone who loves survival horror to play the game.
