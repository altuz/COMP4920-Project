I started up the game and died almost immediately to a goat. No problem! I started a new character (death is permanent unless you change to casual mode) and died to a giant rat.  No problem! I started again and died of hunger and then of thirst! I switched to casual and messed around for a while, finally figuring out that I needed to harvest apples from trees to eat and quench thirst, etc. The beginning of this game is really hard and there isn't a whole lot of initial direction to figure things out. Once you learn the ropes a little it becomes immediately addictive and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes survival games and learning things yourself, the hard way!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504591912, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504591912, "recommendationid": "34750665", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505218337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1410, "steamid": "76561198010780741", "num_games_owned": 78}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If one manages trough the steep learning curve and the roguelike element of \"having bad luck\", this is a truly fantastic game under constant development. The Devs don't shy away from a challenge, by implementing multiplayer for example(as I am writing this, multiplayer is not yet released). \n\nI must warn, there is little to no handholding in this game and some mechanics are not very intuitive. This does however make experimentation more fun, as there is more than one approach to many tasks.\n\nThe community and Devs are quite helpful and the development process is very open. There currently is no up to date Wiki, mostly due to the rapid and large updates in Wayward.\n\nIt is a fun game, survival can be as tough as you want it to be, the weight limit is somewhat cumbersome and the roguelike elements are fun and frustrating.

This might lead to the \u201cYou can\u2019t make everyone happy\u201d problem, but for now Drathy seems to be in control.

Like most survival games, once you are advanced enough to not be worrying about surviving there isn't a whole lot to aim for, though maps to treasure and increasing monster difficulty if you anger the island gives more than some games in the genre. It is by no means as hard as some salty reviewers say, in fact it is so easy as to border on boring if you keep the island happy. \nNot understanding that, though, and starting off in a negative way could make a start quite difficult, and the game doesn't carrently explain it, or much else for that matter.

By accidently bumping into objects such as, say, stone (which is QUITE easy to do) the game automatically assumes that you want to mine it (and with your bare hands), and after multiple accidental bumps, you start to bleed.
