Oh, it looks so cute with the cartoon fish and stuff.  But the gameplay is unbalanced.  I assume that this was a mobile phone game with microtransactions, because it's too hard the way it is.  They don't give you enough cards in a deck to play without getting extra items.  There's a shop you can buy stuff in, but you only get a small amount of money by playing.  So either do a lot of grinding or give up.  I'm just glad they don't have achievements, especially a \"get 3 stars on every level\" achievement, because that would be near impossible.\n\nThis is the \"Three Towers\" type of solitaire.  Similar to Faerie Solitaire, but no where near as good.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452661212, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452661212, "recommendationid": "20499922", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526228", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485102157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 324, "steamid": "76561198053495444", "num_games_owned": 1340}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Finished the game so quickly all I was left with was disappointment. I think I have 5 hours on record, but I play games like this during commercials on hulu...so a lot of that was spent just idle and not playing. It also seems to just be really unbalanced. Solitaire games are one of my favorite genres, but this one just left me feeling ripped off. It was such a cute idea too that I ignored previous negative reviews thinking that my love of the genre would make it better for me. That was my fault really. I can't recommend this for anyone unless some serious updating and expanding was done to make it more worth the price being asked.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485142289, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485142289, "recommendationid": "29435896", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503992", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439110272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1072, "steamid": "76561198088220186", "num_games_owned": 168}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "gets repetitive quick and not much to it. basic solitaire here. nothing too special.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458376586, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1458376586, "recommendationid": "21918769", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488871", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438531638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 398, "steamid": "76561198020294862", "num_games_owned": 72}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "very short game disappointing", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443639600, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443639600, "recommendationid": "18266688", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477903", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
