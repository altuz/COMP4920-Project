Since the game follows a similar path of Silent Hill, I was more interested to give this game a try.\n\nThere was one major drawback to the game and it involves the combat system.  In fairness, the combat system does feel \u201crealistic\u201d in a sense that, it should be harder to see beyond your light until the monsters come close.  Also, your gun should take a split second before letting off the next bullet; sadly, realism is thrown out the window due to frustrations of the combat mechanics.  Most of the time, it\u2019s difficult to avoid getting hit due to the restrictive movements of the character.  The RPG Maker engine only allows you to move up, down, left and right.  The character cannot move around freely as in diagonally; although, I have seen other RPG Maker games do that.  Running doesn\u2019t help much in the game since the enemies tend to run at you just as fast.  In addition, the map layouts are not as open enough to move around with many obstacles in your way, that at times, I find myself bumping into walls or trees.  By then, the enemies are already on you.  With limited lighting as well, you don\u2019t get many opportunities to take out the enemy at a distance.  Again, I think that is how the game is supposed to be.  Fortunately, the only remedy in progressing is saving often even if I have to die a lot.\n\n\nOn the plus side, I do enjoy the scavenging since surviving isn\u2019t all that easy.  I also thought the story was alright.  You kind of know where the story may be leading upon progression but it does stick to its dark roots of a psychological horror game.\n\nI'm glad the developer(s) added controller support.  That is a plus for me.\n\nThe price tag seems fair.  Even though the game is short, it\u2019s not that short like other games that can be completed within the hour and charge for a similar price.  On top of that, there is nothing too problematic to dislike about the game other than the challenging combat system.  You may like the storyline or feel indifferent about it.  This game may not blow people away to a point where I can recommend it but the game is alright and worth a try if you like psychological horror games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500802135, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500802135, "recommendationid": "33739989", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500082", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 21, "total_reviews": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
