It's awesome.  It feels like 1998 all over again.  And after just a few minutes, you will forget that you are looking at a something made almost 20 years ago.  The framerate is so smooth and the controls are so responsive that it makes for an enjoyable experience, even today.\n\nConsole Classics has done it again with another amazing PS1 port.  I like how they even have a stylish custom-made launcher that allows you to select a control scheme, some sound options, video options, and.. that's pretty much it.  Then you click 'play' and it plays perfectly. \n\nNot much else to say, but I will make some points.\n\n[u]Pros:[/u]\n[list]\n[*] Cheap.  $3.75 US launch price is fair.  \n[*] Runs well, high frame rate and is reliable. \n[*] Saving to a PS1 memory card is built into the program internally.  \n[*] Has a cool custom launcher.  \n[*] Works with Xbox 360 controller out of the box by selecting 'Xbox' in the launcher.\n[/list]\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n[list]\n[*] I could not get the game's video to work after it had been minimized once.  For example: launch the game in fullscreen, then alt-tab away, and it would not come back ever, although you can hear the audio playing.  Re-launching the program again obviously would work..  You just can't alt-tab out and expect it to come back.\n[*] Could not find a way to customize controls.  There are keyboard and controller options, but unless the option is hidden from my sight I do not think you can re-bind them.  Bummer.\n[*] On the 360 controller, everything works perfectly BUT the steering was too sensitive to consider being perfect.  I would absolutely LOVE a way to lower sensitivity!  Maybe it was really sensitive on the PS1 as well, I have no idea.\n[*] VERY minor non-issue comment: the video resolution options are nonsensical.  If you select 720p in windowed mode it displays a 4:3 aspect ratio window.  That does against the definition of 720p, which is 16:9 ratio.  I would prefer the developer to use proper terminology, but that's not a big issue.\n[/list]\n\nAll in all, it's a great port.  Well done, Console Classics.\n\nI made a little video of my first impressions of the game: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urh8wRvZ6Vs", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436211239, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436285898, "recommendationid": "16914967", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536776", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437155263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 28, "steamid": "76561198047090124", "num_games_owned": 852}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Feels exactly the same way it did back when it was released, choppy and hard to control, but that was part of this game, and I kind of enjoy the feeling.
