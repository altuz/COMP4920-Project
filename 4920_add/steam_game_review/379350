For those of you who don't know who XS games were, they were responsible for porting over some games that came over from Japan. Their first attempt at marketing a game from japan was Mobile Light Force I believe. While the Charlies Angels theme for that game did not go so well gamers immediately liked the ability to play Gunbird. The company took note and did not alter games again and released games in their original themes. \n\nThis game does play well compared to it's counter part and while there are some frames of animation that are missing from this version of the game it still plays smoothly and well. There are no instances of where the game says \"Now loading\" which makes the game even more fun to play. If you are not an expert in this game, you can button mash your way through the first few levels and continue right in the middle where you left off, even in boss battles. But once you get to a certain stage and you get defeated by a certain boss, you can continue, but it sends you back to the beginning of the level. I think this was intentional by the developer for a challenge, even if you put it on the easy level. \n\nThere are some minor hitches to this game that I did not understand at first. I did not know how to tell if I was truly in full screen mode or not and found out there was a check mark next to Windowed to tell me I was there. But once I unticked that box I was in full screen. The visuals did look nice in Full Screen.\n\nAlso.... When the audio transitions to another track, you can hear a slight popping noise. While not annoying it does show the effects of emulation. Don't hate the game because of it.\n\nFinally I'm not happy at the fact that I can't take screenshots. The emulation technology they use has to use some form of Open GL or Direct 3D instead of software rendering etc. If they can implement a way to get screenshots for the game working it would be nice to share with my friends who don't have the game yet so they can see more of it in action then the screenshots and video that is on display in the store.\n\nOverall a wonderful effort from Console Classics to legally revive a generation of classic gaming we once thought was dead minus some very tiny inperfections.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436820877, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436820877, "recommendationid": "17033524", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551640", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437266595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561198010424891", "num_games_owned": 913}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game except for one not-so-small problem.

That being said, this port is actually rather lackluster, it adds nothing and removes 2 player support. This game desperately needs a save feature, which it lacks, however the PSX version lacked a save feature aswell. Sound and graphics options are only available in the boot up menu. You cannot shift + tab with this game, furthermore, you cannot alt + tab out of this game or it will effectively crash. These two things are made much worse by the fact that you cannot save, so if you want to beat this game you must commit to this game and only it for an extended period of time.\n\nPros of the game itself\n-Nostalgia\n-Pretty fun\n-Sound effects and Music\n-Cool Aesthetic\n\nCons of the game itself\n-High Difficulty due to reliance on randomized enemy drops\n-Graphics style\n-No 'actual' story\n-Everybody can fly\n\nId rate the port quality as poor 2.5/10 because it is strictly worse than the PSX version\nthe game itself gets a 6/10 but that's because the 'feel' of a game weighs heavily with me.\n\nTotal 4.25/10\n\nfor 4.99, I cannot recommend this game, get it on sale for a 1.50, like I did, I'd say go for it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466108494, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1466111289, "recommendationid": "23602404", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458570659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 117, "steamid": "76561198046010361", "num_games_owned": 942}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "PSX port of a poor shmup/arpg/roguelike with neat ideas and broken achievements.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458570737, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1458573158, "recommendationid": "21964483", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501639", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436859842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561198034742110", "num_games_owned": 393}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is still my jam.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436828422, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436828422, "recommendationid": "17035140", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480106", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436928077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 46, "steamid": "76561198156825219", "num_games_owned": 34}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Thats OK . so fun", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457106753, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457106753, "recommendationid": "21622123", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 8, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
