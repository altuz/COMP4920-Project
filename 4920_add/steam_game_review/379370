The original ported version of Gunbird for Sega Saturn and Playstation 1, back in the mid-90s. \n\nWell, almost... It's actually a very horrible port of that version, with a very bad in the style of Charlie's Angels that bear no resemblance to the game proper, and all the in-game conversation and story progression replaced with an awkward pause. There's also no fan-art feature as as well...\n\nStill, those features aside, Gunbird is one of the very best shmup ever be released and this version is no different. The difficulty ramps up quite nicely for anyone new to the genre, providing lots of single-player or hotseat multiplayer action fun. Definitely a must-get for any shmup lovers.!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437273736, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437273736, "recommendationid": "17117530", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527142", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446002271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 21, "steamid": "76561197974549844", "num_games_owned": 710}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": "5", "review": "It's Gunbird--otherwise known as Mobile LIght Force.  A great Psikyo shooter from the PS1 era.  That cheap $10 game you bought at Best Buy or Gamestop is back on Steam, EXACLY the way you remember it.  This is a direct PS1 port--including load times.  It shouldn't be a big issue, but after playing shmups that have those taken out, it's a bit jarring.  Waiting for the music to \"load\" for a boss fight is kind of weird in this day and age.\n\nThe graphics are dated, and the gameplay is quite simple, but it does change up a couple things from the standard shmup.  For one, if you direct your character to the bottom of the screen, they will pull the action back with them.  Which sounds cool, and benefitial, but it only causes your dodging abilities trouble when you have to quickly readjust to the moving bullet swarm coming right towards you.  Be prepared for a bunch of cheap deaths until you finally get used to it.  Also, you can't fly all the way to the bottom of the screen.  There's an invisible barrier keeping you from it.  This also limits your dodging ability.  \n\nIn the end--you know the ol' saying (say it with me, kids)--if you like the genre, you'll like the game.

To get the technical stuff out of the way first: Yes, this game is missing some of it's features that it had as a full release of Gunbird like Local Co-op. Because it's emulated, while they are considerably smaller than it's PSX counterpart, you will get loading screens. The game has no end sequence, although having never beat it in it's original incarnation I can't comment for if the original arcade machine had an end sequence. Fundamentally, it's a direct PSX CD-rip of the 'Mobile Light Force' cut down version of Gunbird, emulated on PC architecture.\n\nIf you're looking for a polished, built around your PC/Mac shmup with tons of options, loads of internet features like leaderboards, challenges etc, look elsewhere.\n\nIf you don't care about red tape and love gameplay pure and simple, get this in. Despite the bare-bones budget presentation and godawful low-res bootleg title screen, this is still Psikyo's Gunbird, which is an excellent late 90s early 00s style shooter. It's in the style of Raiden, Strikers etc in that there aren't really any fancy mechanics, just power-ups, smart bombs and skill. The graphics are cute, the game has a great sense of fun and the mechanics are really tight. \n\nFor me in the Psikyo catalogue, this game sits just behind Strikers 1945 and 1945 II as a solid 3rd best shooter they put out. It plays in a very similar way to Strikers 1945. It has a mildly frustrating mechanic where your power-ups only stay active for a timed period after which you need to collect more to power your guns back up, which would be fine if there was any display of this onscreen to tell you it was about to happen, but it just does it and it's up to you to keep an eye on your level of power via what you're shooting, which is incredibly hard when there's bullets flying all over the shop.\n\nHowever, it counters this with a fairly low level of difficulty (relative to the genre of course, it's still quite hard lol!) so this is like I say, a frustration rather than a game-breaking issue. The game also sweetens the pot by having an excellent soundtrack (aside from a title screen tune that's rather nails-down-chalkboard) and a wide selection of characters to choose from, adding more to it's ability to cater to a wide range of playstyles.\n\nOverall it comes down to this: This is currently the only legal way to play Gunbird on a PC. If you have a PSX, you could buy the original or this release on that, but it would probably cost far more than it's \u00a34 pricetag on Steam as most shmups on PSX or PS2 are rare as hen's teeth as the print run was generally small for what was at the time a niche market. While the port is fairly direct with no concessions or alterations made (and an initially mindboggling but actually quite intuitive forced keyboard layout), it's still got multiple resolution options, multiple control support and very VERY solid emulation with no glitching or crashing. So you basically need to make a choice between tracking down a potentially very expensive original version of the game, or manning up a bit and lumping the slightly rushed port-job to play what is an excellent 2D shooter.\n\nI firmly recommend it, but I also understand that it's an awkward port and that won't be for everyone's tastes.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437317369, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437327560, "recommendationid": "17124984", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505985", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464950597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 304, "steamid": "76561198108690835", "num_games_owned": 48}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Well... I played the old 1994 Gunbird before and this port is very inferior but shares the gameplay so much except for the unknown reason that they decided to take away the cutscene of this game. Sadly this is just a literally PC port of the PS1 of marketing deception of Japanese games to the west which is Mobile light Force which in it's actual form an inferior version of the Japanese PS1 Gunbird with the same long loading times you would endure in real playstaion gameplay. The negatives aside it is just a lesser version of Gunbird which still is fun! and as a simple shmup game it is very enjoyable to play and try to beat the game with no continues (Well, if you disipline your self not to press continue) and I must praise the game's awesome soundtrack, very reminisent of the old original arcade soundtrack with a new fresh Arrangements.\n\nI'l give this game 5 out of 10\n\nI wish They actually ported the Japanese PS1 version of the game then I would have actually given it a higher rating since it has AWESOME Anime opening and all the cutscenes are Intact. I would definitely give it more if it actually had the soundtrack to come with it (Note that the Hours I played isn't really the hours I played this game but Rather the time I had to go to options to play the game's music) OH! And I will DEFINITELY give it more praise if they actually came in a bundle with Strikers 1945 I, II and Sengoku Aces which are one of the best Shmups by Psikyo.\n\nThe Price it's asking most people say is too much but I suppose buy the game on Sale.
