There's quite a bit of interesting history surrounding it that Wikipedia won't tell you, actually. \n\nIn Japan it was originally a Simple 1500 game known as \"Love Para: Lovely Tokyo Para-Para Musume\", developed by Warashi and published by Media Rings in 2001, with XS games localising and releasing it in North America in 2002, and Europe in 2003. It's existence is mainly to cash in on the Para-Para dancing fad in Japan at the time. A lot of that cultural significance was understandably lost in XS Games' localisation, which is what this Steam version is based on, but you can still see elements of early '00s Japanese culture in the game's visuals.\n\nYoutuber Vysethedetermined2 explains this game's history in more detail in this video's description. You can also see what the game looks like running on original hardware. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2dHnvkOtq4\n\nBut as for the game itself, I'm coming into this from a 2015 perspective, as I hadn't even heard of it beforehand. So, as a 2015 release, it actually stands up quite well! The graphics are charming and have aged well despite the low resolution, the music is catchy Eurobeat-inspired tunes, and the gameplay hold up well too! It's not too complicated, you just press the buttons to the beat, and occasionally the button prompts change positions on the screen to keep you on your toes. It starts out easy, but gets very challenging in the later stages! There are 7 stages in all, and each have three difficulty levels, so it's not a particularly long game, but at its original price of \u00a51500, or indeed $5 USD on Steam, it's good value for the content you're getting.\n\nOn the technical side, like all of Console Classics' PlayStation rereleases, this release runs in a PS1 emulator with no enhancements, so it's exactly how it was back in 2001 for better or for worse. Since it's a 2D game, raising the internal resolution would only introduce graphical issues anyway. To make the game more presentable on modern systems, it comes with its own launcher with a bunch of preset graphical and sound settings, and control profiles for a variety of controllers. It even adds Steam Achievements. Unfortunately, you can't remap the controls to your liking, so Xbox 360 controller users are stuck using the analog stick to navigate the menus, but it also supports the PS3 controller without requiring it to be remapped to XInput controls, so that's a plus if you want to play with the original control layout. \n\nWhile the presentation is a bit bare bones and could stand for some more customisation, the game itself is very well preserved, and for retro games I feel preserving exactly how they were is important, so I'm pretty happy with this release.\n\nDo I recommend it? Absolutely. If you like rhythm games, this one may be simple, but it's great value and definitely fun and charming.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447655882, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448278972, "recommendationid": "19109158", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470364", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438719326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 70, "steamid": "76561198072160969", "num_games_owned": 324}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is my childhood in a nutshell!

Frankly, they're quite easy.  They don't even require beating the whole game.\n\nPros/Cons:\n+ The art is adorable and wacky.  It's got a lot of charm.\n+ The songs are good.  They're all catchy with good rhythm.\n+ Even to get an S rank, there was an allowance for mistakes, which was nice.  It was a little forgiving.  \n+ It's only $4.99.  While I didn't get a ton of playtime out of it, it is a rhythm game and replayability is a huge factor.  It's not a bad deal.  \n\n+/- This is the sort of rhythm game that's very metronomic.  Button presses never stray away from the underlying beat, nevermind what the rest of the music is doing.  \n+/- Much of the game's difficulty came from distractions thrown in to disrupt the player's concentration on the button prompts.  I, personally, don't enjoy that type of challenge in a rhythm game, but others might.  \n\n- It's really short.  There's only seven stages.  \n- There's no tutorial to speak of.  The game just plops you into a level with no real instruction.  Given that the level ends if you do poorly enough, it's a little frustrating.  \n- Button prompts cannot be changed.  They'll always be playstation buttons.  Even with it being a ported game, it's still annoying when playing with a keyboard or different type of controller.  \n- The timing for a few of the songs felt a tad... off.  Not enough to completely ruin the game, but enough to be frustrating to compensate for.  That said, not everyone seems to have this problem.  \n- Controls cannot be edited.\n\nOverall:\nSuperstar Dance Club was alright.  As a lover of rhythm games, I did find some enjoyment out of it.  However, the wonkiness in the timing paired with the shortness and lack of button customization really hold this game back.  I know it was ported from the PS1, but that does not excuse the absence of a tutorial.  I really loved the art and the crazy looking dancers, but that alone cannot redeem this game for me.  \nPick this up if you are feeling particularly nostalgic.  Otherwise, I'd suggest passing it up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501571225, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501571225, "recommendationid": "33943587", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505696875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 69, "steamid": "76561198091210711", "num_games_owned": 44}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "those button config are terrible omg.. atleast make the the button customizable holy dam.. hell i can't even make it work with my controller LMAO...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504837875, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504837875, "recommendationid": "34806541", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 10, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
