The pixel art is nice & detailed, sound effects are sharp & crisp, and the music really gets your head bobbin'. In terms of style the game is impeccable.\n\nThe game also supports vertical monitor setups, with video options for 90-degree rotations, as well as scaling and screen positioning.\n\nThe gameplay is also really nice. There's quite a bit of enemies that show up in every stage, and also a decent amount of bullets on screen, but thankfully it never gets quite as crazy as some of the more intense bullet hell games out there, so it always feels more like you're dodging than carving a path.\nThere's a power-up meter at the bottom of the screen and it'll fill up with the different color power-ups you acquire. Each color will give you a different weapon, and the more you get of one color, the stronger that weapon will become, so if you're careful about which power-ups you pick up, you can customize exactly how you want your weapons to fire during the game.\nThe one thing I wish the game had would be a \"Speed\" power up. The ship feels just slightly too slow for my taste (For comparison: It's somewhere around the speed of the ship from Gradius with only one \"speed up\"). This makes it nearly impossible to grab all of the medals that are falling out of enemies, which don't do anything aside from give you extra points. However, high scores are a large part of my enjoyment for these games, so it seems a little disheartening to not have the extra speed.\n\nThey do have online leaderboards, which is always a nice addition. There's separate leaderboards for each difficulty as well as each stage's score attack mode once you unlock them.\n\nOverall, aside from the ship speed, which is a relatively minor complaint in the grand scheme of things, the game is fantastic. I would definitely recommend it to anybody who is a fan of scrolling shooters, especially ones from the mid-90s, as it seems to really accurately evoke that aesthetic.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504330925, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504330925, "recommendationid": "34676888", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503017", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
