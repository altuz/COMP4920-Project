The developers have abandoned the game even though it needs more work. I really wish I could reccomend it, but I can't.\n\nI bought this game ages ago on the hope that it would be finished soon and to this day, nothing has changed. There are numerous bugs that carry across playthroughs that can force you to restart everything. The game's mechanics and goal aren't explained very well, and the \"fates\" are unbalanced and needlessly cryptic on thier various functions.\n\nYou're supposed to appease the fates by building tiles they like, but half of them will get angry anyways even if you make nothing but their favorite tiles. Sometimes they will get permanantly enraged and will either constantly destroy things or bob around in some kind of rage coma, never to destroy anything ever again.\n\nThe core gameplay is just drawing random tiles out of an imaginary bag and trying to place them intelligently. There is no real way to do this without just throwing away tiles by placing them by nothing which doesn't feel like something you should be doing, it feels like cheating, theres no downside to throwing away 1000's of tiles to get the one you want. It feels cheap considering placing a tile that doesn't match up on a side usually causes the whole area to collapse into the void.\n\nMaking it to the end only gets you a couple of abilities that don't really help you. Nothing is explained and it's hard to tell if something is a bug or feature. This game hasn't been worked on forever and the developers seem to have moved on, despite plenty of bugs still existing and many mechanics either underused or flat out unexplained.\n\nSpend your money elsewhere, it's not worth it here.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499798271, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499798271, "recommendationid": "33462457", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506754", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "total_reviews": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
