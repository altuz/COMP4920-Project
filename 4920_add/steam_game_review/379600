Fast paced priority tablet game. Not well ported over. \n\nFairly standard game of this genre, looks better than many others. Control scheme is very inadequate. You never quite know if you are ordering the waiter around, or sending clients to tables or ordering the cook since nothing has a selection reticle. Often the game will just not respond as you click on stuff for that reason as it expects you to be controlling another part of the action. For a fast paced priority game like this its a huge problem. Otherwise it seemed well done, making a profit upgrading a restaurant with more dishes and tables until it is 100% at which point you move on to the next joint.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496625284, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496625340, "recommendationid": "32188832", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496793", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 9}}
