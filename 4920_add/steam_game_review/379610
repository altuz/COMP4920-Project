Each puzzle has a \"pull out\" tray which stores the unplaced pieces but it still allows you to lay pieces onto the puzzle \"board\" without placing them, which is similar to a real jigsaw puzzle.  \n\nThis game allows the player to choose from many included puzzles (several levels of difficulty), plus the workshop has even more high quality, user created puzzles to download for free.  \n\nYou can make your own puzzles from photographs, and choose the shape of the individual pieces for all of the puzzles (traditional jigsaw shape to completely square).    Animated Puzzles has several included puzzles with an interesting animated effect on the pieces, though most workshop puzzles are traditional static photos or drawings.  \n\nThis game allows you to have numerous puzzles that are \"in progress\" so you aren't required to finish one before beginning another.   This is a great feature if you have several people that use your computer to access the game, but want to choose a different puzzle.\n\nAnimated Puzzles offers benefits that a traditional jigsaw puzzle can't :  I don't have to find a place to store a large puzzle in progress, pieces don't get lost, and my cat can't destroy my puzzle.  I was a little unsure  about the concept of an electronic jigsaw puzzle until I tried it.  I have truly enjoyed this game and I am very glad that I purchased it .  If you enjoy jigsaw puzzles then this game is well worth the money.
