There are several goals for each level such as collect all the stars, kill all the enemies, finish before the clock runs out, etc. There is a single checkpoint about half way through each level.\n\nIt is quite fun, and frustrating at times, in a good way. The controls are tight and I have no complaints about the game play.\n\nTwo minor points:\n\n1) When you pick up a heart or a power up (or when the power up fades) the whole game freezes while it makes a sound. This is apparently by design and not a glitch. It only last about a half of a second but it throws my timing off and I sometimes get hit because of it.\n\n2) Occasionally, and randomly, the whole game starts chugging and stuttering for a second or two. It doesn't seem to be related to the number of enemeis on the screen. I don't know what language it's written in, but it is possibly just garbage collection. It only happens once, or rarely twice per level and it doesn't usually cause too much of a problem, but is very noticable when it happens.\n\nI've been playing almost two hours and I'm not quite half way through it. It defintely gets tougher and takes longer as you go, and I've made no special effort to complete any of the goals yet. I'm just getting to the exit asap on this run.\n\nThis is a port of a mobile game, but it's virtually unnoticable. It plays as well as any other PC game of this type.\n\nEdit: And then I get to the mine cart levels about 3.2 hours in to it and quit. I still had $3.39 worth of fun and still recommend it if you don't mind long, trial and error, jumping from cart-to-cart sequences, but after about 25 tries I have moved on.\n\nEdit 2: I got bored and powered through that terrible cart level. Then a few levels later, there was an even worse cart level (much worse.) I nearly threw my gamepad several times, but I was commited at that point and finally made it and finished the game on normal in 5.3 hours. Probably one full hour of that was the two cart levels.\n\nI don't think the cart levels should be there at all since it's otherwise a straight platformer, but it's still a fun game overall.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443837511, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444215591, "recommendationid": "18300039", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505091", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459878690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 1150, "steamid": "76561197993891197", "num_games_owned": 651}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It\u2019s a platformer for platformers\u2019 sake. \n\nIt\u2019s completely generic, almost artistically so, but at the same time I found nothing objectionable whatsoever. That\u2019s kind of impressive. \n\nNo gimmicks, weapons, or special moves\u2026 just you and your double-jump. It reminded me of 90s-era Apogee games like Commander Keen for its art style and simplistic controls.\n\nThe levels are very short, but are collect-a-thons. If you rush through the game on the easiest difficulty, you can beat the whole thing in about an hour. But if you aim for completion, you\u2019ll find dozens and dozens of clever puzzle situations created by devious level design, and they\u2019re quite satisfying to conquer. It can take up to 20 hours to fully complete.\n\nIn order to fully complete a level, you must accomplish 6 objectives: collect all gold stars, collect 3 secret stars, kill every enemy, finish with full health, finish under a time limit, and pop a missable balloon near the exit. Thankfully, the game does not force you to do all of these objectives during the same playthrough; you can do them completely at your own pace.\n\nThe only things locked by completion are the bonus levels. You\u2019ll never have to backtrack to unlock story levels.\n\nNo life limits. If you use checkpoints creatively, you can retry missable objectives indefinitely without playing the whole level over.\n\nNo damage knockback whatsoever! It might feel a little awkward at first, but I found it a breath of fresh air.\n\nI\u2019d give Bloo Kid 2 a 6.8 / 10. It was surprisingly fun to achievement hunt. I couldn't put it down, and I feel like I\u2019m going to miss it once it\u2019s over. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys aiming for 100% completion, whether you\u2019re an achievement hunter or not.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing new or revolutionary here, but at the same time I found almost nothing I would consider shoddy or unfair. It uses its simple elements and stage design to convey a ton of creative tricks, both expected and unexpected.  I feel like this game could serve as someone\u2019s introduction to standard platform game tropes, and I think that\u2019s really cool.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458604234, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1458604283, "recommendationid": "21973419", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513613", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469642032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 71, "steamid": "76561197983230451", "num_games_owned": 248}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great old-school platformer which actually feels more like a throwback to the systems that were more popular in Europe at the time such as the SEGA Master System or Amiga, which is a nice breath of fresh air amongst all the Nintendo-oriented nostalgic games.\n\nAdorable pixel art and some surprisingly good level design and control.
