It is a difficult achievement to unlock and requires at least 70% progression of the single player Campaign. The follow-up achievement \"IDDQD\" (upgrade each one of the 12 runes) builds upon the requirements of this achievement and I have unlocked \"IDDQD\", although \"The Circle is Complete\" still remains locked and glitched. There are many complaints from people with the same issue on the web and it has been around since 2016 across all platforms (PS4, PC etc.). I have seen people who claim they can not achieve 100% game completion rate because of this bug. Apparently it happens if you load into Arcade Mode before your first Campaign save. Until now I have not played Arcade Mode once. According to Bethesda Support to fix this you have to delete your game profile, create a new one and immediately load into single player campaign and create a save. Then you can play through the Campaign again in order to try and unlock your achievement.\n\nIn Multiplayer mode there are quite a lot of negative issues as well. I am just going to name the two most important issues: \nFirst of all there is no team balance. You can end up in something as ridiculous as a 5 vs 2 game, which for one team is impossible to win and no fun at all. If you end up in such an unbalanced game there is no auto balance that will try to correct the issue, nobody will swap to your team or to the other team.\nSecondly there are ranks, but they are not related to who you play with or against. There are a total of 12 ranks with 50 levels per rank. Still you might end up playing with rank 1 level 1 team mates against a full team of rank 12 level 50 opponents.\n\nApart from these issues I have to say in all honesty Doom looks good, the game mechanics feel good and play well. The graphics and game physics are good and the game is well optimised. I like the story behind the single player campaign and what they did with it. Contentwise you receive a lot with your purchase of Doom: There is the single player Campaign, there is an Arcade Mode, there is a Multiplayer mode with different game modes, maps and upgrades (including different kinds of armour, helmets, weapons, in-game taunts etc.) and there is Snap Map where you can create and publish your own map or play and rate many different community created maps. It is also important to mention that there are a lot of secrets, collectables and unlockables in the single player Campaign.\n\nUnfortunately I can not recommend Doom in it's current state.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505171902, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507035228, "recommendationid": "34891878", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504337", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507109834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 309, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 87478, "steamid": "76561198016511187", "num_games_owned": 84}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "18", "review": "Game was decent..... up until 6.66 update.
