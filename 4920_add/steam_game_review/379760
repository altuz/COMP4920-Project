As a Unity Developer myself I'm extra picky about these kinds of games but I was pleasantly impressed by this one. Very smooth, creative, cute minimalistic side-scroller that lets/makes you set up the level before trying to survive it. Gets very challenging later on. It reminds me of VVVVVV with the amount of dying-by-spikes. Decent soundtrack. Excellent physics. Gameplay is thought out and set up so you get to try and experiment with different setups as you play... without having to restart the level... which is refreshing. Has an Angry-Bird-Esque scoring system that's blissfully free of any time limits. Advancement is based on collecting powerups, however these powerups can be hard to see in the first world due to the bright background. Doesn't seem to be an issue though once you progress and the game gets darker. My kids love watching me play.

This game is simplistic in its design, but the gameplay mechanics is not. I'm not saying the gameplay is difficult (finished it in ~90 mins with 100% completion - so anywhere from 1hr-3hrs for this game). Rather, it takes a simple idea of changing the direction, that which your avatar (force) travels in, and flips it as you try to collect the orbs. Yes, a handful of puzzles really stumped me at first. However, a few trial+error runs and you can solve the puzzle easily. The majority of the puzzles are simple enough that by seeing them and what options you have to change the gravity, you will know what to do. One thing that constantly aggravated me during gameplay is how fast force (can move/moves) during the game (hmm the force is strong with this one). However, that's what makes the game a bit harder as you need to control your movements precisely. Plus, the beady little eye on the character is simply amusing to watch as you make it run across the map. \n\nAside from the game, the acheivements didn't proc'ed correctly the first time around so I had to play a few rounds in each chapter to register that yes, I did collect all of the orbs in each chapter. \n\nOverall, very nice puzzle-platforming game.
