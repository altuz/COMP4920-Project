Dont worry about RP and just smash faces in.\n\nAlteil Steam client is currently a work in progress but is working. Just if that sluggish response when i try to open discord while having steam client active at same time be gone will be great. \n\nAnd tidalwave isn't core. :3 Basically Tidalwave abuse got banned unless you're playing noncore :p \n\nThus it gets a 4/5 from me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486275348, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486275348, "recommendationid": "29711256", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495570138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15116, "steamid": "76561198155128650", "num_games_owned": 9}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Played this game for years both in it's original incarnation and Horizons and while it has had it's teething problems it's been a pretty fun game to spend my free time on.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486275411, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486275411, "recommendationid": "29711278", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478352045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 39, "steamid": "76561198013395249", "num_games_owned": 963}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Well.. I played this game a lot when it was still a browser game. It's an amazing concept of card games, with a epic story and a lot of different characters with different skills. This is the good side. The bad side is that it's tough to do a competitive file against the many experienced users here, so you'll probably lose a lot before starting to get the hang of the things. And you mostly need money to buy cards or try really hard to get cards free through lottery and free gram (the money of the game) that you earn here. They are improving the game which options which you can buy cards with the free money you earn every battle, so that's a good improvement.
