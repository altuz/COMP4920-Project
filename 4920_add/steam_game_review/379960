Not sure if you match yourself or opponents and I am not too interested to find out. This suffers from the same lack of polish, lack of fan service and overall value that you can find in the Poker version of the game which I found more intuitive and engaging than this and that game got removed for declutter as well.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505068275, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505112996, "recommendationid": "34868418", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502968", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 42, "total_reviews": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 24}}
