The writing isn't perfect, nor is the art, but the situations and the bizarre setting make up for it, and it *is* aimed at men so you are constantly bombarded by affectionate women and rewarded with showing some skin. Despite this, Panzermadels actually contains some moments that I really didn't expect relative to the depth of the overall game.\n\nThe only disappointing factor in this game (besides that you might be the one playing it) is the ending. The endings occur rather abruptly and they don't really give you much closure. It was rather unsatisfying compared to the whole list of shenanigans that happened throughout the game, and it really put a damper on the experience.\n\nWhile there are certainly more quality dating sims out there, this one is $10 and has a wild pitch.

I like \"Stay Stay\" and I think I understand what the maker was going for, but this is a bad game.  The software is horrid: no way to tweak volumes, no way to skip only content that's already been seen, no way to scroll dialog back, got a few crashes, bad.  Beyond that the dialogs are often non-sensical and disjointed.  There's a lot of political/historical humor which is a weak positive, but it's just painful to go through.  The CG, even uncensored, are mild and tame.  In the end, there's no much there.

The story makes no sense whatsoever, but is full of cool historic/military references and delivers some genuinely funny characters (my personal favourite being the yandere IS-2). It\u2019s definitely targeted towards World War 2 geeks such as myself and really works well in this respect \u2013 also, while short, it offers multiple \u201cromance\u201d options with different tanks/girls and your choice in that matter influences the story quite a lot, creating a lot of replayability. If you wish to explore the game fully, it should give you around 6-7 hours of decent entertainment.\n\nThe art and music are nothing special, but they work and CGs are mostly very nice to look at. [b]What I have to mention though is lack of proper options menu, no autoplay and generally very clunky interface[/b]. I would probably play it more if it had the typical \u201cskip read only\u201d option and didn\u2019t continue skipping after choices, with no easy option to rewind the text. There\u2019s also some glitches, that often can even persist through restarting or loading the game (I had all backgrounds missing on one playthrough, with just black screen behind the text and character sprites). It\u2019s easy to see that it was made as a first attempt by an inexperienced team and Devgru-p\u2019s second title, \u201cStay! Stay! DPRK\u201d is much, much better in this respect.\n\n[b]Considering the technical issues, I only recommend buying this game while on sale \u2013 it\u2019s definitely worth your time if you care about the theme, but the production qualities simply doesn\u2019t justify the 10 dollar pricetag.[/b] The core content nevertheless is very enjoyable and it\u2019s obvious that developers made it with a lot of humour and most likely had genuine fun in the process.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506268808, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506280274, "recommendationid": "35184533", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502059573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 73, "steamid": "76561198254511117", "num_games_owned": 6}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I require a priest, I need moar hentai.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504621686, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504621686, "recommendationid": "34757572", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504446", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504951403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 255, "steamid": "76561198013127756", "num_games_owned": 257}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a masterpiece.
