You jump between third person sections in which tapping either the A or D key will send the camera ballistic, circling you like a desert buzzard, and an isometric top down view which is a little better except when you're in combat. Which is mostly. I get that some games are better with a pad but that shouldn't be a free license to just make the game unplayable in WASD. That's like if I bought a cereal that suggested it was 'Better with full fat milk' but then I ate it with semi-skimmed because it was all I had and it gave me syphilis.\nI can take a challenge. I thrive on them but in a game where walking in the dark (which you have NO choice but to do at several points) drains your already meagre life bar before you even reach the first enemies (six in a room, about five hits to kill at close range, will beat the freckles off of you whether you dodge or not), the challenge doesn't come from competent design. It comes from the saint-like patience you require not to throw your keyboard through the screen.\nI've tried to demonstrate it as best as I can below.

I was very hooked on what was going on and why things were happening the way they were, but there no progression to the story. The little girl (whose name I still don't know) walks around fighting off barrel monsters, flying books, and suitcase things, but this portion of the game did not tell me what the heck was happening!\nAlso, the game was SO SHORT... If I evaded all monsters and progressed through the story, it honestly could be finished in half an hour, if not less. Worth $10?!\nRating: 6/10\n\nAugust 6 update: The little girl's name can now be found by interacting with a few of the kids in the beginning.\n\nGameplay/controls: DIFFICULT. The developer is adding an update tomorrow (July 31) on an improvement for controls, but both keyboard and joystick (I used a ps3 controller) modes were not the greatest. I'd say keyboard mode would be easier overall, since you can only use one analog stick to move AND look around. However, you can't LOOK around when you're using the keyboard mode (at least, I didn't find a way to). There were a few objects in-game that you could simply walk right through, so there's a few bugs there as well.\n---Fighting monsters: There is not enough area of effect for your attacks! You have to get RIGHT in the monster's face to deal damage, while their AOE is noticeably larger. The flying books were also a huge nuisance. Maybe it was my style of attacking, but I got hit at least once every time I attempted to knock down those monsters. \nRating: 3/10\n\nGraphics: I LOVED THE ANIMATIONS, especially the cutscenes, it was beautiful! The gameplay graphics were okay, but there's nothing I would call out and say \"that sucked\". This is probably the best feature of this game.\nRating: 8/10\n\nOverall: Needs quite a bit of work. I'm aware the game will continue later on (PLEASE DO NOT CHARGE MONEY FOR THE NEXT PART...), but I think the gameplay needs severe work and the story needs to develop more. Why is this happening, who am I controlling, WHERE AM I GOING?! \nI would say try it out for yourself if you don't think this review is helpful, but I don't think it's worth $10 for a game that could realistically be finished in half an hour or less.\n\nThis is about 5.7/10 for me.\n\nA two-part gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD3gv7-1w7ESKc_oQZ8x0QG5Mf4VT7qvG", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1438890971, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438287431, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440361474, "recommendationid": "17304352", "developer_response": "Hey there,\n\nThank you for your feedback. \n\nWe just fixed and improved most of your complains about Hush. \n\nPlease play it again, on this new version 1.0.4.\n\nHave fun playing.\n\nGS78", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545084", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439871366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 77, "steamid": "76561198168559360", "num_games_owned": 19}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The combat is pretty horrible because it takes so long to attack, especially in a combo, and that's coupled with the fact that there are so many monsters you have to fight regarless of whether you can have the willpower to try and make it to a save point because they reset after you heal/save.  There are also a few bugs that are pretty serious to the gameplay like losing the ability to dodge roll and running around in the darkness as you would normally in the light (you are supposed to be slowed in the dark), leaving the game via alt + tab glitches the game to the point where you have to exit it to be able to play it again, and if you happen to accidently talk to someone while running away from a monster it kills you because you have to finish the dialouge before you can even move again.

I'm impressed and hope to see more games from this studio now. \nI'm changing my review to a positive because i think these improvements (patch 1.04) will really work but if i may add something...(i know, i know \"chato to caracas!\" but i was a tester before ;))\n\nObservations:\n1.i think the tweaks you did on the roll option are stopping me from rolling randomly (when i press space and directional key) even though its much more controlled now so well done...i recommend checking if you can roll whenever you want (im playing keyboard so..that might be why).\n2.it happened to me a few times that even though i still had a \"full life\" (2 hits) i got hit once and died right away (when i die i see the girl shaking in a buggy way by the way, might want to look into the animation there).\nIn Any case here are the POSITIVES:\n the new camera at the intro works brilliantly and the \"chase scene\" is even more clear now with the camera view from above and much more intuitive as to what needs to be done to delay the chaser.! also i saw you stopped the \"auto walking\" thing so BRAVO! \nAlso love that you increased the lives available as it makes it a lot less frustrating :) (i'm a casual gamer, i get it, i just dont have the time to be hardcore gamer anymore...)\n\nMY ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW (this was with patch1.03 and now most are FIXED with 1.04)\n\n\nBought it cause im all for supporting Portuguese gaming efforts, but really this needs improvement still. I liked it but here are my comments for those playing with a keyboard:\n[FIXED]-camera rotates too fast and does not \"dodge\" obstacles (example when crossing a door it goes through the wall frame rather than avoiding it by leaning down and remaining behind the character\n[FIXED-or at least greatly improved]-difficulty level is \"high\"? for a beginner at least i got easily killed [FIXED, as far as i can see] maybe cause the \"roll\" option keeps jamming you against objects so i couldnt really avoid those barrels by rolling).\n[didnt' have to repeat cinematics yet, so didn't see this key]-is there a key to skip cinematics? i just started playing and had to watch the big fat kid by the window turned zombie 4 times cause i couldn't skip it.\n[FIXED]-character keeps moving even if you're not pressing any keys (suggestion: fix the animation on the character).\n[FIXED without needing to touch the object animations- as with the new camera this now looks way greater and more intuitive! WELL DONE]-floating objects in the initial running scene first appeared to me as a bug, until i realised thats how they were supposed to be - floating (small suggestion, make them move slightly up and down, left and right or rotating in the air to give the illusion that they are really floating).\n\nGood to see Portugal showing up on the game map once again.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1438890822, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438636112, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438894315, "recommendationid": "17373204", "developer_response": "Hey there,\n\nThank you for your feedback. \n\nWe just fixed and improved most of your complains about Hush. \n\nPlease play it again.\n\nHave fun playing.\n\nGS78\n", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512979", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450767379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 253, "steamid": "76561198200388890", "num_games_owned": 37}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Controls are bad and gameplay isn't good.
