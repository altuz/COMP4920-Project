Episode 1, formerly known as Half-life: Aftermath, was the beginning of the new episodic style valve was realeasing new installments. This would give fans what they wanted without having them wait years and years for another game but with some understandable sacrifices. The game was a hit for fans of the previous installments and brought some new tech advancements into the game such as better lighting. The plot takes place right after the end of Half-life 2 and doesn't waste any time getting back into the meat of it.\n\nPROS:\n-The story is very well paced and put together very nicely as all the others. You play as Gordon Freeman again during the aftermath of the citadels destruction. Not spoiling the rest in case you haven't picked up a copy in the many years its existed.\n-The environment is very immersive as it is a long seamless road to the end of the game with, as the definition of seamless implies, zero cutscenes or immersion breaking interruptions.\n-The gunplay involves the same chaotic weapons from half-life 2. The arsenal available is pleasently loud, very powerful feeling, and quite fun to use when eliminating the enemy as per tradition.\n-Dialogue breaks are few, far between, and about a minute each if you even count them as such.\n-Same engine as hal-life 2 to no surprise but with very few legitimate puzzles to get your thinker going.\n-As with half-life 2, the ending is satasfying and closes things out with a nice bow ribbon.\n\nCONS: (Not even half-life is safe from sin, sorry) Please note that i am extremely aware that this game is sorta old.\n-Controls feel less floaty than half-life 1 but there's still some slip n sliding.\n-The combine is a painfully easy enemy throughout the entire game and even when their ranks change.\n-Various visual bugs and other graphical anomalies give the game a kind of rushed feeling.\n-The games puzzles and other logic based conundrums are bonehead easy and will just seem like annoyances on successive playthroughs.\n-Not much of a con but i found it quite odd that gordon gets his crowbar more towards the end dispite being his iconic weapon of choice.\n\nThis game is about as much of a must have as half-life 2. I picked the entire series up in a frantic buy in a summer sale and it was worth it. To me the episodes wern't very replayable, they arn't very exciting to play again and not very memorable. The games main critisim is it's length which is somthing that i fully agree with. I wasn't aware of half-life 2 at the time so i wasn't one of the masses waiting anxiously for this to drop but i think the length was perfect. I feel as if it went any longer it would have outstayed its welcome and become a bore. I certainly would'nt skip the game for fans just coming in but if anything it's textures for gmod if you don't have much interest in it.\n\n8 more crowbars out of 10\n\nNext up is Half-life 2: Episode 2."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506790757, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35346374", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198127318229", "num_reviews": 53, "last_played": 1502274468, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 202}, "timestamp_updated": 1506790775, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Half Life Two, Episde One.

The first hour is by and large a retread of the extremely memorable and cathartic superpowered Gravity Gun section from HL2, and while that game ended just when that section started getting old, Episode One makes the baffling decision to heap more of that stuff on, and despite some cool stuff with energy balls, it can't possibly have the same impact. \n\nThe other big disappointment with Episode One is how scripted it is. Episode One feels more like something from the COD 4 era of shooters than HL2's wonderful blend of old and new. The story content is ramped up significantly, there's way more scenes of just standing around talking or looking at things, your AI companion is constantly opening doors for you...it gave me unpleasant flashbacks to playing mediocre FPS' on the Xbox 360. \n\nUnlike it's immediate predecesssor and sucessor, Episode One really adds nothing new to the Half-Life formula to mix up the gameplay. Most of what's found here are gimmicks and one-off set-pieces. The exception is Alyx, which, proving that Valve in the 2000s was light-years ahead of their contemporaries, is one of the best NPC companions in a game ever, being capable and useful without being too useful and without resorting to cheating to make sure she isn't frustrating (looking at you, Bioshock Infinite and The Last of Us). But even then, Alyx doesn't add much to what the player is doing. You're still doing the same old Half Life 2 song and dance without much new, and since that game felt like it got everything it could out of it's mechanics (except for maybe the Gravity Gun), it all adds up to an experience that never electrifies in the same way it's predecessor did. \n\nThankfully, most of these problems are exacerbated in the first half, in the Citadel and the underground. Once you get back into the streets of City 17, the game is much more engaging to play, the set-pieces become more interactive, and it ends in a fantastic sequence where you escort civillians through an environment that changes every time you run through it in subtle but significant ways, topped off with a spectacularly tense boss fight that really gets the blood pumping.\n\nI don't want to rag on it too much, because Episode One is still a very good game. It just doesn't feel worthy of Valve at times, y'know?"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505086295, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500799", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34873226", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198064952052", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1505066178, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 206}, "timestamp_updated": 1505086295, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The best , episode 1"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506498270, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500799", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35237410", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197994287096", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506498247, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_forever": 279}, "timestamp_updated": 1506498270, "received_for_free": false, "review": "great game"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506841087, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500799", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35367200", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198037079805", "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1506840986, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 170, "playtime_forever": 225}, "timestamp_updated": 1506841087, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Pretty short but quite good.
