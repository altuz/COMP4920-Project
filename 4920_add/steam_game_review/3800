Now, it's testing my patience as I try and force myself to keep playing it to the end. \n\nIf you did not play this game when it first came out, Advent Rising has very little going for it. If you were fond of it like I was when it first came out, things might be a lot different than you remember. \n\nIf you ask a fan of Advent Rising (and if you're still out there, DM me because I've never met you), two names will often be brought up: Tommy Tallarico and Orson Scott Card. \n\nAdvent Rising not being the hit that it wanted to be is a shame because it meant that not too many people are aware of Tommy Tallarico's excellent work as the game's music composer. Seriously, go look up the tracks Muse, Bounty Hunter, and Poeta. Some of the most stand out and inspired video game music of that decade if not of all time and it will never get the recognition it deserves because Advent Rising flopped. \n\nYes, Orson Scott Card is attached to this thing as he apparently had a major hand in writing the script. Regardless of how you feel about the accomplished science fiction author (particularly his controversial stances on homosexuality), the story being told here isn't too bad for a video game released in the mid-2000s. But that's just the problem, isn't it? It's not bad. They've got Orson Scott Card, the writer of Ender's Game. My guess is there's lot of story that was cut somewhere due to time restraints as the opening feels incomplete, cut, particularly little time is given to characters and when the game forces you to make a decision that revolves around the game's characters, I doubt apathy is what they want gamers to feel the most. \n\nThe story wasn't the only thing chopped (presumably, I do not know for sure) because of a rushed schedule; this game is glitched and bugged up the ass. Within the early sections of the game, I found myself stuck in the geometry, doors not opening, and of course, multiple game crashes. There is a fan patch restoring cut content exclusive to the Xbox, not fixing some of the issues you will experience during gameplay. \n\nAside from that, gameplay isn't terribly interesting...at first. One of the most fatal missteps in Advent Rising is its beginning. The difficulty is out of control. I can assure you I am far from the worst gamer in the world and these early sections are inane shooting galleries often complemented with \"defend this area until elevator/door arrives/opens\" with wave after wave of enemy bullet sponges coming in. \n\nOnce you get past what could be considered Act One, things start to grab your attention as you delve deep into the game's mythology. This is where Advent Rising starts to take a sharp shift away from Halo clone to its own identity. \n\nDespite the multitude of issues that would kill any sort of hope for any recommendation, I can't quite say stay away from Advent Rising despite its technical issues, game-killing as they might be. \n\nAdvent Rising isn't quite the flawed masterpiece like say, Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines. Think of it a few notches above Alpha Protocol. If none of these games ring any bells, let me put it this way: \n\nIt's very clear that the people who made Advent Rising were passionate and put a lot of their heart and soul into it. I read that the game's director Donald Mustard had the idea since he was in high school and his favorite book was Ender's Game. Whatever cult status Advent Rising has achieved to this day is most likley stemming from how genuine and heartfelt the whole production is. \n\nSomewhere in this buggy mess is a classic science fiction story trying to happen but it needed at least six months, a year. Also an increase in the budget to tell more story. \n\nI ultimately do recommend this game but with caution and a heart as open as your mind will allow."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500985774, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33785620", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198063941528", "num_reviews": 26, "last_played": 1500485854, "num_games_owned": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 606}, "timestamp_updated": 1500985774, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you liked Halo, you might enjoy this.
