The story mode alone contains approximately one hundred puzzles, so if you are a fan of the genre it is hard to argue against the value here.  Unfortunately, like many casual games, Majong Quest does not support the Steam Overlay or widescreen resolutions, but fullscreen is avaliable.  My only other minor gripe about the title is the tile design itself is a little bland and the mouse curso is overly large and a little unweildy on the playfield.  Those minor blemishes aside though, Majong Quest is a quality game and worth it's discount price."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1424942664, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "14659206", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198116857655", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1469600193, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 659}, "timestamp_updated": 1424942664, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you like mah jong you will enjoy this.
