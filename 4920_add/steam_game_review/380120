First off I do want to say this game is HARD, which I appreciate but a lot of stuff in this game is fairly... hard to solve on your own.  There were several puzzles I had to ask the developer for help upon, which after much finagling I manage to get answers to.\n\nThe bad thing is that all of the game's achievements are tied to the endgame, and one of them the 'bad' ending is fairly difficult to obtain since to obtain it you must get as few ending points as possible, which is hard to do.  Plus a lot of bosses have different powers on their abilities based on WHAT MOVES YOU LEARN.  This is something never explained which at one point required me to redo a fairly large chunk of the game.  And you must complete the game a bear minimum of 3 times in order to complete it, I had to do it 4.  \n\nI want to recommend it, but it was made just a little too frustrating.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503006805, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503006805, "recommendationid": "34315945", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
