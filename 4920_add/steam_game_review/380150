You walk through a ship populated by monsters while being helped by a mysterious person via radio? Never heard that one before. \n\n[*]Gameplay: Clunky and inconsistent. \n\n[*]Puzzles: Almost absent, pixel hunting required. \n\n[*]Achievements: Two thirds of the achievements are for the various ways you can die in this game. Tells you all you need to know.\n\n[*]Graphics: Blurry. Makes the pixel hunting so much more enjoyable.\n[/list]\n\nI have no idea why this game gets so many good reviews, this is a walking simulator with cheap shock effects and frustrating gameplay. Don't buy.\n\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nYou are awaken from stasis on a spaceship without any recollection how you got there. It soon becomes obvious that the ship is not in working order. After not too long you are contacted by a mysterious woman via radio who offers to help you. While you make your way through the ship you uncover what went down there. Turns out, the immoral experiments of an evil corporation went horribly wrong. \n\nAll of this is pretty much apparent right from the start. You fill in more details as you progress but there are no surprises. The only redeeming aspect are the PDAs you find which give you insights into the lifes of some of the people whose bodyparts you see laying around everywhere.\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay and puzzles[/h1]\n\nThe game is in isometric perspective. Your character runs to where you point your mouse and you enter new rooms by clicking on exits. You get descriptions of items by hovering over them (as text at the bottom of the screen; your cursor changes into an eye symbol) and if there is anything you can interact with, the cursor changes into a hand. So far, so good.\n\nDid I say the cursor changes into a hand if you can interact with it? Yes, most of the time, but not always. Sometimes you have to randomly combine stuff from your inventory with eye symbols to make something happen. Sometimes you even have to click stuff twice (in one case thrice) to get an effect. This all is made worse by the fact that the hotspot areas are sometimes really small, so you have to pixel hunt. There is no way to actually [i]see[/i] what you are supposed to click because everything is so damn small in this perspective.\n\nAll of this makes the puzzles in this game incredibly frustrating because even though they are mostly logical in hindsight, you often don't get any indication what you are supposed to do and you end up randomly clicking stuff. So, it is probably a good thing that there aren't that many puzzles.\n\nThere are also a few instances where you enter a room and have to react quickly in the correct way or you die. If you have to make me die over and over again while I figure out what to do at least don't make me watch the same lengthy starting animation each time, thank you very much.\n\n\n[h1]Achievements Or The Suicide Game[/h1]\n\nI'm not an achievement hunter and I'm usually not all that interested what the achievements are. But in this game, the achievements give you a good indication what this game really is about. \n\nOf 27 achievements, roughly one third is story related. The rest are for different ways in which you can die in this game. You can even commit suicide in various gruesome ways, shown to you by a kill cam. \nYes, that's right. You can, for example, watch yourself drill a hole in your head or gut yourself with a glass shard.\n\nThe developers apparently expect you to make a game out of trying to kill your character in as many ways as possible. YMMV, but that's not my kind of fun and it doesn't make up for the lack of real puzzles.\n\n\n[h1]Graphics and sound[/h1]\n\nThere are no graphic options beyond two settings for screen resolution, that's it. On highest resolution on a 19'' screen, everything was slightly blurry. If you could zoom in to specific areas, or if there were at least a hotspot viewer this wouldn't be too bad but as it is the need to pixel hunt is probably my main gripe with this game.\n\nRegarding the overall look, I liked the design of the ship and the different areas. Unfortunately, the developers followed the mantra that there can never be enough blood and guts. Basically every surface in this game is coated in some kind of human-derived organic matter. It is a bit ridiculous.\n\nThere's not much voice acting but what's there is decent. There are a lot of ambient noises and screaming that create an atmosphere of looming danger, at least at first. As with the blood, the developers overdid it. If you constantly hear screaming at some point it stops being frightening and becomes background. [spoiler]You also never meet anyone who could do all that screaming, it is just a cheap trick to create a scary atmosphere.[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAs much fun as drilling a hole in your head.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501231476, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501413266, "recommendationid": "33851128", "language": "english", "votes_down": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521663", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501226447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 534, "steamid": "76561198090900858", "num_games_owned": 84}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Have you ever wanted to play a psychological horror game, but was too much of a damned pussy to *actually* play the game?

Then, this is the game for you!\n\nI know when I'm playing games like Dead Space, Outlast, or The Evil Within, I'm too amped up on adrenaline to fully take in the atmosphere and enjoy the game.\n\nFirst, the cons:\n- Voice acting was meh. The protag's voice was the only one that sounded even remotely non-robotic and realistic.\n- Glitches clearly have not been completely ironed out.\n- There are a few puzzles that don't follow any logical sense. I was hard-pressed to peruse a walkthrough to figure out at least two of the puzzles.\n- For many people, point-and-click games don't constitute as bona fide video games... so there's that. Unless this is your cup of tea, you're most likely going to be bored with the fact you can't really kill monsters.\n\nThe pros!\n- Lots of dead bodies and haunting commentary on dead bodies.\n- But seriously, there are dead bodies EVERYWHERE. It's AWESOME. It's like a veritable Edgar Allen Poe novel all up in here.\n- Descriptive, polished prose.\n- Few jump scares, LOTS of creepy atmosphere that is reminiscent of the classic Silent Hill games\n- Horror game through and through. Plenty of fridge logic at play.\n- Exploration was actually fun. \n\nThumbs up, overall the game is an 8/10.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501868850, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501868850, "recommendationid": "34020698", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516183", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499620954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 309, "steamid": "76561197990066758", "num_games_owned": 488}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "With tha glowing reviews this game's been getting I expected more... so, so much more.\n\nInstead what I got is a mish-mash of horror tropes.

The puzzles are also mediocre, and while I've certainly seen games with crazier solutions, this doesn't make some of the solutions in this game any less crazy.\n\nBut really, the puzzles and the visuals I could forgive if the story had been any good. But it's just... bland, boring and predictable. In the end I was playing not because I wanted to find out what's going to happen to the characters (because I really didn't care for any of them) - rather I was interested if devs were going to do some interesting last-strech \"OMG\" moment with the monsters and gore. They didn't, so a bust on that front as well.

One of the few games I refunded. \nI was looking forward to this project for years. Such a shame.\nThere's ONE good thing - atmosphere - mainly thanks to visual. And even that is true only partially. Animations are laughable, everything is covered in strange blur so you see no details. And one more thing - when you don't have money for cutscenes, just don't do them.\n\nIt's a classic adventure game which means it needs to have well-designed logical puzzles and good story. Neither is true here. This game is ridden with moon logic puzzles. It's not all of them and yes, there are worse cases in gaming history, yet still. I had no idea that a piece of wet rag picked form a toilet could jam a massive machine driven door. If were to use my body to jam that door they would turn me into a red paste, yet a rag is enough? A rag? The most fragile thing I have in my inventory? Oh, ffs!\nIt's  a very frequent occasion that you get absolutely no hint as to what you are meant to achieve or what you CAN achieve. Flavour texts are mixed with poor hints so well you have no idea what piece of information is useful to you. An extended robotic arm holds a driller. When you touch it it retracts. Nobody says \"I could use that driller\" and/or \"Can't unmount it in this position\" when the arm is retracted. Nothing reads \"The driller might be useful\". Nobody shouts \"Hey, I could use that driller for faking a leakage in the other room where I didn't have go and where I've read about the changes to the security system.\" Any of these would suggest I can do something with this robotic arm. But it doesn't tell you. \"Medical robot arm that hold a drill\" is not enough when there are dozens of other non-interactive objects in the scene with similar descriptions.\nWhen trying everything on everything in every possible state is a faster solution to some your puzzles than fucking intuition and reading, you've done fucked it up.\n\nOk. I admit, I don't like adventure games. I often get stuck and have to resort to reading walkthroughs. I can bear this as long as there's any promise of a good story. And what a major letdown the story in STASIS is. It starts off ok-ish as you know nothing, everything is a mystery and the atmosphere created by visuals and sound do all the heavy lifting, and successfully so. But it quickly unravels and it's just a clich\u00e9-driven story with no unpredictable twist whatsoever. \nIt's a horror so... flickering lights, distant shouts and creaky noises all for no reason? Check.\nSaving wife and daughter? Check.\nAmnesia? Check.\nEvil corporation? Check. \nGrotesquely stupid levels of negligence? Check. \nMoustache twirling mad scientist villain? Check.\nRadio companion betraying you at the end? Check.\nImmoral human experimentation gone wrong? Check.\nAt least some logs contain stories that are more nuanced. \nDon't get me wrong. I'm not saying any piece of art should contain no clich\u00e9 or trope whatsoever. No. I know it's hard and often counterproductive trying to be 100% new and original. But combination of all of the above? That's unbearable.\n\nMusic is minimalist and barely noticable. Sound is all over the place when it comes to voiceovers but otherswise it works quite well.
