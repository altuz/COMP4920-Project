As someone below said, being listed as \"early-access\" would possibly make the game more attractive for customers who are on-the-fence because it would show that no, this game is not finished (it really isn't), but work is still being done and it will continue to improve.\n\nI saw this game at ECGC back in April 2015, and I can tell it has come a long way. What kept me from turning off this game to play Audiosurf is:\n\n1) The Playlist. I like not having to exit-out to continually pick songs.\n\n2) The fighting/danger. These features add to the challenge of keeping your score up, and make you feel like a badass while your favorite song is blasting.\n\n3) Space. I'm biased here. But really, the star-studded background mixed with the changing neon colors gives everything a cyberpunk feel. Again, I'm biased, as this is my favorite genre and I can rarely find it in games, but it's still asthetically pleasing and adds to the idea that music is freeing. Like space (as long as you wear a space-suit...).\n\n4) Controller-friendly.\n\n5) The penalty for dying is NOT your song abruptly ending; this is great. Instead you lose points, so you still don't want to die, but the /music never stops/.\n\nNow, the pointers that caused me to agree with the user below that this game needs work is:\n\n!) Glitches, glitches, glitches. My ship going off-screen. This could be a huge problem for competitive gamers\n\n2) The controls, keyboard or otherwise, on the Song Select menu and Pause just. Not. Working. ARGH this was definitely the most frustrating feature. \n\n3) The music skipping or playing over again for a few seconds before going to the next song. Although that isn't that big of a deal for me.\n\nThe positives might outweigh the negatives, but that doesn't mean the game is complete, or worth thirteen dollars. Six-to-eight dollars seems to be more of the norm with Arcade games (unless you're Hyper Light Drifter...). Either way, I believe Solanimus has something great here if they continue to build upon it. That being said, I look forward to the next update, or what is next in store from this company.\n\nAndie", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462126094, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1462127413, "recommendationid": "22747815", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502664", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1461864019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 157, "steamid": "76561197992803661", "num_games_owned": 141}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A game based on my own music and my music library, sign me up!\n\nI'm a huge rhythm game fan and when I heard about Signal to Noise and how I could use my own music library I was immediately interested. The gameplay is easy to pick up and play and is very addicting. Though the game is not without its faults, there have been random crashes here and there and have had some controller issues. I know Solanimus will continue to support the game and improve on many of its features. The tech behind the game is very impressive and I\u2019m excited to see it expand within Signal to Noise.

Overlay works, my frames arent being sucked dry, and even the included music is still good! the inclusion of a tutorial at the start caught me off guard for a moment, but it did help a lot more than just giving you a control scheme to look at before dropping you in. If you enjoy rhythm games in the vein of audiosurf, I say keep a close eye on this title. There's even a fun little \"live\" feature that you can make noise into your microphone to generate a track and accidentally cause a million spikes to pop up because you laughed too loud.
