Some half-assed dialogue which may or may not have been poorly translated?  Stock assets from Unity?  Seriously?  Why would you even pay for microtransactions in a game like this?!?  I mean, yeah some people really don't like clicker games because of what they are, but this?  You'd have to have fluff in between your ears to take this game seriously.  \n\nI hope this was merely someone's pet project and not their life's work...\n\nReally, the only reason to keep playing this is for the achievements.  And hey, if you really need achievements, go play something like Lyne.  At least you'll get letters of the alphabet to use on your profile.  \n\nAvoid this game like the plague.\nOh, and thanks to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/380360/discussions/0/535150948605470715/] this thread [/url] for pointing out the Unity assets.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487310033, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487310033, "recommendationid": "29977608", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510291", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488261349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2111, "steamid": "76561197984051565", "num_games_owned": 330}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I am mostly speaking from the \"technical\" side of this game.  The FTP Clickers, I have tried seem lackluster or uninspired, but this game has a great on-the-fly tutorial.  This tutorial system is done right: not too intrusive and straight to the point.  It gives a bit of story line as well.\n\nWhere the game really gets me, is in the actual coding.  I use a Razer: Orbweaver & Ornata Chroma: i.e. Razer Synapse Software.  With both devices, I have so many KEY combinations and MACROS, it blows my mind.  As anyone that would play this game does, I created a LMB macro, that I set to a key on my keyboard, to Left Mouse Button Click every 0.050 seconds.\n\nThe other 3 Clicker games I have played, recently, have shown me that this is not a good idea, when the games is poorly programmed/optimized.\n\nThe good news is that this game and Adventure Capitalist (AdCap) are spot on!  The other two are feet to miles apart - programmaticly! - but, still good games (High Profits - Not Bad, but issues at higher click rates: and Clicker Heroes - Just BAD!).\n\nThis game has good graphics, for a FTP, and the story and levels are thought out well.  Using my Synapse Software to click through, is consistent and does not make the game laggy, nor process intense.\n\nOverall,  9.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486183639, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486183703, "recommendationid": "29684596", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498553", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491583343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4951, "steamid": "76561198156231391", "num_games_owned": 200}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Half an hour in and I can already tell this is quality.
