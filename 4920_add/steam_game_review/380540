Every now and then, you'll get jumped by a few ships from a rival faction - just to keep you on your toes. Weapons include direct fire, missiles, and turrets, The current best strategy seems to be to load up on shields and just make a Borg cube, but I suspect gameplay will grow in that respect.\n\nTreat it like an early access game without the tag, and... well.

Let me go over some quick bullet points before I go throwing around my 2 cents.\n\nThings that are objectively good:\n\n-Absolutely GREAT Dev. Amazing guy and actually CARES about how his game's finished product will be.\n-Frequent fixes, patches, and support all around.\n-Gameplay is simple enough to get and so are the controls.\n-Fairly cheap for what it is and how well it actually runs.\n-Block based physics building WITH collision damage being a thing for once in these kind of games.\n\n\nNow, Some things that are objectively terrible.\n\n-Music. All of it but the main menu.\n-AI (Which is being fixed in the update after this review, But I'm going to add it because I don't really know how much the AI will be repaired.)\n-Building mechanics are VERY precise. Extremely so if working to replace one block in the middle of your ship.\n-Some of the art is... I hate to admit, But it's terrible. (Something I hope to be fixed soon, Granted nobody falls down the stairs again.)\n-Lacking of PASSIVE inertial dampening causes me to sometimes slam into shit and makes me want to die a little inside.\n-NO REAL CLEAR DESCRIPTION OF ANY BLOCKS EVER. Most are straight forward, But some are just 'WHAT DOES IT DO?!'\n-Drones being complete crap in battle. Really only good for repairs.\n\n\nOk, Now that those are out of the way... Let me actually go through why I would in fact recommend this game with the stuff I said is bad.\n\nThe game itself for a lacking of a better word is rather basic, And simple too play. It's got the potential to be a master-piece among the titles of 'King Arthur's gold' or 'Terraria' given time and more development. It has great replay-ability if you're into building and simple physics-y games. The mechanics of the game aren't fully flushed out yet in terms of resourcing from the feels of things, But this is something fixed over time rather then all at once. Even 'Space Engineers' took well into months of Dev with a whole team of people working on it to tweak it to be any fucking good at all. \n\nIt's actually very fun for being very simple. It feels fun all around for the most part and with new content being added each update and the updates and fixes being quite small and frequent, I usually look forward to seeing the game after each update.\n\nOne of the points that I feel though is that story mode is a little lacking and lack luster, But the open sandbox play is still quite fun.\n\nNow, The draw backs that the game has CURRENTLY that I feel will be more influential and flushed out later are the factions. The factions to me seem reeeeeally pointless... But I think it's not a lacking of effort, and more about needing to have more time to really implement them.\n\nLet me just mention the Dev though... He is actually REALLY nice and can really take, and often does, a lot of criticism. Really what some people need to understand is that he is only ONE GUY who does pretty much everything from what I hear, And almost never gets any outside help past some occasional forum suggestions for things he already actually has planned. Who else can say that they alone made a game that has even HALF the good things I've mentioned above?\n\nAnd with all this being said, It all really boils down to, Yes the game is fun, runs great, is done by one very fantastic guy with an idea, and has just god awful music with an amazing, Passionate Dev whose not going to abandon his project just because some child doesn't understand the game creation possess.\n\nOverall, I'd say the game deserves a chance and is actually VERY MUCH WORTH the cheap price $5.\n\n7/10, Recommended to people who like and enjoy the simple things in games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457049634, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457049634, "recommendationid": "21611738", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525202", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499990596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 170, "steamid": "76561197967375537", "num_games_owned": 925}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 37, "comment_count": "6", "review": "This game suffers from far too many faults.\n\nThe description given in the infographic under \"About this game\" is generous to a fault.\n\nHere's a list of places the game falls short:\n\n\nThe music is corny, the sound effects are horrible\n\nThe controls are often confusing, leading you to constantly hit F1 to review them, which shows a help page which is also confusing.\n\nThe flow of the game is poorly described. It took me a bit to figure out that the probe you are gathering with at the start isn't the ship you will eventually design and iterate on.\n\nThe faction system makes no sense. The universe seems way too large to bother exploring and each system seems to be owned by a faction. You gain and lose faction points extremely fast with different factions for doing different things. There seems to be no benefit to the different factions? I'm not really sure what the whole point of the system was, it was poorly balanced and seemed irrelevant in the end.\n\nThe 'storyline' was just a very short series of quests where I basically just ran around shooting things. Never felt threatened by the enemy, there was no sense of progression here, and nothing interesting.\n\nCombat is too easy, just circle strafe, throw drones at them and they'll never hit you. Once you get enough drones you can kill anything pretty much instantly. Even before you get drones just circle strafe and shoot. Hell, if you don't want to circle strafe, just strap ~10 extra power and shield modules to your ship and you will be unkillable in that way.\n\nShip design is also poorly balanced and poorly explained. There's a life support/power system that I think was supposed to constrain big ship design, but really doesn't serve a purpose because you just throw on enough parts that everything is green and you're good to go. Many of the parts have parameters that are not explained, and the numbers seem to make no sense. Often there's one 'best part' which outshines other parts in every category, so you just strap a ton of those on your ship. Would have been better if you had to balance things out instead of just throwing a bunch of parts together.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but the design is terrible on almost every level.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1440410648, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440409335, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440409335, "recommendationid": "17690818", "developer_response": "To respond to a few of your concerns. \nThe faction system dictates your starting ability that you get throughout the game.

Also a zoom feature for all parts of the game (especially the build menu :) ) is being added. We also have recently acquired an artist to re-draw the character portraits and add more in game ones.\n\nIf you could clarify what you mean by Rendering Issues and what was misleading in the description that would help us a lot and we can get it fixed right away!\n\nI'm sad to hear that you are getting a refund as we would love for you to see the game evolve in the future, but it is of course within your right.
