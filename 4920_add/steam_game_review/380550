It does not have a lot of depth, but what it does it does alright.\n\nPros:\n- Good music\n- Starts out very easy.  This is important because you are not automatically dead while you work out how to play.  I am terrible at this game, and yet the easy early waves still had me progressing farther than I had any right to.\n- various weapon powerups are fun\n- Has a reasonable level of polish\n- Overall I liked the sound effects, with the exception of the constant sound of the gun firing.\n\nCons:\n- The biggest issue for me was too many colors that were used multiple times making it hard for threats to stand out.  Every enemy I destroyed turned into lots of colored sparks.  Colored sparks that blended right in with the loads of enemy shot sparks and my own bullet sparks.  In the end half the time progressing seemed to be just a matter of always moving and pure luck.\n- I played on a mouse and keyboard setup, and the controls were serviceable but not great.  I suspect this game needs a controller to be the most fun.\n- Seemed to be little to no reason not to constantly fire.  Should have had an auto-fire toggle somewhere.\n- Beating bosses didn't get you any special reward.  I felt like killing the bosses should have gotten you a powerup or extra life or something.  As it was they were just a slightly larger enemy with a lot of life.\n- The scrolling does not work in the player's favor.  The whole game is just played in a box.  But the box doesn't fill the screen.  You need to get pretty close to the edge of the screen before the view scrolls in that direction, giving you a small field of view as you move forward and leading to cheap deaths.\n\nI debated on this one, but in the end for me despite all of the cons I enjoyed the game (probably because it starts out so easy).  A decent, cheap casual twin stick shooter.\n\n6/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1474763660, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1474763660, "recommendationid": "25681686", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504663", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475431969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 246, "steamid": "76561198042846156", "num_games_owned": 219}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Old school arcade at its best with neat vextrex styled graphics.
