Its core gameplay is pretty interesting at times, but overall it doesn't require alot to play a few matches, and you can go off and do your own thing. The story is generic, but it has a few side minigames that provide some variety. While progression is slow (painfully sometimes if you are just trying to rush through) it has enough bells and whistles to sidetrack you from feeling like you are just grinding one scenario. Overall a fun game, but the main mission does have a 30 day in game time limit.\n\nPro's:\nMatch 3 with an upgrade system to vary how you play\nFun gameplay (if you like Match 3's)\nNever really over/underpowered in the main storyline\nVaried minigames/sidegames that break the monotany from time to time\nCasual match 3 fun\n\nCon's:\nUpgrade system could use some tweaking\nCan become really grindy in some aspects\nThe rock paper scissors aspect of your attacks never really come that far into play\nAttacking enemies is slow, takes like 5 seconds each attack and it takes on average 6 attacks to kill a guy\n\nBuy it if you are looking for a under $5 game to pass a few hours, it will give you that at a minimum.\n\n*Final note: Dev seems to be pretty responsive on the forums, which is always really appreciated.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435289943, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435289943, "recommendationid": "16712178", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531139", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435785701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 95, "steamid": "76561198027483587", "num_games_owned": 403}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a pretty good \"match 3\" style game. It doesn't do anything that feels especially unique- collect coins to buy upgrades, play several different puzzle styles, advance through an admittedly silly story about becoming a Superhero. And it definitely feels like a game made for tablets. But what it does, it does well. And the game is really cheap even at full price. \n\nThe graphics are fine, though it is lacking resolution options (unless I'm missing something.
