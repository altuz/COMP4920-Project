In this one you get experience for picking up stuff that you find lying around and you make combat with limited AI drones using clunky animations. Its one of those... walk for 10 minutes til you find someone to kill game... The intro was text to speech and google image search slideshow and some nonsensical drivel about humans needing dark matter for... electricity? and ... end of the world zombies... something something\n\nExpect a sharp feeling of anxiety and depression from this thing even existing, frequent framerate dips in the single digits and a general sense of confusion as to why you are even engaged in playing this game. Truly an existential crisis generator.
