That's a seriously impressive balance to achieve, and if you have any idea what I'm talking about so far you should probably just pick up this game right now.\n\n[b]Don'yoku[/b]; the last of the manly shooters!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442680627, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442680627, "recommendationid": "18102126", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537498", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448045100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 311, "steamid": "76561198065066248", "num_games_owned": 216}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Don'Yoku is the reincarnation of the cabinet that sat in the corner of your local dive arcade. You know, the one that gorged itself on the pocket change of the unwary and stubborn; the one that had even the guy with seemingly superhuman coordination and reflexes sweating during the early levels. If you were that guy, Don\u2019Yoku will reveal whether you\u2019ve still \u201cgot it.\u201d If you were the bystander who could barely surmount stage one, then Don\u2019Yoku is your chance for redemption. Whatever your goal and whatever the outcome, you\u2019re going to have fun. \n\nThis is a brutal but enjoyable game: tough but fair. The first stage mercilessly showers you with bullets. The second? Ditto. The third? Same. The fourth? Guess. The fifth? Good luck getting there. As you make progress, Don\u2019Yoku will pour on the rain in increasingly dense patterns, and you\u2019ll love every minute of it. Controls are just about as tight and responsive as possible, so as much as you might curse the game when death comes (and it will), deep down you\u2019ll know the real reason you keep eating bullets is poor plane placement and/or slow reaction time. Granted, upon first encounter, some patterns will appear impossible to dodge. In these instances, Don\u2019Yoku\u2019s weapon mechanics serve as a buffer. Strategic use of your arsenal can extend your survivalbility by quite a bit.\n\nYou are given three planes to choose from, and each comes with a standard machine gun, an energy beam, and a Don\u2019Yoku attack (basically, a bomb). Damaging enemies with the machine gun fills the Don\u2019Yoku counter (i.e. gauge) for the Don'Yoku attack; whereas, the energy beam causes slight slowdown of onscreen action and converts kills to coins for increased score. A huge part of surviving in Don\u2019Yoku involves efficient swapping of the the weaker machine gun and the more powerful beam, as well as juggling Don\u2019Yoku energy stocking with Don'Yoku attack striking. Do this balancing act well and combine it with effective dodging, and your plane can endure a beating. \n\nAll in all, great gameplay and cool presentation makes Don'Yoku a must-have for bullet hell aficionados.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438011294, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451578150, "recommendationid": "17251076", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508909", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490124313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 35, "steamid": "76561198146023230", "num_games_owned": 39}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A great old school SHUMPS whit a fantastic OST!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435690815, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1480078283, "recommendationid": "16813936", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.978120", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1455760416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1354, "steamid": "76561197990196117", "num_games_owned": 62}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "When it comes to oldschool styled games, I am very picky; this game looks like a direct port from a 90s arcade machine.
