I wonder now if I had drowned and awoken in Sheol, for find myself among only devils of the abyss. In the night, I hear their drums, the arrhythmic pounding when they sacrifice to their cruel gods. I dare not venture inland. I make camp on the desolate sands, for the jungle is awash with rot. Miasmic and pulsating, it calls to me, but I will not follow. It is a festering wound. It stinks of corruption.\n\nThere are no ships on the horizon. No sails to be seen. I hunt crabs on the beach, without much success. The thirst is maddening. I crack fallen coconuts against the rocks, sucking them dry like marrow from bone. Soft flesh or putrid milk, I gag and choke it down.\n\nI collect the shell fragments. I use them for jewelry, fashioning necklaces and armbands. I decorate my camp. I bring civilization to a place of savagery. I piled rocks by the firepit and called it a throne\u2014for having carved out an existence here, am I not queen of this forsaken shore?\n\nThe natives grow restless. Savage shades who harbour only murder in their hearts. They know I am here. They are hunting. They are coming. From a smashed coconut I dab war paint on my face. Run my fingers down my axe, squeezing the handle. These are my rocks. These are my palms. They are coming. They are coming.\n\nI am the coconut queen."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1398043489, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516409", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "9887157", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197996594411", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1397467075, "num_games_owned": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 402}, "timestamp_updated": 1398043489, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I picked this game up when it was on sale and I wasn\u2019t expecting such a fun game. The artwork and voice acting is excellent and it has a funny storyline. \n\nThe main goal game is to build tourist amenities throughout various locations around the island. \u00a0It\u2019s similar to games like Build-A-Lot in that you have limited resources and workers but there is much more freedom to place buildings and bonus-generating structures.\n\nThe game is addicting since it\u2019s really easy to pick up and play- most of the levels can be finished in 6 or 7 minutes. And once you finish a level your development carries over into the next one so can continue building it up. \n\nHowever, beware of a glitch that may prevent you from seeing the true ending. If you complete the side paths of the game before the main story, the ending might not play after finishing the last level. Leave the side areas (the ones you need rubies to find) until the main story is complete."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1400521331, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499198", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "10171665", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198098246310", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1388692201, "num_games_owned": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 163}, "timestamp_updated": 1400521331, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is super addictive. Kind of like Dinner Dash and all those stereotypical games where you run around build, upgrade, and manage things. You dash about and have your \"Hunks\" build things for you to earn cash to build more things and to hire more hunks. You upgrade things to make them better, buy out stuff to upgrade them, and then meet certain goals throughout the game.\n\nI only had to replay a scenario twice, they get increasingly difficult as you move on but I didn't run into any problems until the last chapter in the game. It's a fun game, very casual, and worth the $10 that I paid for it. \n\nThe replayability isn't there for me though.
