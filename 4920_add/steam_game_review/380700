The usual stuff.\n\nUnfortunately, you are unable to save games; so, if you get to level 99, make a mistake and die, then you have to start all over again from level 1. Not impressive; that sort of thing is just a massive time-waster as far as I am concerned.\n\nThe nine achievements are all set for long play time.\n* Make it to wave 100\n* Kill a total of 10000 zombies\n* Earn 1000000 dollars\n* Spend 1000000 dollars\n* Get 10000 headshots\n* Get 10000 longshots\n* Get 10000 one shot kills\n* Kill a total of 1000 bosses\n* Get 10000 melee kills\nAt this date, your Steam achievements list doesn't show your cumulative totals.\n\nIt's obvious from the outset that this is not an advanced and amazing game; so, it's a shame that Steam only has a \"Yes\" or \"No\" choice as to whether you recommend this game - there needs to be at least a third option, one which says something like \"It's ok for what it is\".\n\nThat's how I would rate Zombie Killtime, it's ok for what it is. You can see that it's a very basic game, so you should expect nothing more.\nHowever, with all that said, on balance, I have to give this game a thumbs down.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE:\nI have moved the following section to the bottom of the review, as it is no longer applicable; however, I haven't deleted it from the review altogether as it shows that the developer of this game pays attention to comments and responds, which should be commended.\n\nThe game gives you the option to change the keyboard settings, but it actually wouldn't accept the arrow keys instead of the WASD keys - so I wasn't impressed with that.\n[UPDATE: This situation has changed, the arrow keys will now work when altered in the settings. Well done to the developer!!]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460018471, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460514295, "recommendationid": "22281550", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504255", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503011437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 401, "steamid": "76561198182078293", "num_games_owned": 58}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is legendary. probably the most realistic game I've ever played.
