You might think it's a bit irky with it's presentation and i can honestly say that the store page for this game doesn't attract much attention except for the awesome art, but this was one interesting ride. Despite flaws with the voice acting and little variation between both controllable characters, it has a gorgeous level design, a nice hack n' slash gameplay, well crafted bosses and a great soundtrack. The lore made me interested in the Anima tabletop RPG game, so that's definently a plus, still i expected a bit more. \n\nThis game reminds me of the classic PS2 era with series like Devil May Cry, Maximo and even the PS3 Nier which seems to be inspired in the making of this game. Take note that even the platforming sections remind a lot of that era and might be a bit hard to traverse them. \n\nIf you like the Hack n' Slash genre and don't mind the combat system being simplistic or even prefer some intersting boss fights, this might be one for you. If you don't like the fast paced combat or abhor platforming in this genre or even a above average difficulty, you might want to pass on this one.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506039651, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506039651, "recommendationid": "35116733", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 86, "total_reviews": 115, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 29}}
