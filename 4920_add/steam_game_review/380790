There is no provision for playing single player.\nThis basically ended my interest in what was an otherwise interesting-looking game.\n\nIt might not for everyone, but be warned; starting up the game, it asks you for \na server name you wish to be matched up with opponents on. It doesn't give you a list, \nso, unless you are a dev, you don't know what to write in that testbox, and you'll\nnever, ever actualy find an opponent to play with.\n\nBest of all, once you discover all this, there's no obvious indicator as to how to close\nthe program. You can't seem to do it once the program is running.\n\nI got sucked in by the cool-looking video and an introductory sale.\nLearn from my mistake.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438118611, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438118705, "recommendationid": "17272391", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523318", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
