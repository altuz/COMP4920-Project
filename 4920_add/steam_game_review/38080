So picking it up once again hit me with a great rush of nostalgia just playing the game.\n\nBuild-a-lot is a very unique game as you are a Real Estate Manager going around to different neighborhoods and improving them. There are 2 modes to the game, Career Mode where you compete against the clock to complete the various tasks; and Causal Mode, where you can sit back, not worry about a time limit, and complete the goal money of the selected area/ The core game play is building houses and buildings to complete various goals such as having a certain amount of rent or money, or having a specific building or a specific number of houses.\n\nThe real challenge from the game comes from your ability to multitask to compete against the deadline. The first half of the game does a good job of getting you settled in, however in the later half the game will test your skills you have learned to complete some pretty ambitious tasks. Another element that brings the heat are added tasks where the mayor of the neighborhood will pop in to add another goal to your agenda. Late game this is very annoying because they will give you another goal right as you complete the level and in many cases force you to replay the level you almost completed. However, this only becomes a problem when you try to get \"Super Efficiency\" on every level. Your reward for completing every level is a bit underwhelming (The Cost-Mart which gives you money and materials at a slow pace and can only be used on the complete user in Career Mode. It would be awesome if could use it in Causal)\n\nOne last thing I want to touch is the music. The music in Build-a-lot puts you into a relaxed mood and is very calming (aside from the Granite Springs track) And I will say hands down the area Lakeside, has the best music, best atmosphere and right level of difficulty in the entire game.\n\nThough the game is fairly easy as it does get very repetitive, ESPECIALLY in the final area Palm Grove, I still very much enjoyed the experience back when I was 7 and playing it 10 years later. I highly recommend the game, though the price of $10 is a little steep. If you're going to buy any of the Build-a-lot games, buy the \"Build-a-lot Bundle\" and wait for a sale. I got the bundle for $18.74 and I say that's a fair enough price."}]}
