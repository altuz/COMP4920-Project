The amount of detail in both character design, writing and worldbuilding blew me out of the water. The richly animated 2D character portraits are nothing short of gorgeous and made me relate to the well-rounded characters. The 3D art is in general a lot less polished, but by no means ugly. The Indian palace that serves as the location for the frame story is a huge exception: it looks and feels wonderful.\n\nCan't wait for books III and IV!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504731657, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504731657, "recommendationid": "34783130", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 42, "total_reviews": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
