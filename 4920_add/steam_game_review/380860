Unfortunately not.\n\n[h1]QUICKRATING[/h1]\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY 2/5[/b]\nNothing ground breaking. I like the direction the game is going in, but it's simply not enough.\nThe game doesn't offer much content wise and there haven't been any updates in a long time. With this being said, I can only change my initial positive review into a negative one. Last response of the devs as of November 2016: still working on it, but progressing slow. Since then the game has left early access and lacks a lot of polish.\n\n[b]CONTROLS 5/5[/b]\nPlays fluently, the button layout makes sense to me and is rebindable.\n\n[b]MUSIC & SOUND 4/5[/b]\nFitting the scenario and thrilling. Not a fan of the menu music tho, as the joke wears off quick. \n\n[b]VISUALS 4/5[/b]\nClean and distinct. More lights here and there wouldn't harm, if the hammer of the gods goes all over the place again (no pun intended), destroying light sources. \n\n[h1]ADDITIONAL INFO[/h1]\n\nThe music is GOLD and the controls are fluid, which is a must for this type of game - and the devs pulled them off real nice. Playing it with mouse/kb or gamepad feels both equal, but i prefer the gamepad to have all functions within the reach of my thumb.\n\nBasically you clear a level and descent deeper into the dungeon. You can find different weapons that really make a difference to your gameplay. Combine that with Barbara-Ians slick moves, only ONE hitpoint and some mean traps and you are up for a good amount of fun. Unfortunately the game feels unfinished and you will encounter bugs (falling through the floor, levetating) or run out of things to explore pretty fast.\n\nIf you like Gauntlet/Crimsonland/Hotline Miami 1 and brawlers in general, you might give it a try despite my negative review.
