Do you build-and-flip to get quick cash? Or build-and-rent for steady income? Do you acquire new properties or upgrade your current holdings? etc., etc.\n\nThis sequel's biggest addition is the concept of curb appeal. Certain improvements increase curb appeal, as well as neigboring installations like parks.  Other buildings such as workships and oil rigs can decrease the curb appeal of neighbors.  More often than not, your goal for a level will include increasing the appeal of the neighborhood overall.\n\nEverything is so well balanced. In the early levels, it is fairly easy to reach the goal, but challenging to hit the super-clear time, while in the later levels it is challenging to reach the goal and very hard (but do-able) to hit the super-clear time.  The abilities granted by buildings are useful, but not so overpowered that you find yourself building the same things on every level.\n\nI picked up the first Build-A-Lot game years ago in a bargain bin at Micro Center and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I was very surprised to find that three more had been released since then.  This game is a lot of fun and well worth picking up in a seasonal sale, perhaps as a bundle with the other 3 games."}]}
