It's a good addition to the handful of games on steam inspired by or adapted from the Assault Suits series.\n\nThe game isn't without its problems, but I did not experience the crashing, jank and no input detection reported by many.\n\nIf anyone reading this liked Gunhound, Gigantic Army or Assault Suit Leynos and wants more, do check it out, especially if it's on sale. I can't recommend a control pad enough, if you try to play this with a keyboard you're probably going to have a bad time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505904502, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506005898, "recommendationid": "35081540", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 7}}
