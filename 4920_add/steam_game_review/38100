A couple of new additions, such as homes that start in a run-down state, police, fire, and medical emergencies help to keep the concept from going stale just yet. Premier lots, a feature from the first game that was missing in the second, make their return.\n\nPerhaps the biggest cosmetic change to the game is in the level selection screens.  Instead of the traditional menu-of-levels that are the staple of games like this, Build-a-Lot 2 has you criss-crossing a political map of western Europe. Instead of just playing all of the levels from one setting consecutively, you will often play 1-3 levels in one locale before sprinting off to another, often returning to early locales for bigger projects.\n\nThis game to me seemed quite a bit easier than Build-a-Lot 2.  I was able to super-clear 26 of the first 28 levels on the first try.  In Build-a-Lot 2, it was only 16 of the first 18.\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of the first two Build-a-Lot games, you shouldn't be disappointed in this one."}]}
