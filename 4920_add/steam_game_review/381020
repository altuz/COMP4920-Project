Each plane can then be equipped with any weapon or countermeasure of your choosing within that planes allowance, further allowing the player the flexibility to play how they please for better or worse.\nIf you realize you made a terrible decision when equipping or if you take too much damage you can return to your carrier before completing the mission to heal at a cost.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m\u00a0really enjoying Sky Psychic Warrior, the combat is fluid and fun.\nThe controls\u00a0need\u00a0a\u00a0little bit\u00a0of learning but once they become instinctive you are left with a tight rewarding fun air combat game that wont punish you with physics and tends to eat up\u00a0waaaaay\u00a0more time than you intend to spend with it.\u00a0\n\nSky Cleric is a really nice little game that might not appeal to anyone morally opposed to\u00a0arcady\u00a0flight games but is a virtual must buy for anyone into\u00a0retro, cathartic jet powered nonsense with a load of content to unlock.\u00a0\nFor 15 quid with steam workshop support providing more content, A\u00a0free-play, endless and custom mission options aside from the campaign which again\u00a0can be\u00a0played in local\u00a0co op,\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0not sure how or why anyone\u00a0wouldn\u2019t\u00a0recommend\u00a0this game.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThanks for reading,", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505216688, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505497111, "recommendationid": "34899384", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499620", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 330, "total_reviews": 358, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 28}}
