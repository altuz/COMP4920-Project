There's no healing mechanic, and the store front already states that it's a weapons-free title. At best, it's a [strike]walking[/strike] running simulator with an underlying horror theme that revolves around an ancient cult, dark rituals, and black magicks. You take control of Moira Weylyn, who has been summoned to her grandfather's island, via wishes from his Last Will and Testament, so that she can rekindle her relationship with her few remaining family members and learn the secrets of the island itself.\n\nThroughout your stay on Weylyn Island, which will last anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half, you can expect to do a lot of running, mostly from cult members and some zombie-like creatures. There are also audio tapes that can be picked up, which help to bridge the gaps of the story between dialogues and cutscenes. Although much of the game feels as though it could be classified as a demo to a much larger, high-budget title, there are far too many areas that feel like they go on forever; sections of the game that have no dialogue, tapes, or cutscenes, just pure running. On that note, it's a good thing that the main character's stamina is unlimited.\n\nAs short as it is, that's really all that can be said about The Ritual on Weylyn Island; there are no puzzles or combat, just story and a little bit of action. There are a total of six chapters, to which the developer has said last 2-3 hours \"depending on exploration\". As the game is almost entirely linear, there isn't much exploring to be had. Though the story is good, there are far too many monotonous moments without dialogue or any form of interaction, other than traversing the wilderness by running along trails. There's even a noticeable lack of ambiance. There are also some optimization issues. The game is a decent contender for the \"something to do for a couple of hours on a dark, rainy night\" category, but given its age and repetitive nature, grab it on sale.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]3.0/5.0[/b] - Average, can take it or leave it.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork#curation]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497067688, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497595833, "recommendationid": "32308171", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521852", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 23, "total_reviews": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
