That said, I hope that the ones come over are ones I can actually truly enjoy and love.  I have mixed feelings about The Men of Yoshiwara: Kikuya.  I originally bought it in 2015 going, \"lol, otome game that needs my support, but...male prostitutes, lol.\"\n\nI enjoyed the Japanese architecture, the attire, and the character designs - a lot of the men truly are that flashy; or are deliberately attempting to look so to catch the eye of potential customers.  That much is fine.\n\nThe setting, however - the world building - was absolutely horrendous.  I grew up hating the convenient excuse of female-only races that had to lure men (and upon luring them, the men could enjoy themselves); so why would I suddenly appreciate the reverse?  Or something similar.  The idea that MEN ARE RARELY BORN ON THE ISLAND, SO WE DECIDED TO CREATE WHOREHOUSES OF IMPORTED MEN is just a stupid, convenient excuse that annoys the heck out of me.  I certainly wouldn't appreciate the reverse concept either.  \n\nHowever, simply having a house of male courtesans / prostitutes  to appeal to a clientele not so commonly targeted...that's fine, in theory, if they'd just gone that route.  And I do appreciate the realism that most of the men, under all the flair and presentation and glamor, do not actually want to live their lives there.  They were sold, traded, or otherwise dragged into a situation that they have to adapt to and deal with.\n\nThe female character is \"true\" to the culture of the world the game has built and does not think of how unwilling they might be until it comes up in each route itself, but then, she also never intended to deliberately seek the attention of male courtesans, either.  She's caught up in that world accidentally and is shown to have a sympathetic perspective from the start when encountering a couple that has to escape the island since one of them is, in fact, a male courtesan that has not yet paid his debt to the house that took him in.\n\nThere's parts of this game I like.  There really are.  I especially liked the CGs; the art was tasteful when it was sexual (heck, I actually really liked some of those scenes overall) and I really like how soft everyone's hair looked.  I also love that the female character wasn't generally faceless - she was extremely cute, and the most attractive character in the entire game to me.  My tastes revealed, I guess?  Whoops.\n\nThat said, certain routes feel like a chore to complete, and I end up feeling like this world setting would have been better as a bigger budget game instead of a port from a mobile game.  For what it is, it isn't that bad - most mobile otomes in my experience are extremely worthless to play - but this one didn't feel like that.  It just felt like it really missed the mark on potential, for me.\n\nA setting like this with a lot more world buildup and less direct focus on romance routes (while still maintaining the romance later on) would have been extremely intriguing, but that's not what was created.  This game, and its setting, might have been able to convince or trick me into enjoying the worldbuilding a lot more if there was a much longer prologue, with a lot of character interaction and circumstance to force the female protagonist into these characters' lives.  Something that took much longer to read, with more intricately detailed routes once the paths really branched.\n\nInstead, I have to say that this isn't an otome I'd recommend unless you're wanting something that is a step up from most mobile otome games, but isn't as good as Nameless, Sweet Fuse, or Hakuoki.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494796450, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494796450, "recommendationid": "31757421", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525992", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480960552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 286, "steamid": "76561198009526949", "num_games_owned": 176}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "review": "The premise is good, but the execution is flawed in so many ways that I can't recommend this unless you really, really care about (badly written / translated) sex scenes.\n\nI read a lot of VNs and Otomes and compared to what else is out there, the Men of Yoshiwara just doesn't deliver. The poor quality of the writing and translation isn't even the worst problem; I read an awful fan translation of Higurashi and was still hooked. No, this otome has other issues.\n\n-The heroine's background and personality are paper thin. Yes, this is sometimes the case in other otome as well, but it seriously wasn't THIS bad anywhere else that I've seen. She's a cardboard cutout defined by almost nothing except her desire to have spending money so she can see those men.\n-The overall plot is very shallow and unexciting, with lukewarm solutions to lukewarm problems that are usually resolved within a very short timeframe and without real effort.\n-The sex scenes are really, really bad. Like... laughing out loud bad. The 'ferocious wedge' is a frequently quoted gem.\n\nAnyone expecting depth, believable character development and tension: stay away.\nAnyone who just wants to indulge in a fantasy of sexy men and doesn't care about anything else - go ahead, I guess.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498580084, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498580084, "recommendationid": "32860880", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512285", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498418371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 314, "steamid": "76561198164956210", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "As a lover of Otome and visual novel games and for the people who don\u2019t want to read this super long review I have to say one thing, DO.NOT.BUY.THIS.GAME!\n\nFor the reasons why I say this: \n\nFor the 5 hours it took me to get through 2 of the 7 routes provided in the game along with the few glitches and occasional freezing when saving, loading or just going through the poor excuse of an menu itself I found it to be the shittiest translation attempt at a sexy crap-show of a story ever told.  (Seriously though I have seen and played games that have never been officially released in the States that random people who either learn or use their language and programming skills and take time out of their lives to make an Japanese game run better and look better while writing and translating lines FOR FREE have Higher quality standards VS. a person who working in the company, who IS getting paid, and they throw out shit translations like this, I wonder if the problem is the apparent LOW standards of a company. )\n\nFor English speakers, the grammar is NOT as it is shown in the screenshots, It is just plain AWFUL. Like legit, I was confused on what was happening to the Heroine and her chosen \"manwhore\" that made me have to try and attempt to reread several sections back just to figure out how they got from plot A to plot Z. Speaking of plots, there are several plotholes in the game or lack of plot that just throws random \"problems\" out just to drag out chapters/give issues for the Heroine and Manwhore to fight and get over it together to \"grow their love~\". \n\nAnd since they advertise this game as being a \"ADULT\" Otome (where these types of games genre for a female base audience are too few.) But then is the most you get other than some saucy visual here and there is just literally foreplay(which in most cases is just the fondling of boobies, if you're lucky you get a manwhore to offer ONE kiss to your Heroine lower lady lips)  In short it goes, \"Fondle Fondle, dialogue about sexy something, more fondle and end.\" (Personally for being an \u201cAdult\u201d VN sure is pretty tame, vs. that of more male orientation games that goes through the WORKS with details in writing, dialogue and art.  But that just my opinion.) \n\nThe few good things about the game is literally just the art and an interesting story concept. \n\nSo if anyone was looking for a smexy good time with interesting characters and story this is not the game for you. \nDo yourselves a favor, save your cash, go to youtube and look these routes up. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498873018, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498873018, "recommendationid": "33063614", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505766", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458395889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1153, "steamid": "76561198066975359", "num_games_owned": 97}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This was the first Dogenzaka labs game I ever bought (and was out at the time).
