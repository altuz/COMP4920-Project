However, for the money I wasn't expecting alot. I found it fun, not taxing on the brain, simple point and click, but be warned the UI isn't exactly friendly. It can also be a bit glitchy. I used the eye icon alot to see where I could interact with the scene, but overall I think this is a decent enough casual game, although it does feel a little like a school project.  \n\nFor the couple of quid I spent I don't feel ripped off, and the time I spent playing was fun. Good as a time fiiller. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440076224, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440076224, "recommendationid": "17628917", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547875", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486180428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 105, "steamid": "76561198139489213", "num_games_owned": 64}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very short, easy game; finished it in less than 1 1/2 hours.
