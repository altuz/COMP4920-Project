Hopefully the developer will fix this issue somewhere down the line, so that we do not have to revert to 1995 methods of manually backing up saved games.\"", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504646533, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506802010, "recommendationid": "34764844", "language": "english", "votes_down": 174, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717199", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507148581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2370, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 75064, "steamid": "76561198046610936", "num_games_owned": 7}, "votes_funny": 19, "votes_up": 333, "comment_count": "66", "review": "I get it, i have 1000 plus hours and youll probably see my status as \"playing dbd. . .\" So why would i not recommend this game after all the time i have and still am investing in it?\n\nBecause i dont think the devs deserve any more money. Go to the forums. Every single day someone is saying they lost all of their progress. Ive had friends with over 900 hours just lose their progress out of nowhere. Ive had multiple friends lose their progress. Some still waiting after 4 weeks to get their blood points back. (game's currency) The devs have taken so long to fix this bug (its been happening since i got this game in dec 2016!!!!) that they have told people to make their own copies of their save files. This is just one of many glitches.\nSecond reason is, balance issues. Playing killer is...awful. So if you like being a survivor this game is for you. But if you think youre gunna come into this game and actually be something to fear with your cool michael myers dlc you are in for a real surprise. Between the looping and the ninjaing i just cant handle the frustration. Looping is great fun as a surv but its hell for the killer and you have to waste 2 perks just to counter it. And with balance issues comes MORE balance issues. Some matches become a chore if survs or killers bring op add ons into the game. This can happen quite frequently. It throws off the balance waay off even more and you cant ever prepare for it. Youre basically stuck in a match where the game is heavily on the other sides favor. Fun? Not really, just annoying.  \nThird reason, survive with friends. You can play with friends but since youre most likely using discord and the devs cant accept the fact that friends like the chat while they play together and balance the game accordingly you are going to be lobby dodged. Expect to wait at least 10 minutes (realistically 15mins plus) inbetween games. Its hard to blame killers for it, I try to blame the devs for it bc it is ultimately their failing. \n\nSo those are the reasons why i wont push my friends to get the game anymore. If you cant handle feeling cheesed by stupid op addons, offerings and perks youre not going to like this game. The game has a lot of luck involved and the luck heavily sides with the survivors. \nSo yeah, i play a lot but i wont spend another dime on these fools. They fail time and time again to fix anything. Every patch brings in more problems. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505266656, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505266656, "recommendationid": "34911497", "language": "english", "votes_down": 91, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684798", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506242182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 390, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1907, "steamid": "76561198041505645", "num_games_owned": 154}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 65, "comment_count": "6", "review": "Out of all the reviews I wrote, This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. \n\nFor starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.\n\nBut you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.\n\nAs Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. \n\nI mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.\n\nBut what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. \n\nI wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do.

As in, why, after the game has been \"live-release\" for over a year and a half, is there still such a game-breaking \"bug\" in this?
