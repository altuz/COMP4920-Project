Not as in banning everyone or deleting tons of threads bad (though some were deleted before it was noted that Valve and Steam Community Moderators can see EVERYTHING deleted) and the developer did play it fair in that regard afterwards.\n\nWhat happened was actually worse, pushing towards felony material.\n\nFirst it had started with review fraud by an account from the game's Greenlight submission page along with a known artist for the game.\n\nThe artist immediately apologized and took down their reviews, conforming to both Valve's rules and consumer law regarding proper disclosure in review.  They were thanked for their honesty along with having the problems review fraud could have given them explained.  This was as much for their benefit as any other developers looking in on the situation.\n\nThe lead developer was a different story.  Insisting that they were the sole developer, nobody else despite credits and other developers being mentioned in the creation of Hydraulic Empire, the developer tried to distance themselves from the account from the Greenlight submission page (royalmage7).  Now in turn the royalmage7 account was offering the idea that they weren't even connected to the developer.  \"So first off I do not work for the dev, I just wanted to help him out. I made post like that in order to make him look better (bigger studio).\"  They had changed their reviews to preserve them, claiming that they were a moderator once upon a time and no longer had ties to the developer.\n\n[u]The problem was that royalmage7 was actually the developer trying to take the heat off of themselves.[/u]   \n\nThey may not have understood fully what they were doing, but they tried to cover up review fraud (which usually faces many thousands USD in fines depending upon state and even federal laws) by claiming misrepresentation fraud to make people think the company was larger to entice buyers (which is a felony in most states and even on a federal level IIRC).\n\nThe developer had to be saved from themselves and shown why this was bad before it got even worse.\n\nA Google Cache result exposing their alt account was shown, upon which the developer removed all fraudulent reviews and issued an apology.\n\nYeah, it had to get to that point, I did get a bit snarly at the continued lies (which was far better than the alternatives), but now that the developer dropped the whole thing and has apologized and [u]has gone one unasked-for step beyond in trying to resolve anyone hurt by this[/u], I'll be one of if not the first to be right there behind the developer if they continue doing things right.\n\nThe fraud, both counts of it, have been remedied by the actions of the developer.\n\nSince the apology the developer has gone back to fix bugs, so the title has not been dropped.\n\nIt is just waiting for more input - input that I think this developer deserves now that they are doing things right.\n\nThank you for doing the right thing.  \nIt wasn't pretty, but you now stand as an example of how someone can clean up their act to preserve their indie development career.  :)\n\nSome info links about this:\nFTC Guidelines - as Valve is a US company they must conform to US law (along with the State of Washington's state laws), which requires proper disclosure in review, though Valve usually squishes most developers reviewing their own games - NOTE: THIS MAY BE DIFFERENT IN YOUR JURISDICTION AND COMPLETELY ILLEGAL EVEN WITH DISCLOSURE, DO NOT RISK IT:\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking\n\nDev Apology:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/games/381220/announcements/detail/2641773114861818516\n\nA post explaining why the developer dove from frying pan into fire by defending one kind of fraud with another:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/381220/discussions/0/2119355556477136107/#c2119355556479032398\n\nSidAlpha's report in review:\nhttps://youtu.be/n9nFXr76W9Q", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497555830, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498035738, "recommendationid": "32450485", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524352", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492462237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198330766809", "num_games_owned": 14}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Not sure what people are so uptight about with this game...
