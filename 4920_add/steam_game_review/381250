Bank the scrap to buy upgrades both for your ship and your station while both keeping the station's hull repaired and not losing all your colonists.

The 7 player co-op sounds like it would be a great deal of fun, but I was not able to examine this particular feature.\n\nThe game is a bit expensive at $20 for what is currently available so you may want to wait for a sale.\nI'd also recommend using a controller.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492047033, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492047033, "recommendationid": "31108161", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493129", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
