You can't go backwards so picking certain paths will close off others. When you reach your destination a random event will occur based on what location you have visited. These often involved a skill check and both your captain and your 3 officers have their own stats that include such things as tactics, diplomacy and science. The different options you have are all themed around a specific skill and the more points your crew has culmitavely in that skill, the greater your chance of success so it's best to pick the choices that play to your strengths. You will sometimes have the option to send out an away team as well, which are basically a themed set of encounters. In this instance though, your skill checks are not  your crews culmitive skills, but just the skills of the officer you send to lead the expidition. The amount of situations you can encounter in this random encounters and away missions is quite varied and they will play out differently depending on what skills you choose to favour. The are often bizzare and humorous and the writing is quite good.\n\nThere is also some resource management and you will need to make sure you don't run out of your vital resources or you will face consequences. You will need to keep an eye on your food, fuel, number of crew and the condition of your hull. While running out of fuel can be a bit of a pain, running out of hull will destroy your ship and end your journey.\n\nThe game has a nice retro pixel art style to convey the events happening  in what is mostly text based encounters but the art has a lot of humour and really adds to the zany atmosphere of the whacky adventures your crew will have. The music is quite good too with catchy retro chiptunes.\n\nAll up a fun little story based game. There is a lot of luck involved in the skill tests the game makes during your encounters but if you play to your crews strengths you can normally offset that. Plus the adventures are short enough that failure is not a big deal and sometimes it's fun to fail, just to see what disaster is going to befall you when you do.\n\n7/10\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501206251, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501206251, "recommendationid": "33845555", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500331", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 42, "total_reviews": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 17}}
