I found myself not wanting to play this at all.  It's basically breakout in 3D which has been done before... and VR in this instance doesn't add that much to it, except that they chose to make your goggles the controller by default.  I'm guessing this was more for the Oculus crowd since they don't have motion controls yet.\n\nThe Developer kindly informed me that holding the grip buttons will activate the paddles.  Somehow that makes it even less fun for me.  I don't get it.  Word of advice: If you do choose to use the paddles, don't play in a room with light fixtures hanging from the ceiling.  If you choose to use the goggles, take a break or your neck will likely hurt later.\n\nThe developer really should have made it an option... or a toggle... instead of having to hold the button to use the hand paddles, press it once to bring up the paddle, press it again to use the goggles... simple, efficient, and unobtrusive.\n\nBut as I said before, it's just 3D breakout.  With your head as the controller, your neck will be kinda sore after playing this for a while.  It's not just looking up, down, left and right... it's the fact that to put a spin on the ball you kinda have to hit the ball with the paddle moving just right... so trying to spin the ball to angle it to hit the blocks I wanted is what really did my neck in.\n\nUsing your hands as the paddles allows you to hit the ball forcefully and change the speed, but that actually makes the game harder to play and not in a fun way.  \n\nThings I liked:\n[list]\n[*] chiptunes (though they weren't all that catchy)\n[*] It's Breakout!\n[*] There's a red and white \"amiga beachball\" in the game as a multiball mode.\n[*] There are some powerups like a metal ball that goes through multiple bricks before rebounding.\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't really like\n[list]\n[*] It's 3D breakout.  (I don't feel VR adds to the game here)\n[*] They give you a LOT of lives, to the point where I doubted that I'd ever lose the game  There's zero feeling of challenge unless you slam the ball into action and then you have to react to your own serve.\n[*] The ball is rather large and so is the paddle so there's not a whole lot of skill involved here.\n[*] Neither control method (goggles or hand controllers) seemed to feel right. \n[*] The Slowdown powerup really seemed unnecessary.\n[*] The controllers vibrate as you move them around... like non stop.  It's like the developer said \"hey, I can use haptics... I don't know what to use them for... how about if they just buzz all the damn time?  Yeah I'll do that then\".\n[*] The first few levels are really boring and when it finally changes the stage a bit, it doesn't really change much... now instead of being a square room it's a cyllinder. WOO.\n[/list]\n\nSo yeah, it's not a great game.  Maybe they'll improve on the game some?  Probably not though.  I bet they're already done for good unless there's a bugfix to do.  I waited a while and came back to it thinking maybe I'd like it even more, or that with the new found info about the hand paddles it would make the game better.    It didn't though.  \n\nThe best thing I can say for this game is that at least it doesn't do what holoball did with the annoying voice... I can actually understand the opening narration.  But I don't feel like every game needs a back story either.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467284605, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1470384058, "recommendationid": "23951630", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.972928", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 9, "num_reviews": 9, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 3}}
