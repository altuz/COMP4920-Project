Its a SideScrolling, Shoot 'Em Up, Perma Death, Rouge-lite game with a very adorable art style and amazing music. The game takes inspiration from many of the Indie greats, such as Binding of Isaac with its stacking power ups that also mutate the characters appearence as you go on, and Fez with its whimsical/retro soundtrack and colors. The game is simple, but super fun and extremly addictive. The people at WeFiends put so much love and heart into this game its hard not to love it as well. This game even had me smiling while playing it because of how much fun I was having. Dandy is also really difficult, and all the enemies require different tactics to beat them, forcing you to actually think about what way to attack enemies rather than just holding down the shoot button, and I gotta give WeFiends some credit because its really well done and innovative. The art style is possibly the nicest thing to look at ever, and the backgrounds look like they were made by the League of Legend art team! The backgrounds look extremly amazing and detailed, expecally a little later on in the game when Dandy is flying through a beautiful starry night sky. This game also has great music and is one of the few video game soundtracks I could listen to for days. There is an Online Mode that is also very fun and playing with friends (Online or Locally) is always a blast with Dandy. In conclusion, Dandy is cute, crazy and fun with so much heart put into it. Maybe a little simple, but thats ok, because the content that is here is enough to keep you playing for hours. I highly recommend this game to any fans of Indie games (expecally the ones I said above) and artist since this game is a blast to look at (seriously I could just look at this game and have a fun time doing it). This game is a lot like candy itself, and Im totally addicted, WeFiends did an amazing job and I can't wait to see what they have in store in the future.\n\n-Stefan <3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438901336, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438901336, "recommendationid": "17421057", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507154", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1473071395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 71, "steamid": "76561198080625138", "num_games_owned": 188}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "2", "review": "It's a good game, but there are no checkpoints and that drives me INSANE!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1473071482, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1473071482, "recommendationid": "25361727", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507312", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469584862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1026, "steamid": "76561197996715488", "num_games_owned": 638}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game started pretty good and escalated to great in my book.

The game is also available on mobile, that explains the art style and why the enemies look rather bland, but trust me, it is a lot better than it looks. The gameplay is simple, you kill waves of enemies, after some waves you get randomized power-ups and eventually you fight a boss.\n\n[b]Enemies:[/b]\nThe strongest part about dandy is the enemy design. Most of the enemies have weaknesses that can be exploited to fight them efficiently without losing health. For example some of the enemies require you to stand still or else you can't hurt them, while others force you to move or else they shoot at you. These two enemy types can appear on the same screen and lead to difficult situations. Overcoming these tricky screens with knowledge and skill feels very rewarding.\n\nThe final boss is annoying, it is a bullet-hell boss and he doesn't fit in the game. The 4th version of the boss has a ridiculous amount of hp and if you don't have good damage items the fight goes 20 minutes or until you die.\n\n[b]Controls:[/b]\nI play the game with an xbox-controller, you move up or down (you can't move left or right) with the analog stick and use the a-button for shooting. If you hold down the a-button you character auto-fires. The only problem i have with the controls is that there are items that require you to charge them up, picking up one of these items overrides the ability to auto-fire. I really hope they add an extra button to charge up shots in the future.\n\n[b]Items:[/b]\nThe item variety is rather small, there are maybe 30-40 items and most of them are just damage upgrades or defensive upgrades in some form, Items that are more special like pierce or the banana boomerang are rare.\nSome items are overpowered, the peach and the cinnamon both allow you to oneshot pretty much every enemy leading to extremly easy runs. However in general the items aren't very important, even if i get only bad items i can almost always make it to the final boss.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n\nDandy is a fun skill-based game that has well designed enemys and good controls. The replay-value is rather limited because of the non-random encounters and the bad item system but if you are a fan of the genre the game is definitively worth the asking price,", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443555642, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443555642, "recommendationid": "18253816", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501009", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439063950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 68, "steamid": "76561198238644146", "num_games_owned": 5}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Prunk saw game called \"Dandy\" and soon realized it is not same game from Atari in the 1980s.

Prunk frustrated but want to get better at game so play again, and again, and again.  Prunk keep dying, but keep playing to win, even though no scores - must reach end!  No reach end, but game good.

Candy cane sometimes seem to fire blanks even when it look like direct hits on enemies.  This would be less problem if Prunk had battleaxe, but candy cane shooter more appropriate.  Learned fast shooting not so great at damage, but Prunk panic and do faster shooting most times.  Probably why keep dying.
