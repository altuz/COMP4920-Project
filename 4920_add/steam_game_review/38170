Where it becomes complicated however, is that each of these matches contributes to a pool of resources that you use as currency to buy more buildings between stages. Each purchased building adds an object that can be matched, often with a powerful power-up that can be unleashed to help the player defeat the puzzle. Taken together, Cradle of Rome is both unique and refreshing and offers hours of puzzle fun for any casual gamer. I highly recommend this game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1438166841, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498329", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "17279945", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198028180031", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1502788921, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1746}, "timestamp_updated": 1438166841, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A simple puzzle game, very cool concept.
