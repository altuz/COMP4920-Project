The cars are pretty much just drive around with the arrow keys and like an old Mario Kart game.  The people in the game are even worse.  Their graphics and walking remind me of N64 characters as well.

I wanted to love this game as it had 2WD and 4WD buggies in it.\n\nI have played VRC PRO for years and unfortunately, this game does not come close to it yet.  All VRC Pro lacks is 2WD and 4WD electric buggy.\n\nI feel this game is trying to be too broad and not focusing on the aspect of certain classes.  Bits of it are very nice, some really nice modelling and some great ideas with the track builder etc.  I hope over time this game develops to become less rough.\n\nIt would do no harm taking some pointers from VRC Pro.
