Highly recommended, especially if you loved the original tale. \n\nEach journey takes about 2 hours (within 80 days) to 3 hours (more than 80 days). While you can always take a break from the game at any city, the story is so engrossing that you would probably complete your playthrough in one sitting. There is high replay value as you explore different routes and choices.\n\nThe clock is always ticking so you feel a sense of urgency as you have to decide quickly between visiting the market, exploring the city, or planning your route. Add to that balancing your duties as valet and friend to Fogg without losing your eye on the prize. To win the game, you have to complete the journey within 80 days. However, the journey itself is fun even when you come across obstacles. Get robbed, thrown into jail, or crash your vehicle... There are many unexpected surprises along the way that make delays more amusing than frustrating.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502033390, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502033974, "recommendationid": "34062511", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509474", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500967063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 146, "steamid": "76561197970545977", "num_games_owned": 594}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I'm only an hour into it but am having so much fun I had to share!  The game looks simple on the surface -- travel around the world in 80 days -- but there is much more to this game.  Juggling suitcases, buying and selling goods, exploring cities, talking with people and learning things, and keeping your master happy are just some of the things you have to do.  Do you travel across Russia?  If so, does the master have cold weather gear?  Do you go south and cross North Africa and risk crossing the desert and, yes, riding a camel?\n\nThe interface is incredibly easy to use.  Managing your suitcases and inventory is a simple drag and drop process.  To buy goods, you drag them to your suitcase.  To sell, you drag them out.  Easy as can be.  All of the items have tooltips that shed some light on them -- the value, where they should be sold, and/or how they might help you during your journey.   Your market purchases can impact your travel plans too.  Certain items can be extremely valuable in certain cities.\n\nUsing the map is very intuitive.  Your mouse wheel is used to zoom in and out.  Click and drag spins the globe around.  There are also buttons for zooming in and out as well.  \n\nWhat really hooked me is the \"choose your own adventure\" aspect to the game.  As you converse with your master, train porters, and people in various cities, you are presented with a few dialog options to choose from.  Each option has pros and cons.  Some will improve your relations with your master.  Some will shed light on travel routes.  Some will tell you little facts about various cities, histories, or travel tips.   As you learn new things, little information boxes appear when you click on each city -- no need to remember stuff or write it down.\n\nI'll update this review when I finish.

Although the visuals and interface are functional at best, their abstract nature leaves most of the imagery up to your imagination. This game is essentially a choose-your-own-adventure novel with good writing. The choices are diverse, and there are light inventory/money management elements that give the gameplay some diversity and agency in choice. However, the real star here is the character imbued in every word, in every scene, in every moment of foreshadowing that suggest, to use the words of the Knight in The Last Crusade, that you have chosen wisely or poorly.\n\nIf you enjoy story in games, are willing to invest in creating a world in your mind, and are interested in exploring the world and discovering mysteries and adventures, check it out!
