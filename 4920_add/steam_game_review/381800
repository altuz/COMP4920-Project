I feel it isn't worth even the low introductory price. I feel it simply isn't ready yet, even for Steam Early Access. \n\nPrior to purchasing, I checked out the screenshots. It reminded me of classic games like Super Sprint or RC Pro-Am, games I was a huge fan of back in the day. The potential may be there, time will tell.\n\nThe game is tagged with Multiplayer and Cross-platform multiplayer, which would be great, however, the multiplayer aspects have not yet been integrated into the game. As of now, this is a major disappointment. \"That's OK\", I thought. \"I can just play against the AI\"\n\nWell, there is just one problem with that: this game has no AI! In Single Player mode, all there is to do is race around the track solo, sort of a \"time trial mode\" but without the Time Trial. There is literally no incentive to do well.\n\nAt this point I feel the game isn't yet in a playable state, but I do see potential here. I'm skeptical of some of the positive user reviews left thusfar. \n\nThe options menu states that controllers are not yet supported. There is no support to change screen resolution. The only options available are choosing between Fullscreen and Windowed (a window that cannot be resized), and a Master Volume slider. \n\nAt this point I'm going to request a refund through Steam. If at any point this game improves on some of the lacking features that I believe should be there (even in early access), I might repurchase the game and update my review as I see fit. \n\nThe verdict: don't buy this game, at least not yet.\n\nOne other small thing -- What's up with the artwork on the store page? This is a game about racing on \"50+ tracks across Europe\".
