Gameplay wise, there are 3 different game modes, two of which feel very similar, the third, aim mode, is quite unique and really fun. To me, this game is definitely more of a relaxation activity than a full on game.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n[list]\n   [*] Beautifully crafted environments that feel very real.\n   [*] Controls are spot on.\n   [*] Music is great, ambient sounds are very calming in game.\n   [*] Levels are very long.\n   [*] Boat Customization is neat, lots of different options for flags, etc.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n[list]\n   [*] Only 3 game modes with 5 maps, can get boring quick.\n   [*] No sound options in the menu, the sound blasted out my ears when I opened the game.\n   [*] Coin Collection feels very similar to Rally.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nThis game is clearly beautifully crafted with a lot of love, the music and graphics are stunning, the ambient sounds are accurate for the areas, the controls are spot on for how a paper boat would control. Sadly with only 3 game modes, two of which feel very similar and 5 maps, although each map is quite long, the game got boring rather quickly and left me feeling wanting for more to do. I'd love to see a racing mode against AI or even multiplayer? to give far more replayability of an otherwise great game.\n\n6.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443161007, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443161007, "recommendationid": "18181816", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504690", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443111476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 163, "steamid": "76561198063142139", "num_games_owned": 364}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmYm6WKKqQ&feature=youtu.be\n\nMy Paper Boat is a quaint little physics-based simulation of controlling a paper boat around various levels.

It might be zen-like as others term it, but only on the lowest settings if you're not into a jet engine video card.

I think it fails to hit it's mark. Here's where I think the majority of the mistakes are made:\n\n1) While on the casual side of things, this idea seems brilliant. You have a nice relaxing setting & a very innocent somewhat nostalgic pass time. The beautiful settings turn out to be very aesthetically noisy & a bit gaudy. It's hard to just play & relax. I find myself squinting just to focus. This problem is just compounded by the the water effects, mainly waterfalls. When you get water on the camera you get the expected result of image distortion. The problem is that when the setting is already irritating, the added distortion is not welcome.\n\n2) The controls need a bit of tweeking. While using KB&M some of the controls function like you'd expect in some areas, but not others. For instance if you highlight \"Game Modes\" from the main menu & press \"Enter\", highlight 1 of 3 modes & press \"Enter\", now highlight a map & press \"Enter\". The \"Enter\" button will work the 1st 2 times. The map selection forces you to click on the map with your mouse. Why do the rules on a button change? Now try to use that steaming heap of crap called a Steam Controller & you add an entire layer of tweeking, because nobody could be bothered to deal with it beforehand. \n\nThese are just 2 problems I found in 30 minutes of play in \"Regular\" mode. I haven't even tried the other 2 modes, but I doubt these issues are not intrusive there as well.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1484697274, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1484981886, "recommendationid": "29326847", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493729", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463365788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561198095993700", "num_games_owned": 95}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "it is wierd", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463440265, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463440265, "recommendationid": "23029099", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486018", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448847920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 19, "steamid": "76561198048481084", "num_games_owned": 56}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Its casual so slow paced gameplay is expected but wow, that is almost something I would play to go to sleep, I like the consept but maybe add a game mode to spice things up, multiplayer racing maybe, or cannons + boats + multiplayer = online paper boat massacur xD I would play a game where I can play a paper boat version of a first person shooter xD or third person in this case.\n\nI would suggest this game if you like casual games.\n\nIf you don't like slow-paced games, this isn't for you", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448848540, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448848540, "recommendationid": "19379605", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488232", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480640896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 295, "steamid": "76561197964121070", "num_games_owned": 342}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Sometimes you're in the mood to play some video games, but you don't really want to deal with angry teammates and opponents telling you you're the scum of the earth and that you should garrotte yourself with a rusty paperclip.

Just listening to the flow of the river or whatnot is quite soothing and fits the game.\n- Fuck those mini-tornadoes on environment 2. Those do not help me relax at all.\n- Fuck that ultra-bright glare from the gold on environment 3. That hurts my eyes and doesn't help me relax at all.\n- I'm convinced that getting 3-star on two of the modes for environment 3 is actually impossible.
