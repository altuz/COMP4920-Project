Both players are integral to succeeding in the game.  You must work together, there is no way that a stronger player can get a weaker player through the game.  Success is dependant on both players equally.  I think this is the most enjoyable aspect of Red Rope, its one of the few co-op games available where you feel like a genuine team and you really do forge a bond while playing it... if you don't kill each other first!\n\nDefinitely my favourite local co-op game on steam.  If you have a couch co-op friend and are looking for a great game to play together you've got to give this one a try.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506112189, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506112189, "recommendationid": "35136960", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 24, "total_reviews": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
