Some stuff was VERY well hidden but the hints were helpful. The quest aspect was kinda cute too. I tend to like HOGs sothis was okay. It was good fun and didn't take too long to beat. \n\nDon't get it at full price though. Getting this on a sale is your best bet. \n\nOverall, average but okay.

The hidden object aspect was fun, and not too easy, with a few pieces extremely well hidden. The addition of the 'comics' and voice acting was nice, however the story was a dull and predictable 'save and marry the damsel in distress' that could be set anywhere at any time. Historical accuracy is not a feature of this game.\n\nPersonally, not recommended as there are other hidden object games on the market that are superior, despite this being a fun little distraction. It's not worth buying at full price, but as part of the Cradle Bundle - especially if said bundle is in a sale - it's a nice 'freebie'."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1293587875, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503143", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "1753865", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197997477460", "num_reviews": 40, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 11599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 513}, "timestamp_updated": 1391967573, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Hidden object game where the objects are actually hard to find, although a hint is almost always available if the stress of hunting for those hidden objects is too much for you to bare.
