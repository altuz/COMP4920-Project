While the game is enjoyable and has a few flaws. The biggest is how dying appears to remove all your powerups. Only after playing for a while do you realize certain items block this, and you don't actually lose everything. Still, even with a bubble around you there are still plenty of instant deaths it seems.\n\nThe game is rather short once you get the hang of it. There is no reason to use a weapon other than the knife, and the game is completeable with very few of the \"death\" upgrades. The bosses are zero challenge if you arrive at them with a 3-knife fully powered up.\n\nI like the secrets, including assembling the map. There does feel like something is a bit off though; on the first level if you find all the secrets you get a bonus heart. This doesn't appear to repeat on any other level of the game.\n\nThe hit-boxes of the monsters (for character contact) are unforuntately quite generous.

It is very well done, polished and generally fun. I agree with virtually everything the other positive reviews say.\n\nBut it is easily the most annoying game I have played in recent memory. \n\nEDIT: The last couple of patches have helped with several of the annoyances. \n\nLedges are *just* high enough that you can't shoot over them, so you have to double jump and shoot on the way down to hit something on a ledge.\n\nThe arrows shooting from the edges of the screen are completely unavoidable in many cases, sometimes even by design, unless you know where they are.\n\nThe floating books are usually just out of reach and a pain to hit.\n\nDon't get me started about the Tower of Patience.\n\nTake a look at my library. I have played and beat many \"hard\" games including Mr. Bree, Super Meat Boy, Bloody Trapland, etc. \n\nWhat you won't see there is many permadeath games. Even though this has lives, it's still game over when they are gone. This, coupled with the difficulty is just too much for me. I don't mind trying a level or boss 30 times. I do mind having to do the previous 6 levels over and over to do it.\n\nSo, given that I don't care for permadeath games, take my opinion for what it's worth. If you don't mind permadeath + lots of redoing of levels, it really is a fun game overall.\n\nEdit: I wanted to clarify that when all your lives are gone, it's not exatly \"Game Over\".

You collect treasure throughout the levels which are mostly randomly generated with secrets hidden within the levels such as more treasure, items, and rooms that can be very rewarding. Some items make your character more powerfully, move faster, or better weapons. Enemies have different ways for attacking you causing you to change your strategy all the time and even moving further through game it keeps getting harder to add more replay value. Boss fights are honestly not that well made and just feel like much more powerful versions of the regular enemies just given more health and different looks. You unlock skills just like in Rogue Legacy where evertime you die all the treasure you found throughout the playthrough can be used to unlock skills to make you more powerful in the next playthroughs.\n\nConclusion: Bard's Gold is a solid indie game that you should check out if you like games like Spelunky and Rogue Legacy.

Bard's Gold is no exception to that rule. When I first picked up my controller, I died nearly instantly. I felt silly, dying to a stupid bat, so I picked myself back up and went in again. I cannot tell you how many times I've died thus far, but I'm enjoying every obsenity-riddled moment of it. The slightly randomized feel to the levels helps you learn where secret treasures are, how to navigate through the obstacles, and ultimately, get your treasure so you can buy upgrades. I have found this much more enjoyable because there is a somewhat unpredictable nature to the levels themselves. The enemies are always the same, regardless of the layout, but each different scenario gives you a better idea of how to kill the monsters around you.\n\nGuidance-wise, there isn't much, other than some one-line remarks by the Bard (at the beginning of some levels); you basically have to charge in and hope for the best. The learning curve itself felt steep for me, at the very beginning, but after I was able to progress through a few levels (after a multitude of deaths), I became comfortable and was not losing my precious power-ups immediately after I had gotten them. Having the extra life skillbook from the beginning is very helpful, but I quickly became stumped while trying to locate others. It was slightly frustrating not knowing how to find other skillbooks; however, the emphasis on finding secret treasures was enough to overcome that obstacle.\n\nI cannot emphasize this enough: don't think you're done with the level simply because all of the enemies are dead and you have a key in-hand! If the timer isn't out, attack like crazy and try to find those secret treasures! \n\nThe platformer aspect of the game is enjoyable; it relates back to old-school platformers that I grew up with. I'm not sure if this is happening for everyone, but I have some moments when the double-jump seems to glitch a bit. It happens sporadically, and I'm playing on a relatively new controller. It is a little bothersome, but it's not enough to make me stop playing. That is really my only complaint so far, which says a lot about this game. It is a challenge and make you want to rip your hair out, but it is one of the more addictive games that Steam has to offer right now.

I was expecting a roguelike/roguelite platformer, which is what I received, to an extent.\n\nFrom what I read from other reviewers, it seems that this is the first game from the developer. This allows me to forgive some of the nuances with the mechanics that I found slightly frustrating. I wished that I could have a variable jump height instead of a static jump, but perhaps this was intentional. Some of the traps were near impossible, if not impossible, to dodge, due to this feature, as you'd have to eat the trap or ram your head into spikes. Additionally, I found the hitboxes a bit too large, especially the player projectile, hitting edges that I was clearly not contacting. Grievances aside, on to the review. I'm ignoring story because this is meant to be a roguelike, which I expect to have little or no story, which this has, and I am not disappointed, since this is not the main selling factor for a roguelike.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe controls are tight. The character slides slightly to slow down, which feels good and makes mastering the controls rather difficult. There are several traps both above and below you, as well as projectiles to watch out for from enemies, making it sometimes hard to focus on everything at once, which, in my opinion, is a good thing in this type of game. I did not like when spikes fell on my head from two screen lengths up, however, with no warning. I played on a keyboard. I do wish the controls were fully customizable. I suspect, as is described in game, that playing on a control is the desired method, and I would tend to agree. Enemies were simple, yet effective. The bosses had a bit to be desired. I found locations in which I was unhittable upon fighting one boss for my first time.\n\nI enjoyed that there were different weapons, however, I found the knife to be the most effective. The axe did not hit some enemies on the ground, making some situations impossible to get past because the enemy was in a small, unhittable location. I would have liked to see the weapons fleshed out a bit more.\n\nI will admit I did not spend much time on the books. I played the game starting on retro difficulty, then switched to hardcore after I died twice. I wish hardcore was harder. I do appreciate that the developer made the game difficulty available to a large audience. I did find it a little disappointing that hardcore did not allow you to spend your gems on upgrades, even if you could not use them in said difficulty.\n\nMusic/Sound:\n\nMusic had a nice feel to it, and the sounds were unintrusive.  I did find myself getting a little sleepy from how relaxing the music was, but this may have been because I was playing at 3AM.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe art in the game was decent. The levels themselves had a bit to be desired, but the character and his animations were pretty. The bosses looked as if they visually had a bit of work put into them. The graphics worked well for the game, with a few minor exceptions where I would miss an enemy because he would be blending into the background.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis game is a somewhat flawed roguelite, but has its positive aspects and is an admirable creation for a first game. I found the overall playstyle appeasing, but longed for a bit more depth and a bit more difficulty. I completed hardcore the first day I purchased the game. That being said, buying the game on sale for less than $5 is, in my opinion, worth it. I received probably about 4 hours of entertainment from the game before completing it on the hardest difficulty, and oddly enough, securing the first spot on the leaderboard, which I suspect is because there is little reward for playing on that difficulty aside from challenge. I may run through on retro to explore the skill books some more. I would say the average gamer would get about 6-10 hours out of this game if they chose to play on normal or retro, depending on skill.\n\nI hope to see more from the developer in the future.
