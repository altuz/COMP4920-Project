Gimmick here involves a pitch black screen with visibility in radius around protag square tile and some buttons you must push to make pipelines glow up parts of the level. Tight margins for platforming. Game uses a trampoline mechanic that is clunky and hard to execute correctly. Game is bland and boring with no world setting, protag design, foe design or anything interesting. Audio is okay but forgettable.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501182740, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501182775, "recommendationid": "33839383", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 24, "total_reviews": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
