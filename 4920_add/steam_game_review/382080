It needs some improvements though but overall, it's a pretty simple and fun game. All you have to do is find weapons and shoot the dinosaur looking aliens. Now let's get to the review part of this game!\n\nPros: Simple FPS, Upgraded/Gold Weapons, Perks to make your hero stronger and better\n\nCons: The dinosaur alien's death animation is really silly (especially when they fall to the ground and start shaking their body like the Harlem Shake and sometimes they do the Stanky Leg while dead. XD) \n\nAll in all, get this game only when it is heavily discounted.
