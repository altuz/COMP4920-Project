There is enough to keep it interesting as you move forward, although the levels themselves are procedurally generated, the found items unlock new vignettes as you finish the levels.\n\nThe story is about a person stuck in an endless cycle of nightmares and waking state, so the repetitive aspect fits.\n\nDespite that it is a fairly simple concept, I still want to keep playing it regularly, even after long breaks. \n\nWhen I saw that it was on sale for the price of a dog's breakfast, I thought it would be \"meh\" but it's actually quite good.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506628443, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506628443, "recommendationid": "35270673", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500039", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505570488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 232, "steamid": "76561198314008130", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I've previously played the first Dungeon Nightmares on my tablet, and I think the game is very scary and I like it too.
