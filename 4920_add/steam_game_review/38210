Lack of Xbox360 support and lack of resolution options seriously bring down the value proposition of this title. \n\nNo Target Audience: By the time a child can be trusted on a keyboard they would be edging out of the target demographic that is being targeted here making this a very unappealing title. \n\nEven if the non casual mode represents a higher difficulty the grainy resolution and sit-down-at-desk experience of a keyboard makes this not so compelling for a casual game for adults. The infantile skin of the game would rub most adults the wrong way when it comes to their self respect if they were to play this."}]}
