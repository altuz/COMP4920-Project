I love the art style and the 3 different abilities (well, 2 different abilities = the guy who collects water seems to be there to make the levels a bit longer and add a bit more difficultly) make for some fun puzzles. \n\nI do have some gripes though: On the technical side of things, Sometimes blocks you need to use to make jumps with some characters or in true platforming fashion use to weigh down pressure pads don't always respawn if you restart from a check point. Sometimes when you switch character you get a screen but no character - you can hear them moving about but you can't see them. From a game design standpoint it can get quite frustrating with the limited checkpoints redoing a lot of stuff especially if you die from slightly overjumping or underjumping onto (usually) a ladder. I guess once you familiarize yourself with where one \"block\" ends you can better judge if you've cleared the danger or not.\n\nFor less than \u00a33 this game is a steal, I've played far worse for far more!  That isn''t fair to it actually, at any price it is a genuinely fun experience and I'd definitely recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443416590, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443416590, "recommendationid": "18231785", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541045", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447116258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 516, "steamid": "76561197993837300", "num_games_owned": 2023}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "really cool game with the three characters mechanic , sometimes the jumps can be frustrating but the difficulty spike is good enough to bring quite an enjoyable adventure ,  im not a big platformer player but it was a good one   8/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447113132, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447113132, "recommendationid": "18978841", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502899", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
