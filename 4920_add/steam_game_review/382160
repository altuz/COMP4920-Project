Although the voice acting in the trailer on Steam sounds fine enough let me assure you the actual game's voice acting is BAAAAAAD. One of the early characters you encounter (who looks like a gruff, 50-60 year old male hobo) sounds like a 5 year old girl explaining something to you and the translation is so terrible that what they are saying doesn't even make sense. While this is funny to see, I was also simultaneously weeping that I had paid money to experience it.  \n\nThe voice acting and overall pace of the game may pick up later after you slog through the garbage introductory sequence, but for myself I couldn't even be bothered to sift through it too much. From what I remember the game uses a checkpoint save system as well, so if you find yourself stuck on a particularly annoying sequence but happen to exit before a checkpoint good luck accomplishing the same tasks again. \n\nI would only recommend this game to the most hardcore of fans of detective type storylines but be warned the product itself is very unpolished.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493695690, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503378440, "recommendationid": "31499255", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508894", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496845277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 82, "steamid": "76561198302317261", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "What is this thing?

(Even I could have written it better using my broken English)\n-Nonsensical puzzles \n-More bugs than a bethesda game on release \n-Quite nice hand drawn cut-scenes, which was obviously not made by the same people as the rest of this game, as the texts bobbles in these scenes features grammatically correctly written dialog, while the voice actors who are narrating the same scenes are still reading nonsensical dialog out loud. \n-Dreadful controls, which are barely tolerable while out in the open and nearly game breaking when moving in cramped spaces. \n-The music\u2019s nice though. \n\nHowever I also laughed out load many times. Below is a list of some of my favorite moments of the game (Spoiler Warning):\n\n-\tA NPC advices one of the protagonists to disguise himself as a \u201cBritish count\u201d (according to the subtitles)  which the voice actor pronounce as a \u201cBritish cunt\u201d\n-\tThe London eye appearing in one on the cut scenes, even though the game takes place in 1953.  \n-\tThe ending.
