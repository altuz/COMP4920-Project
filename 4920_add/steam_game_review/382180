This is a $2.00 game at best. Here's why:\n\nHorrible control scheme: 1 button to toggle your weapons, 1 button to toggle items, and both from the same inventory list. Should've just hotkeyed the 5 inventory slots, but the clumsy inventory scheme is possibly the only thing to make the game challenging.\n\nHorrible sound design. Awkwardly clumsy/loud footsteps, wildly varient levels if you simply turn in place. Stupidly loud security alarms. Bad choices for radios and televisions.\n\nHorrible level design: 1 bathroom, no shower, 3 bedroom, oversized-basement, open attic, thoughtless layout based on no home that exists in reality, sparcely and horribly furnished with little effort to make each room make sense or unique for its purpose.\n\nHorrible concept: you're supposed to run all over your house making guerrilla warfare against a ghost while leaving your vulnerable family to sleep defenselessly in 3 separate rooms, and the design is so lazy that your sleeping wife and daughter don't even sleep with their eyes closed.\n\nHorrible ghost: once you've encountered this ghost 2-3 times it becomes boring and predictable, and the only challenge is navigating the silly inventory scheme while said ghost smacks you around. \n\nHorrible menus: not enough options on graphics and the motion blur is overdone by default, and when your scenario ends it's hard to be sure what the outcome was, did you win, or did the ghost win? One second you're fighting the ghost, the next you're restarting from the beginning. I assume that means \"you lose\", but for all I know I've won the game half a dozen times.\n\nThis game provides a short-lived bit of mild jump scares...then it's just tedious and boring.

Maybe I beat on them during the daytime or something, and frankly, I'm not sure the encounters with the \"ghost\" aren't just in my own booze-addled head.  \n \n   Perhaps this was influenced by the Kubrick version of The Shining?  Only set in a \"regular\" suburban house with epic fountains out in the garden and what-not (like we all have).  Perhaps this is intended as a biting social commentary on the peculiar, first world-y madness which only upper middle-class families can generate for themselves, in a world where status creates stresses we neither need nor benefit from?  Or perhaps it's just another example of a horror \"game\" which serves as little more than an admittedly impressive \"showcase\" for the programming - if not exactly STORYTELLING - talents of its alleged \"developers\"?!  I mean, it's atmospheric and spooky and shite, but WHAT EXACTLY AM I SUPPOSED TO BE DOING?!?  \n \n   Let me put it another way:  Have a look at all the \"positive\" reviews for this game on the Store page - including mine! - and see how short all the playing times actually are.  If you find it on super-sale and fancy a quick, creepy fuck-around inside a small-but-spooky map, then go for it.  Just don't expect a proper \"game\" for your hard-earned cash.  Oh, what ambivalent times we live in:  So many horror games for those of us who covet such things, yet so few with anything one could describe as quality \"gameplay\".  Still, it is a great feckin' era for SHOWCASES, ennit?  Here's to the next generation of horror game designers progressing past the \"tech demo\" stage...character, story and gameplay, anyone?

Ghosts. Materialising at the foot of your bed at god knows what time in the morning, popping up behind you in the bathroom mirror as you're spitting out your mouthwash and for what? Usually because they have some right to wrong or they've been brutally killed and their murderer needs exposing or some such drivel. If any LIVE individual tried that nonsense, they'd be rewarded with a closed right across the jaw but, of course, ghosts sidestep the corrective beating they're owed by way of being intangible.\nWell, NO LONGER. I'm recommending Devilry largely for one reason and that is that it allows you to poison, stun and stab ghosts to death with a kitchen knife. If that sounds like the unwatchable finale to an American J-Horror remake then I am absolutely out of rebuttals but any game where I can use a beartrap to catch a ghost before smashing its face open with an axe is beyond any criticism you can level at its weak inventory system or suspect lighting points.\nYou can watch me catching my first ghost below.

The ambient sounds, and the visual effects all play with your mind. Your goal is to \"kill\" the ghost. Now just know that you cannot run up and simply kill it when you see it, you must track it using radios and wtching for visual queues as well. You get quite a few tools but you must search the house to find them first. IR and UV cameras, candles, flour, (yes, flour) poison, and bear traps are among the many things you'll find lying about at your disposal.\n\nThere are a number of different modifiers to play the game, like a timed mode, no candles, one hit, and so on, giving this game a fair amount of replayability. The gameplay can at times be quiet and slow and at other times, fast and frantic. I really recommend this game, especially for the price.\n\nThe menu and options menu could use a little work, adding more customizable graphics options and so on, maybe an FOV slider. Also when you die, it just automatically restarts the game. I'd like the option to quit or restart, so you for sure know you've failed, also a \"You've Died\" type screen would be a nice addition as well. Its only day one for this game so hopefully the dev will read this and consider adding some or all of these things. Other than these few small gripes an overall terrifying and fun game.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate: The last few patches have fixed pretty much every gripe that I had with the game, the loud footsteps are gone, the graphics options are more customizeable and an FOV slider has been added., along with other bug fixes.
