The Best $2 I've ever spent. When it was on sale for $1, I gifted it to all my friends.... So yes I recommend this game to a friend. I have played other Qix like games, but I think I like this one best. Mouse works just fine on this game, but I think using gamepad is better. And it has a Leaderboard which is nice.\n\nI think it has a good balance of difficulty, but I must say, save your coins for a time when you do need them.
