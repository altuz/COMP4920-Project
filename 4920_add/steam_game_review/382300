This game is just bad. The only good part of the game was chapter 1 and 2 the rest were just bad.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502221333, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502221488, "recommendationid": "34110564", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 45, "total_reviews": 97, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 52}}
