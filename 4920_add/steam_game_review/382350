It has all the foundation work to be good and fun and I'm sad that I have to struggle to find players to play. :( \n\nI am going to go ahead and recommend it based on my limited knowledge. It really looks like something people would gobble up if they either knew about it or were forced to play. It has great music, cute graphics and from what little I was able to play, it's a very fun and enjoyable experience.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506982102, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506982102, "recommendationid": "35429561", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499176", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 40, "total_reviews": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 30}}
