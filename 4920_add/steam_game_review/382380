Throughout the game we see the effects of the amber throne on the various races, whether they have had a chance to use it or not. It paints the throne as both good and evil in equal measures, though ultimately, it becomes clearer and clearer as the game progresses that the throne is more than what everyone assumes it is. Along the way you'll meet a colourful cast of characters, each one having varying stakes in the story. Some feel like the Vaan and Penelo of the story, having little reason to go to these insane lengths with a girl who can't even speak. But overall, the entire party fits well. The biggest thing the game has going for it plot wise, is the metaphors it presents throughout the game, I'd list an example, but I don't want to spoil anything. But suffice to say we get to see each nations wish twisted against them in some form or another, and the execution is beautiful for an indie title.\n\nThe combat is as traditional as it gets, turn based with menus. Its alot more streamlined than the classics though, instead of having everyone be able to equip all kinds of items and magic, each character has a list of skills they can unlock as they level up. With a set amount of these abilities being equippable to that party member at any given time, forcing you to pick and choose what way you want to specialize that character, but giving you the option to swap abilities out of combat whenever you like. You can have three of the roster of five characters you'll eventually have by the end of the game on the field at any one time, and can't swap them out mid battle. Each combination of characters works in different ways, since you could have all of the debuffers in one group, or the tank, glass cannon and taunting tank in another, and both will work. My personal favourite combo was tank, glass cannon and spellcaster/healer, but that didn't mean I didn't experiment and have fun while doing so. Combat itself is very fast, normally lasting between two or five rounds in random encounters, to about ten maximum for boss battles usually, with the animations for attacks being swift and visually impactful. What little grinding that you might want to do is made painless because of this.\n\nVisually speaking, the game is a mixed bag. Its all hand drawn, but not to an insane, breathtaking quality, at least not all the time. During combat, the art really stands out, both with your characters, and the enemy sprites. The cutscenes shift in quality, but for the most part they look very nice as well, using a slide show format with the text underneath, giving it a slight storybook feel. The overworld map and overworld sprites for everything are pretty simple, but they aren't bad by any means, nor are they good, they do their job and don't look out of place. Though, it is a bit annoying that the quality shifts so much throughout the game, with one part in particular with the final boss really looking like smudges across the screen. \n\nThe music of this game is very simple, no grand scores or epic pieces. To the end the tunes pick up the pace figuratively speaking and get much better, but for the most part the music does its job and it does it fairly well.\n\nOverall I love this game, its everything I could possibly want from a classic inspired RPG, with some added depth. It isn't an RPG in the sense of dialog options or massive impactful choices, but in terms of combat and character developement. The story is what you'd expect from a classic RPG, but with alot more connectivity and substance. You aren't going from one place to another, doing things to get four crystals of the elements, or stop the evil emperor, or save the princess. You have a goal, and everything you do revolves around it, every boss you fight is directly tied to the main plot. Everything, revolves around the Amber Throne. The best comparison I can think of is Chrono Trigger, minus the time travel. While not as perfect as CT, Amber Throne manages to really be a retro rpg, and something much more at the same time. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of classic Final Fantasy style games, or titles similar to them.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500041573, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500041573, "recommendationid": "33536744", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1476262362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1222, "steamid": "76561198056701760", "num_games_owned": 390}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is beautiful.
