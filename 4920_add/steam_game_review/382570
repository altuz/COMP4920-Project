The game seems to be influenced from classic titles such as Orcarina of Time on the N64.\n\nThe game took me about 3-4 hours to finish, although short I do highly recommend purchasing this game.\nIt seems basic at first but give it a chance and you find yourself pleasently suprised with what it offers you.\n\nSo after starting (I won't ruin the other thing that happens :P) you will find yourself feeling like Link, minus the green, the sword, the flute, and you seem to be a bigger version of his fairy.\nAlot of the beginning if traversing through some basic landscapes and getting introduced to the controls and certain elements of the game you will be seeing.\n\nAfter a while you will notice you are picking up some glass wings that Mayfly lost in the beginning, collecting a number of these will start to give Mayfly some interesting abilities. A good point to make it once you acquire a new ability, you will find you need to use it quite often, unlike other typical games where you may only use it for the area you are in and then barely ever again. I find it nice where the game will build on what you have and force you to use everything to get further.\n\nUsing 'tools' you will find along the way you will be required to use them to help you solve some puzzles and continue through the game. You cannot put away items and you can only hold one item at any given time. Be aware that certain moves will cause you to drop your weapon, which is a nice feature.\n\nPuzzles in the game are pretty clever and fun to interact with, I found myself rather impressed by a few of them. They will make you uses tools as often as possible, one in particular has a feature I didn't expect.\n\nThe landscape has some elements that will block your path or try to hinder you in certain scenarios, you will come across electric orbs and flooring, sludge, thorns and a couple of others. In certain scenarios they will be more annoying that others.\n\nMonsters in this game are all dino-like, and they vary a little bit. Every monster is this game has aim hax (not kidding xD), stay clear as much as you can, although they will come for you within a certain distance. You can kill monsters (more effort than it's worth), but after a while you do get a nice health bar, also there is plenty of health around so you shouldn't die to monsters really.\n\nThe game's landscapes and levels are very nice and well thought out. The music is very nice to listen to and I found that each track suited the part of the game it was assigned to. Also I found the boss monster to be very impacting on this game, it made me want to run away all the time, maybe due to the first encounter you have with it.\n\nOverall I think this is a very nice game to play and you really feel you are playing something from the 90's, if you grew up in that period of time you will really enjoy this.\n\n\nPros\n+ Simple game that feels like a blast from the past.\n+ Will keep you playing, keeps adding new elements to stop the repetitive feeling.\n+ Interesting move set which you will enjoy using.\n+ Easy controls\n+ Great soundtrack\n+ If you grew up in the 90's you should enjoy this\n\nCons\n- Monsters hack :(\n- The big monster also hax ;__;\n- I got some slow down, usually when initially running the game, doesn't ruin the experience though.\n- A single glitch is on the 3rd last section, there is an error message and you will not lose progress.\n- If you are a graphics gamer (you know who you are) you might not appreciate this game.\n\n8/10 :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435282135, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435303330, "recommendationid": "16710644", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565389", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435392827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 190, "steamid": "76561198011614926", "num_games_owned": 645}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Initially, Glass Wing failed to live up to my already low expectations, but all that changed once I found the scythe. The primary use of the scythe is to hack away tall grass which, paired with the pots and the health icons, makes it clear that the game was heavily inspired by the Legend of Zelda series.\n\nGlass Wing alternates between tricky platforming sections and \"find the proper tool for the job and figure out how to use it\" puzzles. Some of the platforming sections took me more than one attempt, but they weren't frustratingly difficult. As you progress through the game, you gain new platforming abilities, and since the developers know you have the ability, they designed the rest of the game with them in mind which makes things trickier as you go.\n\nAs for the puzzles, some took me a while to figure out and started to cause frustration, but once I figured out the solution they seemed rather clever. There are also monsters and they can be killed, but there is little point in doing so and they do not go down easy, so it's best to do as the game says and avoid them.\n\nThere are no collectibles or extra routes, so you're likely only going to make one run through and that should only take a few hours (less than 5). Still, I had fun during my time with the game, so if you aren't scared off by the visuals being what they are or the risk of finding the puzzles to be \"too obtuse\" rather than \"clever,\" Glass Wing may be worth a go.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435387084, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435505983, "recommendationid": "16734297", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520029", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443569437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 73, "steamid": "76561198107448894", "num_games_owned": 166}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "No, I don't recommend this game. Quite possibly the only thing good about this game is the music and the main character design- and perhaps how it forces the player to explore and learn the ropes of the game, but it doesn't explain ANYTHING to you, the only brief explanations you get in a sentence or two in the start about how to jump and change the camera a bit, and maybe how to use the powerups you get throughout the game. When fighting mobs, I wasn't sure if I was ever even doing damage, and I'm still not sure- even though one of the items you can pick up is a sword. The physics of this game are wonky, and the jump is odd as you can get to areas you're clearly not supposed to get to without an item once you get certain powerups. I would not find it surprising if someone had to watch a guide on how to do a few of the puzzles, as some of them are quite bizarre, like the one with the spear and the plant. The character doesn't really match in with the areas, which is okay, I wasn't too picky about it. The platforming is terrible in this game, to be honest... The camera never wants to show you exactly what you need to jump to next- and you need to jump quickly in some areas, and the platforms always move too quickly, meaning you need to have a fast reaction speed or alot of patience, becuase you will end up doing the same things multiple times.  5.5/10, a decent way to spend an hour or two of time if you don't mind getting scared by loud noises in the first three minutes of the game.

I would, and DO recomend this game! The artwork is beautiful, I have always loved the older game styles of the N64 and the GameCube, and this game brings that back to us. As someone has already stated, the AI is a little overkill, but that's like that for a reason.\n\nNow like any game it has its kinks, and not any of the good kinds. The controls were a little wonky for the keyboard at least. Let me tell you now that H is the use key (there may have been other keys for the use button! I just got frustrated at not finding them quick enough and changed them quickly), and like most Indie games, it's not flawless and its definately not seemless. However even the fact that it's not seemless brings back some old memories of how the older games used to be made. Also like most Indie games, from what I gather, this is also a fairly short game. \n\nNow the wonky controls can easily be changed. When you go to start up the game it will ask you if you want to start the game or configure controls. BE WARNED! When you change your controls, it wasn't set up 100% accurately. When you assign the Left and Right keys, switch them around. It assigns the Left key to the right and vice versa. \n\nSo whether it be for nostalgia of older style games, the art work, looking for a puzzle and/or platformer, or even just looking for a game to blow your last $5 on, I highly recommend this game!\n\nOne last bit of advice if you get the game, Look everywhere, Avoid everything.\n\nFinal Rating 9/10\n\nNote to Developer: This game truely is amazing, music included. If you could put out a soundtrack for sale that would be fantastic! And thank you SOOOO MUCH for puting this game out! This really is a piece of art!

There is no point to change the controlls anyway, it doesn't seem to keep the changes you make (Scratch that! It was user error not game error!).

Glass Wing was a rather interesting game. I found out about this game awhile back when I was watching a podcast with DrWolf001 and he mentioned playing the voice of the antagonist Ferace. Was debating whether or not to get it, and decided to get it in the end. \n\nBefore I get into the review, I strongly recommend to play this with a controller. I used a Dualshock 3 controller to play this and it worked perfectly.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, this game was rather interesting. You play the role of the Glass Wing Mayfly who is trying to get away from the demon Ferace, after he attempts to capture you. During the course of the game, you find various tools as well as unlock new abilities in order to progress through each map. The game is composed of several maps with puzzles as well as platforming stages.\n\nOne of the interesting concepts I found while playing is the use of tools and the \"combat\". The game strongly advises against fighting the monsters that roam around the game (The game description mentions Mayfly being very weak and not suited for combat) thus the tools you find around the game are instead used for exploring. Each tool has a purpose for getting around (this includes using a scythe to cut down plants, a sword for cutting thorns, a hammer for smashing certain blocks, etc.)\n\nThe music in this game was actually really nice to listen to. I actually recognized a few of them as several of the tracks used are from the artist Makkon, an artist who once did pony music (A Waltz for Trixie and Hallowed Waltz being the two used that I recognized).\n\nOne of the main gripes I had while playing this game was surprisingly not the controls, but the platforming levels (or Twilight Trials as they're called). I got through the first Twilight Trial perfectly fine, but aftwards they just got really painful to do. These levels were rather punishing if you fall off because you would have to start all the way back at the beginning. (This really isn't too horrible, but it gives me nostalgic moments of when I played games like Super Mario Sunshine and having to play those FLUDD-less platforming levels)\n\nAnother minor gripe I had involved the final segment of the game. There is a glitch that causes Mayfly to fall through the map should you die and try to reload the file. This was fixed by simply closing out of the game and reloading the save. Minor, but really annoying.\n\nOverall, I thought this game was a mixture of interesting and frustration. I enjoyed the interactions with Mayfly and Ferace and I rather enjoyed solving the puzzles (I'm still surprised I managed to beat this without consulting a guide... actually I couldn't find a guide for this game. Might write one up in the future if I feel like playing through again.) Would I recommend this game to anyone? Maybe... Maybe not... Depends on one's patience threshold as this game rather tested mine at some points, but it was rather satisfying when I managed to get past said points.\n\nRating: 7/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456121610, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1458441349, "recommendationid": "21380561", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499464", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439264228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 134, "steamid": "76561198113509656", "num_games_owned": 105}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It is a very cute game.

That said - there is stuff that can *easily* kill you. The game is largely casual and laid back but some of the puzzles may have you pulling your hair out if you can't time jumps like a pro.\n\nSpeaking of Jumps: The game has a bit of a blessing and a curse when it comes to them, yes there is manual jumping (ie pressing Space to Jump etc) but there is also tied into the root game a feature which can make you jump automatically as you near places where it might be viable; this is both good and bad - it's good because it hints at the fact you make a jump here - it's bad because the game often mis-times the jumps automatically and you end up having to compensate.\n\nNot spoiling too much - the fact is I haven't played it very long at this point but I'm enjoying it regardless.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444423211, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444704403, "recommendationid": "18401203", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496668", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460834097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 49, "steamid": "76561197990093202", "num_games_owned": 757}, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Scythes are for cutting grass, silly!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435885206, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1435885206, "recommendationid": "16853106", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484902", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1435803666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198050929976", "num_games_owned": 254}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "4", "review": "*Revision from earlier. Was too salty to make a properly structured review.\n Anyway. The controls felt slippery, optimization was terrible as it ran at 15 fps on my end and didnt go any higher. Vsynch was nonexistant.
