There are weapons and items for only people who decide to spend real life money and there is an option to just buy stuff with in game currency, which frankly not much people do besides me and others. I can beat a P2W player any day with just an AUG A3 ( which is a credit gun that does not involve real cash ). \n\nMoral of the story?

Old characters are still there along with a few new ones and the same weapons are there along with a few new ones too. Many people argue whether or not it's a pay to win game. In some way it is however, buying ingame items with real money doesn't give you a massive advantage. You can still obtain weapons as good as the ones you have to pay for, for example the AUG A3. Unfortunately you have the grind the shit out of this game in order to get it.\n\nOverall, Piercing Blow is a decent Free To Play FPS and it's worth a try I suppose.
