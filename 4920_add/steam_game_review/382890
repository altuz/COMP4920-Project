(I know I began dumb but whatever.)\n\nThis is not a review. This is a request. Final Fantasy 5 is my favourite Final Fantasy. Second after Final Fantasy X. I love the Android version and I'm fine with updated graphics. I want to play this game on PC. But I can't reccomend it. Why? Simple. I can't play it. Literally. The Reason? It's simple. Crash on encountering some/all non-English letters in the Windows profile path. Look, SquareEnix. If there is an entire post considering bugs and solutions to them about one particular game (http://steamcommunity.com/app/382890/discussions/0/487870763294376234/) then why won't you fix them? And why literally ALL OTHER games in the world work EXCEPT my favourite Final Fantasy? I want to reccomend this game, Square! Fix this big problem! I will reccomend this game, but only if I'll be able to play it! I hope SquareEnix will see this request (of course they won't) and will do something with it! I seriously sat 5 minutes on a launcher just to be able to write this request!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505231073, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505231155, "recommendationid": "34903584", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510030", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 207, "total_reviews": 297, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 90}}
