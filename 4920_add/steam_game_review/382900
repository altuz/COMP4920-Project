Amazing story, combat and boss fights. Easily one of my favorites in the series.\n\nThings to note about the steam version in particular:\n\n- Download the mod to remove the horrible filtering they use. Google \"FF6 Remove Bilinear Filter\".\n- It has the extra content that is included in the GBA version which is new optional bosses and espers!\n- Has the new iOS version interface. I hated it at first but got used to it eventually and now I don't mind it at all.\n-  Has an auto-battle mode which makes everyone continually do the last action they were given (at times this can be abused, such as with Sabins Blitz actions). Makes the game way more enjoyable and makes some of the optional grind sections much more bearable (especially when trying to get the Paladin Shield).\n\nAll in all, it is an excellent way to play the game, I highly recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506267768, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506267768, "recommendationid": "35184121", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516178", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 404, "total_reviews": 529, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 125}}
