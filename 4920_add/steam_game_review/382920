Because although I may not be the best at puzzle games, I lost intrest in both the the story and actually wanting to move forward in the game after about the first 10 levels. If this game was either free or had more time put into it, I would have considered continuing, but I couldn't bring myself too. However, if you really are set on buying this game for yourself, then you should. But speaking for me and many others I know this game was reccomended for, I just don't think it was worth the $5.00 we all spent.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495922749, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495922749, "recommendationid": "32006583", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500860", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492989352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 28, "steamid": "76561197976114663", "num_games_owned": 907}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Interesting puzzle mechanic, that is absolutely mindbending.
