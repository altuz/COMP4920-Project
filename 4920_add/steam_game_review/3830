You start off with pretty much no psychic ability and slowly set out to learn new abilities as they become necessary for the tasks presented to you. Before you know it you have a slew of abilities and a clear end goal in sight. The transition from worthless Psi-cadet to full-on Psychonaut is the smoothest progression I've ever seen in a video game. I had a hard time discerning where the tutorial-type levels ended and the game truly began because none of it actually felt like a tutorial.\n\nThere were only 3 aspects about this game I did not like. I didn't enjoy having to mine for arrowheads in order to get the cobweb duster. I did not at all like the Milkman brain level, mostly because of the contorted world but also because I felt it was a poorly designed level. I didn't enjoy climbing the meat circus to protect Little Oly since he tended to die before I could reach him. The Meat Circus level would have been much better if you had more time to complete the level."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506317207, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35196798", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198069470812", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506402737, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 72, "playtime_forever": 578}, "timestamp_updated": 1506317207, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Definitely one of my favorite games from my childhood.

The beginning serves as a tutorial on how to platform, explore and use your powers etc.. so don't be discouraged by the slow start.
