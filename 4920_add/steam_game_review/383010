Being a massive fan of Ballance, I was hoping that this game would be able to rival it.  Whether that is the case or not we will probably never know since development on it seems to have long stopped.\n\n+Game currently loads up and doesn't crash while playing (which is more than can be said for some so called finished games).\n+The game gets very difficult very quickly in a mostly makes you stop and think way, not a die 1000 times way.\n+While there is not much to see in the game visually (it's mostly water with a blue sky), what is there is high quality.\n\n-Menu options are bare bones and resolution settings do not work.\n-If you are not one for thinking the difficulty may be too much and could cause you to give up within an hour.\n-A couple of puzzles do require pin point accuracy (although they are further into the game).\n-Reached a point in the game where I am stuck (may be the point where the dev stopped working on the game).\n\nDespite the fact this looks like it will never come out of early access, I am still giving this a thumbs up because what is here provides a great challenge.\n\n7/10\n\nAlso will ammend this review if anymore progress is ever made with the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1480440533, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1480443743, "recommendationid": "28075211", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508358", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451106050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 138, "steamid": "76561198058641616", "num_games_owned": 146}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Crashes Steam when you start it up. \n10/10 \"You can refund it.\"", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451101028, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1451101028, "recommendationid": "19949168", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484660", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436866013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561197996985879", "num_games_owned": 1128}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This and similar games represent what's wrong with early access.
