There's glimmers of potential here and there, but have been sorely wasted.\n\nThe gameplay loop is very... Limited, with the player directing around handfuls of ships at a time to try and either complete an objective, or last a minute. Many objectives don't clearly state which is your end goal, unfortunately. One of the common encounters, a scouting party, simply says your under attack. If you wipe out the initial forces, and wait around, some more will show up. If you leave, there's no indication that you've failed, or that it was expecting you to leave.\n\nThe scale is also unfortunately limited. while I can understand putting a cap on capital ships, the game will also cap your fighters, and automatically decommission some, without player input on which, if you jump with what it deems to be too many. This limit isn't accurately indicated, as you can have more fighters than the build menu permits you to make with no warning (And it'll happen frequently as ships join your fleet). The straight render distance is also limited. While it makes sense that fighter craft get reduced to icons easily, larger capitol ships will quickly vanish out to be replaced with a small icon when the camera is still quite close.\n\nThere's also no real meta or planning to your jumps. Whenever you do jump, your options are to jump to an unknown location, or home. No way whatsoever to attempt to control your goal. Not that resource management is very important either, I'm afraid, as fuel and salvage are both completely abundant. As long as you don't get your flagship too beaten up before you get more capital ships, your pretty much set for the rest of the game, especially as your home base generates passive income every jump.\n\nUltimately, the game has bones, but it doesn't have any meat. What little exists is solid, more or less, but there's just so little depth or content to any of it, at all.\n\n4/10: The game works, runs well, but doesn't really deliver on any of its potential at all.

Not true, you jump from small arena box to small arena box with no choice except Unknown or Homebase (Probes and research eventually open this to 3 choices or home). Still just little arena boxes though.\n\nEverything always starts off within shooting range, no time to really move your fleet, no need/use for any form of tactical play, launch fighters, set weapon power to max, fight with a bad UI to click ships and launch missile/plasma/whatever abilities. (The arena boxes and this bit are why this feels so much like a tablet game).\n\nAll that said though, when this game is on sale for a few bucks it may still be worth your time.

As a fan of BSG, and especially the tension of \"33\", I'm happy this game is here. That said, as things stand, it's very clear it's still in Alpha. Tooltips say things like \"We can put text here in a smaller font\". Ships have command buttons (like fire turrets/fire missiles) which are duplicated in x & y axis, and yet pushing on either of them does nothing. Which is the basic problem it has as things stand, the only button which obviously does anything is 'jump'. That does jump you to a new sector. But when you get there, there may or may not be friendly ships there. If there are, there's no obvious way to tell (if you hang in battle for a while, you may suddenly read '1611 civilians killed'). The first couple of systems, you're likely to find civilians, take them back home, they unload, then.... there's no running count of how many you have, how many you need. When you jump to a new sector, there's no sense of progression, either that you have to search a certain number, or travel a certain distance (as you're always 1 jump from Home Base). There's no obvious way to tell ships to fire on other ships (whilst you can left click on your ships to get their name/health, and left click enemy ships to see likewise, does left clicking yours then left clicking theres order targetting? Or, rather, is it meant to? As it doesn't appear to.) Rather than the normal convention of middle wheel zooming, middle wheel switches between your ships. Not sure if zooming is possible, or if that's what's meant to happen when you push mouse to top of screen. If you jump to a supply depot, and destroy all the enemy... did destroying the ships get you the supplies the system had? There seems no way to take the fuel & metal on board. I don't know if it was supposed to happen automatically in battle, if a 'get resources' system is to be implemented later, or what.\n\nAll in all, after a few hours, I'm rather bemused.

From what was initially an interesting take on \u201cBSG\u201d\u2019s episode \u201c33\u201d (the first episode of Season One), where you must enter a sector of space and rescue transports and/or engage enemy supply stations/fleets.

Next, full-fledged missions are being implemented. With each patch/build, and they are fast and furiously with these, the Devs not only welcome feedback but actively seek it, so much so that the game feels very much like a community-driven project. And the game just keeps improving as a result. The graphics, using the Unreal 3 Engine can look ark and a little \u2018muddy\u2019 at times, but even these are being constantly tweaked and addressed. I don\u2019t remember even \u201cHomeworld\u201d receiving this much love when it first came out, and many gamers caved on that title as the difficulty wore on many gamers. There are challenges with this title too, bugs at first, but now an efficient and often tricky A.I. There have been hurdles yes, but as the game keeps growing these are dealt with leading this very long time gamer actually excited to see what is coming next.

A cockpit view for certain ships adds some immersion.\n\nYou will see the same missile patterns, explosions, and \"jump / warp\" animations, but the initial effects are all pretty cool. The game depicts desolate, never-ending space well, however their could be more planets and other outer space phenomena scattered around the sectors to appear more immersive... \n\n[b][u]GAMEPLAY[/u][/b]\nA rogue-like gameplay progression as you jump to subsequent sectors deciding whether to return to home base and salvage what you have acquired (and take a break to repair with your constantly-changing fleet..) or continue making jumps to different situations (akin to DarkStar One's sector jumping, arriving, being attacked immediately etc..) adds some panicked moments trying to take down an opposing fleet, as you wait for your abilities to level up. \n\nTo level abilities such as your fleet's shields or to unlock new fighter jets, repair freighters, and the ability to see a description of where you are next jumping to are all unlocked via \"X number of sector jumps\" so say I want higher shields on my capital ships, it will take 5 sector jumps to complete the ability unlock, to finish unlocking the ability I will have to endanger myself by doing a numer of sector jumps, and with no traditional save feature I may jump to a situation that wipes me out before the ability is finished researching.\n\nThe random encounters you have as you progress with subsequent jumps provide the opportunity to rescue other freighters and capital ships along the way, who join and expand your fleet.\n\n[b][u]BAD STUFF[/u][/b]\nThe capital ships / corvettes / stations all move fairly clunkily it seems, beyond making sweeping moves toward their waypoints. Some enemy ships snag on one another goofily (it seems to be the same model that it happens to..) and then neither is able to move anymore so you can wipe them both out fairly easily. Suffice to say the game has its share of jankiness.   \n\nI still find combat in the game a bit confusing overall as to whether my ships are actually attacking whom I'm telling them to, beyond a vague \"Direct (Unit) Fire\" option on each of your constructed fighter jets, there isn't much indication that ships are going where you've told them to beyond watching if the swarm of fighters approaches the other capital ships etc. Though I haven't played the game a ton, so maybe I am missing an indicator. \n\nSome voice acting would have been nice, as it is present in the studio's other title Battle of Sol so its absence here is a bit strange. The UI is simple and effective.\n\n[b][u]OVERALL[/u][/b]\nOverall, for all the game offers and with its modest pricepoint, it maintains my interest for longer than many other space games. What is present may be a bit thin on complexity and the graphics ~could~ use a little more polish or higher rez/more effects /lights etc... what is present is quality entertainment, especially if you are a fan of deep space sci fi / capital ship battles and the like.\n\nI picked up this game on sale for only 1.99 after having played its other separate / side game the Battle of Sol ( a game in the same universe I also recommend but with strictly space flight combat, no RTS, and chapter-based storylines..) . After finding the storyline behind Battle of Sol and the overall gameplay to be enjoyable I figured I would give this one a try as well. At first after playing briefly I feared the game would be way too complex and heavy into tutorials and micro managey bullshit that often plagues other \"Space Strategy\" games for me, as I prefer them to be a little more straight-forward ala Colony Wars/Rogue Galaxy/DarkStar One etc...\n\nHowever, as I'm not often a big fan of RTS games I found this game to have the right pacing between letting the battles happen and just admiring the visuals of the units themselves. In many other RTS games I find I spend a ton of time zoomed way too far out just staring at bland icons meant to represent my massive fleet moving through space. Thankfully this game includes simple camera controls with mouse and keyboard that allow you to navigate the action and repair your capital ships as needed. Controller support seems limited and like a wack way to play this particular game, which is more a result of the genre than by bad programming from the developers per se. (i.e. the Battle of Sol spinoff game by the same dev has better controller fluidity, but is a space combat / pilot game, not RTS)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489357556, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489357730, "recommendationid": "30480782", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498870", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490431855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 246, "steamid": "76561198087612588", "num_games_owned": 195}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This one is a bit of a tough sell... It has gorgeous pew-pew cinematic moments, so if you're looking for a gorgeous pew-pew cinematic moment generator, this is the game for you. \n\nIf you're looking for deep, engaging, or strategic gameplay, thoug, this won't be your beast. The controls just feel a little sluggish, and overall the game feels unfinished. That's a shame too, because the combat presentation is absolutely gorgeous. \n\nSo should you buy it? Look- its like this. This game isn't polished, and it isn't perfect, but for the sale price I say yes, even if thats just to support the development team with a teensy weensy bit to motivate them to make something else. With a little love and a little care this could be a great game. Hopefully the devs will keep the series going and put a little more depth into the fleet side of this Sol series.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489031958, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489032137, "recommendationid": "30402319", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497548", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1470081371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3008, "steamid": "76561198113058856", "num_games_owned": 15}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "THIS GAME NEEDS TONS OF WORK.THE SOUND AFFECTS ARE BAD.YOU GET THROUGH PART ONE OF THE GAME IT WONT LET YOU ADVANCE TO PART TWO", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1465470059, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1465470059, "recommendationid": "23466247", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485984", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499296831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 110, "steamid": "76561198006653773", "num_games_owned": 54}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": "5", "review": "Game has improved a lot over the last time I played.
