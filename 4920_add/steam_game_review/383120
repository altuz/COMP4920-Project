The building system is well designed and allows for an incredible amount of creativity.  Combat is standard FPS and works well.  Learning curve is almost perfect.  \n\nTBH, the game is best explained through a story of what happened:\n\nBuddy and I were getting bored and decided to go riding in a capital ship.  Found an enemy strong hold.  attack it with him in the capital ship and myself flying escort in a fighter I built.  We manage to takedown an enemy Cargo Vessel.  He goes in to loot it while I provide cover outside fighting off waves of incoming drones.  \n\nAfter wards, we attack the station it was headed for.  It was surrounded with little defense satellites that we couldn't damage for some reason, so we opted for a straight on assault.  I flew in, blasted open some doors and returned to the Capital ship.  We load in to the shuttle, and I fly us straight in through the now open hangar doors.  We jump out, secure the area, then proceed to secure the entire base and loot.  Then on our way out, the freighter we had attacked self-destructs as we are flying past it.\n\nSeriously.  Coolest game ever.

I dunno, something low, like late 2015 when I bought it. My only real experiences have been co-op multiplayer with 1 other person, but it's pretty great for that. I think if you had a bigger group of people working together it could be even better.\n\nIt's sci-fi Minecraft with a little less random digging and a little more purpose / tech-progression. The whole thing has a bit more of a learning curve, from using constructors to finding the right resources to figuring out how to scavenge points of interest to figuring out how to make a ship that doesn't look like butt. I just completed my longest \"playthrough\" which was number 3 or 4 I believe, and after another big patch or two will probably go for the next one.\n\nIt is still early access, and despite the constant patches and addition of various things, I feel like it is progressing a little slower than I would have expected. Also, I'm worried that the inclusion of PvP is going to hamper the PvE experience (it already is to some extent) and hope that they can work PvP to be more isolated from the main game, maybe even making the rules of the game different depending whether PvP is enabled or not. \n\nI've put 120 hours into it as of this review, and they've been almost all good hours.

This review is mostly considering single player experience.\n\nI bought Empyrion a way back when there was only few things to offer even then it had the feel of large planets and endless possibilities. Nowadays Empyrion offers about 10 or so star systems with different kind of planets, a lots of crafting and building, few places of interest, blueprints, lively workshop community and lots of more. So there's plenty of stuff to love.\n\nDesigning, crafting and building different kind of ships are just plain fun. I've spent hours to mine iron to get enough minerals for my plans. With the little experience, you start seeing good and bad designs in vessels. When you start a new ship, you get plenty of nice ideas that you want to see in action. Building capital ship gives an nice perspective, because you think that this time my ship is going to be huge, it will be relatively small. On the other hand it is so nice to get a compact model to work for you, without being total chaos. With texture & color tool you can make your signature touches to your creation.\n\nAfter all it is so great to take your brand new toy to a test drive trough space. Get some rare minerals so that you can improve your ships even more.\n\nso what's missing?\n\nI remember the excitement when my capital vessel took off from the home planet and punctured the clouds for the first time. I saw a endless space with endless adventures ahead. At that point I was already bored to my home planet. At first I got to the moon. I thought everything would be different when I get to the surface, gravity, feel of being in a thin ice, different consistency of the stone.. well, everything on the moon was pretty much like back in the home except that moon didn't have any breathable air. (And it was little bit colder.)  Same thing happened when I got to the other planets of the other systems. I think my biggest disappointment was to realize that all the flora and fauna similar in every planet, no matter how far you go you always get aloe vera and corn.\n\nThis same thing happens with micro scale too. Every biome in every planet has always same kind of plants. so planets itself don't invite you to explore anything exept POIs. And POIs on the other hand are pretty much the same in every planet. Some planets have different levels of difficulty, but character-wise they are images of the easier ones.\n\nOther thing that makes me hate this game is overall clumsiness in textures, creature design, plants and so on. The sounds are little bit weird too. Like, drilling sound, for example. Drill sounds like it has few loose parts, it needs to be oiled real bad. Sound gets very irritating after 15 minutes. It's kind of okay for the tier 1 drill because you get that one for free. And it encourage you to get better equipment faster, but in tier 2 I really expect to get a drill with nice smooth sound, nope, it is the same sound. Also the sound of the automatic turrets are so loud that you hop in air every time they start shooting some random beast somewhere. Controls happen to have similar issues. The game has a good signal system, which provides a possibility to control you vessel better, and in a creative way. In order to use those buttons you need to open menu and use your mouse for that. Would be nice to use hot keys so that in fights you could open weapons hatches, change colors in your cockpit, do things that is actually possible to do, but without proper controls pointless. Motorcycles and hover vessels glides like hell and sometimes you cannot stop them. As I described the sounds of drills earlier, I think it's okay to have bad controls if you plan your ship that way. But it really needs an alternative.\n\nFortunately, developers in this game are being active. And they tend to improve things that matter the most. For example newest version of the game (7.0.0 experimental) gives a opportunity to make planets by hand (a big improvement to seed-based system). Mineral system took a big leap forward too. The beginning of the game needs nowadays more survival skills. Textures and graphics have improved a lot within a year.\n\nI have high hopes that some day I will see variation in flora and fauna in different planets. I also hope that some day small low-end vessel feels different to fly than huge planetoid-size flying mega bases. Maybe in near future swamps have their own characteristics, like little frogs and flies and deserts burns hot. I dream that the game itself encourages me to build a well thought base where I could hang out and feel being safe from the rest of the cruel world. Maybe one day I find more motivation to do something else than build a ship after ship, have an adventure, have a npc-driven quest in a local settlement. Have a reaction from the natives when I arrive to a local shop for the first time. I want to get into a trouble when a loot someones private home, use her shower and eat her food.\n\nBefore that I just keep building my ships isolated from the rest of the world (and be rather happy of doing so).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506609009, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506609009, "recommendationid": "35263264", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506843792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 921, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3757, "steamid": "76561198259862451", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "review": "I Loved this game it is one of the Best games i have ever played it is so much fun building and fighting and flying your spaceships\n\ni think it would be alot more popular if it was a little cheaper", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505808745, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505808745, "recommendationid": "35060090", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505519326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14577, "steamid": "76561198058927302", "num_games_owned": 63}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Exploring Multiple Planets Without A Load Screen.
