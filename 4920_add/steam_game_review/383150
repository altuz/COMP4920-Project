I'm glad I stuck with the game and decided to put off reviewing it for a while until I thought I had enough time invested into it. \n\nI have never played the original dead island up until this point. I played through riptide on console (back when I was unaware of the inferiority consoles suffered from compared to pc gaming) and had an absolute blast! I don't know, I guess I just really love killing things.\n\nAnyway, I picked this one up when it was on sale for 6 dollars. As I stated earlier, it starts out painfully slow. Every single mission feels the exact same... It's always the \"get this, go back to ____.\" However, after a while of doing the shitty boring missions, some really exciting gameplay begins to ensue! More types of zombies begin to appear, better and new kinds of loot begin to appear, new areas open up, and missions get much less tedious and much more fun. I'm currently 12 hours in and only 50 percent through the storyline, which is another pro in my opinion. I'm getting tired of typing so let's do it this way:\n\nPros:\n-Extremely fun combat.\n-Diverse characters (Though I almost exclusively play Logan.)\n-Huge skill trees.\n-Lots of loot (Similar to bl2... and if you're a true friend of mine you'll know that I fucking love bl2.)\n-Lots of different types of enemies.\n-SO MANY WEAPON MODS.\nCons:\n-The game starts out DREADFULLY slow.\n-Driving is a pain in the ass. (Though to be fair, a lot of games get this aspect entirely wrong)\n-Slightly glitchy. (But no where close to game-breakingly. It's glitchy in the sense that your feet sometimes go through walls or a zombie runs through part of another zombie in a tight area.)\n\nIt's good. For 6 dollars, I'd recommend it.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506470795, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506470795, "recommendationid": "35232457", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506885702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2041, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2451, "steamid": "76561197983878024", "num_games_owned": 112}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Not that bad at all...with a lot of recent reviews negative as regards performance, bugs etc...i wasnt expecting much.

One thing of note for gun play its not the greatest and maybe some of the areas in the game could be allowed to explore more, there seems to be a lot of play going in and out of the sewer networks. To use the main interface menu too feels as laggy as hell too for some reason and moving weaponry into slots can be be clunky and awkward.
