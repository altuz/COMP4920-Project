Now it's at a point where it sometimes gives me an error message from GML, which is really pathetic. Also, I can't start a normal run anymore, since I start in a boss room, without boss, able to run towards the mark. And that all over again. Just lame... I was hoping for it to be worth the 13\u20ac , but nah..
