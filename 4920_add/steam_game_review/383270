Basically you can change the color of the background to make objects of that same color blend into the background, which makes them temporarily disappear. The developer did a great job of filling the world with fun puzzles in a vivid world.\n\nMy only complaint really is that the structure ends up being very repetitive. There are eight colors, and each color's gauntlet is essentially structured the same. First you are forced to walk through a maze while a voice-over reads the story, but there's no way to skip this or reach the end of the maze before the voice finishes. Then you solve the puzzles, which can sometimes be a bit too easy and repetitive as well. And then you obtain the next color for the next area. I suppose it's simple and it works, but they could have probably done something slightly less predictable.\n\nOverall it was a fun experience, with definitely a lot of effort put into it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505215785, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505215785, "recommendationid": "34899190", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503546", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506471123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 77, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 297, "steamid": "76561198005951691", "num_games_owned": 237}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A good game. Puzzle platformer with a cute mechanic - you change the colors on the background to match colored obstacles, then the obstacles disappear.

The rest ranged from easy to \"how the hell... Oh! I getcha. Clever.\"\nThe art is (obviously) simple and gorgeous, and there's a pretty simple plot to keep you going along, narrated by excellent voicework.
