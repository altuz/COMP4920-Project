I would recommend this for a first-time VN-reader.\n\nMy route order: Princess of drops > Himeno > Fall into poison > The limited ocean of life.\"Princess of drops\" and \"The limited ocean of life\" were my favourite endings.\n\nSound of Drop - fall into poison - is a psychogical thriller with horror elements. Its main theme is, arguably, moving on from the death of a loved one. Choices matter in this visual novel -- there are a whopping 27 bad endings and only 4 good endings (though one is rather bittersweet). Two of the good endings are only available after initially completing the game and then starting a new game. The save files in this VN don't have time played, so I can't say how long it took me to complete the first route. However, it took me just over 9 hours to complete all the endings, skipping content I had already read, which is a pretty good length for the price.\n\nThe plot is good. It doesn't take too long to start off and pick up the pace. Lengthwise, I never felt that the novel was boring or stagnant; it made good use of all dialogue and action to push the plot along. The story itself is quite interesting and the characters were written well enough that I felt invested in them. I laughed and cried while reading Sound of Drop, which I think is a sign it did a pretty good job of sending across its message and themes. While the characters didn't necessarily have depth, they were interesting, and some were quite surprising later on in the novel.\n\nThe artwork for Sound of Drop is of very high quality. The character sprites are all very bright and nicely drawn, and backgrounds are pleasant as well. The CGs are all very good though a few are a bit wonky-looking. Nonetheless they are both lighthearted and creepy when the context calls for it.\n\nSound of Drop's soundtrack is also very good. It was extremely effective at evoking the mood and atmosphere it wanted to, whether that was wariness, anxiety, or hope. It never felt repetitive. I also enjoyed both the opening and ending themes. I'll be purchasing the soundtrack when it's on sale.\n\nOverall, Sound of Drop - fall into poison - is a solid visual novel title that I'd recommend to anyone looking for something new and interesting to read.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503807707, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503807707, "recommendationid": "34520534", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508621", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 100, "total_reviews": 111, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
