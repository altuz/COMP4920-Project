The control scheme is meant to be a bit disorienting to make the game much more difficult, whilst easily playable, for the player. Don't lead this disuade you though, this game is incredibly unique, and a brilliant concept. \n\nThe premise of the game is that you must shoot powerups at the colored circles located in the middle of your quadrant. Once you shoot one with a powerup, the powerup will move to the quadrant corresponding with the color of the circle that you had shot. You may not regularly shoot at other players, as you must use the portals in the middle of your area. Other players also have the ability to halt your powerups, for example... one powerup spawns some enemies within the area that you should it to. The player in that area may shoot and kill the enemies of course, so that they will not remain taunting the other player for the remainder of the game. As I stated previously, and you most likely could already tell... I would highly reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys local, splitscreen party-like games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1479085336, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1479085336, "recommendationid": "26592806", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492958", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
