I immediately noted the game's awesome art style from the images/screenshots. The game was 10% off and I was happy to buy it. It was a good decision.\n\nThis particular puzzle game has a unique twist, 'the people have to turn left.' This provides a fun new way to experience this genre, and its something you have to consider at every point when choosing an approach to tackle the levels.\n\nI've played through about half of the levels you can see from the start (I assume there aren't more as of now.) \nThey all provide a fun and rewarding challenge.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, there have been a couple of levels that have been slightly more challenging than others, and likewise there are several levels I could solve in one go, but overall the difficulty isn't too easy to be boring, but isn't too difficult to deter you away. I find it hits the mark almost perfectly.\n\nIt's the kind of game that once you figure out a certain way to solve a puzzle, you get a smile on your face.\n\nDid get a little repetitive after a while, so I would recommend not attempting it in one sitting, although it's definitely possible. Once a level is completed, you can re-attempt it. I haven't played through it enough to say there is more than one possible way to complete a level, although I'm sure it's the case on many of the levels. At any rate I can't say I would go back and replay levels I've already completed.\n\nIs it worth the price?\nSince I feel the game isn't particularly replayable, I have to admit I feel that the base price is a little steep, I certainly don't feel ripped off, but I would definitely recommend purchasing the game reduced. I got mine for 10% off in its 'launch sale.'\n\"But hey, at least its not laiden with microtransactions!\"\n\nOverall:\n\nPROS:\n-Great Fun\n-Great Singleplayer Puzzle Game\n-Unique\n-Great Art Style\n\nCONS:\n-Repetitive (Can get boring quick if you aren't patient.)\n-Arguably a little pricey\n\nWould Recommend\n\nI give this game a 7/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438806751, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438806751, "recommendationid": "17404492", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517107", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439113215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 38, "steamid": "76561197977805178", "num_games_owned": 356}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a great little game - for the \u00a36.29 I paid for it, I can definitely recommend it.\n\nOn full graphical settings, it looks pretty good, certainly for a puzzle game.

Prunk like puzzles, though make Prunk bite tongue when concentrate too hard.\n\nGame good.  It look easy sometimes, but can get tricky.

Most times can only turn left, sometimes magic sign make them turn right and confuse Prunk.\n\nPrunk like how levels go from easy to tongue-biting.  Music pretty catchy because  Prunk always nodding to music when playing.\n\nOne thing don't make sense, why you have to get so many busy peoples into portals?  No need so many and waste of peoples.
