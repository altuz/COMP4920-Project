Enemies can spawn inside of walls. the first place you lay down a bed will permanently be assigned your spawn point, Making relocating a house a pain if you like to use teleport scrolls... which don't work as intended either.

It's really annoying when I don't know which is which.\n-Spawning on the beach would make more sense.  I don't know if you can spawn on a beach but I spawn in a forest every time, so having it be an island, also like ROTMG, would be cool.  \n\nPLEASE FIX:\n-Fullscreen glitch where you cann't move your cursor to the bottom part of the screen.\n-Fullscreen Resolution.

I don't have a lot of survival game exposure, but I do prefer 2D over 3D environments when available, so I looked for something like this when I wanted to check out survival games. I've yet to get Terraria, but this would probably be my follow-up after I get finished playing around with this game.\n\nI've had to dump a lot of collected gear and I mostly dump them into treasure chests and leave them at my shelter, old shelter or at cave entrance \"shrines\" I'd create to make the cave entrances more visible on the map. The underworld is full of torches I place around as I investigate for ore, treasure and experience heavy monsters.\n\nSpoiler: Collect bones from skeletons to make a powerful sword that moves the game forward a lot faster. I found skeletons on the first and second levels of the underworld and I assume the deeper I go, the more powerful the monsters may grow.\n\nMy problems with the game are the large mobs of wizards that control strongholds throughout the surface area. However, I've taken it as a challenge to grow powerful enough to take on and wipe out these strongholds. I hope these structures are defeatable with a computer as powerful as mine. As noted in a prior review, these wizard mobs tend to spam attack and lag the game for me, which is frustrating and prevents effective skirmish assaults to pick off these fools.\n\nThere does seem to be a lot more to discover in this game and I see myself putting at least another score of play hours into this game. I hope the developers return to this game and enhance it into popularity. Finally, Realm of the Mad God wasn't appealing to me as I wasn't looking for another MMO and as someone who has contributed some minor pixel art and effort into a game (The Mana World), I know I'd be honored to have many games use my art. I hope that more of this style of art is developed and used by Squarelands or a sequel to it and grow the play factor by leaps and bounds.
