Wind, muzzle velocity discrepancies, bullet weight, coriolis effect, et. etc,\n- targets are placeable at various stages, moveable and turnable to various angles\n- Pretty easy to get into for anyone who has realoading or real world shooting skills\n- Seems pretty accurate as a simulator at first try. \n\nCons:\n- Not a game. Don't expect any bells an whistles, career mode, arcade shooting/sniper challenges...it's a tool\n- Graphics need serious polish. I know it's a sim, but still...draw me in. They're too basic\n- Scopes reticles are far too few and lack variety. You can customize and add your own, but this should have been released with a lot more already in, so guys can practice holdovers and leads with hunting style scope reticles or whatever.\n- Only 3 calibres are in the sim to start with (you can add your own by inputting stats)  as far as I could see - .338, 7.62, and .50 I believe.\n- Audio and felt recoil, blast effects could use an overhaul. \n- UI needs to be minimized a bit\n- You can't walk around in a terrain. you have a panning scope view an that's it.\n- Scopes should be able to at least simulate distance haze, and other visual abberations/reflections for a truer \"feel\". I'd like to be able to add some distortions to my custom scope view to simulate some of the less that awesome scopes on the market.\n\nConclulsion:\nI would have preferred this as a serious rifle range mod for Arma III, where I could choose the landscape, target types, set up a map on a rolling terrain and actually choose what positions to shoot from. All the math is there. Just needs a better body. Still a good buy for those who can't get to the range.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439747661, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439747661, "recommendationid": "17570509", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559166", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456055776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 233, "playtime_forever": 4653, "steamid": "76561198112810429", "num_games_owned": 1570}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 34, "comment_count": "2", "review": "\"Expert Rifleman\" is not even 1 % of a game. That's a ballistic diorama, a sandbox for those weapons enthusiasts who cares how the bullet performs in the really long ranges.\n\nIt would be just a waste of money for anybody who don't ever have to consider the bullets trajectory in the real life. Now again, this application is not a game. It has some \"score\" system to count your hits, but other than that, there are zero gameplay interest, even for the lovers of shooting. I can suggest a freeware project World of Guns: Gun Disassembly (http://store.steampowered.com/app/262410/) which have much more of gameplay value, and ranges to shoot stuff in particular.\n\nBut as we are returning to the Expert Rifleman... Think of it as of addition to the ballistic calculator. A 3D visualisation of sniper tables which marksmen use to quickly making the math before pulling the trigger.\n\nIf it happened that you are one of the rare breed of shooters who have an interest to software like this... I suggest to try it for yourself then. By all means, it is far from perfect. You can't change your stance there. There are not enough terrains, collisions, settings for climate and gravitational forces. There are charts only for 3 calibers, and all other numbers you gotta add for yourself.

Before starting a shooting session there are half a dozen pages or so of values and numbers for different weather and shooting variables which have zero descriptions. Unless you are a big time shooter or have military experience none of this makes any sense and there are no descriptions about what they do and how those numbers affect your shots.\n\nThe price seems a bit high for the lack of content and unpolished graphics.
