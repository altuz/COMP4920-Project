Not really a simulator. Plane Physics are no the best bur doing the missions are fun. The ground textures could use some work though. Id rather have a basic flat texture than pixelated satillite views.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nWhy no joystick Support?!?!   I really wanted to like this simplistic Flight Simulator. I play super sims like DCS FSX and ROF  this game would have been awesome to play on my laptop but i cant use my joystick!  I know its a mobile port but come on!  I wish i liked playing sims on mobile but i really dont.. its no fun without a joystick.. PLEASE fix this!
