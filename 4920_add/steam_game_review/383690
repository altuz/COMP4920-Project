There are some serious quality of life improvements required to make this less frustrating for regular terminal users.\n\nThe game (and terminal) doesn't properly resize to fit the resolution (2560x1600), so you are stuck with a lot of scrolling to read stuff that would have comfortably fit on the monitor otherwise. The mouse wheel doesn't work and the scroll handle is tiny and therefore very fiddly. There doesn't even seem to be any keyboard shortcuts for scrolling, which would have been fine, too.\n\nI got through Episode 1 easily enough, but stopped playing during some puzzles in Episode 2 that require typing a lot of rather wordy commands in a very specific order. Failing one of these apparently requires re-typing all of it. The solution was easy, but extremely tedious to enter. This, combined with the lack of context (due to the small window and lack of halfway decent scrolling) made it frustrating enough for me to just quit right there.\n\nMy experience with the puzzles is limited by the fact that I stopped playing, but most puzzles so far seem to consist out of rather repetitively digging through emails, finding a clue and entering the result. Sometimes it also requires you to Google for some piece of text that the clue references to find the answer. Also, this is nowhere near a \"full-featured hacker\" experience. There is only a handful of limited commands, and you could probably just brute-force your way through all of it.\n\nI would have liked to know how the story ends, but in its current state, I am not willing to put more time into it to find out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501865095, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501865314, "recommendationid": "34019634", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 60, "total_reviews": 70, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
