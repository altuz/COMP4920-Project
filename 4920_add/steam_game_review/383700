The music is atrocious and loops way too much.The control scheme becomes really hard to manage, the bounce back from being hurt by spikes is completely uncontrollable and frustrating\n\nYou will spend most of your time mashing your controller trying to get your character to behave in a sensible manner. Someone with a lot of practice might find some flow to this game and enjoy it but the investment/reward ratio is off balance and with the low amount of levels it is hard to justify doing so.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494591985, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506059112, "recommendationid": "31700680", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498225", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 6}}
