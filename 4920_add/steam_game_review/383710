The art, music and enemy design are absolutely gorgeous but the gameplay itself is an infuriatingly buggy, laggy and generally  non-functional. The hit boxes are way off and the general feel of the gameplay is super loose and unresponsive. The English is full of mistakes and feels awkward. The instructions displayed at the start of the game have ridiculously low-res text and pictures which are borderline unreadable. \n\nIt doesn't matter whether you're a fan of beat'em ups or Eastern art styles, this can of worms is definitely not worth the asking price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502105657, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502110828, "recommendationid": "34079872", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502129", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458053213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 44, "steamid": "76561198137466444", "num_games_owned": 454}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this isn't a actual review it's more of facts and truths about this game.\n\nthe controls are fine, but the lagged response from the input is what really screws this game up.\nsometimes the input can be unresponsive making the game play very agitating. \na lot of the enemies are annoying as EFF!! like they're just as agitating as the input lagg.\nthe boss fights are really dumb, and so are the skills. i have quite a few hours on this game offline.. and honestly i didn't even beat the second boss because of how terrible this game is. \n\nthis game NEVER updates. it's a LOST cause just like my life. don't get it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503029183, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503029183, "recommendationid": "34320500", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498178", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503274617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 362, "playtime_forever": 199, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 445}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is... odd. First, the controls are no where near intuitive. They also have a bad habit of making one's fingers/hands cramp up. Might be better with an actual controller.
