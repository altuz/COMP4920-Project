Yes.\nHas the game actually delivered all the playable elements? Yes.\nIs the game fun? Kind of.\nIs it recommended? Of course not.\n\nGraphic: I'm generally neutral to Swords & Crossbones in this aspect.\n\nMusic and Sound: I turned both off after 1 hour of game play, so you know what to expect...\n\nGame system: All the elements they showed in the trailer are present, however, they seem to be spliced together by weak glues. None of them is outstanding, and their combination does not make things any better. The battles are boring and unbalanced.\n\nControl: This is the WORST user interface in game I've ever seen in the past several years. For almost doing everything, you need to do at least twice the clicks as that you would do in another turn-based strategy game with an average-level UI.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492857349, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492857349, "recommendationid": "31293868", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501366", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 24, "total_reviews": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
