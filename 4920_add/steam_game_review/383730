I created a new project, filled the initial map with grass, placed the hero and started the game. The result: Lag.\nThis does not happen with the old version Don translated. I have Windows 10 and a QuadCore 2.8GHz.\nThis problem has been known for quite some time, but nobody seems to care.\n\nI also hate that it can't run without steam. Why would they do that to this super-old software that has been copied all around the world for about two decades?
