The game has grown and now shines. It's not for everyone and the core concept might be alien to casual gamers but for those who are looking for something original and challenging will find warm & fuzzy feelings with Close Order. As an indie developer and a proponent of innovation in gaming I fully support this team. For $5 I think this is a great deal. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:\nI am recommending to purchase the game only for those with patience and an interest in actually contributing to the development of a game. This game needs a lot of help from the community as the developer is capable but apparently inexperienced with game design.  NOTED IMPROVEMENTS: tutorial is great now, the UI is improved and polished, the few bugs I encountered originally are all gone, the difficulty curve seems to have been smoothed out as well. Exceptional improvement IMHO. Well done Raconteur Games!                                                          \n\nThere are core design decisions in place that are interesting and could prove to be really fun with a lot of polish and refinement. Missions are currently disjointed and transitions are abrupt and break the fourth wall. Your \"minions\"(fleet) disappear suddenly and without reason or even explosive effect in one mission. If you skipped the conversation, as many shooter fans do, it is confusing. I kept spending my amassed fortune replacing those ships only to have them suddenly dissapear again. 3 times I did this until broke and finally understood that this mission forces you to go alone. Unfortunately this is the sort of unrefined gameplay I was mentioning. An experienced developer would know to remove player's ability to spend on new ships and when they attempt to do so, place an explanatory message on screen. It takes 10 minutes to code but without user feedback and direction, it will never happen. \n\nThe game is less than $5 and has tons of potential but don't buy it expecting others to fix it for you. It has a small user population and the forum is empty right now. Buy it and help out or stay clear until reviews at \"final release\".", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439047345, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1457696273, "recommendationid": "17444589", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513682", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439583868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561198035450010", "num_games_owned": 68}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game shows much promise for its current state of development.

The story is simple, and I enjoyed the character's knowledge of how ludicrous what they were doing was. It was an interesting take on expected game mechanics (no one questions how 1 man in black ops can accomplish all the tasks he does, it's unrealistic but just accepted by the gamer) but the characters are almost self aware of this without having to do a Deadpool style of 4th wall breaking. An example of this was in the first story mission your briefing tells you that you are to escort a ship and that there will be people trying to attack the escort, and one of the crew members states something to the extent of, \"A military mission when we're just explorers and have no idea how to fight? Let's dive in head first!.\" Subtle humor that I enjoyed. Humor aside you're always just in that believability spectrum, never too far serious or ludicrous. The author knew what kind of experience he wanted to give and he presented it well. This game's story will not lead you into a deeper understanding of humanity or anything like that, but it will give you enough to keep your attention to present to you an enjoyable time.\n\nVisually it's a treat, I don't mean it's NEXT GENERATION GRAPHICS, but it's colorfull vistas and elements of the world backup the style the game is presenting.\n\nI do wish that the way you upgraded your ship/fleet was more progression based, or unlockable I suppose. Not having practically all ship variants right of the start, and getting certain upgrades or new abilities after beating a level would of been nice. Not to say there isn't any progression, but it seems a bit underdeveloped in my humble opinion.\n\nUnfortunately there are some bugs that will hinder your enjoyment of the game. A short gameplay session occurs before what is supposed to be the intro cutscene, and that gameplay segment is a tutorial that you must repeat after the cutscene. The one that caused me the most trouble is the bugged music. While the music itself is great and fitting, you have no ocntrol over the volume. You can try to turn in down using the enraging cursor that is used in menus, using buggy volume sliders, but even if you manage to get the volume to where you want it (which is unlikely since the first slider barley works, the second even less so, and the third is unusable) after a loading screen the volume goes back to max and if you try to change it after that the music will briefly go to the volume you stay and then quickly rise back to max. I point this out because it made it impossible to make a video of this game because the music was always overpowering my voice.\n\nBugs aside I recommend the game, and look forward to see what come out of the game creator next.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459783273, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1459783375, "recommendationid": "22237692", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500152", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460592481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 186, "steamid": "76561198040273241", "num_games_owned": 118}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Well.

The story mode was not linear, the game started off abrubtly and had no tutorial, and was buggier than my backyard. HOWEVER, the game is now VERY stable, and is a nice gem to my library, the devs are CONSTANTLY at work trying to get this game better and better, and I cannot wait for what else these guys can give us! :D\n\nSo the game goes like this, you are a ship, your goal? Destroy other ships. These enemy ships drop scaps of materials, which you can use to build more ships to help you conquer more levels! As of now, there are 2 story mode hubs and an endless mode. \n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n-ARTWORK is very nice, the backgrounds look like real space pictures of galaxies and stars and things like that, great to look at, and a nice touch by the game makers\n-MUSIC is quite unique, instead of the devs going for a traditional, boring old, sci-fi themed soundtrack, the music sounds like a horror, techno, sci-fi, mix thing, inventive and unique\n-IDEA, the idea here is a nice unique one, not some just lame 2D side-scroller shootem up you find for 49 cents all over steam, this is an original idea!!!\n-SHIPS, I feel like the ship movement, artwork of the ships, and enemy ships all work right together, the asteroids add a nice effect to the background as well as some shield for your enemy's shots. You can use shift to move faster if you feel you are moving too slow, which you really are, but the slowness of the ship makes up for itself during combat.\n-TUTORIAL, this tutorial has been added and it works wonders, just a quick breifing on controls is all the game really needed and has been added! :) Good Work devs\n-STORYMODE, with each level of story mode completed you unlock a new ship to make! This mode has been revised to be more linear and a hellof alot more fun!\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n-MORE GAMEMODES, thier is not much to complain about with this game, it was a great buy for the price, however I would most definitly enjoy more mode types. Multiplayer would be SICK and would spark up a community, a race mode, more story modes, daily challenges, more ways to play the game would be AMAZING, and would really expand the play time of players!\n\n[h1]REVISED Judgement 8/10![/h1]\nThe last time I had written this judgement the game was 3/10, it needed ALOT of help but these devs have worked thier asses OFF, and it truly shows! Thier new score from me is 8/10, this game is amazing and you should pick it up, the music, the textures, the strategy, the storymode levels, all are beautifully executed, this game is very much a GEM in my steam library and it will be in yours as well :)", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1451309194, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451293048, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1454696867, "recommendationid": "20026609", "developer_response": "Hey DatFancylan!

It looked from the videos and screenshots like a fun action shooter game. I unfortunatley turned out to be wrong. After booting up the game, I played a quick tutuorial mission, in which I discovered the fidley controls, vague objectives, and confusing camera angles.\n\nMoving around feels floaty, and it is near impossible to have any sort of percession while moving. You can either sit still and take massive amounts of damage while you fire, or spray and pray, missing every shot. The menu is also very fidley and sensetive. Trying to select a new minion to purchase requires you to move your mouse very slowly, and you often fly past the option you want to it just doesn't select when you do eventually reach it.\n\nIn the tutorial, I was shown several ships to defeat. I defeated them all (with some effort) and was taken into the first mission. I was then given nearly no direction whatsoever. I floated off into the endless world with no idea where I was going. An \"endless\" world may sound exciting, but it is just a black background with a few stars permanently sitting in the distance. I eventually doubled back and spoted a hard to see asteroid belt that I needed to follow. This style covers half of the game, and could possibly be a fun challenge, if the other half wasn't just going to white dots on your map, getting some text, and going to a new white dot. Both types of gameplay are extremely tedious, and the battles take up very little of the actual gameplay.\n\nThis game looked very promising. But after playing it for a short while I realized it needed a lot of work to become what I would consider a good game. The many glitches (a few of which are gamebreaking), unpolished controls and menus, and the overall fidley gameplay make this game one I would certainly not recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453500588, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1453500588, "recommendationid": "20687477", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499602", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480677204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198028496024", "num_games_owned": 417}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's quite fun, very very simple but fun to play which is the important bit.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1480677231, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1480677231, "recommendationid": "28136493", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 11, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
