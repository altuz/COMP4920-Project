Xbox pad works. Limited assets. Camera too close to protag and massive hitboxes everywhere.\n\nReview: Controls feel okay. Camera too zoomed in. Often changing Z levels on platform exposes you to immediate danger and there is no way to know ahead of time with those blind jumps. Character model and foe models are all way too large and make a lot of the screen a hitbox concern. Weapon where you throw a lance does not have a weird arc or anything. You shoot straight and you can shoot a lot in a short span of time. Its also possible to pick secondary ability power ups but those do not come into play nearly as much. Level design was not half bad and kept you mostly engaged in progressing further striking a good challenge balance for the most part. Xbox360 pad detected and working correctly. Quality of the visuals was debatable, there were some half decent animations like the death animation. However it seems lacking, flat, and very mobile-like. Foes and crates can take way too much punishment and the game is a slow grind, of jumping blindly and chipping at monsters by tossing 8 swords into them. Occasionally you get a sword power up that helps with the pacing but those need to be found every level and add an unnecessary and unpleasant ncessity to go on a silly easter egg hunt across entire levels all the time because the dev decided to slant game balance against the player if he did not perform his chores. Not my idea of fun. People are complaining a lot about the voice acting but It might have gotten redone as I thought that part was very very good. Audio arguably better than the game. Some sound effects were by nature of the game extremely repetitive and even kind of goofy. Game fullscreened correctly. Only saw three enemies, orcs, pigs and bats. Level variation introduced in the form of color reskin of tiles\n\nConclusion: Playable. You can get your fun out of it. But the experience comes across as substandard and the competition is just too strong in the platformer market for this to really stand a chance.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500429627, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500430210, "recommendationid": "33642252", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
