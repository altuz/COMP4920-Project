The narrative and voice acting is spot on. The game graphically is beautiful. The musical score is great. However with the positives I feel that they ran out of ideas or direction. I knew going in it was going to be a short game, but I didn't think this short. That's not even the issue. The game just......ended....Top 3 worst endings of a story rich game I've ever seen. It disappoints you. Breaks your heart and not in a great narative type of way, more like a the developers ran out of content or vision type of heartbreak. If  a 2nd game is in the works I'll gladly change my review. But as it stands they took a wonderful idea and gave up 3/4 of the way through it. You just feel longing for closure for it to be finished. So much potential. But Length times price times poor execution closer to the end= no buy for me. Do I regret buying it? No not really. But had I known what I know now I wouldn't have. You're better off watching THE RAD BRAD play it.
