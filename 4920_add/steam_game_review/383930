However, if you're looking for an atmospheric, psychological horror game with solid gameplay, you might enjoy it.\n\nDoorways: Holy Mountains of Flesh is a horror game with a lot of puzzle solving just like the previous two games in the Doorway trilogy (\"Doorways: Prelude\" and \"Doorways: The Underworld\"). I'm impressed that the devs are devoted to the atmosphere building, the story and the level design of the game to create a sense of psychological horror rather than relying on jumpscares or flashing lights and ear-piercing sound effects commonly used in other try hard wannabe \"horror\" games. \n\nBefore playing this game, It's highly recommended that you play the previous two games in the trilogy as the story is consecutive in them. You play as Thomas Foster, an investigator working for an organization called Doorways. His mission is to pursue four psychopaths and uncover the mysteries behind them. Thomas had already dealt with the first three psychopaths in the previous two games and this time he'll face Juan Torres, the last villian on the list. What's more, the player will discover the true colors of Doorways and the evil side of the protagonist.\n\nThe game has an unique artstyle resembling a remote devil worshipping village in Argentina. Environmental elements like the crimson sky, grotesque structures, floating mountains with burning lava underneath all add to the amosphere. Optimization is good as it runs perfectly on my PC.\n\nPuzzles and platforming are two main elements of the game. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging for me as one of them even took me nearly an hour to finally figure out, but they are well-designed and cause little interference to the general pacing. As for the platforming parts, they're fun to play due to the smooth control of the game.\n\nThe game has several chapters and each of them has its own scene, for example, the school, the mansion, and the temple. There're notes and collectables scattered around the map in each chapter, which are rewarding for the player's effort in exploring. \n\nIn the game, you'll also encounter monsters. Sometimes you'll get chased by them and need to escape, while sometimes you need to avoid them. The final boss is fun and thrilling to fight, you'll not be battling it face to face wielding a weapon but to beat it with timing and your platforming skill.\n\nAll in all, this is a very well made game with a lot of efforts put in by the devs and I throughly enjoyed it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1482724600, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498213112, "recommendationid": "28657837", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515931", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483849616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 358, "steamid": "76561197976402001", "num_games_owned": 79}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game caters to a specific type of gamer.\nIt is certainly not for everyone.\n\nIf you pay good attention to detail, enjoy puzzles, appreciate well-written stories, but also like some creepiness and the occasional (very occasional) jump scare, this game is for you.\n\nThis game also carries an element of mystery, you're essentaily a detective with a psychological gift, who is attempting to solve the mystery of a lost city.

I know this because as I enter some buildings my ability to control the character is reduced as I'm forced to listen to something. which is really quite annoying, though is something quite usual in horror games for some reason. any chance of an \"Immersive\" story is immediatly taken away at this point. the town splits off into a few different sections, which quietly attribute to the thought of being in someone's mind in their own little way. quite a difficult thing to pull off.\n\nthe game really begins once you've reached the school and you meet the monster, or at least the first one that will appear in this title. the introduction to the monster is done horribly, it's something that will only appear in darkness to attack you, but first appears half basked in the light which lead me to quite a bit of confusion until I figured out how this monster opperates exactly. immediatly it would have been better to have this monster appear in the players vision in darkness, only for it to disapear when some light randomly turns on. from here on out it's \"be afraid of the spooky scary dark\" as the player goes through several different light puzzles in order to safely navagiate a room.\n\nINCOMING SPOILERS: \n\n[spoiler]the final nail in the coffin comes from the fact that the school itself is, well, a school for schoolchildren. whereas the final sequence involves a lot of dismembered adult body parts strewn around everywhere and the player running through many racks of cages with adults slamming on the bars as a spooky darkness approaches. did the school change to a high school or college at some point? is this really how they advertise their early access product with such an inaccuracy? this is proof of concept stuff right here, not anything which actually indicates any amount of development, usually I would overlook something like this given that it is early access, but... the assets used look as if they were placed there to stay there, with no intention of changing it later[/spoiler]\n\nthere are many things about this game that show promise. the animations are great, art is great, modeling is great, sound is not the greatest but is definetly at a level I would call highly passable, but it looks as if the designer is quite heavily asleep at the wheel and has little concept of what horror is or how to actually implement it. \n\nmaybe I'm wrong and this game will turn out great, but initial impressions aren't great.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449177297, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1449177297, "recommendationid": "19465346", "language": "english", "votes_down": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507777", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440745455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 79, "steamid": "76561198050750789", "num_games_owned": 311}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[b]i played 1-3 all parts are nice  atmosphere and this one especially the deepest one.\n\n[h1]*Devolpers*[/h1]\n- Everything is fine as previous parts, but make it little real for example i can jump on theater and this is [u] frustrating[/u] when i see small stuff can't jump on it.\n- Make a custom settings for graphics cause i choose what i want in game. \n- there is a bug when the screen becomes small in the [strike]middle[/strike] and sides is Black.\nKeep up the good work :P[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440154953, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1440180648, "recommendationid": "17642605", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505141", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469844027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 177, "steamid": "76561197998914313", "num_games_owned": 749}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I tried to like this game, I really did. Trying to enjoy the atmosphere of the game was a challenge. Running everywhere trying to figure out where to go. But the one thing that killed the game for me was the puzzles. The damn puzzles.\n\nIn any of the Penumbra or Amnesia games, which this game seems like its trying to be a spiritual successor, the puzzles in those games were fair and solvable. Gave you a good amount of informtion & hints to solve them. Made you think and they were fun to solve, without taking you out of the atmosphere of the games.\n\nHowever, in Doorways Holy Mountains of Flesh, the first few puzzles have very little information to very vague hints, breaking you away from the excellent atmosphere of the game. Puzzles done wrong? This game is an excellent prime example of how you do not program puzzles and supply little to no clues on how to solve them.\n\nThis is a Walkthrough kind of game. Which means you have to watch someones Lets Play. Skimming through someones video just to see how its solved. Which makes you feel like you're cheating and that you're really stupid. Then you find out that when they're trying to find the solution, they needed help or look it up themselves.\n\nI cannot recommend a game that breaks you away from the atmosphere due to its unforgivable puzzles. The rest of the game however is superb. But when it comes to the first Doorways game, it was a great game. Was scary, excellent atmosphere, and it managed to grab the attention of the player with ease. This game provides puzzles that frustrate and breaks you away from what the original game provided.\n\nI will not say do not buy the game. If you like hard as nails puzzles, like in the old Silent Hill days, then this is your game. A word of warning however, when you get stuck (and you will get stuck often), do not be ashamed to use a walkthrough.

The lighting conditions at the transition from outdoor areas <-> indoors isn`t fluently enough.\n\nThe Bug:\n\nAt the very end of act 1, there is a door that can no longer be activated [u]after your first death[/u] in this sequence (the latch does no longer lights up). Says: autosave was created (indicated by short flickering of the screen), you play the sequence and die, after that no matter how often you load the autosave, the door is no longer usable. To fix the problem, you have to exit to the main menu and  reload the autosave from there. \n\nI can recommend the game because it shows potential and I think it could deliver what is promised by the developer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440122485, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1440122485, "recommendationid": "17638026", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502356", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482587382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 836, "steamid": "76561197987565903", "num_games_owned": 70}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really liked the first two parts in the Doorways series and this one is no exception.\n\nSome say the in-game graphics look a bit dated, but they sure do trick for me. Personally, I think it's an amazing art style throughout the whole series. It's pretty disturbing and so are the background stories and the creepy sounds you'll hear from time to time when discovering new areas. This one tops it on all levels.\n\nOne downside of the previous two parts was that the puzzles were a bit too easy. This one delivers more. Especially in the part called 'The Mansion' which is also amazingly beautiful.\n\nI do wonder about the mental state of the developers though.. the last part is.. sick!

I would say this entry may be more coherent and smooth gameplay-wise, and hopefully the fleshed out final version does live up to be the (finale'?) of the series' that kind of brings it together..\n**UPDATE** O.K. with all the features and graphics revised I DO consider this way up to par with the others if not by far, much more creepy. I am truly amazed at just how good it has been brought together by the devs, and it truly manages to freak me out EVEN after already playing a while back, it strikes up the perfect balance of memories and being like whoah I don't remember that;) All in all a great treat, especially for the longer term fans that have been here throughout, what a great experience, I love it..", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1470901951, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1470988547, "recommendationid": "24822199", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505997", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 30, "total_reviews": 37, "num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
