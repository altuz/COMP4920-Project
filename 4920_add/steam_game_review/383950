The game contains an incredible number of match 3 boards, getting increasingly more difficult as you proceed in the story. What I really like here is that the boards are not on a grid, instead they take several forms ranging from your basic \"ball pit\" to free floating boards in space that require strategic dropping to solve them completely.\n\nThe story is forgettable, told by static images. A mermaid has lost treasures which means the world will be destroyed, so she has to solve match 3 puzzles to get them back. Each stage contains 15 boards, and you return a treasure after every 5th board.\n\nThe match 3 puzzles can be solved relatively easily, even the difficult ones, but to get a 3 star rating on each board you do not only need to solve it (1st star), but also solve it before the time limit (2nd star) and also match an additonal challenge for the 3rd star. This is where the difficulty comes in, since it usually requires you to match three specific gems which are scattered across the board before the rest of the board is solved.\n\nThis added complexity of trying to get all three stars is what makes the game fun and challenging, and keeps me returning to it. I've already spent multiple hours trying to perfect the boards, and will probably sink in a lot more in this fun game.\n\nIf you're still not sure what this game is like, think of a cross between Bubble Bobble, Peggle, and a basic match 3 game.

But the actual full title for this is called League of Mermaids: Pearl Saga.\n\nThis is one of the kind match 3 game because of a special feature has implemented into the game. Physics is the special feature in this game. Whenever a match is made the nearby elements is effect by jostling them like a bunch of marbles in a jar.\n\n[h1][u]Game Visuals[/u][/h1]\n\nI want to mentioned that the visuals for this game is well done even its simplistic.\n\n[h1][u]Game Audio[/u][/h1]\n\nI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even if it's simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.\n\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\n\nThere are no game difficulty modes to choose from but each of the game levels has their own difficulty.\n\nThe game has a timer but all the levels still can be completed if the time on the timer has run out.\n\nThe story campaign mode there is total of three chapters with fifteen levels.\n\nThere are three extra chapters with fifteen levels each and they aren't related to the story campaign.\n\nThe zen mode provides untimed endless match 3 levels. Leveling up to the next level requires certain amount of stars. This mode can be seen as a stress reliever.\n\nThe bottomless trench mode. Is to see far the individual player can go until the time on the timer runs out. But there are some bonuses would help with the time and quickly help the individual player to go further.\n\nThe special puzzles mode features similar puzzles from the story campaign mode.\n\nThere are sixteen different achievements. But each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.\n\n[h1][u]Miscellaneous[/u][/h1]\n\nMy final thoughts, this match 3 game, is definitely enjoyable to play. I would recommend this game but not at the full price value.\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/383950", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455905025, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500847469, "recommendationid": "21322171", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528793", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444256517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1041, "steamid": "76561198027276226", "num_games_owned": 288}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game worth for sure the money even if its not in discount because you have at least 10 hours of gameplay.And for the players that wanna do 100% of the game its gonna take you even more .\n\nLeague of Mermaids is a cute Match 3  game that plays with physics. \nReally easy to learn the mechanics of the game and pretty simple to play  left click and right click of mouse only .\nStory is fine you need to recovers the treasures before the kraken is summoned and destroy your mermaid world.\nMusic is nice and quality of the world ambiance is well made .\n\nThere is 6 worlds and 3 bonus game mode to play. \n\nThere is alot of achievements for the achievements hunters !

So you just don't switch stones but drop them on others so at least three of the same kind would touch each other. When every one of them is gone, the level's finished. The levels can turn challenging wether it's by obstacles between you and your marbles (platforms, etc.) or it's by level features that make you think more about physics and movements in order to win the level (like gear wheels or mill wheels).\nAlso there's some story going on about mermaids and treasures but it's not very interesting and also not important to follow. Just do the levels and be hooked. That's also a hint for you if you fear the mermaids would be just too much of a girly game: The mermaids are just part of the cutscenes.\n\nThe game itself I enjoy. It's very addicting and entertaining. It's also relaxing. So all in all I call it a good casual game/time waster and a bit more fun and challenging than an ordinary 3-match game.\nThe gameplay is very easy, you just click to drop marbles. Not much more to say about that.\nThe graphics are fine and clear, not too bright and colourful and fit to the underwater world.\nThe sound is subtle and okay, the music's not horrible but also not exactly exciting so soon after starting with the game I also started playing my own music as background music.\n\nWhen it comes to Steam features, it has achievements but no trading cards or something else.\n\nSo if you look for a relaxing, nice casual game (wether if you like mermaids or not) for a couple of bucks, this might be a good one for you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486493377, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486493377, "recommendationid": "29767212", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 8, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
