Don't get me wrong, Smash is amazing, but I feel like it sometimes finds it hard to find a good balance between casual and competitive play. Rivals was built to be a competitive fighting game for tournaments, while still having some fun stuff for casuals.\n\nHere are some major perks about this game:\n-All of the stages have a \"basic\" and \"Aether\" form. The basic forms have no stage hazards and all of them are tournament legal. Aether stages have hazards and are meant for casual matches. This option is amazing. It is what Smash 4 did with Omega stages but so much better.\n\n-All of the characters are super unique. No two characters feel the same, and all of them feel fresh and new. None feel like they were ripped from Smash or don't feel unique. All of them feel so different from one another and you can't play any two the same way. The cast is also a LOT of fun, no matter who you pick. There is nobody who is boring to play as.\n\n-All of the characters are balanced. All of the characters in this game are extremely well balanced. No character is definitely the best. All of them have their strengths and weaknesses. Plus patches are still being added to balance the cast further.\n\n-It was made for tournament play. There is even a \"tournament mode\"  setting in the menu for local play for running tournaments. This mode gives you access to how big the sets will be, such as best of 3 and best of 5. It even shows the player's win count at the top in matches.\n\n-The basic techniques from Super Smash Bros. Melee(Wavedashing and dash dancing) are made a lot more accessible, meaning that you spend more time focusing on learning combos and everything else and not having to spend lots of time learning movement options. It also makes you feel a lot more free and fluid in your movements, which feels amazing.\n\n-The online mode is good. Unlike Smash 4, the online mode in Rivals is good. They are even played in sets instead of individual matches, further giving to the competitive vibe of the game. There are ranked matches, where you will fight players depending on your rank, which goes up or down depending on if you win or lose. Exhibition mode is basically unranked matches which pool all of the players together, no matter your rank or skill. There is also friendly matches, where you can play people on your Steam friend list.\n\n-Great training mode. There are tons of options available to you in the training mode that are not available in Smash. For example, you can turn hitboxes and hurtboxes which are really useful for learning more about your character and testing combos out. You can also turn on frame advancing, which freezes time and lets you do movements on certain frames. There are a bunch of other options too, like changing the computer's DI, teching, action, etc, allowing you to practice all types of stuff.\n\n-Fun single player mode. Unlike Smash 4, I found myself coming back to single player mode of Rivals. There are story modes for each of the six original characters, and I found myself coming back to it to try to beat them in the fastest time possible.\n\n-At the time of this review, they are still adding content! This is what I used to love about Smash 4. Rivals is still getting new characters, stages, skins, patch updates, and features! It definitely keeps you invested in the game and excited for what they will announce next!\n\nSo, to conclude my review, you should definitely buy this game, especially if you like Smash or other platform fighters. It is a great fighting game and even surpasses Smash in many areas, in my opinion. It's fun to play both competitively and casually, and you will definitely get a lot of fun out of it, no matter what kind of player you are.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506564022, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506564064, "recommendationid": "35252900", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508055", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507186053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 687, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3697, "steamid": "76561198041305472", "num_games_owned": 470}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Rivals is AMAZING.
