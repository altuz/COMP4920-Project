The Original Fallout. [/h1]\n\nI have put a Pros/Cons section at the foot of this review, for those not fond of reading.\n\nYou know... You know how games used to be good right? [i] When less was better? [/i] You know what I mean: like in old horror games when the controls were so terrible that it added to fear factor. Well, this game at first glance is pretty standard. I bought the classics bundle because I admit... I had never played the original fallouts before falling in love with Fallout 3 and New Vegas. I wanted to see where these games originated. \n\nI played the game for half an hour... I despised it. Absolutely hated it. [strike] I quickly became incredibly butthurt [/strike] I had issues with the controls, having not been too well acquainted with turn based titles before this point. \n\nThe urge came many months later to retry the game, I thoroughly enjoyed playing for the next 28 hours (I had breaks of course, like... come on). This was a very, very sloppy playthrough. But trudging through the wastelands clinging to dear life... I still had a hell of a time. Anyway, this playthrough ended at the 28 hours (in which I didn't have much to show for, having messed around the whole time) because I half a**ed the 'ending' and left it sat for maybe a couple years?\n\nThis is when we come to the present. Fallout has ruined my social life this past week... [spoiler] think it was just the past two days. [/spoiler] I was oblivious to the outside world the whole time while playing, as if I was temporarily brainwashed. I put in 34 hours to be graced with the end of the game. Also, just finished it about an hour ago, thought I'd write this while I was still in awe. \n\nA couple indicators that lead me to believe this playthrough was more successful was: levelling had got me 75HP (Health Points), the Dweller brandished high tech weaponary capable of dealing up to around 450 damage, an untouchable set of T-51b Power Armour and... 63,000 caps. All this could be your's for the low, low price of: [spoiler] [your social life]. [/spoiler] You'd expect to have this equipment depending on character build by the end of the game. Well, maybe not the caps - spent too much time earning caps I'd never use. Out of curiosity, once I got there I had a look at the bad ending. I felt so accountable for the events that transpired in game following this that I was actually sorry... until I reloaded a save and completed the game the way I originally intended. \n\nEveryone lived happily ever after. Apart from... [spoiler] The Followers of the Apocalypse, The Supermutants/Nightkin, The Regulators, The Children of the Cathedral, The Raiders, of course the many dead and even the Vault Dweller... Now that I think of it, I lied. [/spoiler]\n\nWith most games, spending 34 hours would be reflected upon as a waste but I found it completely worthwhile, if even it was only to learn about the early fallout story. It will at least teach you one thing: to wish luck on anyone who survives complete nuclear world annihilation, cause that'll be the easy part.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n-Engaging turn based system\n-Original and sharp humour balanced \nperfectly with the feeling of dread\n-Decent character creation, allowing \nfor a vast range of playstyles\n-\"Maximum Blood\"\n-Many easter eggs (most in\nform of encounters)\n- 30+ hour playtime\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n-Has many downfalls when compared \nto Fallout 2 (inventory, content, many \nminor changes, ability to 'push companions' - see\nthe last criticism)\n-Can be confusing at times\n-Has a range of minor bugs (I encountered \na number of minor bugs but no game-\nbreaking bugs)\n-And probably the worst: when NPC followers \ntrap you in a building or corner etc\n\n\n[u] And one final thing: [/u]\nYou'll probably know this if you've played the game for a bit but something I should probably put in this review is the advice to: \"Save Often\". You don't know how many times you'll mess up. Maybe you entered a cave and save at the wrong time, following this, some creatures block your exit and you're too weak to fight- I recommend you save in a different slot before you enter new locations. Or it could be as simple as choosing a funny dialogue option and having the receiver of the comment initiate on you - and no... there's no \"it was just a prank, bro\" options. By far the most likely thing to effect you is what I mentioned in the 'Cons' about being trapped by NPCs. I have found the only ways out of this are to reload or kill the companion - if it's Ian carrying all your loot: you're f***ed, good luck carrying several hundred pounds of loot back to The Hub. Please take note of this, because it can add up to hours of progress being lost if the only save you can use is relatively old. Just saving your hide before you make the mistake!\n\nEnjoy this game... and then play the sequel! \nAlso thanks for taking the time to read my review!"}, {"votes_down": 20, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505103164, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589839", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "34876384", "votes_up": 91, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975982580", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1398232214, "num_games_owned": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 903}, "timestamp_updated": 1505103164, "received_for_free": true, "review": "The start of one of the best RPG series ever made.\nDarkly beautiful and beautifully retro."}, {"votes_down": 55, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504629554, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593907", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 60, "recommendationid": "34760133", "votes_up": 146, "comment_count": "8", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297114340", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1503409708, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 561}, "timestamp_updated": 1504629554, "received_for_free": false, "review": "\"You think you can destroy me!?

Combat, Atmosphere, Dialog, Atmosphere, Quests, did I mention Atmoshphere? This game does all of it and it does it magnificently.\n\nI do understand if you're coming from 3 and 4 like I did that this might be polarizing, and difficult, and frustrating, and it may be hard to just break through the barrier, but once you've pushed through it is a wonderful game.\n\nThe Atmosphere makes you feel alone, like the whole world is frozen in an instant while you're travelling through the Wastes. Or it can make you feel hopeful, scared, insignificant. I seriously reccomend doing nothing else while you play like listen to music or podcasts.\n\nThe Combat, whilst challenging, is stragetic. It is quite difficult, but it's not impossible.\n\nWhilst there is a limited amount of content to do, all of it is gold.\n\nFor those that want to get into it, I reccomend looking up a few build videos online, that's what helped me.\n\n\n9.5/10. Only reason it's not a 10 is because it's a 20 year game and has a few features and kinks that are annoying, like the fact that there are no quicksaves, or you have to manually select what skill you want to use and where you want to use it. But these features don't ruin the experience and you do get used to them pretty quick.\n\nTIPS:\nSave. Everywhere. Save everytime you go into a different town, every time you're about to leave and after every fight (Depending on weither that fight went so badly you'd rather go back and try again, but normally it's a good idea to save after every fight)\n\nSmalls Guns are your friend in the Early Game.

And today it's a game that makes filthy plebs go REEEEE over its combat mechanics, complex nature, ruthless quest outcomes, time limit and questionable interface. All of the above set this game apart from the rest of the franchise for both good and bad.\n\nIt's a game that delivers an amazing world setting, subtle social and political commentaries, and while the game is not shaming away from its influences and constant references to them, it DOES hold a world and story of its own. The story and the way game is delivering it is much MUCH better than what bethesda's fallouts tried to accomplish. \n\nWhile the gameplay might look hard, annoying and slow, you can actually increase the speed of it by turning some cranks in the settings. I recommend MAX speed. Not many players actually realise this, but your accuracy is decreased drastically in the darkness. To have a better accuracy at night or in caves, you must use flares or just pray and spray weapons (or just lure the enemy closer to you). There is also some small interesting details like dealing crits to enemies and temporarily blinding them if you hit them with a lit flare in the eye with VATS, so you can go ahead and experiment with it. The beggining of the game's road does have some rough bumps, like the first cave filled with rats that serves as a tutorial (which is actually very easy to complete and is better to run/sneak through.) then there is radscorp lair, which is basically your first run on the mill type of quest \"go and kill some baddies in a cave\" but then again, a lot of people tend to not realise that fallout is a much more different rpg that will not hold your hand, and you're just a survivor in this wasteland, so it's easy to just go and die right there, at the very first scorpion the game tosses at you. If your character is physically weak, what you're SUPPOSED TO DO, is to get another guy join your team. And this is the mindset that you're supposed to hold till the very end of the game, untill you are completely 100% confident in yourself and your stats/skills. I think the only way to be able to beat the game through the use of combat is to have 1 intelligence point and the rest assigned to physical traits, but then that just makes the game harder to complete if you have no idea where you're going and what you're supposed to do. \n\nThere is also one aspect of the game that i can't really love but highly respect and appriciate, is the time limit. Now, everybody hates it when there is time limit to what you're doing, especially if it's an open world rpg game. But hear me out, it's an aspect that i GREW to appriciate. Time limit actually adds a lot of tension in between your actions, forces you to THINK \"should i help this old lady here because i feel bad about her, but in the process risk to kill thousand of people that i promised to help back inside my vault?\" it's a shitty world with shitty people, but it's a world that is most closer to ours. Life won't wait for you stopping and smelling the flowers. (especially a WASTELAND that has little to no plant growth) YOU WILL WANT A REWARD for your time, you will THINK if the reward is even worth it, or maybe if the time is much more precious. Or you can try to be the goodie two shoes and get completely FUCKED in the brutal post apocalyptic world. You must understand that in helping others, you're actually helping yourself on your journey, be it some money, some really useful loot like a gun or armor, or maybe even a favor or a connection. The world changes as the time passes, and it's possible to fuck up some of the main and secondary quests as you wait or do others. Trust me on this though, time limit will have little value when you actually learn the right way to complete the game, and you absolutely can finish it 100% with the right priorities and a good skillset. \n\nNow the UI, after all these year of playing fallout, i can say that it absolutely blows donkey's saggy coconuts. I still don't even remember how to put items into backpacks and handbags, it's absolutely frustrating to sort and trade items, too many buttons on the main screen and it's pretty fucking shitty in general. No redeeming qualities here, probably some mods can fix it though. \n\nOut of fallout 2, 3 and 4 this is the one that you can actually complete without sinking a month into it. In fact, you can complete it in 20 minutes, that's right, the very end of the game is dangling right in front of you, but not realising that, you will have to sink at least 20 hours into the game learn about the world and its surrounding. That's the genius of Fallout right here."}]}
