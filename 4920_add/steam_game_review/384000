This is a free twitch.io zelda clone with a theme of \"middle ages\". This is suppose to be 1500s Frisia, netherlands. Where are the crossbowmen, Sallets and landsknechts? Probably later on in this game but if im half way through the achievements in an hour this game will end before i can get a refund. As such i do not recommend it unless you like clackity-clack \"slashers\" and the like. \nI do not know that much about mr Donia. What i gather is from this great article. http://www.badassoftheweek.com/bigpier.html\nAnd if i am to be right nothing in this game would be tolerated. It is merely a crash grab by some rather talented artists who really did have much talent in programming fun combat. Forced stealth times and constant death by the [i] thwic [/i] of a bow whilst being hoarded by a dozen idiots [i] WHO DONT EVEN HAVE SHIELDS[/i] isnt fun. \nImprove the combat/ give more variation in weaponry, lengthen the game, and fucking give some of these saxon Landsknecht a shield!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499126921, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499126921, "recommendationid": "33207973", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488648", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 38, "total_reviews": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
