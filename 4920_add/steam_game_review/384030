You only have 3 slots for selling. There are four main islands and I believe half of the beginners never leave the first island and about 1% reach the fourth one. Prepare to walk and sail a lot to complete quests (back and forth). There is no teleport between islands, no save spots deeper in the bigger dungeons. The game is new on steam but the community is very old. Mostly EU. Trolling and misleading in global chat is not prohibited, just caps, different languages and cursing.

It has everything you would expect in a 3D MMORPG and a very pleasant look. I can't say anything about the late-game which some people seem to hate, but since the game is very cheap (including stuff that you should buy), you can just play while it's fun and create a new character when the fun ends \u2013 I never played a WoW character higher than level 40, but still enjoyed that game. A lot. Playing without spending is not really an option here, but I think that's an okay model: You try the game for free and if you like it, you support the creators by buying the \u201cadditional\u201d stuff \u2013 many games do it now and it's certanly better for starters than WoW's original model where you had to pay ~40 \u20ac for the DVD before you could consider which subscription would suit you.

For one, I have an EXTREMELY average laptop with an EXTREMELY average internet connection therefore resulting in laggy gameplay, shotty connectivity and a less than stellar experience when I try and do gaming for the most part. But with Florensia the game runs great on high details, combat on the \"land\" is fluid as well as combat in the \"sea\" too so basically for gamers with an average setup you should have no troubles with the servers (i'm in NA btw). Secondly, the UI is very clean and put together, very straightforward in finding your skills, quests, maps, community etc. A clean UI is pretty important for me in terms of convenience and accessibility. Lastly I do like the differential between the land and sea combat, both are a quick learn and seems like the customization is pretty deep, although the sea combat controls i do find a bit clunky and will get some getting used to.\n\nI can not speak to higher end content like various bosses, raids (if they have them?) gear crafting and buffing and so on but if you are looking for a very chilled out mmorpg with questing, fishing, various combat interfaces and an overall smooth gameplay I suggest you give the game a shot. Another thing too, I do see a LOT of new players running around the game so I think Florensia coming to Steam has brought a nice influx on new players so thats a positive. Give it a shot, its not bad.\n\nHope this helped!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485988443, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485988443, "recommendationid": "29637570", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481957", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489793698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 39000, "steamid": "76561198052705023", "num_games_owned": 3}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is EXTREMELY buggy.
