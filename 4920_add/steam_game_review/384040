I really like the costomize option of the puck your racing! What i think you should add is online multiplayer cause its hard for so many hands on one keyboard to control the pucks and it will be fun to skype with people while racing! I also suggest adding a control options on keys to fire cause sometimes the fire key is too far away or is too hard to reach! This game has alot of modes too so you can never get bored with so many options! Highly Recommend! But please add online multiplayer! :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442032854, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442032854, "recommendationid": "17992833", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508449", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460052855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 70, "steamid": "76561198039271325", "num_games_owned": 244}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Warning, this game is addictive. If you like your fingers I would advise against playing it but holy crap is it fun. It is one of the best couch games ever in my humble opinion. Grab a couple friends, a few spare controllers and set aside an evening. There is enough variance in the maps and game modes, with some of the most creative and unique ideas I've encountered in a long time in a game of this type.\n\nAs fun as the game is there are a couple of downsides, it is incredibly taxing on your hands and fingers, and is best played in short bursts as the method of propulsion requires rapidly tapping the keys or buttons. The lack of online multiplayer hurts it as well but for \u00a35 the bots will provide plenty of entertainment as they are sufficiently challenging\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443127931, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443127931, "recommendationid": "18177135", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487425941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1197, "steamid": "76561198056519598", "num_games_owned": 46}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Impulse Revolution is a game about racing through tracks.. probably..\n\nThis game is great for 4 local player to play on..
