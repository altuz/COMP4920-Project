When I played it, it didn't have a good story but it was enjoyably bad for me. I tried Fallout New Vegas and I found it better than Fallout 3 and played it death. A side note here: I played both games on the Xbox 360. Now 2017 Sept 13, I tried out PC gaming and had fun with it but wasnt dedicated to it. When Fallout 2 was on a discount for 2 dollars I said hey why not, it's a Fallout game that I never tried. Needless to say I was impressed.\n\nFallout 2 was made in the late 1990's and had a completely different style than 3 and New Vegas. It is a turned base rpg developed by Black Isle Studios. From what I heard, this game was rushed and was in development for 1 year. 1 YEAR!! I haven't finished the game yet but there's already plenty to do. This is more challenging that 3 and New Vegas and it's the challenge that keeps you invested than leading to you ripping your skin off. This game had me use my brain more than any other game I played. You actually had to strategize in combat than just mindlessly shooting. When ever I kill anything It is satisfying, especially when their guts explode. This map isn't the biggest but every location you go to feels unique, in my opinion atleast. \n\nThe story at first sight looks simple. Go to a trader, he will tell you where the G.E.C.K is, collect it then go to your village Arroyo. Before we talk about the story, let's talk about how it's handled. You're going to actually how to use your brain to complete the story. Fallout 3 had a bad story becuase it basically did everything for you. New vegas kind of did this but you felt like you were the main character. In Fallout 2, you feel like you could change anything. You actually felt like someone who had an influence. Now lets talk about the story. In one of the tasks on saving Arroyo, it expands to something more. In your way to find the trader that will help you, you find a town with things to do. I don't want to spoil much but at some point your involved in a gang war and your able to become a slaver. You went from finding a trader to being involved in slavery. \n\nThe characters aren't the most memeorable, in my opinion, but you certainly remember  them more than Fallout 3. Most characters don't have voice actors but that's okay becuase the dialogue they tell you is great and beyond the time it was made in and holds up to this day. You have many dialogue choices with them and they are all interesting, including theirs. There are talking heads, characters with voice actors and are typically important in someway. When I listen to them, the voice actors do a great job at keeping you invested in what they are saying. \n\nWhat can I say about this game? I didn't finish it yet and I nearly wrote a whole essay. The game will keep you hooked at the cost of you thinking more. If you played Fallout 3, New Vegas, 4 as one of your first fallout games you will likely not enjoy this game. However, it is different and has the enjoyment of the modern Fallout Games \nbut you have to use your brain more and challenge this ruthless wasteland. Get this game on discount and prepare for the different style of gaming you don't see often to truly enjoy this game. I will post a full review on it when I have finished the game.\n THE FULL REVIEW AFTER DEFEATING GAME:\nChrist was this game an experience. This game made you feel like a badass, especially after you defeated the end-game. This game has balance of seriousness and just silly. When I looked back on it, there were many pop culture references that went over my head. Throughout my experience I've done and seen so many things from murdering children, driving a car, associating with mutants and a deathclaw, finding Chinese ripoffs of Star-Wars, to becoming a fucking pornstar. This game is absurd yet also has a mature edge to it. In my opinion, when serious moments came I felt threatened. One of my first few encounters was when there were raiders killing a whole innocent family, including children. Those are one of the plenty serious moments in Fallout 2. You won't quite have an emotional experience depending on who you are but you still feel in the game and the actions you have done. That is represented in an end-game slideshow showing the effects you made on the wasteland. It can either make you feel proud or disapointed. You can play after the final section of the game however I do not know if it is before you peform an action making you get to the final section or literally after the end game since I did not put time afterwards. Let's talk about other parts of the game I may not have mentioned.\nWhen you get the most powerful armor you can find in the wasteland, the game is still tough on you. Defeating just one deathclaw can be a challenge, even with the armor. Eventually you'll gather up plenty of companions which will help you a lot. I will continue this review some time after becuase it is getting a bit late for me. Good night everyone and buy 2, New Vegas, and maybe Fallout 1 once I buy it on sale.\nNOW: Okay, okay.... Fallout 1 as on sale, or as free, on its 20th birthday. I said to get Fallout 1 when it was on sale and it was free and know you will never get it for free becuase you didnt pay attention to me. I'm going to post my current review on Fallout 1."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506879020, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35390434", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198045765418", "num_reviews": 318, "last_played": 1506163960, "num_games_owned": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "playtime_forever": 58}, "timestamp_updated": 1506879020, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The game's story takes place in 2241, 80 years after the events of Fallout and 164 years after the war. It tells the story of the original hero's descendant and their quest to save their primitive tribe from starvation by finding an ancient environmental restoration machine known as the Garden of Eden Creation Kit(GECK).\n\nThe player is free to move at will until they enter into combat. Combat gives them a number of action points to move, fire, check their equipment, reload and the like. When a player uses up all of their action points, they end their turn and enemies start theirs. Combat and completion of jobs or quests rewards the player with experience points with which they can level up their characters and apply beneficial perks to become more suited to the dangerous post-apocalyptic world. General gameplay consists of traveling and interacting with local inhabitants and organizations to complete goals and aid or inhibit the NPCs. The player's actions dictate what future story or gameplay opportunities are available. Mature themes such as alcohol consumption, drug usage and sex are present. Organized crime, prostitution and slavery are major elements of the setting. Character creation is based on the SPECIAL roleplaying system.\n\nThe Fallout games both allow you to create truly individualized characters, which you can then role-play essentially as you see fit. In the Fallout games you can choose to play a righteous avenger, a nonviolent scientist, a self-motivated bigot, an evil sociopath, a jinxed moron, or some personalized variation of these character types, and you'll experience the game quite differently depending upon your character's attributes and actions. While other role-playing games boast of \"dozens\" of available player character types, your experience with any of those characters will often be almost identical to all of the others except you'll use different weapons in combat. No game does a better job than Fallout 2 at actually giving you opportunities to act in a distinctive manner representative of the role you choose to play with your character. A smooth talking, highly intelligent character may be able to persuade other characters to reveal their secrets, while a dim witted thug character may be unable to express anything other than basic intentions and risks being manipulated and sold into slavery. Fallout 2 is the real deal when it comes to roleplaying, and its open-ended nature makes it far more replayable than the average game of the genre.\n\nIn Fallout 2 your character can be accompanied by a number of computer-controlled nonplayer characters. Unlike in Fallout, nonplayer characters can now wear armor and gain proficiency in skills as your character does, making them more consistently useful during the course of the game.\n\nGame contains dozens of subtle and more often not so subtle references to cult movies, television icons, and other aspects of popular culture. Interesting meetings on map like bramins, cows, who play cards. Or maybe king Artur fighting with a monster? Monty Python anyone?\n\nIts awesome storyline, huge detailed world and well written scripts, Fallout 2 gave me many hours of absorbing gameplay."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505230068, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503479", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34903320", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197980787602", "num_reviews": 44, "last_played": 1505807057, "num_games_owned": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3997}, "timestamp_updated": 1505235816, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1]Timeless classic[/h1]\n\nSo for the first time, I played this game in 1999 and since then I have been replaying it once in a couple of years.

You will never see all the game content in one playthrough, as in Bethesda games.\n\nIn what other game you can marry then become a slaver with a cool looking \"slaver\" mark on your forehead, then sell your wife and companions into slavery, then spend all the money in casinos and on hookers, then drop everything and travel in New Reno to fly on Jet and be a porn star?\n\nAt the end, the words \"Role Playing\" in the title is not just for beauty. You can play as different characters and always get different results.\n\nI often see how some folks compare F1 and F2 with F3, NV and F4, which is a wrong thing to do since these are completely different games.
