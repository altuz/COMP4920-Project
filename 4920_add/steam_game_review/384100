The stealth mechanism is very new in this genre and permits different style of gameplay and the three different game types give us a vast array of options.\n\nProbably it needs maps with above-ground paths and a game mode where players have limited lifes with no crystal to capture. I think it could be more interesting with these options.\n\nSometimes it remembers me of an old game that I was using to play on PlayStation with friends: Blast Chamber.\n\nCan't wait for online multiplayer...

The idea for the game is great, but the execution really doesn't live up to that promise. The visual design of the game is too busy, making it hard to see where you're shooting, where you're being shot from, and what's going on. Even with the lava pits, which ought to be clear, it's hard to see where you can go safely and where will kill you.\n\nI don't like the control mechanic either. It really needs the ability to shoot just by pointing with the right stick, without having to press RT as well. I tried it with a Steam Controller, which is abysmal, and with an XBox 360 controller, which is less bad but still pretty cumbersome.\n\nAll of these factors mean you never really get to the point of using the stealth mechanics, which just makes the game feel simplistic and pointless. Overall, I'd say this is a great concept, but it feels more like a game jam game than a refined commercial product.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462951992, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1462951992, "recommendationid": "22907459", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525689", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483477251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 244, "steamid": "76561198019507440", "num_games_owned": 907}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fatal Error is a local multiplayer that you don't want to miss if you love the genere.

FATAL ERROR IS DEATH. \n\nFatal Error is a bundle of fun with your loved ones that you want to kill in a virtual environment.\n\nThe game contains many promising aspects that will over time develop into a really polished yet simple gameplay that will bring your friends and family together at the same time as dividing them as you slaughter each other and gloat like a drunken goat. Better bring those apples. \n\nThe current state of the Early Access is limited to only quick match with three maps and only a few settings but the developers seem like the productive type and will give out updates every two weeks based on feedback and their own design. Mighty fine and dandy!\n\nLook out for this game in its later stages for sure. If you want to jump in and play with some friends on a night where all you have is each other then be my guest. There will be a lot more content and stuff to do later on so thats cool.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who wants to help shape the future of its gameplay and especially if you have some spare time to bash out on your friends or overpowered computer bots.\n\nThank you for you time.
