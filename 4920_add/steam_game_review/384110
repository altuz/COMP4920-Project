That being said, it is definitely a cult classic and almost avant garde in design so it is not for everyone. If you can't handle walking simulator this game is certainly not for you. \n\nYou set out as one of three characters in a town infected by a deadly plague that nobody knows how to cure. Pathologic is not a mechanical game but focuses more on the relationships between characters in the town. A lot of time will be spent in the game just reading what people have to say to you, and then reading again between the lines. \n\nOne of Pathologic's strongest and most interesting features is the fully fleshed out culture. Once you are a few hours into the game, you will know each of the three families in charge of the town, what family members they have, rules for children in the town, what kind of people can mend your clothes vs your weapons, and so much more. Even trading in the game is different between shopkeepers, guards, and children so you have to know who values what and why. \n\nThe survival aspect of Pathologic hangs in a delicate balance all game. In most games you have one health bar, occasionally a game will spice things up and give you two. But Pathologic gives you like five. You can die from being shot, from being infected, from hunger, from sleep deprivation, or from getting a bad reputation and being arrested. I think I covered them all. The point is, decisions in game typically try and play with the balance you try so desperately to keep. \n\nPathologic makes the player think for themselves in order to be rewarded.

The only things that I dislike about this game are:\n\n1) The game is not as hard as IPL have advertised it. I don't really understand why some people find this game hard - you always have enough time to finish the main quest and the sidequests before the day ends; you can always find enough bottles of water to swap them for bandages to heal fully; even if you don't have enough money for food you can always find enough junk in the bins to swap it for food; you can easily dodge the infection clouds etc.\n2) Klara's and Burakh's storylines are less developed than Bachelor's storyline.\n\nFortunately IPL have promised to fix these 2 issues in Pathologic 2.\n\n[b] Russian [/b]\n\n\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u044f \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430-\u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b. \u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c:\n\n1) \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u0436 \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f. \u042f \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e, \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0435\u0451 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 - \u0443 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c;

The game is worth this much. And I'm going to tell you why. Please read till the end.\n\nGraphics ---\n\nI know the game is older, released way older since this is a \"HD remaster\" and the game had just finally had a proper english translation. The graphics would to today quality, be ugly as sin and does not hold up well.(For example Gothic, is a game that yeah the graphics are meh but they hold up well. Same with Legacy of Kain/Soul Reaver)\n\nBut being an older man in his 30s, I am used to games like this. The graphics to me, for the time, are great. Though the main characters look just fine, many of the townfolk are just ugly as sin especially the children. The buildings look great, the rain effect is great same with the flash of lightning. The ground is kinda meh, the roads look good and the foliage looks great.\n\nSo for the time it was released, I'd give it a 6/10.\n\n----\n\nMusic/Sounds----\n\nThe music and sounds in this game are great and line up well for the time. They do dramatically give you a good mood to fit it. I don't have issues with the sound/music at all.\n\n10/10\n\nGameplay----\n\nOk, this is where it goes down hill. I know it's suppose psychologic survival(maybe horror?)experience but I am missing out on. Perhaps I am too logical or not logical enough on it. I didn't like the flow of the game, especially since you have to walk in a straight line or else you don't walk fast. This city is huge by the way. There are a lot of \"empty\" houses you can't get into. A lot of houses that you can lack any proper markers so you have to constantly check your map. A \"arrow\" or waypoint system would have been nice to have for this. Like you being able to put a marker on the map and then it points  an arrow on it. At the time when this game came out, this wasn't a new thing, a lot of games had nav markers.\n\nI wish there was spoken dialogue instead of having to read, perhaps i'm getting lazier but it would have been nice. Perhaps for Pathologic 2 they will do so but as right now, I dislike the dialogue in the game. You have to read into it more than you have too and sometimes even over assume. It seems almost my choices throughout the days it doesn't change much unless there is more than just the ending you can recieve. I only played the Bachlor but later succumbed to starvation cause of lack of money I suppose I was being too nice.\n\nThe combat is very horrid, at one time I had to follow one of those steppe monsters to find some guy's son whom I had to talk to. He then once finished showing me, open attacks and would not stop following me. Though it's quite easy to go in for a punch and back up for him to miss. I never could figure out either why random towns folk after burning one of the women started to randomly draw their fists and punch some women to death.\n\nGameplay 5/10.\n\nAll in all, I wish steam had a maybe money or a side hand. Cause I know a few friends who would love this game but me personally, at where I am at now. I don't care for the game. Perhaps in due time I will finish it, perhaps in due time I will not but this is my opinion on the matter.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506160679, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506160679, "recommendationid": "35149112", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485580", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 170, "total_reviews": 200, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 30}}
