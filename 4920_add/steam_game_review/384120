I thought the game had fairly good level design, ranging from casual runs to more intense speed runs. Usually coins guide you along, but sometimes they can bait you out of a trickjump so be mindful of that. Its a one button game where you jump from cart to cart. The animation for jumping looks and feels nice, the jumping feels strangely kinetic and satisfying, and there game has an odd sense of emulated physics that was kinda nice. I noticed a slight auto correct in speed levels where the platforms would sometimes alter when and how they start their motion to match the arc of my jump as an ease of use casual jump assist which I suppose is a good or a bad but I thought it cut down on frustration. I thought the game audiovisually made an incredibly strong showing for games of this flash/tablet category. The casual and simplistic one button nature of the gameplay DEMANDS GAMEPAD, as this kind of experience is hard to justify as a sit down PC entertainment experience and is way more suited for the couch.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501730669, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506056702, "recommendationid": "33984303", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 10}}
