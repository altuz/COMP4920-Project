The screen shaking along with the zoomed in view and having to change your aim's direction means your screen will jitter around like crazy. The graphics are extremely poor. Music and sound effects are okay. As others have pointed there is no real progression, unlocks, lives, levels, just a bunch of crates, red saucers zerging you and thats it. Difficulty is pretty high, Xbox 360 pad detected correctly. This one is slated for removal in the interest of library declutter.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494139415, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506061071, "recommendationid": "31597542", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 35, "total_reviews": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 7}}
