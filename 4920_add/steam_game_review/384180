While the graphics are certainly robust, the options and controls are clearly designed to accommodate for consoles, resulting in a lack of advanced PC customizability and options, often resulting in low fps and other performance issues.

And the single player part of the game is also decent enough to allow you to play a casual game, or a more intense high stakes poker game whenever you want.\n\nThere are in-game MTs but those are only for chips (you get some for free every 24 hours, and the amount you receive goes up as you level up your character), which you will never need to buy, as the game provides you with plenty of chips for beating the single player modes.\nI was amazed when I discovered the only part of the game that requires real money isn't even remotely essential or required in any way. It's just a bonus for anyone who wants a huge amount of chips, or perhaps a few extra so they don't have to save up for some of the really expensive character customisation items.\n\nYou can edit your characters gender, face, hair, facial hair, body, clothes, accessories (watch, ear ring, tatooes, etc), and do various amusing emojis during a game.\n\nIn conclusion as a totally free to play (from the first day you play it until the last) this is an exceptionally good game, and easily the best poker game available on PC at the time of writing this. \n\nI highly recommend it!\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488078148, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488078148, "recommendationid": "30184273", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508845", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501969512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5600, "steamid": "76561198168083979", "num_games_owned": 24}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great fun!

enjoyed the aspect of personalizing your own in game character but as of now i cannot reccomend this game, primarily due to the RNG algorhithm.\n\nIf you have never played Poker before you may enjoy this particular game because it frequently rewards high hands to multiple players in a single hand (particularly in tournament) in order to make the game interesting to casual players, i've seen where a single player drops the nuts, not once or twice but 5 times in a row almost af if the RNG is not based per single card draw but based on hands per player......in real Poker this is non-existent except in rare cases, the norm for this game is multiple characters with pocket high cards, Trips and Flop Flushes...after a while (particularly if you play alot of other Poker games) it becomes rather obvious, which is rather unfortunate because i think on the outside it can be a rather fun and interesting game were it not for the poor RNG algorhithm due to the fact that it punishes experienced players by removing the need to engage in any kind of strategy or knowledge of drop percentages.\n\nI may come back to this game and a later time to check out if they have gone through the trouble of changing this, but until that happens i would not recommend this game ESPECIALLY if you want to learn the way Poker is really played.....believe me, you will end up in Vegas losing alot because you are not getting flushes every draw, the sad thing is the game should want to draw in serious players who will want to stick around and not casual players who want to fiddle around for a few hands just to uninstall, and even if you do just want to play casual or you find the Poker to be rather slow and boring, the developers could easily just add other game modes (WSOP offers Omaha and GoP offers Royal Poker) if they want to have games that offer gameplay based around multiple large hands which would be an easy fix, but as of right now it feels like the theory that the Slots near the Casino entrances put out more in order to bring customers in...it's still a game of skill and chance, but it seems like this game has brought down the bar on the level of skill needed and upped the chance for large hands for everyone in order to win.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485040576, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1490342494,
