Whenever asked why I played them, a typical response was, \"because they relax me.\" Until playing ABZU, I never realized how wrong I'd been. It was this game that showed me what a relaxing game was. Game may be a bit of a misnomer, however. ABZU was more of an interactive virtual ocean with a plot. No goals were spelled out for me. There were no real moves to master with my Steam controller. I was given a few basic commands on how to interact with the world and sent on my way. Yet I never had trouble figuring out what to do or where I should go. The level designs, if you can call them levels, were beautifully designed and intuitive. And speaking of beautiful, the depictions of sea life were gorgeous. I found myself gasping and smiling on numerous occassions. \n\nIn case it hasn't been clear by my descriptions so far, ABZU is not a game you beat. It is a game you discover. Part of that means that if you are the type to play a game once and set it aside, you will find ABZU to be quite short. So if what I've described doesn't quite appeal to you, you may want to either give this game a pass or buy it when it is on sale. However for those who want to try something very different and experience a game where rushing to the end is not the point, I recommend ABZU without hesitation. \n\nAs a final note, I read some reviews saying that the game does not work with ultrawide monitors. That is not true. I was able to get the full resolution out of my LG ultrawide, and it was a thing of beauty to behold. The trick is you cannot launch the game while in Big Picture Mode. Big Picture doesn't do 21:9.
