But the themes and level designs are great.\nCombat is really difficult and brutal as it should be, but be prepared to have to restart when you encounter situations you are in no way prepared for.\nThe lore in the game isn't technically canon, but a secondary source to the primary games, but in my opinion it presents a much better perspective about the Brotherhood of Steel in particular then you will see in any other Fallout game. They are not knights in shining armor here to \"do good.\" You will also be lied to outright by the narrator, and you will notice this if you pay attention to what is happening in the game, and so you are expected to believe the propaganda from the BoS but the game won't shy away from showing you that things aren't exactly as your faction presents them.\nThis is something that was consistent in earlier fallouts but had been entirely forgotten by Bethesda, they made the games so black and white and stupidly cartoonish they had completely lost the original essence the games had.\nThe game does have some clunkiness to it, mainly with the unit pathing, and could really use some alternate animations in certain very specific situations to make it perfect.\nIn my opinion, Fallout Tactics is the third best in the series, (behind Fallout 1 and 2) but also one of the best Tactical RPGs I've ever played. I can't go back to Jagged Alliance 2 without frustration after playing this.\nThere's nothing more exhilirating than being in a full scale battle having rockets flying overhead, while swarms of mutants are storming your position and often killing their own in the crossfire."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505103507, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503701", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34876469", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197975982580", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1399012332, "num_games_owned": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1474}, "timestamp_updated": 1505103507, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Surprisingly good spinoff in the Fallout world.\nIts clunky and barely cannon, but manages to be fun.\nRecommended."}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504625731, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489893", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34758932", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197991542822", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1411435588, "num_games_owned": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 503}, "timestamp_updated": 1504625731, "received_for_free": false, "review": "mmmmmmmmmm its ok i guess"}]}
