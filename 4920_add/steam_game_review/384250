It helps to make the game a little more accesible to me (though it's still incredibly challenging). The art is great, and I love the little dialogues. When I saw all the corpses I used in the first level piling up, I realized I will never ever ever beat this game, but that's ok, I'll keep trying. Some day maybe I'll be able to beat level one without corpses. Great game, would reccomend, especially if you're looking for a challenge.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497543855, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497543855, "recommendationid": "32442366", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505292", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497969698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22, "steamid": "76561198050339951", "num_games_owned": 178}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game, good and interesting mechanics  and a very solid implemntation on the platforming side.
