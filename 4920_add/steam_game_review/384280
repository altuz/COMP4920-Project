Took my little blocky caterpillar ninja through his high contrast world, gathered all of the coins, and liked it enough to publish a poorly written review for my Xbox Indie site. I didn't see much reason to return.\n\nI was wrong. The big improvement here are certainly the graphics. The old shoebox now looks like an actual ninja guy. The scant enemies and levels look much better and animate smoothly. We now can enjoy some impressive cinematic art between levels as well, and everything just pops. For a game with a mostly two color palette, it looks really good. Kinda like a 2-D MadWorld. Well, maybe not, but it oozes style.\n\nPlatforming is tight and a joy to play. If you're like me, then you're a fast approaching middle-aged white guy, but then you'd also find the level design strict and at times maddening but always fair. You'd also hate the rising lava levels which Mute Crimson+ employs on occasion, stressing out our fat middle-aged hearts to dangerous limits. Welcomed modern conveniences of infinite lives and checkpoints will help keep your sanity intact, though they're far from a crutch. An optional goal of finding hidden coins in a level provide further challenge, and it can be tough to secure it and make it out alive.\n\nThere's still a bit of clunkiness present what with the inexplicable arrow zones which alter the control of the ninja, but these spots add some much needed variety to the game and help flesh out a journey otherwise dominated by jumping and slashing. I'm so glad there are people out there who remember that platformers can exist between the extremes of masochist memorization and cakewalk adventure fetch-quests. Mute Crimson+ feels so refreshing by comparison, even after playing the XBLIG original. It's not going to blow anyone away, but it's an immensely satisfying game all the same.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499981962, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499982120, "recommendationid": "33512665", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504486252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 52, "steamid": "76561198054766153", "num_games_owned": 437}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's not a horrible game, especially for the price, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends. The graphics are very pleasing and the retro aesthetic is well executed. But my big gripe about it is that the controls are very stiff, and almost all of it's difficulty and frustration stems from the stiff controls, rather than challenging enemies or level design.\n\nMost of the levels and jumps I think would be easy if the control was fluid like Mario or Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, for examples. But your character has no weight or momentum and things such as climbing up a wall and getting to stand at the top of that wall make you have to circle jerk the analog stick just right to hit a precise angle to climb over the corner of the top block. Up climbs up and left or right makes him get on top of the ledge, but you need to have him at the right spot for him to get on. And so many jumps require you to cilmb up or down walls and fall off them to jump to the next platform. The biggest example of this is the levels where lava rises. Obstacles include singular floating coulmns of walls you climb up/down, fall off then hit jump in mid air at the right spot to land on the next platform, all before the lava gets you. But he never wants to fall off or climb onto the top while he's climbing the walls. It's as if he's glued to the walls, and it feels awkward the way you have to move the joystick to do it right. It feels like an interruption rather than another movement.\n\nJumps feel weird, it always feels like you're gonna miss a platform but you make it anyways, and other times you need precise timing when to double jump, but the lack of momentum makes you under estimate the jump, because it feels like it should put you higher but it doesn't. It's hard to explain but it's noticable to feel when playing. The jump mechanics are not satisfying. All of the level design and enemies are based around the awkward controls it seems. The game is very much a nod to Ninja Gaiden, But even Ninja Gaiden's controls were fluid, responsive, and satisfying. It's like the game opted out Ninja Gaiden's BS enemy placement  and replaced it with awkward controls.\n\nAnother thing that feels weird is attacking while in the air. You need to hit the attack button slightly before you get close to the enemy, because of his swing animation, but if you do it when you're too close, the hit won't register fast enough. And too close doesn't mean when you're already on top of the enemy, it still looks like there's plenty of room for your attack. So then instinct makes you want to hit the attack button too early, since  the animation shows him bringing the sword down the entire time in the air after the button's pressed until he lands, so you think the sword touching the enemy will count, but it doesn't and that kills you too. It's such a counterintuitive timing, and fairly easy once you get used to the weirdness of it, but again it makes for a non-fluid, non-flowing gameplay.\n\nAnother annoyance is the dialogue. Whoever wrote it thought the \"All your base are belong to us\" meme was way too funny and misuses grammar intentionally in every sentence. It becomes borderline racist, making you wonder if they're doing it because they're trying to play off a stereotypical ninja, but I just think they find gibberish that funny. Instead it makes me dread the cutscenes.\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad game. If you want an inexpensive game with a retro, nostalgic feeling and are running out of others on steam, this may be for you. But do keep in mind the controls and gameplay before buying. It takes some getting used to.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504487657, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504560631, "recommendationid": "34725139", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503351", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504326973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 384, "steamid": "76561197996627259", "num_games_owned": 1116}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I can't tell if the dialogue is intentionally bad to evoke the poorly translated games on the NES, or if it's actually just a terrible translation. Either way, it makes an already super plain story even more unbearable.\n\nOn top of that, the game is pretty middling. The controls are sometimes not as precise as you want them to be, and sometimes you'll end up doing something you didn't intend to, such as stick to a block when you wanted to get on top of it, or jump slightly higher than you intended to. There's also a general lack of momentum to your character's movement, so every jump feels very stiff and rigid.\n\nThe level design is alright, with each world featuring some new game mechanic. The second world features wind, another world introduces teleporters. However, each world feels liek it goes on for a bit too long, and can sometimes get a little repetitive.\n\nThe art ranges from acceptable to pretty bad. Even considering this is a throwback title, there are areas where it looks like the art was made in MS Paint using the spray tool. The design of the main character is fairly bland as well, but I will say that he animates nicely. The bosses also all look pretty good and animate well.\n\nMusic is good, too.\n\nAt some points, I had a good time with the game, but at other points it felt very draining and frustrating. However, this frustration was not the good kind, it came from the less than ideal controls and the repetitive nature of some worlds. It's not the worst game, but I would say that unless you're really desperate for a retro platformer and you've already exhausted the many other options out there, that you should steer clear of this one.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504328082, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504328438, "recommendationid": "34676319", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503093", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 54, "total_reviews": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
