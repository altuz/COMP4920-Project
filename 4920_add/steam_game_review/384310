In it you manage 8 characters each with their own backstories who survive a plane crash on an island. To survive you must gather resources such as wood rocks food and herbs, while using them to heal and feed your survivors and build up your base. There also is a very interesting map system where you send people out to explore then you can explore and scavenge the place. Once there you will have to pass rng tests of stealth to do anything. You have the trade off of either using as strong character to not take as much damage or a stealthy character who can try to not take damage via rng or take more damage if they fail the stealth check.\n\nTL;DR if you enjoy survival games pick this one up its mostly unique and fun to play for more hours than the price suggests.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504467767, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504467767, "recommendationid": "34720023", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 64, "total_reviews": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 26}}
