I suppose I never got to the end, but I assume there is one shortly. If there isnt, there should be, because the game was long enough. There just needed to be more Issac-style unlocks, or something, to spice it up.\n  \nCoolest thing found: Sword with shitty damage, but the inclusion of a slow debuff. \n\nShittiest thing we had to \"play around\" when trying to play the game: A lost sense of ennui and desperation as we wander endlessly backtracking looking for the damned exit.\n\n\"end game\" meant a few points invested in unlocks, and getting a few lucky chests for sweet unique gear. High level swag is easily found on the map too, but learning not to get hit while using these resources is the majority of the difficulty. once you keep that in mind, the difficulty curve seems flat.\n\n7.5/10, great game, but unless something new happenes (Mods pls.
