I'm sure there are ways to fix it but I felt like it was not worth it since I own the Playstation versions. However it seems to be a common problem with most people, it's unplayable. This is a true shame because MDK is another great game by interplay. The guys who brought classic games in like GIants: Citizen Kabuto, Armed and Dangerous, Baldur's Gate and many many more. I suggest if your interested in this game, then you would definetly be interested in those listed games and more."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504433974, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499700", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34707910", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197992610785", "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1500488998, "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 29}, "timestamp_updated": 1504433974, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Dont buy, game is not working properly."}]}
