The bombs enter the level from a set point and you have a handful of tools you can use to send the bombs where you want them to go. Gravity is enough to get them started but when they stall out, they roll into each other and explode, which means the bomb in front gets a boost from the bomb behind it. This can create some very interesting and surprising situations, especially on levels where you have more tools available. (What tools you have varies from level to level.)\n\nUltimately the goal is to blow up all the rocks on the level that have gems in them so you can collect money from them and move onto the next level. As you beat levels you get experience points that help you unlock other kinds of bombs that have special abilities, as well as upgrades for bombs you already have.\n\nBecause it's a puzzle game, there are levels when you're probably going to get stuck. There are hints available for every level you can activate if you're at that point where it's going from fun to frustrating, but I haven't had that happen. (Yet.)\n\n+Pros: Lots of levels with lots of possible solutions. A pretty concise tutorial and good controls. \n\n-Cons: You cannot move tools around while bombs are moving. I understand why they did this but there are moments when it can slow down the pace of the game till you learn how it works.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442866613, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442866705, "recommendationid": "18136691", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521328", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443295258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561198044191609", "num_games_owned": 24}, "votes_funny": 8, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "My wife threatened to leave if I continued playing so many video games. She hates first person shooters, MMO's, MMORPG's, Tower defense, Horror, Strategy and pretty much anything I play on the PC.  She said why the eff would a man spend over 2K hours playing some damn video game.  As an ultimatum, she said she will no longer give me access to her magic cave until I stopped wasting my time with the damn video games.  Suffice it to say, it was rough 3 weeks.  A friend of mine told me about a ground breaking game that even the angriest of wife could not refuse.  I bought Red Fuse, my wife played Red Fused and discovered how much fun video games can be.  She does not resent my computer anymore. She no longer thinks I love my video games more than her.  Red Fuse opened her eyes...... but more importantly it re-opened her magic cave.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455581619, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1455581955, "recommendationid": "21242275", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503586", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465190006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 344, "steamid": "76561198079683599", "num_games_owned": 19}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A pretty unique game about causing lots of explosions and getting money for it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454267245, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454267245, "recommendationid": "20879116", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
