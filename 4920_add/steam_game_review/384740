He likes Machinarium and we play through that game over and over.\n   By playing other games, he has developed the ability to accurately use  WASD and the  mouse  to  control DOG. \n   He likes the graphics and his questions and my answers have made the story clear in his mind. He likes to solve problems\nand isn't easily discouraged.\n   We have played through the Mines Chapter and look forward to finishing the game. I've told him that I think there is a cat at the end of the story so he is eager to get there. \n   He likes to start every session  at Chapter 1. Repeating success is important for kids his age so he is not bored by replaying chapters as he often finds something new he missed in earlier play.\n   This game, like Machinarium, will be a favorite of his and I am sure he will play it through over and over.\n\n   I heartily recommend this game especially to grandparents (or parents that have the time and the patience) that are\nlooking for a violence-free game wih a story to play with kids or  grandkids.\n\n                                                          **************   5 Stars out of 5 Stars  *********************", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505239972, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505239972, "recommendationid": "34905984", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541820", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501852540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 60, "steamid": "76561198315626015", "num_games_owned": 50}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "VERY short game, compelling story.
