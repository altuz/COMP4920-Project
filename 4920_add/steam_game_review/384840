Tossed into the amiguous Board Game category for that reason.\nStrategy Ressource Management Visual Novel, Skyrim Lockpicking hybrid with rpg zombie survival elements.\nNarrative does not salvage or wrap the elements together.\n\nManage 5 ressources by expending actions across exploration, survival tasks, managing camp and assessing risk for encounters. Spend action points to do stuff, resting consumes food, camp upgrades require materials etc. The minigames for combat, or salvaging ressources are slot machines and a ghetto version of skyrim's lockpicking. You get choice and consequence visual novel style sections that can alter how close you are to other NPC survivors. Its a barebones implementation at best. There are a few pre-scripted events and some hints of a personal bio for each character but after seeing what the fully fledged simulation mode had to offer I did not care to bother checking out the version with all of that content stripped out just for the so called story as I do not believe the setting, quality of the writing and level of animation deserves it. The game is filled with static images with no animation whatsoever. The sound design was simple but appropriate. For a better simulation play Zafehouse Diaries. For a better narrative experience play Telltale The Walking Dead.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500156187, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503549656, "recommendationid": "33570501", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 19}}
