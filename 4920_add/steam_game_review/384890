I finished the game in about 4 hours total (left it running through the day on accident, thus the extra hours on my record).\n\nThere's nothing open ended to the game, it's all about finding the exact right string of commands to get to the next part of the story.

Well, I don't play them often but when Hack RUN was announced, I was intrigued, so, I buy it. And I bought also ZERO.\n\nI've finally decided to play it after finishing Hack RUN and I knew where I would land.  Flashy green on a black screen with commands only to type and nothing else around. And like the previous game, the big negative point is the lack of music. The only sound is the sound of your keyboard (and... I'm letting you discover it).\n\nLike for Hack RUN, you're staying in the game for 2 main reasons:\n- You want to know the story\n- These achievements unlocking each time you're hacking, or receiving, or... in other words, it can be a quick release of achievements.\n\nBecause, let's be honest: typing always the same thing because the piece of information you need is always in an email isn't really captivating. Well, thanks god, there is at least 5% of the game that aren't about typing m and e.\n\nAnd yet, if typing the same thing is boring, trying to find passwords, or usernames, or any clue that can help you is very very enjoyable. And be aware of something: the game is more sneaky for the password, even relying on your knowledge of muscle cars, classical composers or any name that could fit a dog (still puzzled how that password can be found). But the best here is the inclusion of voicemails... if you're used to English. Else, it will be perhaps a little harder for you.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm waiting for the third game to come so that.
