DON'T BUY!!!\n\nDeveloper took the money and ran. Developer asked for input to game on 7/23/15 and has not since replied in the forum or to the emails I have sent. Game still crashes, mouse works sometimes, graphics freak out on some levels. Game is not playable. They have another game that looks like a clone of this one called Defenders of Time.
