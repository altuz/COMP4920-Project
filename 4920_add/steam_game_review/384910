The TL;DR is that getting 4 pretty good point-and-click adventures for this price is pretty great. However, if you'd like to look over what all is offered, I wrote up each review. When you purchase the set, I highly recommend going to the community centre and downloading the launchers made by Zeikar, otherwise, getting the first 3 games to play will be difficult.\n\nShadows of the servants:\nPlayed from a 1st person point of view, this first installment seems almost dependent on the \"pop on screen\" kind of scare tactics. The voices are difficult to understand, but many important \"clues\" are not captioned. You must have the sound on to catch everything. I seriously recommend a notebook of some kind and very fast writing skills.\nIn my personal opinion, there are many puzzles in this installment that make little to no logical sense. There is no hint system or map, so you are required to go back and check everything on a regular basis. On the plus side, when you find the correct item, it will wiggle in front of the hot spot, so you can use a little process of elimination. Regardless, I'd be surprised if you don't have to look up help a few times while you play.\n\nBeyond the Spirit's Eye:\nAlso played from the 1st person point of view, there is less \"pop up\" action, but this installment is still very creepy. More of the speech is captioned, but the voices are still very difficult to understand. If you want to know the twist at the end, make sure you've got your headphones on, because none of that is captioned.\nThe puzzles in this game are much more logically sound. There were very few times I was at a complete loss as to what came next. That being said, there are a lot more red herrings and many items that are very difficult to find, if you don't click every millimetre of your screen. On the positive side, there is a map included in this game. It's not super useful, but it does help you travel to 5 main areas of the adventure.\nBy far, the most annoying part of this game is that there is no way to skip the animated scenes. There are certain rooms that play a full animation every time you go in them, and there's no choice but to sit back and watch the same scene over and over again.\n\nTomb of Zoljir:\nPlayed from a 1st person point of view, the most immediate difference in this installment is that you can actually understand the voices. The captioning is done much better than the previous two, and the graphics are noticeably better. However, despite the much better captioning, you absolutely have to have headphones available. One puzzle, in particular, requires you to listen to the clicks of a wheel, and the different sound is the correct choice. The map is much more useful than in Beyond the Spirit's eye.\nOf the four, this is the one that I think has the most content. I spent the longest on it, and 90% of the puzzles are pretty straight forward. There's still a lot of traveling back and forth, but not as much as the previous 2. \n\nSociety of the Serpent Moon:\nPlayed from a 3rd person perspective, this installment moves very slow because you're always waiting for your character to walk across the screen. On the plus side, it gives you tons of time to think. They've made it so that you can double-click on the entrance/exit and leave a room immediately. They've also made it so that you push Tab and can see your entrances/exits. There are very few repeating animated scenes (unlike Spirit's Eye), but you can skip any or all of them with a simple right-click.\nThis game is pretty much stand-alone when compared to the others. Installments 1-3 reference one another and have very similar feels while this game seems to be a completely different story.\nThe puzzles follow logic. Very few red herrings, very few \"WTF?!?\" moments. A map allows you to travel from one area to the next with very few problems, once you find it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441689562, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441689572, "recommendationid": "17938748", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530095", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454126535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 604, "steamid": "76561198120430388", "num_games_owned": 89}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I have thoroughly enjoyed these games and I am very sorry I have finished.
