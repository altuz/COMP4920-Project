It is now October of 2017. It never worked for me. I don't think it ever worked for anyone. But I will touch on that later. Every four or five months I would check in on it. But after a while I gave up. Why should I waste my time? The developers say they were tricked by a member of their team. That he stabbed them in the back. Possible. I'm not accusing them of otherwise. Thats why I held off making a review. I gave them the benefit of the doubt. There are some bad people out there. They could still be working hard for all I know. I haven't seen a news update or anything in a long time. Last I saw was  a picture of some in game models and a description of the possible future. That was Februrary or March of 2017. Fine. Maybe the project is on hold. . But that brings me to the reason I am even making this review at all.\n\nIt is insane to me is that  this game is available for purchase if it never worked. This is straight up unethical for it to be on here. I don't know why steam has it up still in the first place.  To my knowledge no one who purchased the game got it to work. Don't believe me? Use some search engine. Searcg these forums. Look at the developer's youtube channel. Find me some gameplay. I can't seem to locate ANY. Somebody. Upload some sort of gameplay and prove me wrong.\n\nIf the developers are going through a hard time, I understand. But remove it until you have a playable game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507158303, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507158303, "recommendationid": "35482161", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 16}}
