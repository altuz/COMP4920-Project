So here is an overal review of the game:\n\n[b]PRO's:[/b]\n\nPRICE (Well worth it)\nThe difficulty is well balanced and substantially gets harder after I unlock the second ship.\nLove the explosions and variation of the explosion sounds\nThe background music is enjoyable, but I also love the mute option! haha\nAlways love when games put in the classic screenshake! \nEnjoyed the multiple styles of ships ! I have only played with the first two but the second one is awesome!\n\n\n[b]CON's:[/b]\n\nLack of configuration options\nWould love to see a global leaderboard and not just local\n\n\n[b] OVERALL [/b]\n\nThe game was a good fun fast paced shooter based in space with a mix of the classic and newer technologies with good explosions and sfx. Would love to see some more configuration options and more ships! Overall a great buy for a only $0.99! \n\n[b] SUGGESTION [/b]\n\n[b]Buy[/b] if you like small fun shootemups that will keep you distracted for a couple hours for under $1.00 on sale!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436550549, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436550549, "recommendationid": "16978993", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517360", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450054586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561198111286987", "num_games_owned": 93}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "3", "review": "This game at first I was pumped for, but after I played it I found a number of bugs.\n\nEvery time you blow up an enemy, there is a giant white box.
