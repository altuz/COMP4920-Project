The combat is decent for a jrpg type game (and has actually provide a pretty good challenge).  The story is pretty good so far, mostly serious with some dry bits of humor that is done pretty well.  Character building/character progression is lite, but different.  I have been enjoying the setting.  Characters are good so far.  I actually have been reading and paying attention to the story and what people say or what is written in journals, etc, I pick up.  \n\nThe bottom line - is this game worth $3 (or $2.50 currently on sale)?  Yes, definitely.  This game has more going for it than a lot of the generic jrpgs/rpg maker games that come out and sell for $15 or $20.  I've already have gotten $3 out of it, and I feel safe recommending it to people who can tolerate the graphics.\n\nThe cons, to me, are-\nControls, I can't rebind keys\nLike most of these games the controller UI is awful on a civilized keyboard and mouse set-up and having to navigate the UI to do something simple is a huge pain in the ass (which is true for every game like this, from FF7 to Skyrim).\nThats about it, but for a pretty decent game at full price $3 I can't complain.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436296081, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436296081, "recommendationid": "16930972", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509691", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436854373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 423, "steamid": "76561197983059529", "num_games_owned": 377}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Macabre is a nice and simple JRPG in the style of the old 16-bit classics.  Does this game hold a light to those games?  Sort of.\n\n\nStory:\n\n-Despite the game taking place in a medieval setting, the story isn't 100% typical of your usual save the princess, stop the evil guy plotline.  The story takes a couple of interesting turns and the settings are varied enough to keep you interested throughout your short journey.  Also, the main character looks like Guile from Street Fighter with red hair, which is pretty rad.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\n-The battle system is quite typical.  You have the option to attack, cast spells, and use items.  The only real unique aspect is that characters can only gain new spells by using spells, similar to how Saga Frontier handles it.  Outside of combat, you can equip your characters with various weapons and armor.  There is an additional \"augury\" equip slot that allows your characters to get various stat bonuses at level-up but the mechanic seemed a bit underwhelming.\n\n-Exploration is rewarded with loot and various side-quests.  I found that grabbing as much loot as I could left me with a stockpile of gold and supplies by the end of the game.  There are a limited number of random encounters in each area.  Once the limit has been reached, the player is given the option to turn off the encounters to allow from uninterupted explortation.  I found this to be a nice touch.\n\n-Crafting is a bit tedious.  In order to craft the best weapons and armor you have to craft A LOT of items.  Crafting items that you already have feels mindless and is really only a waste of time.  I had well over 100 crafting materials by the end of the game because I didn't want to craft the same sword over and over in order to get my crafting level high enough.  The equipment you get from shops is good enough that I didn't see much of a reason to craft any more. \n\n\nGraphics:\n\n-The quality of graphics wouldn't have been acceptable in 1995, let alone 2015.  On the bright side, the graphics are consistently bad so the game has a certain style and charm to it.  If the developer were to make another game I'd recommend either hiring extra help with the pixel art or giving your artist more time to work on the sprites.\n \n\nMusic:\n\n-I'm not sure if the soundtrack is original but it fits the game rather nicely.  Each area seems to have its appropriate song matched with it.\n \n\nReplayability:\n\n-There are two difficulty settings and a set of achievements.  There isn't much character customization and the storyline is strictly linear.  I would have a tough time finding a reason to go through the game again.\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI really liked this game.  It may have some faults but the overall package was satisfying for the 7 hours it took for me to complete it.  Macabre isn't a revolutionary RPG but it does what it can do well.  I am eager to see the next game from MOCBJ Software and wish them the best of luck!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436856208, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436856278, "recommendationid": "17039374", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510306", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436387548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 385, "steamid": "76561198002150760", "num_games_owned": 579}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "At four hours in I think I can give a fair review of this game.

So, not expecting a lot, I decided to give this one a go.\n\nAs with any rpg, the story is hugely important. Without a decent and captivating story to tell the game can lose your interest, but this one tells a tale that keeps you interested and involved from the beginning.\nAn earhquake has tossed the main hero, Fred, on a beach needing to make his way home in a now shattered world. Along the way he meets the rest of the party, discovers what is behind the upheaval, deals with various side quests (16), battles thieves and assorted monsters, and collects more loot than you can imagine.\nLoot comes in the form of \"scrap material\", \"mystery meat\", coins, and many other collectibles which are all used in the crafting system featured in the game.\nAnd although the crafting system is not seen in these old style games that often, it is easy to learn so that you can have the items, weapons, armor, etc. that you need to have success in the game. \n\nIn a lot of ways this game reminds me of the original Final Fantasy, or even the old Phantasy Star seies. In addition to the crafting, the graphics really take you back ---- for those who remember playing those classics when they came out. \nAnd there are aspects that give it a thoroughly modern feel as well. The characters are fun with lots of personality (Alan), the humor is current, nothing forced with a few LOL moments. And the music is great and adds greatly to the game's enjoyment.\nI was impressed with the ease of working the menu with just the keyboard, and the game flowed quickly and smoothly with no glitching at all. \n\nSave the game often as you never know what's coming next (even in the towns). Also, if after a recent save you are not  happy with the loot you pick up when there are a bunch of boxes, chests, bookcases, etc. ---- just go back to the last save and try again because the loot will be different. \n\nClocking in at around 15-20 hours, it's a can't miss addition to the rpg library.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443147565, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443147565, "recommendationid": "18180204", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510231", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465339097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 28, "steamid": "76561198205406013", "num_games_owned": 41}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "fun game, but you should wait until it's on sale", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1465339220, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1465339220, "recommendationid": "23443135", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493938", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487556270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 952, "steamid": "76561198024345425", "num_games_owned": 348}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This was a really fun game.
