I've also been able to play as they've added new features over the weeks. For the most part, I find the game\u2019s unique controls and camera system exciting. While, the Soldier level could use a little sprucing up, the ability to record different angles in the scene, rewind and then replay your footage is a great extension of the VR environment.\n\n\nAs a film student in college, I feel the tools developed in this game would be a great learning tool for students looking to implement different things we've learned in class in an environment with infinite opportunity and no worry about camera equipment or budget (outside of the Vive :P ). I look forward to some new features being added, especially the option to export our recorded footage, and to see some new levels and environments to test the equipment.\n\n\nOverall I'm happy with my experience, especially considering it was only $1 and is still in early access. Keep up the good work!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1478046440, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1478046440, "recommendationid": "26364999", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498683", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477750633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198302701730", "num_games_owned": 106}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "horrible, nothing else to decribe it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477750660, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1477750660, "recommendationid": "26292200", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489610", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
