I can't defend what this comic series is about. I don't know dick about it, but it kind of sickens me. However, if I astral project myself away from this and just think of the game as its own thing, well, I'll explain why I like it.\n\nWhen I first started it, I was confused. \"First person perspective? Being able to move around? Why?\"\n\nThen it hit me when I was playing: The noise. The atmosphere.\n\nThe sound of the joystick, the click of the button. Playing with a 360 controller, I could swear I was playing with an arcade pad. There's no way you can replicate that in an emulated fashion unless you get yourself one, but even then. There's something about staring down into a simulated CRT monitor of an arcade machine that playing it as any other game wouldn't have given you. Arcade machines were something special - like a big bulky advertising box that wants to sell itself to you. (Or maybe a [b]pros[/b][b]titute[/b] comparison is apt here?) Arcade machines were the kind of thing you dreamed of taking home with you, as opposed to some crappy home port no doubt Acclaim had something to do with.\n\n\"Gon' E-Choo!\" (I kinda don't like that name) is as it says on the tin: A 3 stage \"platformer\" where you collect letters (The paper kind. Although for awhile I thought they were white hats for some reason) while avoiding a gator and bees. Avoiding the gator is just plain fun, like a primitive stealth game, where obfuscating simple AI patterns feels like you're tricking something - like showing a dog a mirror and it thinks its own reflection is another dog. There's not a whole lot to discuss here besides the sublime, simplistic design, which yes, does take its cues from Popeye - but you know what? I like Popeye, but the game is different enough from it that it's not an outright clone. At worst, I'd call it an extremely well done rom hack that adds new levels, as opposed to how I think of it as an homage to a classic. (It even has similar Thru signs.) \n\nIn fact, the game feels very much like a love letter to arcades. If you look around the room you're in, you'll find fictional flyers and the guts/parts of an arcade machine you can examine. There's also a tape player you can blare over the music and sound of the game. (A nice touch is that you can turn off the arcade machines music and just leave the SFX on, which is pretty awesome. Custom music tape mod when?)\n\nSo I've gushed about it. Any problems? Well... there is kind of one, but it's not in the way you think. You see, it's the controls. They're far too precise. With a keyboard, the game works as you'd expect,  the problem is the Xbox 360 controller. It was never truly precise, it's a good controller that fits a lot of games like a glove, but for Gon E-Choo, I got myself into a few too many pickles I knew I could have prevented if I was using something better. At the same time though, I want to use a controller for this game, cause it's the right kind of game for it.\n\nFor minor problems, I guess the side panelling of the arcade machine could be more eye catching. I mean I could be wrong, but how common are arcade machines with black and white comics on the sides of it? Maybe the power up could serve more of a purpose than letting you eat the gator? Maybe a mini game like a lot of later arcade games started adding? I don't know, at this point I'm nitpicking.\n\nI know furries are a punchline, but this more than anything proves to me that a person can have bad taste in fetishes, but they can have supremely excellent taste in video game design. I think a lot of indie devs that think they're \"totally like, making retro games, man\" could learn a lot from this title.

You pick up paper airplanes while running from the gator and killing flies with your yoyo, and once per life you can pick up the power-up comic book(?) and devour him instead.

The others seem too focused on delivering the aesthetic (usually with too many colors) alongside gameplay that conforms to modern videogame expectations: there has to be an overarcing story, a metagame, a save system, character growth, a difficulty curve that gently guides players to credits. Gon' E-Choo! doesn't do any of that. This game only sets out to deliver a new-one-of-those, and absolutely succeeds.\n\nWhile there's no explicit campaign, the game does give you an overarcing goal: a notepad tells you the game can be broken to the point where someone can play it all day on a single quarter. But the only way to do this is the same way you'd exploit a classic arcade game: by learning the AI patterns to the point where nothing can surprise you. (There is a helpful cheat code, but even when it's used I can only make it to stage 57 or so.) I currently have a text file full of AI notes and stage strategies; it seems like I have it all worked out, I just need to get my reflexes to the point where I can do this in my sleep.\n\nThere is a motive for getting as far in as you can, from a this-is-merchandise-for-an-actual-brand standpoint: the webcomic has a cryptic side to it, related to the gator's origin. The comic teases a letter that may hold some answers, but it's only shown the first line so far. The whole thing appears to be in this game, however; it's drip-fed line-by-line with every three stages you complete. But that's only a motivator if you're interested in the lore of a silly furry webcomic (which -- and I'm going to take a wild guess, here -- [i]I bet[/i] most people aren't).

While running around collecting them, there is an alligator trying to eat the cat. Also, there is a power up that allows you to turn the tables and eat the alligator.
