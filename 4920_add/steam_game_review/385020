This game has a lot of potential. However, it does compete against websites like chess.com which have been around for a long time and have perfected themselves with time. But people like me will join this community thinking that it would be great to play fellow gamers in chess which is an unsual thing in Steam! I Here is what I think should be done as a matter of priority:\n\n- We should be able to search for players (per location or else)\n- To refuse an invitation to play\n- To resign\n- The game should prompt you to confirm your move when done\n- Chat rooms would be perfect (by theme or else), where people could interact with each other and perhaps have a chat before the game. This would be a massive advantage compared to other games in the market.\n- There should be a time limit to your turn. At the moment if you play the day after your opponent plays or a month later there is no penalty. Your opponent could be waiting weeks before you move and this is frustrating. It is very important that there should be a time limit to your move and this could be agreed by both players before matching.\n\nI believe that if the above is introduced it would make the game excellent. I am currently matching some people and enjoying it but I am looking forward to the development of the game. I will update the review if I find other useful comments to make and will delete above suggestions if they have been fixed/introduced so this is more of a live review.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438296490, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1438296642, "recommendationid": "17306574", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537807", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448838023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 176, "steamid": "76561198059610231", "num_games_owned": 306}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 45, "comment_count": "19", "review": "******************Addition to the Review (March 2016)******************\n\n(This addition to the review is concerning the developer relations with his customers, for the game review please scroll down.)\n\nThe developer is dishonest or doesnt care about his customers. I bought this game under the a christmas sale:\n\n\"Celebrating Our Launch: Get an Extra Access Key FREE!\"\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/385020/discussions/0/496881136928763218/\n\nwhere the developer promised a second key to whoever buys the game during that time window. I did so, asked for a second key as the rest... Did not recieve it, also I tried to friend the developer so I can msg him about the issue, he ignored my friend request.\nA possible reason (an unjustified one) for his unintresst in providing me a second key (as promised) is my negative review on his product (was made monthes before this issue)\nThis shameful way of him handling his customers are a cherry on top of his bad game.\n\nMy recommendation stays: Stay Away & Don\u00b4t Support Developers Who Ignore or Lie to Their Customers.\n\n****************Game Review (November 2015)****************\n\nI really love Chess, and I am very happy when I see a version of it on Steam. Therefor I have really gave this game a chance but sadly I cannot recommend it whatsoever.\n- Tried to play for almost 2 hours and went as far as completing 2 moves... (most members are inactive)\n- Upon running the game for the first time Avira flagged the luncher as a virus.\n- After about 10, 15 minutes of having the game running it crashes (the browser that runs the game through steam)\n- The option of choosing different colors of pieces for the board doesnt seem to work yet.\n- The game provides the abillity to be ran through browser in order for it to be more accessible but sadly with a mobile phone only the profile can be opened but no chess piece can be moved.\n\nTo summerize- sadly, a complete let down... Stay away. \nFor chess on Steam I would happily recommend \"Simply Chess\".", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1499245581, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448840888, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456917316, "recommendationid": "19377636", "developer_response": "We sent out friend requests to everyone who posted in the offer thread and the offer was time sensitive as stated.

If you get a pawn throught it becomes automatically a queen. But sometimes this could lead to a stalemate. 2. There is still no clock. As well the community is still small and the game doesn't do enough imo to seperate itself from other chess games. </edit>\n\nin my opinion chess is a great game, I've been playing it for many years, in real life as well.\n\nIf you are interested in chess in general check out my guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=490990568\n\nAbout \"Ancients of Fasaria: Chess Club\":\n+ good support\n+ nice style\n+ well organised menu\n+ easy way to challenge players\n+ easy profile set up, with basic information (maybe the option to write a sentence should be added)\n\nSome things which should be added for sure:\n- time option (now with time-out after 7 days = lost)\n- no easy chat option (only after move or in lobbies)\n- the option to select people who are allowed to challenge you (f.e. friends only)\n- a friend list \n- I also would love to create an own club, with an invitation system, just for friends\n\nI'm gonna keep the list updated and I'll keep adding things.

The value of this game is that you can challenge any of the members or receive challemges from them. It is not compulsory to accept a challenge in just the same way as at a Chess Club.
