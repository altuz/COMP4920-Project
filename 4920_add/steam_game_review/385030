Kane is an... interesting game to review.\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, the game stands. The RPG mechanics are clear, present, your party is small and every character has a decent amount of strengths and weaknesses (except Leland, who has no weakness), and the bosses have some interesting gimmicks at times. It's challenging, but never too insanely difficult -- I think I died once in the entire game while fighting the hidden end game boss. The game is only about two to three hours long if you choose to explore the world, less if you just run through.\n\nWhen it comes to writing and story, C. Kane is a love it or hate it. One thing that would DEFINITELY increase your enjoyment of the game is seeing the film Citizen Kane, as there are a few amazing references to the film and world. However, the writing occassionally gets a little flat, and just starts seeming weird for the sake of being weird. I wish there was a little more substance to the story, as I felt like it had potential that it didn't use.\n\nThe soundtrack is actually my biggest gripe in the game. It's very limited, and all the loops are very short. The songs are hilarious at first, but quickly become repetitive -- especially during some of the longer fights.\n\nOverall, if you like the trailer and love puns and Citizen Kane, you'll likely enjoy the game. If you don't find the trailer funny, don't bother.

Hence, it's the Citizen Kane of videogames by virtue of being a videogame based on Citizen Kane. That's the joke. However, even though this is a blatantly flippant joke game, it's tightly designed to achieve what it sets out to do without overstaying its welcome.\n\nThe RPG gameplay is minimalist to the point of its own minimalism being a running gag. The world map is not only so tiny it fits in a single screen, the overworld music itself is a rap track about all the locations on the map (there's about 6). There are no random battles, and of course, the battle music has some vocals about wanting to fight some monsters. Acquiring better gear and expanding characters' spell and ability repertoire is stripped down to the bone, yet still satisfying. The small amount of battle situations that occur in the game's 2-3 hours have just enough variety and call for strategic planning - usually by exploiting elemental weaknesses or smart usage of stat debuffs - to be interesting.\n\nThe story is farcical and full of pop culture references, as well as skewed references to Citizen Kane itself. It even upholds the lineage of Barkley Gaiden by featuring basketball as a token plot element. Actually, if you enjoyed the style of writing in Barkley Gaiden or Dog of Dracula 2, you'll probably feel right at home here.\n\nIt's worth the asking price if you can appreciate a surreal, crass, tongue-in-cheek short form RPG with a steady IV-drip flow of weirdness throughout, along with some occasional bursts of comic writing genius.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460348592, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460348592, "recommendationid": "22351866", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488959622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 393, "steamid": "76561198136732748", "num_games_owned": 830}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "See Game, C.

Also, some of the things in the game seemed to be nonsensical for the sake of being nonsensical rather than providing any sort of humor.

C.Kane attempts to boil all of these RPG tropes down into a simple format and lean message about what actually constitutes the hero's journey and questions whether the hero is even really a hero.\n\nCharles Kane is just your average RPG hero, well, media mogul with an absentee father if you want to get technical, who goes around town and listens to the pleas of townsfolk who wish him to locate their junk for them. Along the way, he fights monsters and bosses, as that's the only way he can please the people. But as he journeys from one corner of a post-apocalyptic United States to another, he gradually comes face-to-face with the greatest moral questions that an RPG hero can face: Is he doing the right thing?\n\nC.Kane isn't just a game about killing monsters (even though it kind of is). It's a game that dives deep into a series of philosophical questions that challenge our understanding of what makes a good man good, or a good man into a monster. It's a game about moral choices, and deciding what makes a choice moral. It's a game about talking beavers, clowns, and hip-hop talking wizards. And it has a soundtrack that reminds you that, even though you are having to make tough choices about whether you should slay that monster or dump your wife for the \"hot chick,\" you are still playing an RPG, one that should take only a few hours to finish.\n\nShould you play C.Kane? Only if you enjoy a good story, thought-provoking character dilemmas, and don't give a lick about random battles, except for those against mega sharks, zombies, walruses, and pure evil.\n\nOh, and don't adjust your color. It's meant to be in black and white. It's based on a film from the 1930s after all.

Most battles come down to attacking/healing/buffing/debuffing but are never mindless. The solution to each battle is usually very puzzlesque and figuring out the tricks to each enemy encounter is satisfying.\n\nThe game is only 2 or 3 hours but has a satisfying arc of engaging in fights, discovering weaknesses, and leaning new abilities. There are no random encounters, only deliberate battles, and I think that's what pushes me over the line into recommending this game.\n\nThe story is not really important. C Kane is a game that acts as a vehicle for jokes. The quality of those jokes is debatable. I found the game was at its funniest when it dealt with the titular character's inner monologue. There's a \u201cmoral choices in video games\u201d joke that wouldn't be that funny even back in 2007. \n\nThe game's soundtrack is another source of comedy, it's idiosyncratic to say the least. Contrasting with C Kane's black and white aesthetic is a hip-hop/pop soundtrack with comical lyrics about walking around RPG towns or using the world map. The themes loop too quickly but the charm of the musical themes works a lot better than many of the jokes in the dialogue.\n\nIt's an enjoyable romp. Maybe you'll find it funnier than I did, and if you do find it funnier you'll have yourself a good couple of hours.
