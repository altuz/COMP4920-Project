Early in single-player, I was trying to keep and equip a reasonable front and back line of summons:  I would keep two zombies (and later, wraiths) around with beat-em-up sticks and shields (and later, scythes, for those undead bonuses) and then have two trolls on the back line hucking rocks and any shurikens I made with leftover steel.  Later, as mobility become more and more important, I started instead summoning a flying mount and pimping out my own archery skills.  Once I found the materials for a bow, I would fly around on my griffin strafing land-bound opponents and then resurrecting them as .\n\nThe levels are entertainingly designed and always different enough that no one strategy feels like it's inherently better than the others.  Flying mounted archers are very strong, but the fact that you have to craft or plunder ranged weapons balances them out a bit, and I suspect mounts are less OP in multiplayer where the enemy can focus them down.  You always have multiple objectives and limited time to complete them (kill the enemy warlocks, get all the gems).\n\nVerdict:  A hidden gem!

You can really feel how much love went into this. It is a mix up of different genres, working out together in an absolutly brilliant way. I already had bought the game on iPad and decided to aquire it again on PC. The PC-version is even better, as controls with mouse an keybord are a tad more fluent. \n\nThe Game is turn-based and about defeating the opponent's Warlock. Each warlock can cast spells, which either work directy (\"fireball\") or summon creatures that fight for you. Each creature has it's own characteristics, strengh and weaknesses. There are chests with power-ups to discover, secrets, weapons to use and items to craft. The envoirment ist distructable and can be included in your strategy. You gain items to \"level-up\" different characteristics, that suit your gameplay best. Just awesome !\n\nThe interactive Tutorial explains the concepts very good, there is a single-player campain and online multiplayer. Multiplayer is just so much fun, unfortunatly there aren't many players, as the game is (totally unjustified if you ask me) still not very known. \n\nIt ist so much fun to let your own creativity play in this game. For me the best game of 2015!\n\nUpdate 6th of June: As you can see, the dev is really behind this and still droping updates and additional content for free. You can't do nothing wrong, buy it for 6\u20ac!!\n\n\n\nDeutsch: \n\nDieses Spiel ist einfach fantastisch, Man sieht wieviel Liebe der Entwickler da hineingesteckt hat. Es ist ein Misch-Masch zwischen verschiedenen bereits bekannten Konzepten, das einfach funktioniert und viel Spa\u00df macht. Ich hatte mir das Spiel bereits auf dem iPad geholt, und da es mir so gut gefallen hatte, habe ich es mir nochmal erworben. Die PC-Umsetzung ist genauso, wenn nicht noch besser, da die Bedienung mit Mouse und Tastatur einfacher ist. \n\nEs geht im Prinzip darum, den gegnerischen Hexenmeister (Warlock) zu besiegen. Jeder Warlock kann Zauberspr\u00fcche wirken, die entweder direkt wirken (\"Feuerkugel\"), oder Monster heraufbeschw\u00f6ren, die f\u00fcr einen K\u00e4mpfen. Jedes Monster hat seine eigenen F\u00e4higkeiten, St\u00e4rken und Schw\u00e4chen. Es gibt Waffen zum Ausr\u00fcsten und Gegenst\u00e4nde zum \"Craften\", Geheimnisse zu entdecken. Die Umgebung ist zerst\u00f6rbar, was man nutzen kann und man kann seinen Charakter \"aufleveln\" wie es zu einem passt. Alles wird rundenbasiert ausgespielt. \n\nDas interaktive Tutorial erkl\u00e4rt einem gut die Steurung und Prinzipien, eine Einzelspieler-Kampanie ist vorhanden und auch online-Mulitplayer. Multplayer macht einfach so viel Spa\u00df, nur leider gibt es nicht so viele Gegener, da dass Spiel leider (zu unrecht meiner Meinung nach) unbekannt geblieben ist. \n\nEs macht sehr viel Spa\u00df die eigene Kreativit\u00e4t spielen zu lassen und dieses Spiel zu entdecken.
