Sold the cards and made some money, a lot more than i spent, AND STILL THINK IT WASN'T WORTH IT.\n\nThis game has to be some kind of joke, i can't believe someone would actually release something so horrible, ugly, unresponsive and pooly done.\n\nI mean, if i was in a locked room with the developer of this game and Stalin, and i had a gun with just one bullet, i would definetly shoot Stalin right in the head, JUST SO I COULD HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BEATING THE HELL OF THE DAMN DEVELOPER\n\nTo be fair, the game DOES corresponds to it's proposal of beeing a \"challenging platform\". After all:\n     - When you launch it, it's very challenging to NOT break your PC with a brick. That is, of course, if the game doesn't break it by itself, since It consumes any RAM from any computer within a 50 miles radius;\n     - When you see the opening menu, it's very challenging to find out what to do in such a polluted screen;\n     - When you can finally manage to enter the game, it's very challenging to get over all of the scribbles on the screens made of WordArt;\n     - It's also very challenging to figure out what is platform and what is background, since everything it's equally ugly;\n     - It takes about three minutes for the game to figure out you want to jump and respond to it, leading o situations such as:\n               - You walk = you die\n               - You manage to jump after three steps = you die.\n               - You open your umbrella = the game crashes and you die.\n               - You play = you die. and the game also crashes. a lot.\n\nCan't think of anything more challenging than that. So, yeah, very challening, congratulations. \n\nAnd, as a bonus feature, it doesn't terminate when you quit and invisibly hides out, consuming a bizarrely large amount of RAM. It's like a dementor of performance.\n\nLong story short, it's a very glitchy, crashy game with an awful art, poor fonts and texts, horrible gameplay and it SOMEHOW still manages to consume more RAM than The Witcher 3  in full 4k resolution **WITH** that mod that enhances the hair effects. Can't recommend it, even as a joke.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507001364, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507002381, "recommendationid": "35434320", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503848", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 20}}
