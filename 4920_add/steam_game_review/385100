Sounds dire? wait, thats not all, you can augment both of those slots with a variety of upgrades, and combine them for really interessting effects.\nAnd you have 5 slots for your ship augments, for example a simple heal, a shield, or do you want to sent a swarm of killerdrones at your enemy? \n\nEarlier i said the game shines on its exploration part, yes, indeed, while you can always teleport back to your starting planet, you can only upgrade flat stats on your \"garage\", but this wont do. The game actually forces you to go out there and visit space, because you can only progress (meaning getting your very important augments) when you find another planet, that has a merchant. AND again, merchants only offer you a limited amount of stuff, and while they may refresh their stock, its always better to search for more merchants, instead of just babysit there.\n\nThe game doesnt seem really challenging at first, but be warned, it can be really hard if you think guns blazin is the way to go. Especially when the game difficulty gets a little bit started, the game likes to use the secret art of \"throwing so much shit at you that you cant even see what hit you\". Kkeeping a cool head is key in later battles, and knowing when to retreat and come back later really helps, ESPECIALLY when you want to take out a fortress of enemies.\n\nall in all, its a solid game, not a blockbuster, but a secret pearl in this whirlpool of narrow rollercoster- gamedesign we have these days\n\ni say its a 9 / 11", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1470510033, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1470510234, "recommendationid": "24747131", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497322", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450230888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 172, "steamid": "76561197999340711", "num_games_owned": 818}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Paid $3 for a game.\n\nAsteroids on steroids.\n\nWould pay $3 again.\n\n10/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446530322, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446530322, "recommendationid": "18852045", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480694", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468713558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 351, "steamid": "76561198000965264", "num_games_owned": 361}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pretty fun, the fact that you have to figure out a lot of stuff by yourself can be a perk or minus depending on how you like to play.
