This makes the game look very grainy and pixelated, despite the art being technically sound.\n-Hiccups. Constant hiccups. The longer I play the game, the more frequent and annoying they get. After several hours, don't be suprised if your screen pauses for nearly an entire second every 4-5 seconds.\n-Framerate issues. Only one or two maps are designed to allot for full framerate in the RPG Maker engine.\n-Bugs. Despite being delayed for several months, I've encountered sloppy scripting issues, text issues (mostly grammar related), invisible barriers, and items that don't do what they say (Stun, for the record is apparently not a \"physical status ailment\").\n-Characters. Characterization is forced and almost everyone fills a trope. You won't find much originality here, except for the female protagonist.\n-Heavy balance issues. You'll encounter enemies that can deal 50 damage to one character and 5 to the other. You'll have battles that will take you forever and consume all your items and you'll be rewarded with 7 XP; or you'll fight a battle which is over in one attack and you'll be rewarded with 30-40. I only found one shop in episode 1, and I was only able to shop there once. This is a moot point since you can only carry 8 items of any one type at a time, and if you find any more they will be immediately discarded (even in chests). The Legend of Dragoon-style pinch-defend-heal is actually the most effective way to heal in the game, so I recommend in every battle you get the opportunity to delay killing the last enemy and defend-heal up to max so you don't waste items and MP. Grinding, too, is near-impossible, since it seems monsters only respawn when it's inconvenient, and not when it would be nice to gain XP.\n-Dungeons are way too long. There are several areas in every dungeon which is simply a path populated with monsters. I'm pretty sure the devs of Pier Solar would get tired of the dungeons in this game.\n-Puzzles are often not very intuitive and the clunkiness of the controls lead you having to repeat them over and over and over. \n\nIn short, if you don't mind the RPG Maker engine and a game that is too big for its britches, you'll enjoy Celestial Tear. The plot is interesting enough and combat is challenging (though not exactly rewarding, and unbalanced), but this isn't going to win any awards, especially when the intro cinematic -- the most impressive part of the game -- won't even play without constant stutter. You can't help but think with this level of dedication, scripting and custom assets, a more sensible engine choice (like Unity) wouldn't make more sense. RPG Maker has already been committed though, and that's the primary shame.\n\n[Reviewed on Win7 Pro]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448743402, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448743402, "recommendationid": "19345228", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570757", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1474119571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 164, "steamid": "76561198062448603", "num_games_owned": 167}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Game is all good and nice,\n\nbut I had few problem.\n-FPS issues\n-Bugs such as \n--selecting inventory that didn't let me in\n--drowning bar is still on when I got out of the water\nthe main problem is the FPS, you just play the game for a good 20 minutes, BOOM huge lag, huge fps drop. impossible to play it.\nWould love to continue but a little bit upgrade and fix would be helpful.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1470084715, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1470084715, "recommendationid": "24658853", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505741", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
