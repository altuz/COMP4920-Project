Game fullscreens correctly and can be played windowed\n+Death is handled charitably where you just respawn at beginning of screen with respawned foes\n\nCons\n+I got stuck about 3 minutes in, the game wanted me to jump using a trampoline style mushroom and then somehow reach a higher level platform than what I could. \n+Controls can take some getting used to. They feel tight and responsive but seem like they will have a mind on their own and you will sometimes slide down walls when you thought you were trying to go up or vice versa, you will grab ledges without trying or pushing anything extra for it. Its just a little bit off.\n+Game looked very samey from what I saw, just rearranged platforms here and there but it looked like I was going through the same screen over and over again\n\nNeutral/Meh\n+Animation quality and sprite quality did not impress\n+Overall level design of platforms\n+No exposition or story to speak of. You get dumped in a game start jumping on platforms and beat on guys for no reason\n\nPoints harvested from other reviews:\n-No Map does sound like a pain in a game with branching paths\n\nConclusion: While someone with limited option could definitely fall back on this and play it through. Personally, I found it to be a little bit too bland and too much of a chore to warrant investing time into it and would rather just declutter my library by having it gone and instead play An Imp!
