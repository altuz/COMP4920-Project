The story is very well thought and you really need to think since there are a whole bunch of hidden hints in what the characters say in order to understand.

The story is extremely sad though (it's not a bad comment but if you're looking for something that is pretty random and happy then this is not for you)... but I definitely recommend this game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499002307, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499002307, "recommendationid": "33131681", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489903370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 332, "steamid": "76561198166254080", "num_games_owned": 11}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Good, but short.
