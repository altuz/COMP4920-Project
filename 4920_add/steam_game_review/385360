The first game had lots of humor and a story to follow, it made the game enjoyable. This game lacks the luster of the first, My problems with it are three things, First the game play lacks the versatility of tactical options offered in good strategy games. Second the story is very lacking and empty, this leaves a why am i playing this feeling even when you beat the game. Third.... Gameplay, while the game isnt to hard to beat, the game play is fustrating to put it nicely. The first game held a great deal of fun to it being a top down shotter and it allowed for the player to seek out secrets and rewarded the effort. While this game has its own secrets to it i wont be wasting the time with them. A suggestion for the developers, Stick to what you did well. The first game was by far more fun and enjoyable.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492543725, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492543725, "recommendationid": "31224731", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514902", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492798424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 245, "steamid": "76561198088206502", "num_games_owned": 127}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Gameplay: https://youtu.be/1xjK3uJz0WY\nBought this on 90% sale > 0,69\u20ac this aint like the first game, but its \"turn-based\" and \"Strategy\"\n\"survive through dangerous\" fields: http://imgur.com/a/dWFxx <--- screenshot, \nand purchase reinforcement Soldiers/Food & Supplies.\nDEFEND FEMINIST LEADER http://imgur.com/a/JwwNA <--- another screenshot", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492788229, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492797305, "recommendationid": "31277235", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499163", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492916502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561198029074222", "num_games_owned": 271}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "compared to the first one this is garbage.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492916528, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492916528, "recommendationid": "31310781", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.410438", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 21, "total_reviews": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 13}}
