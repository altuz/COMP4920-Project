The character storylines are quite good and very convincing, leading me to believe that these were real people who actually fought in the American Civil War. More on that in a bit.\n\n[b]PROS:[/b] \n\n-Historical information about battles, locations, and generals. Everytime you finish a hidden object \"battle\", you get a little history lesson about the specific battle and which side won the battle, or whether it was a draw.\n\n-Storyline. All three main characters have great storylines. The further you progress in the game, the more information you unlock about them.\n\n-Decoding letters. This part of the game is actually fun, way more fun than the hidden object scenes. However, it's just too easy. Some of the code letters look almost identical to the encoded letters themselves. There's also overly dramatic music that only plays during these letter decoding sequences, which would seem better suited for a boss fight.\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n\n-Tiny, & I mean [b]TINY[/b] low-res hidden objects on low-res backgrounds. In one scene in particular, some of the hidden objects are no bigger than a pixel or two.\n\n-Hidden objects totally irrelevant for the time period. I've seen this before in other HOG's, and normally it doesn't bother me, but this is a game about a major historical event. Cassette tapes? Car keys? Even a space invader? Come on, this really detracts from gameplay immersion.\n\n-Falsified history. I assumed that the three characters were real people, it turns out they were fictional. None of the three characters in this game existed, which is fine, but...\n\n[b]***SPOILER ALERT[/b][spoiler]...when a fictional game character prevents Lincoln's assassination attempt by Booth, this really ruined the whole game for me. So yeah, you heard me right, in this game Lincoln survives his assassination. Alternate history? No mention of this is given in the game description. I'm not sure why the dev thought it was a good idea to re-write history for the sake of this game, it really added nothing to the story, in my opinion.[/spoiler][b]SPOILER ALERT***[/b]\n\n[b]BOTTOM LINE:[/b]\n\nHidden Mysteries: Civil War fails spectacularly as a hidden object game. However, the character storylines and the historical information do add some interest to the game. Unfortunately, some of the historical information is extremely inaccurate. It's definitely not worth full price, probably not worth the 75% off I got it for.

What happened to the general? Or to that convinced Confederate soldier? Or to the poor soldier that is more romantic than wanting to fight for his country?\n\nHidden Mysteries: Civil War belongs to the old era of hidden objects games, where you have only scenes to investigate, to find X numbers of this item or find the whole list of it. Some minigames are also included. However, like any game from that time, objects are hard to find because being merged with the background or being very tiny.\n\nAs you may know, I'm not thumbing down games because they're not adapted to our current days. But here, what a boring game! Mystery P.I. and Mystery Cases Files had at least something that made play for more. Puzzles were more challenging or hidden objects scenes were a little more interesting. Even trying to follow these three people wasn't what I've expected.\n\nI hate using hints, but here, I was always on a thin line with having none, meaning that I had an hard time to see the objects (even if it's an old-school game, it's not really adapted for every sight). Besides, on my laptop, the game wasn't even running smoothly, it was slow...\n\nThe graphics are acceptable for a game that was released in 2008. The soundtrack was... well, it wasn't something that struck me.\n\nAnyway, I suppose that I would have been bored if I've played it back then. Indeed, I've played other similar games back then and when I replayed them, I still found myself enjoying then. People used to the new evolution of hidden object games will be annoyed with this game and as a veteran, my excitement to play it was quickly turned into disappointement.\n\nBut the biggest reason for the thumb down is the current price of 10 bucks. It would have been lower, I would have been probably leaning towards a thumb up, though I'm not sure that I would have done, given the fact that I didn't really enjoy the game.\n\nNow, I'll wait for a discount for Titanic.
