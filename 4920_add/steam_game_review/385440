The controls do not work at the start of game and the keybindings in the option menus were confusing. as for the game its the typical move forward kill things, gain gold, grow stronger repeat. This is fine,  but there isnt much besides that. There are lots of stats and gear to upgrade but it only ever really changes the numbers you deal to the enemies. also i ended up buying things on one upgrade page while on another,  doesnt seem like the code for the other menus is frozen while not being looked at.\n\nIf this goes on sale to something like $1 to $2 you can think of buying this. but otherwise for +$5 there are other more enertaining games then this.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441262877, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441262877, "recommendationid": "17858431", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537434", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471376372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 697, "steamid": "76561198145871719", "num_games_owned": 6804}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I've had so much fun with Buff Knight Advanced! It's a casual game, and you'll definitely do quite a bit of rapid clicking or button mashing during this side-scrolling RPG. \n\nThere are two character classes (melee fighting knight or magic using sorceror) as well as weapon, armor, and character attributes to upgrade, multiple artifacts to find and upgrade, and a variety of monsters to slay over the course of 12 stages of gameplay. There are also story and endless modes, full-controller support, and very attainable achievements. \n\nAt this point, I only have the stage 12 boss to get through, and all of my stats and upgrades are maxed out. There's not much of a downside to this game, especially if you can pick it up on sale. It's perfectly enjoyable and simplistic. However, I have to admit that I wish there was more content and more items, weapons, and attributes to upgrade, because other than health and mana potions (which reset when you die) I have nothing on which to spend my gold and gems. \n\nThe soundtrack isn't complex, but the music and sound effects are appropriate and alert the player to what's coming. The pixel graphics are very well done, and I had no issues with seeing clearly and identifying what was on my rapidly scrolling screen. \n\nOverall, I love this game. It's entertained me for 11+ hours at this point, and it was very refreshing to begin a game that wasn't full of complex puzzles or sporting an unrealistic degree of difficulty. This is perfect for a casual gamer, and it's got definite replayability with the two modes, achievements, rare artifacts, and scored stages.  \n\nGet your Buff on!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1471377398, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1471377398, "recommendationid": "24960183", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540192", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446472290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561198020741974", "num_games_owned": 548}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this game builds on the idle game formula by removing the idle part and making you do all the repetitive boring stuff... but at least this is a video game instead of a number simulation application.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446470726, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446470958, "recommendationid": "18837155", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502511", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441631067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 899, "steamid": "76561197969158018", "num_games_owned": 8941}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Buff Knight Advanced:\n\n[+] Steam trading cards\n[+] Achievements\n[+] Addictive (just one more go gameplay)\n[+] Value for money IMHO\n\n[-] Controls not clearly explained (K/B) for me\n\nThe game is more a side scrolling clicker game with options: you will hit the 'C' key lots of times.\nYou can play 1 of 2 classes mage or knight and there are 12 levels to complete.
