No sandbox mode or even a map editor. It has nothing to do with modeling at all.\nAll you do is pick an engine, pick your freight or a passenger car and go in a cricle from station to station loading/unloading. The only thing you do control is start/stop the train and the switches.\n\nGranted it is only $5, but you are not getting anything for it at all. I played the first two scenarios and maybe the game does get better, but I got bored. Since there is no table view having more than one train is pointless, because you have stop all other trains to be able to concentrate on one.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436571217, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436571217, "recommendationid": "16983987", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627779", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436596709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 46, "steamid": "76561198012068872", "num_games_owned": 192}, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 64, "comment_count": "5", "review": "I wholeheartedly do not recommend this game. You buy a loco and cars, drive the train around in circles between stations dropping off and picking up passengers (don't incur a penality!) one ONE screen and THAT IS IT. It's like model railroad used to be. Track/train/power mindless circling of the track.\n\n\nNO sandbox, NO track laying, NO POINT.

I downloaded this game, because it said that I could build my own railroad. Of coarse this is a total fake.

There are some stations present on the map which provide and receive these goods. If you deliver goods to a station, you get money for it. You can switch the railway points to make sure your trains get to the right stations, and start, stop and reverse your trains.\n\nThere are 20 Missions, which have one main goal each (\"Make x money\"), and you get optional missions, which you sometimes have to fulfill within a certain time frame.\n\nThe graphics are somewhat crappy, especiall from the \"driver's cab view\". From the standard view it looks like the game from 2004 it is.\n\nThat's it, yes.\n\nIt's basically like making a painting with the Bob Ross-technique: It most likely won't result in any high category art, but it's soooo relaxing to make it. And this game is a classic of its own kind (though it is pretty lonely for it there).\n\nSo, get the game, if you think the above can entertain you. Don't buy it, if it can't.\n\n__\nSome hints at the end:\n- you can tilt the camera with the right mouse button\n- you can reverse the trains by double clicking, stop and forward with single click. Cars can be connected by clicking within two carriages.\n- click on the little buildings next to points to set them.\n- Have fun with this pretty unique little game...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468333610, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468333610, "recommendationid": "24275331", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489373", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477944162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 212, "steamid": "76561198256185463", "num_games_owned": 6}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you like trains, and you are looking for a fun and cheep game, Railroad Lines is the best option!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477773596, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1477773596, "recommendationid": "26300444", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489850", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495836589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 247, "playtime_forever": 386, "steamid": "76561198048048796", "num_games_owned": 211}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "bad game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1481295991, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1481295991, "recommendationid": "28271420", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485345", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1436573524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561198030876667", "num_games_owned": 404}, "votes_funny": 47, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": "3", "review": "This is what aids must look like...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1436573526, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1436573526, "recommendationid": "16984396", "language": "english", "votes_down": 68, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.404528", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 5}}
