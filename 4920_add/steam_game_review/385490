I've always loved this game, I really found it quite fun to play, with the speed through the corners and also the crashes. It's basically an F1 version of Mario Kart :D\n\nOnly con is when you play it in window mode, it doesn't fit the screen and so it can't be maximized\n\nAlthough when you do tournaments you have to wait a few days before you can do them which is a shame.\n\nI haven't played online yet but it'll be great fun I think ;)\n\nPros: Crashes, cars, races\nCons: Window mode, waiting for tournaments", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492649573, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492649573, "recommendationid": "31247456", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 5}}
