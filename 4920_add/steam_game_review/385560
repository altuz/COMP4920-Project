Loved it so much, I finished it over just a handful of sessions across 2 days. I really missed it when my console died on me and always wished a PC edition was available. Surprisingly, I wasn't aware of a PC 'Remastered' edition all this while until the recent Steam Sale. Double combo!!!\n\nDon't go in expecting an Oscar-winning story; the book it was based on is probably way more interesting. It is engaging enough to make you want to move it along, especially when the game seamlessly transitions to in-game scripted scenes. There is also a mild hint of parody at spy or action movies by way of how the script was written.\n\nWhat do I enjoy about it? Simplicity.\nThe power armor is over-the-top powerful by end game, it is such a refreshing experience to feel godly after all the effort pumped in to the game. The game is short, but highly replayable, with or without your upgraded armor. Want some challenge? Replay it and DON'T go for all upgrades and secrets. Want to squash your enemies like the ragdolls they are? This is the perfect game for it!\n\nThe level design is coherent and, even for a small game, gives a sense of continuity and size. The whole game world is seamlessly connected, and there is even a full game map provided as you explore. Imagine having that in Mario! The map even hints at hidden secrets in a location in case you missed any visual cues on the scene. Some may find this less challenging, but I don't believe the game was designed to be a grind. It has the right balance of challenge because some of the secrets are SO obvious in their location but takes either motion agility or some smart thinking to reach them.\n\nThe only real downside? The game is short. I took my time and still finished it in a few hours. There are achievements to finish the game in 2 and 3 hours respectively. Good thing is the game was never priced with a full AAA pricetag, so it sets the right expectation. If you enjoy a smart, fun platformer, then it is worth more than a few of those so-called big name games.\n\nHighly recommended, with or without the Steam sales. I already owned a copy on a different platform, so the sale price was extra appreciated.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499560624, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499560624, "recommendationid": "33390035", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500783", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502860326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 171, "steamid": "76561198087328979", "num_games_owned": 410}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Let me start off by saying this is a fun game, I remember playing it back on xbox 360 and enjoyed it. When they remastered it in UE4 i was excited to get my hands on it again and enjoy it, the gameplay is fun, the action is fun, but that doesnt mean its not bug free. At certain points the game will just freeze and not move at all for a few minutes, a ladder climbing animation where the characters hands dont fit perfectly on the bars when climbing, and im sure there are others.   Even with all the bugs the game is still fun to play and enjoy, so give it a shot and enjoy it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502895451, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502895451, "recommendationid": "34277763", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501655711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 411, "steamid": "76561198012917530", "num_games_owned": 176}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Mertoid meets Metal Gear with some Uncharted thrown in there for good measure.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499803825, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499803825, "recommendationid": "33464337", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499886", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 99, "total_reviews": 111, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 12}}
