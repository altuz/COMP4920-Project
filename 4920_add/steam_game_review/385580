I can't say that I recommend buying it, but I haven't fully completed it yet. I played it on normal mode, and beat it within 20 minutes. It seems that based on the game description & achievements that the hardest difficulty has a longer story, and that there is probably a secret ending as well.\n\nPros:\nI actually like the core gameplay mechanic, which revolves around finding matches to keep your lamp lit, and finding keys to progress through locked doors. Since there are not too many matches, you have to keep moving at all times and search everything you can. It ends up giving you a nice mild anxiety as you try to find the next match.\n\nCons:\nThe game length is pretty short, although again I only played it on the mid tier difficulty level, not the high level. Another thing that was mildly annoying throughout the gameplay was collision. The doors you must go through are basically just big enough for you to get through, so I bumped into the walls a lot.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438116896, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438116896, "recommendationid": "17272019", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513456", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438129428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 371, "playtime_forever": 85, "steamid": "76561198135143088", "num_games_owned": 557}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Not worth $4.\n\nThe controls are really, really bad: Move with WASD, mouse button for actions... No, you don't move the mouse. Just the button. There's a remap in the options screen, but it doesn't work. You can't remap it to a keyboard key.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also vacuous. A small area surrounding you is lit up and you navigate through small, not very complex rooms to find the next key, to open the next door, repeat, etc.\n\nNot worth money.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438129358, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438129601, "recommendationid": "17274501", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497061", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442858079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 86, "steamid": "76561198196074759", "num_games_owned": 310}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a rather short 4 dollar game. Besides trying to unlock the hidden secret story or to get all achievements it doesn't have much replay. The limited lighting is a nice idea maybe if there were different arrangment of the levels for the difficulties it would have had longer entertaining value for some users. There are some random gliches ( I had a few gamethru with no monster ghost chasing me fixed by shutting down and opening up the game).  The controls are simple (I kind of wish I could use a controller on it) The sound effects are decent, story short, graphics for 8 bit not bad just a lot of Yellow (which you can see in the screen shots). \nSo that being said if you know your getting a short dectective, run-from-the-scary-thing (actully just don't let it see you your not going to outrun it in the harder difficulties) game then its not bad. If you want to work on getting the secret ending then this game can keep you playing for a while. Pretty much what you see in the description and the screen shots is what you get. For that reason I give this game a thumbs up becuase it does deliver what it says it does.

It also has a couple of bugs here and there. However, if you understand that, then I'd definitely say it's worth a play if you can maybe pick it up on sale, because it's quite innovative for what it is, and the retro vibe is very well done. It's a puzzle-focussed exploration game, with a little bit of a story.
