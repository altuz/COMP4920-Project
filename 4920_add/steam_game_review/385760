But being online prevents you from being able to do that. So if you want to try a new position you will have to grind many hours from your pathetic 58 or so rating.\n\nOverall, I cannot speak to what it is like to play online with other people, but as someone who buys 2K games on sale and only plays mycareer, I liked this game the least because it felt like all the game wants is you to purchase stats with microtransactions. If you can get past those flaws, then the mechanics are pretty enjoyable and in lieu with the other 2K games so far. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506438621, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506438621, "recommendationid": "35223728", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491014221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3083, "steamid": "76561198069002447", "num_games_owned": 59}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Too much microtransaction", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506909226, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506909226, "recommendationid": "35401734", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501779", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506710800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8997, "steamid": "76561198361378599", "num_games_owned": 6}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have mostly played the MyCareer and myGM features on my steam account and I have to say that it is a huge upgrade from PS3's 2K16 my previous 2K game even on my 940mx!

Since I only game on PC, my options for Sports games in general is limited, but I don't feel like I am settling for less by playing 2k.

With 2k18 just around the corner, I am curious how possible it will be to just enjoy playing without having to be online and interacting (intentionally or otherwise) with other players on the internet.

The game has several popular gamemodes including MyCareer, MyTeam, MyGM, MyLeague, and many more.  A lot of the game is centered around your created player that you made in the previously mentioned gamemode, MyCareer.  Your goal in that particular gamemode is basically exactly what you would expect, you begin by picking your College and then you move onto the NBA, where your goal is to work your way up to being a star.  Your player's skill is based upon a rating system and the highest your player can be is 99 overall.  \n\nNow onto the review, the game definitely has it's strong points including graphics and the appearance of the actual NBA players.  The developers at 2K did an amazing job making sure every player looks realistic.  I also thoroughly enjoy the little things in the game that are often overlooked such as, the in-game halftime and pregame shows.  They are very well done and are quite accurate to what actually happens during real NBA games.  While you are loading into a game, they also show episodes of their own show called 2KTV, these videos go behind the scenes of the making of the current NBA 2K title.  During the show they also do a few trivia questions that allow you to earn a little bit of free VC.  \n\nThe gamemodes themselves are all different, for example MyGM is about you picking a team and being the General Manager and making team decisions including trades, free agency signings, contracts, etc.  Another example is MyTeam, in this gamemode you start off with a random team, and the goal is to build your team from basically nothing to something special.  All of the gamemodes are missing some little things that I believe will make the game a tiny bit easier.  For example, my friend and I play a lot of MyLeague Online, we play our regular season games against each other and then we move onto the playoffs, but we then have to individually sim the playoff games to get our teams to the NBA Finals so we can play in a fun best of 7 series.  A small feature I would like to see is: an option to auto-sim two teams into the finals rather than doing each game at a time or risking that your team won't be in the finals by choosing the \"sim current round\" option.\n\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun to play with friends, however if you are by yourself you can have just as much fun by playing some of the single player gamemodes or by playing with random people online.  I give this game a solid 8/10.  I would say it's a good pickup, but at this point in time, I would just wait a few days and get NBA 2K18 that releases on September 19, 2017.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505397967, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505397967, "recommendationid": "34949117", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505967968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 87, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 648, "steamid": "76561198341194828", "num_games_owned": 4}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "2k sports made a good  work", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504940022, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504940022, "recommendationid": "34830657", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498095", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506424099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 149, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9992, "steamid": "76561198352890333", "num_games_owned": 3}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "gooood", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506415038, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506415038, "recommendationid": "35218028", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503336203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6856, "steamid": "76561198049900708", "num_games_owned": 37}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Worst, glitchiest game ever!
