And it is ok.  The controls work well, the rules function as a concept, the layout simple.  However, this game is boring.  It is not any fun.  A game can work well, but still suck.  The point is to be entertained.  Probably won't ever play it again after about 1.5 hours of giving it my honest effort.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460357328, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460357328, "recommendationid": "22352955", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477191", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484546465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 148, "steamid": "76561198021840203", "num_games_owned": 117}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "At first a serious bug.. played the demo with no problems but now I get the full version and can't get a single generated battle to start - keep getting dumped to the intro screen. Also can't get the music to shut off without turning all sound off..  Once fixed I will change my rating..\n\n1st Edit.. designers are responding to the first problem, seems to be effecting the \"no survivors\" game mode. Conquer and decapitation modes seem to work. However, I have not seen a response yet for the inability to turn off the music without turning off all sound. \n\nI will update this review when both are verified fixed.\n\n2nd Edit.. v1.81 fixed the problem with the \"no survivors\" game mode. Also found out the sound issue was a misunderstanding as the sound controls are a bit confusing. Apparently the music slider scales the sound effects and the speaker slider scales the music. \n\nWith the above.. this is a very good, and simple quick to learn, wargame. Even though there are only 3 units (not including a general in the decapitation mode) there is plenty of strategy and no micromanagement. For a quick and dirty wargame at a reasonable price and with good developer support I would recommend it to the casual wargamer.\n\nThanks.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459862599, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460039744, "recommendationid": "22252244", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504569", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471839540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 42, "steamid": "76561198073092169", "num_games_owned": 567}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game doesn't offer much more than the demo, so try to demo.\n\nOut of courtesy to developer, rating up", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463419661, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463419661, "recommendationid": "23023978", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490659", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
