Well, it's not very good, I don't know what game the other reviewers were playing  but I sure didn't have the same experience. \n\nFirst of all, the animations are great.  I actually admire the amount of work that went into the animations.  \n\nBut the game falls short after that.  I didn't find the levels to be very well thought out, basically just a simple straight path with the same enemy types over and over, I got all the way to the first boss, being extremely careful the whole time with hundreds of ammo.  The boss had several attack moves, but easily avoidable, so without missing a single shot, the boss took all of the machine gun ammo and all grenades, leaving me with just a pistol with 1000 ammo in it.  The pistol does not do much damage at all, and it would probably take 20+ minutes of shooting slowly to take him down.  I had to stop after pressing the shoot button a couple hundred times.  It would be a different story if you had the ability to be swapping out weapons or could build up some sort of strategy up to that point, but there's no way to have unlocked something else by this time.  Just sit there and pew-pew-pew your way through, taking tiny scratches off this boss.  It's just boring gameplay all around, and feels unbalanced as though they never even played their game from the start.  \n\nOn the third level in the graveyard, there is a giant message that says \"SNIPER RIFLE BEST USED HERE\" and a picture of a sniper.  But it's not possible to even have a sniper rifle at that stage at all, it's all locked.  You just have to ignore this.  \n\nIn your \"armory\", it lists a number.. mine says 317 right now.  What does it mean, I wonder?  There's no dollar sign or anything beside it, no tool tip, is it money?  Experience?  http://i.imgur.com/MGHIdsd.jpg\n\nIn addition to that, there are buttons in the menu to join online servers but none of them work.  When you first boot up the game, it says \"CONNECTION STATUS: Disconnected\" in the top left corner.  But it's not possible to actually connect to anything, I tried every single server.  Not a huge issue, though.  \n\nWhen you press the escape key in-game, it brings up the menu.  But it doesn't pause the gameplay at all?  I guess the developer hasn't figured out how to do that yet.  Not an issue for online games as it wouldn't make sense to pause it, but for single player matches it's awful to have no way to pause what you are doing.  \n\nThere are just weird problems everywhere, like if you click on the options menu, it reads \"create room\" on top, for no reason at all.  That's how rushed of a release this is, they didn't even check over the options menu for obvious mistakes.  \n\nSo, overall I found the game to be very poorly made, yet it shows promise.  They could turn it around and fix things...  but then now let's talk about the real reason I came here to complain.  I smell something fishy.  \n\nFirst of all, the whole store page is full of positive reviews on the very first day, everyone is just LOVING this game, somehow.  We've got steam accounts that only have 1 or maybe 2 games in it, buying this game and reviewing it.  Steam accounts that have ONLY started playing games on the day of Burgers' release.  That's highly suspicious.  \n\nSecondly, I videotaped myself playing the game, and my content was banned from the community.  http://i.imgur.com/W48hxoW.jpg  I recieved an email saying I was banned because my video \"violates the Steam Terms of Service.\"  Well, here's that video: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0a7s1NkODs\n\nWhat, exactly, is violating the terms of service in that video? \n\nHere are the guidelines: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4045-USHJ-3810\n\nDo not do any of the following:\n[list][*]Flame or insult other members [b]I did not do this.[/b]\n[*]Bypass any filters [b]I did not do this.[/b]\n[*]Abuse or encourage abuse of the Reputation, or Post Reporting Systems [b]I did not do this.[/b]\n[*]Post personally identifiable information (i.e. name, address, email, phone number, etc.) [b]I did not do this.[/b]\n[*]Bump threads [b]I did not do this.[/b]\n[*]Derail a thread's topic [b]I did not do this.[/b]\n[*]Post links to phishing sites [b]I did not do this.[/b]\n[*]Post spam (i.e. +1, 10char, rickrolls) or Re-post Closed, Modified, Deleted Content [b]I did not do this.[/b]\n[*]Repetitively post in the incorrect forum (example: trade requests belong in trading forum) [b]I did not do this.[/b]\n[*]Openly argue with a moderator [b]I did not do this.[/b]\n[/list]\n\nSo, as you can see, a simple \"let's play\" video should not be banned for violating the terms of service.  The developer clearly saw that I was having a less-than-stellar gaming experience and figured that they would lie to the Steam moderators in hopes to get my video removed.  This is dishonesty, and further goes to show you how low these developers will go to get content removed from their hub.  \n\nI do NOT recommend people to buy this game.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1439735744, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439408841, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439427582, "recommendationid": "17509638", "developer_response": "Thank you, Deacon, for speaking for us.

The story writes itself as they face off against monsters, aliens and other baddies.' \n\nFrom the sounds of it, this could've been a good good shoot 'em eup with zombies and guns. The sour note however, is that this game falls at even being playable in the slightest. The controls are terrible and hardly responsive, you constantly run out of ammo/ grenades considering that the baddies are bullet sponges.\n\n\"Burgers\" also goes so far as to not allow you to USE your knife. O_o What kind of black magic is this? Its as if this game wa made to enrage gamers, instead of entertain them. Burgers are supposed to be tasty. They're not supposed to taste like rotting zombie flesh.\n\nThe game also has challenges that add some other gameplay aspects that are good but not used well at all some examples are some sci-fi upgrades, a mech-suit and other weapons. And its due to bad controls.  \n\nWith this in mind, leveling up your character, and decent graphics don't do the game justice. If gameplay hardly has any redeemable quality, like with what this game has; then its safe to safe to say that this game was rushed, instead of developed. I doubt the developers even tested this game. It's a shame that this game blows like the wind, and it could've been fun, if it spent more time in development. 1/10\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441369276, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441369276, "recommendationid": "17875815", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504428", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440191636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561198008118692", "num_games_owned": 719}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm giving this game a tenative positive review given that it's still in Early Access like so many products on STEAM. In it's current state the game is like a horizontal as opposed to vertical scrolling version of Ikari Warriors (for those who have played that, if you have you are officially *OLD*). It's functional but a bit basic where you wind up switching between a pistol, machine gun, and grenades to kill waves of identical looking enemies while occasionally popping an explosive barrel. The game truely needs more enemy variety in this state but I can only hope that is coming. \n\n Premise-wise the game has you playing as a \"German Soldier\" in WW II, coveyed in the modern reinventionalist stance popular with Japan that is trying to seperate this from the Nazis. While playing a Nazi in a heroic context outside of the historical war could be thought provoking, and I think the world is ready for that, this is not the game to do it. The plot has very little to do with the war as a whole and your killing monsters for the most part. The only part of the game that some might find disturbing in this context from what I've seen is the first level where all of the bad guys have pronounced noses (a sort of Jewish stereotype) where the main character your playing has no real nose at all. Some may read into this, but it's never explicitly stated who your fighting, just people of this village where wierd stuff happens before the aliens and giant spiders show up. \n\n To be fair if they never specified your playing as a German soldier and armed you with vintage WW II weaponry there would be nothing even remotely controversial about this. There isn't anything offensive here, as the game seems to be intentionally walking the fence, as far as I've seen the Devs are correct and there isn't even a single swatstika on display though given the fanaticism that caused WW II I'd find it hard to believe anyone trusted with a special mission as this seems to be wouldn't be a loyalist of the National Socialist party, which of course doesn't mean someone is neccesarily a genocidal maniac (it being a workers rights movement by and large which got derailed by the leadership). Even if one argues for what would be a rare exception you'd at least be dealing with an ultra-nationalist in the military. But as I said this goes well beyond the context of what I've seen in the game. \n\n With some work \"Burgers\" could be good, but it lacks the charm or quality of \"Castle Crashers\" so far, but it could get there and become a shooter version. Shorter levels, more enemy variety, more background scenery to give it personality, etc... and this could very well turn into a great little game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440192562, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1440192562, "recommendationid": "17650809", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503703", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456270207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198122112373", "num_games_owned": 151}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nah, nope it is not worth your time. better off playing a flash game off a cheap website. nope. you can beat the entire game by using your knife ONLY.
