It took me about 4 hours to play through, which I consider to be a good length for the $10 price.  The story starts off a bit confusing, however it does make sense as you play through.  An interesting take on an \"amnesic character\" in a strange land.\n\nThe puzzles were not overly simple but never lead to my being so confused that I couldn't finish.  After completing the story I felt satisfied, and its got a nice lead up for a sequel which I'd be glad to buy if they make it.\n\nIf you're a fan of old-school adventures with a fantasy setting I'd definately recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477586052, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1477586052, "recommendationid": "26247762", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523525", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477627480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 278, "steamid": "76561198059623957", "num_games_owned": 121}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Amazing story, setting, characters, puzzles...everything.

An ordinary, somewhat shy guy gets whisked away to a fantasy land and tasked with a quest that he neither understands much of or feels up to - but nevertheless sets out on this unexpected journey of discovery and growth. Along the way he'll make friends and enemies. He'll meet some crazies and non-human forms of inteligent life. As you'd expect from a fantasy tale, there's swords, magical creatures - and love. But all of that has its own unique flavor, specific to the creators -- a wife and a husband -- and the flerd between Paul and Lily feels all the more personal and adorkable for that. The game itself leans to the comedic side, and the puzzles especially require some unorthodox, out-of-the-box thinking -- but while the solutions might not be evident at once, they're fair and require only that you mind your surroundings and inventory. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and while I've never played King's Quest or Simon the Sorcerer (which, I think, might've been major inspirations), as a LucasArts adventure fan I some of my favorite things out of it, too.\n\nPros:\n- the old-school graphics! Today's mainstream where games seem to revel in being hi-res festivals of murkiness -- and I love me some pixels and saturated, juicy colors\n- the comedy - I've always preferred the funny point&clicks with odd-ball characters, and this one has plenty\n- the heart - the game's a passion project that was made on and off for 10 years! You have to admire this kind of devotion!\n\nCons:\n- there's one Click Time Event that I found annoying (but the creators say there's an option to skip it if you've failed twice)\n- one puzzle leads to a dead end after much effort taken, which seems a bit unfair (but the actual solution isn't far away, actually)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488276506, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488276506, "recommendationid": "30237395", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509391", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486192689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 104, "steamid": "76561197993154288", "num_games_owned": 477}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Had a lot of fun playing this -- took around 4 hours (Steam isn't showing the playtime correctly for some reason).
