That needs to be remedied. For those familiar with Matrix old Fields of Glory (FoG), this game is better in almost all respects. Graphics and animations do matter, and although I probably have 400+ custom FoG scenarios, the game just seems dull, even in multiplayer.\n\nThe biggest difference in this game, compared to say HexWar's \"Nuts\" or \"Assault on Arnhem,\" is that it feels like a complete game system, not a puzzle game like Arnhem. That it doesn't have an editor like FoG is to be expected for the current price of $8.99. FoG and almost all the DLC I bought cost me a fortune back in the day! What this game does have is 18 varied battles. And, hold onto your hats, the ability to easily modify most of the text files. Certainly a first for HexWar, and the reason I have less time in-game than I should have by now.\n\nI know most people simply won't do this, but simple cutting and pasting of unit names in the scenario file gives one complete freedom to replace any unit in the game system with any other. Unit strengths and weapon effects can also be easily modified. So for a tinkerer like myself, I can get a few months from the system.\n\nOnly overt oversight I've noticed so far is the Combat Analysis box is rather large (my native res is 1900x1200), so in some cases it gets partially cut off the screen. Also, in the Idivisto (16 A.D.) scenario, I expected the Germans to rush me like the crazy barbarians they are, but the AI was very slow to move its units forward, so I was able to deal with them piecemeal. But in the other two scenarios I've played, the AI wasn't bad and certainly as good or better than FoG. It may also be possible to modify AI behavior in the script files.\n\nBut unless you are an insane Ancients fan that can deal with the UI horror and micromanagement found in the HPS ancients series, this game has plenty of stats that should satisfy most \"normal\" players and includes a variety of charts to consult in-game. The aforementioned Combat Analysis box gives the average player a good feel for the potential attack, without all the bumbo jumbo that appears in FoG's detailed combat analysis function.\n\nAmazingly, this is not just another cookie cutter HexWar game, and I need to check the game credits to see who designed this thing. So far, it actually seems worthy of future DLC and/or a scenario editor, which is typically not the HexWar way of thinking. Meaning, this game seems worthy of follow-up work, but that will only happen if people buy it. Forgive me, but forget HexWar's other ported games and just get this one. It looks good, plays smoothly, is moddable and quick to play. And the battle maps I've seen so far are satisfyingly large and etailed--much more so than FoG--and contain upwards of 50+ units per side (Idivisto is one, but I haven't counted).\n\nAnyway, unlike the HPS epics, it is big enough to be satisfying and you've got a great shot at actually finishing the scenario in one sitting. For the price, I highly recommend it to novice on up to intermediate players. Even if you don't start modding the files, the 18 scenarios are more than worth the asking price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506146656, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506146656, "recommendationid": "35145222", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517623", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507135936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 39, "steamid": "76561198002568901", "num_games_owned": 333}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It doesn't work in WIN 7.
