It lacks a depth in maneuver options due to the large tile scale and similarly it lacks sophistication during the movement phase. The Ai needs work to make for a good oponent. After playing only one turn I noticed the Ai diong some inexplicable things. Overall this game falls far short of expectation. Also, due to a cursor bug, for me it was unplayable. \n\nThere seems to be a mouse selection problem where it moves the focus on the selected unit to some random point on the hex grid. Unfortunately I had to give up playing during the second turn as I could not control the units. I think that is grounds for my money back.\n\nI would echo other reviews that this is more a mobile game in the style of Civilization rather than an epic game in the tradition of the SPI board game War In Euope.\n\nDespite and also because of my criticisms, I would be very keen to see this game reworked to mirror the style of the hexwar online board game.

If a game has negative reviews, it's not likely to be a good game.   Mouse pointer jumpes all over, takes multiple clicks to finally select the unit.\n\nGame is very slow, plodding.

I've played a number of the scenarios and campaigns. Most of them are not worth the time, but the full Barbarossa Campaign on the hard level was quite entertaining, IF you play as Germany. The Russian A/I for this longest campaign makes some good moves, IMO. It seems like the game designers poured all of their energy into making the Russian A/I fairly competent for this campaign. However, the German A/I for the long scenario is HORRENDOUS. Completely passive, defensive, no blitzing, etc. Horrible.  Please come up with a head to head version. The victory conditions need changing as well. In the Barbarossa campaign, the conditions change from turn to turn. A fixed victory condition would be an improvement, IMO.
