Doubtful.\nShould you buy this game? I see no reason why. \nWill I ask a refund? Well... The guinea pig is kinda cute. \n\nSeriously, this game is really, really bad. The only thing you have to do is to reach the end of a level, sometimes picking up a \"quest\" item on the road. There are ennemies in your way but it is far more efficient to dodge them all. Jumping on their heads indeed prove difficult and I have not figured at all what determines either you are hurt or you make a hit. Anyway, you have equal chance to die than to kill the guy, so on average, you are dead by the end of the level of you don't run away (but that's what a guinea pig is meant to do, right?).\n\nYou can also pick up apples along the way. A certain amount of them will resplenish your life. Otherwise, they are basically useless. \n\nLife is a pig problem. You have three bars of health and three lifes. I didn't quite get the difference between loosing a life and loosing them all (I re-started at the same point in both cases). As has been stressed in other reviews, once you have died, you will have to go throughout the game with only one life as the number of lifes remain at 0 until the end. This is pretty annoying. Knowing that a false jump (and, given the poor quality of the controls, you can bet you will do plenty) leading into a pit will make you instantly loose your one and only life, the game turns out to be incredibly difficult for nothing. Really bad.  \n\nNoises may be awful -especially when you are hurt or when you fall. This is more annoying than you can think of. \n\nAre there any pros left? Not many. The main character is cute. The developpers seem to be involved. Actually it made me really sad and I have some pity for them. They seem to have tried to make a nice work with a nice guinea pig... And it just fails. Plainly. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462964752, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1462964752, "recommendationid": "22909235", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503729", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456186729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22, "steamid": "76561198013867123", "num_games_owned": 139}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game does not only have breath-taking graphics but amazing gameplay too!
