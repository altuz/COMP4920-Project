I'm not sure what you're expecting.  It was a fun little variant on what is an overdone concept at this point. If you want something to mindlessly click at while at work, watching tv, or whatever. This provides more entertainment than other variants I've encountered, but wait for a sale.

I guess it's all right at what it is, a solitaire card game with some earnable extras to make it smoother, but for the asked price that's a little sparse. The story is rather cheesy and its conclusion is not very satisfying either (Cliffhanger Warning!). And then there's the achievements... be warned, if you really want to collect them all, because it's going to be quite a grind to get the last two or three, as one of them (which is the pre-requisite for at least one other, I don't quite recall all details, because I haven't touched it in a while) is completely chance-based.\n\nSo, really only get this game if you're desperate for some alternative solitaire card game and don't care about achievements and storytelling much."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503191918, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487418", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34362822", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035691061", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1503191682, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3019}, "timestamp_updated": 1503191918, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Was fun for a while until ALL of my in game achievements got wiped.

Additionally, last time I submitted a bug report and told them what happened they said there was nothing they could do, so Im not going to bother to even ask this time. If you want to feel like you're having fun only to get completely pissed off later, then buy this game. Otherwise save your money."}]}
