It manages to make wrong decisions at almost every step of the way while making itself just good enough to have made it worth my time to play for 7 hours and make it to bosses and areas that only 10% of players have the achievement for getting. I have played the game and experienced it, and for the first 2 areas, it was alright. It fell apart very very quickly. I quit after one particular situation that I will elaborate on in detail later, but I feel I experienced quite enough of the game to give it the negative review I am now giving it. The comments will contain more.\n\nNormally I would give a review on every aspect of the game, but I'm going to be brief here, because the list of negatives to discuss in comparison to its obvious inspiration, Dark Souls, are many. The cartoonish art style of the game is not awful - but upper bodies seem just a bit too big and legs and feet seem just a bit too small. There's not a lot of visual variation in the human enemies (though they have their own attack patterns), though the beastly enemies are what you'd except from an Egypt themed games: scorpions, ghouls, and the like, along with Stone Golems. Music was forgettable. I don't recall a single track to be truthful with you.\n\nThere's a war going on in the background but it's unimportant. NPCs are unimportant. You even feel unimportant - but there's nothing else to latch onto. In Dark Souls, your individual importance is carefully weighted against the superb environmental storytelling; you may not matter, but the places you traverse once did, and the driving force is that genuine sense of exploration. In this game, you simply go places and you kill bosses because She Said So. The contrast is real, this game implements vagueness and obscurity, but misses the meaning of those things it tries to emulate.\n\nSo now let's talk about the downsides (which is a polite way to say \"The rest of the game.\"). This list will largely be spoken about as though you have an understanding of  Dark Souls concepts and terms,  such as \"i-frames\", \"bonfires\",  and \"poise\".\n\n-There are no souls, just a normal TNL XP bar. Levelling increases health, stamina, and magic. That's it. You still lose a huge chunk of XP when you die, so dying really just does mean \"more grinding\". It sucks in Dark Souls but sucks more here, because...\n\n- There are gated encounters you MUST fight between bonfires at points, which means it's very possible to die at a point and NEED to kill several difficult encounters (due to 2d space, cameras that don't move, and actual spikes that stop movement and can't be broken) to get your XP back.\n\n- There are no stats, no weapon scaling, nothing. Levelling up is done via Skill Gems. 2 problems: Tying your core levelling progression to a collectathon style item is not a good design decision. There are 2 extras, and 8 skills with 5 levels each. The design intention is that you select one of two types for each equipment: light/heavy weapons, light/heavy armor, light/heavy shields, and offense/defense backpacks. Miss more than 2 and you are not maxing out your stats. Several require you to buy them for expensive prices from shops.\n\n-Bringing us to skill choices. Enemies are damage sponges, and aggressive enough to where you'll only really get a max of 3 swings maybe less before needing to dodge. Especially in packs. Because of that, when a dagger will hit the same number of times as a greataxe - why use the dagger? Heavy weapons are the obvious choice. There is no damage scaling of any kind or sort, so just use the highest damage. Due to the damage formula in the game, less armor will actually [i]amplify[/i] the damage you take. Not reduce it. Having slightly more stamina does not outweigh (heh) the downsides of having less than 1/2 the armor and taking extra damage when you do get hit. Chip damage is killer, as outlined soon. Shields are subjective... ish - but few shields will block 100% of damage, and those that do often take more stamina to block them, as opposed to DkS: heavy shields parry less effectively and take more stamina to use. I chose heavy shields because an Unblockable attack means Unparryable too, making blocking what you can more effective just made sense. There are no ripostes and no reduction to stamina drain for a successful parry, so blocking then folowing up with 2 attacks is identical to parrying and doing the same. Offense/defense backpack is truly your own choice, but I liked buffs better than attack spells, as enemies are damage sponges so lasting buffs on yourself seemed better. Finally: There are even Dev posts that talk about how sepcific bosses have unpredictable, hard to read animations by design, or are very tanky and hard to harm with light weapons,so he recommends using heavy weapons and shields even if you didn't skill them. In light of this I truly believe there is no point to playing any build that isn't Heavy/Heavy/Heavy/Defense. Anything else is artificial difficulty.\n\n-You only get 3 chugs of Estus. If you get more, I did not see it in my 7 hours of play through to the Royal Quarry (the long way, not the King's Valley shortcut) The \"Estus Ring\" gives you one more chug, but, [i]insultingly[/i] reduces the amount of heal per chug. This makes chip damage killer, as distances between \"Bonfires\" are long and arduous, with forced encounters. See above about damage formulas and heavy armor.\n\n-There are 3 separate dodges, all with separate amounts of i-frames. I do not know how many, just that a standing dodge has the most and a backwards dodge has the least. The Dev says he \"does not remember\". There is no good reason to make inconsistent i-frames, as this badly messes with player reaction and muscle memory, especially when you can be caught between 2 enemies, and a forward roll facing one way is a backwards roll the other way, with different i-frames. Perversely, unlike DkS, this encourages a somewhat stationary battle style when possible: Spot dodge everything or parry/block everything, then hit back. In practice, due to below, this is not generally doable.\n\n- Enemy hurtboxes are generous and will overlap with their hitboxes. Enemies can 180 mid combo and continue to hit you. It's not uncommon to roll through an enemy's attack only to be hit by the backswing of the sword with crosses over their body and hits you midroll after your i-frames are done but after you dodged the actual attack. Enemy attacks can be Unblockable or Undodgeable, noted by Red and Blue tints, but sometimes these tints don't show up except just before an attack actually hits - meaning you're just forced to memorize the windups anyways, amking the tells useless.\n\n- Enemies will come in mobs, can overlap each other, and can mix up Unblockable and Undodgeable attacks simultaneously, meaning the only way to not take damage is to physically not be in that space - but there is no sprint button, and movement is combat is artificially slowed down from exploration movement, making damage almost inevitable at times, as the enemies are exceedingly good (to its credit) at \"phalanxing\" big enemies in back that can swing through allies, with little guys with shields in front. A group of scorpions, golems, and shielded spear users did this to me. This is why I quit. It didn't kill me. It was just the last straw. The scorpions lunge forward with an unblockable stab of the tail, run forward with aspinning sweep of the tail that is undodgeable and remains active as long as the tail is spinning (including behind it and in the body), a 1-2 combo attack, the golems have an unblockable one-two combo that they can rotate in the middle of (like all combos), and the spear users have a long range Undodgeable spear sweep, and can block and parry. I was done at that point. The best heavy weapon I found, the Hittite Sword, took 8-10 hits to kill one. There would regularly be 3-5 monsters per encounter.
