Don't let the idea that it has \"only three stages\" dissuade you from purchasing it. You'll get more entertainment from Nandeyanen's three stages than you would from games that are twice its length (and far more than twice its price).\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, Nandeyanen!? nails it. Controls are tight and responsive, and everything necessary for dispatching foes is provided right from the start: standard bullet stream, companions to summon, a charge beam, and the ability to \"counter\" enemy shots. Among these skills, the \"bullet counter\" is especially notable for its orginality. Functioning much like a \"parry\" would in a fighting game--specifically Street Fighter III, for those old enough to remember--a successful counter deflects incoming fire. Managing to deflect a torrent of bullets feels pretty satisfying, and using the other skills efficiently is fun, but you'll have to play on \"normal\" or \"hard\" to appreciate the cleverness of Nandeyanen's mechanics. The easy difficulty setting oversimplifies countering bullets, making the game *too* easy. \n\nAs for the game's visuals and music, Nandeyanen!? doesn't miss a beat. The game creatively draws upon Japanese mythology to produce a dream-like, immersive world. The stage backgrounds have a lovely hand-painted look to them, and the sprites populating the stages are vibrant, featuring a degree of animation uncommon in bullet hell shoot 'em ups. The game's soundtrack perfectly compliments its visuals, smoothly blending traditional Japanese instruments and vocals with contemporary beats. I haven't experienced such an effective adaptation of Japanese folklore and music in a game since Okami. As with that classic, some familiarity with Japanese culture may enhance appreciation of the game, but thorough knowledge of all things Japanese is not required for enjoyment. Anyone who enjoys beautiful art and music will more than likely be pleased by the game's unique aesthetic and mystic atmosphere.\n\nTchagata Games really has made something special. Yes, it is a short game. But that's typical of the shoot 'em up genre. What's not typical is that Nandeyanen!? offers not only sound gameplay but  also a well-imagined world that has all the appeal of a folktale. This is clearly a labor love by a small indie team invested in crafting a game worth playing and a tale worth telling.\n\nBuy it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437667365, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438096806, "recommendationid": "17189818", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506291", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456932886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 99, "steamid": "76561198101802133", "num_games_owned": 215}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "In a shmup, I take three things into account: theme, sound design, and art.\nNandeyanen!? hs=as an interesting, well fleshed out theme, that theme being Japanese folklore, specifically, yokai. \nThe art is... decent. The sprites, both of you and your enemies, are nice looking, but far from amazing. They do, however, complement the theme pretty well. The backgrounds are stunning, though.\nThe only plae the game really falls behind is sound design. The music's great, but the sound effects kind of f-cking suck. There's no real audio feedback when yout hit an enemy other than a faint, unsatisying beep. It's not enough to ruin the game, but it doesn significntly lessen the experience.\nAll in all, buy it if you like shmups because it's real cheap and worth your time for the most part.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444423422, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444423422, "recommendationid": "18401244", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437596903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 31, "steamid": "76561198006068964", "num_games_owned": 1392}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A unique hard-as-balls shmup style game with a brilliant soundtrack and some great visuals.
