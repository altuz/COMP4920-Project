I *LOVE* roguelike games. its my favorite genre and i have hundreds of hours into binding of isaac and games like it. I also love action rpg games like diablo and etc, so the fusion of the two seemed like an awesome idea that i wanted to be amazing.\n\nWhere i take issue with the game is here:\nTake a game like diablo (1/2/3) hardcore mode. Health in that game is easy come easy go. You will take unavoidable damage regularly while playing, but its not only trivial but a major part of the game to stock up on health items. In d2, you'll have a belt full of literally 16 full health potions. So you have a game formula of If you die once you lose your character, and you can take unavoidable damage regularly, BUT you also have excess access to health items.\n\nNow take a roguelike like binding of isaac or enter the gungeon. \nIt's not so easy to come across health in those games, and if you die once you lose your character. *BUT* you practically never take unavoidable damage or damage unexpectedly. That is to say - everytime you get hit in binding of isaac you're like: oh yeah i let that bullet hit me or i walked into that poison or whatever.\n\nThe thing about this game thats been bothering me is that it doesn't have this balance of either of the previous 2 games.\n\n1.If you die your game is over.\n2. health is EXTREMELY difficult to come across\n3. you incur unavoidable damage regularly.\n\nIf you're playing a melee hero, you *CANNOT* avoid taking damage. whereas if you're amazing at binding of isaac you can not take a point of damage for almost the entire game.  This would be okay if health wasn't SO DIFFICULT to come across. you can buy full heals at the end of every level but 1. it makes for a less fun experience and 2. it doesnt address the issue of life in a big level.\n\nExample: the sand worms in the desert. When they spit poison on the ground, you are guaranteed to take a few points of damage because the ground is active immediately. The damage should not begin for a second or two after the visual cue, making it avoidable for the player.\n\nOther problem: for the bow character, the optimal strategy is to basically spam your defensive move nonstop, because the I-frames keep you almost permanently invincible. So how you play her is: spam defensive to one side of the map, shoot your bow 3 times, spam defensive to the other side, bow, defensive, bow, defensive.\n\nThats the optimal strategy. its right there, there is no other way to play her if you want to do the best.\nand its not fun.\n\nThe rock golem on the other hand has a much more fun and dynamic playstyle, But then you run into the unavoidable melee damage issues. \n\nFinal issue is this: in games like binding of isaac and enter the gungeon, the visual cues for damage sources are SO OVERT. you absolutely cannot miss an object whose frames will cause you damage. It causes you to rarely feel like you took damage where you shouldnt have - which is incredibly frustrating.\n\nIn this game, because of the nature of the models and enemies, as well as the visual noise of the map around you, its not easy to tell when an enemy or object is emitting damage frames. I'll find myself being like what the fuck how did that fucking fly just hit me thats bullshit.\n\nStronger visual cues for when you're invincible vs not, when an enemy can damage you vs not, would go a LOOOOONG LONG LONG LONG LONG way imo. because i find myself just being frustrated when i die. whereas in a game like binding of isaac, you almost always see your death coming. In this game i'll abruptly die and be like oh welp run over that was lame.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506314200, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506314200, "recommendationid": "35196286", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506273831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 132, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 132, "steamid": "76561198027269721", "num_games_owned": 159}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Just getting started when I write this but hoo boy. It's like a frickin' Diablo Souls or somethin'. \nIt's hard as nuts but also fun as nuts. Like... A really hard Diablo 3 on the PS3. Hitting buttons to fight and having the whole neatness of it. Would love to learn the lore of this world and see this game become a big ol' thingie but we'll see. I'm sure some early hitters took a while to hit it big anyway. Like, was The Binding of Isaac an instant hit? I mean. I honestly don't know but... probably not??\nAnyway, I like. Basically bought it for the girl with a giant katana was like \"dat me\"\nand purchased the game. Found out the sword isn't realeased yet and to play the girl who uses it anyway has a difficult unlock method.\nWell. To basically get my money's worth I got a lot of work to do.
