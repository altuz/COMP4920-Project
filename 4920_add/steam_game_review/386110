It took me a while longer than it should have because I had to contact the dev to figure out a bug. A regular play through would probably take 45 minutes at the most. First things first, the dev is very helpful and great. Unfortunately the game has a ways to go before it's worth buying. \n\nThere are some glaring problems, and I'll try to make this review as constructive as possible so hopefully Raywin 2 addresses these problems. \n\n1. There is no tutorial to learn the controls. They are easy enough but you first need to try all your keys to see if they do anything. \n\n2. Items don't tell you what they do. You have a healing potion? Great! But it doesn't tell you how much it will heal you. Vegatables? Fun! What are they even used for? I didn't use an item throughout the entire game. \n\n3. You can't see the HP of the enemy. How am I supposed to know when to heal/attack? So far I just attack and eventually win, and have some NPC heal me. Not much strategy. \n\n4. Wall/noclip glitches everywhere. Doesn't feel like a complete game. Not to mention, 95% of every shop screen is empty space. There is no decoration, and on the off-chance there is decoration, half the time you can walk right through it. \n\n5. Can't go back to places already visited. Found that out too late, so I think I missed some content. \n\n6. The \"quests\" are as simple as \"walk 5 spaces and click 'space' 8 times then come back\". Another quest you literally turn into a rock, for no good reason, to sneak by some guards. That's the only time you turn into a rock in the whole game. I would understand if it the game was introducing a new mechanic, but it's not. I just don't get it. \n\nOne nice part about the game is the leveling system. It seems really cool, but since you only defeat maybe 5 enemies (you can avoid the rest without problem) you don't really get to try it out. At the end, each of my characters levelled one.. to level 2. I feel like this would have been a fun part of the game, I just wish I was able to take advantage of it!\n\nOverall, not a very gripping game. Needs a lot of work fixing some bugs. I don't recommend it in its current state.\n\n**To get into the museum, you need to press space to enter.

Even when not from scratch it is still very time consuming and thinking of an original story these days just isn't easy in the slightest. Unfortunately this game just isn't good. It is obvious instantly that this is made with RPG Maker pre-made assets. You can tell this from the way the sprite look in-game to how their psuedo-3D faces look when dialogue options come up. There are tons of grammatical errors and really cringey and cliche writing.
