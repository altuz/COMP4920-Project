I do not know for sure if this is my system, or the game, but the choppiness of regular game play is so distracting and a general bummer that I wont be sinking hours into it until that gets fixed.\n\nThe chopiness I am referring to manifests in skips or lags in game speed. Walking around, scrolling text, etc execute it starts and it strikes an unpleasant nerve for me. I checked the box in the settings for less screen flashes or whatever, but I did not get any recognizable change on that front.\n\nI will have to revise my review when these issues are properly addressed.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501249396, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501249396, "recommendationid": "33856052", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500699", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501034690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 343, "steamid": "76561198079197456", "num_games_owned": 385}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "This is a ton of fun but you are going to have problems out the gate. I am using a Xbox 360 controller and it took me a good while to remap the buttons so here is what I've done.

Use the list above so you know what is what.\n\nUse this to rebind the game's buttions.\n\nProblems Thus Far:\nNo buttion to skip or make chat go faster.\nWhen on the overworld map there is this weird bug where if you try to attack with the off hand item your map opens up and pauses the game and the attack. This happens everytime you use the off hand making it just about useless. I even tried to rebind the command to a diffrent buttion on the controller but it does not help it and it really hurts the gameplay but there is a fix: Whatever you\n\nThis game is good so far with some good story so do not let the controlls deter you from enjoying it but the overworld bug is going to be a massive pain.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500570354, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500780497, "recommendationid": "33676337", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
