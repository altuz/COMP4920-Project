Even the most popular ones like Binding of Isaac are wildly all over the place, with some runs being cakewalks and others being an uphill struggle. What unites all the great ones, however, are those moments where fortune smiles upon you and that magical crossing of luck and skill delivers you a win. Vampire of the Sands has many of the parts to make these moments happen, and many more parts that will cruelly snatch them away.\n\nI will say upfront that I'm a big fan of the premise. You've been resurrected by a necromancer to descend into dungeon beneath the desert and kill a vampire, who I guess is worse than having a practicing necromancer around. You pick one of four unfortunate revivees, each with a dramtically different playstyle, and then begin your descent into the subterrainean sands. The first of eight levels is desert-themed but the others stray into such territories as breweries, libraries, tech bases, and meatspace. The pixelly foes are equally bizarre, so prepared to get murdered by smiling beer bottles and angry sculptors over and over and over.\n\nDuring your journey you'll find weapons that extend your attack reach, cloaks that take hits for you, masks that give you new abilities, scrolls, potions, wands, and more. There's also money to spend at shops, keys to open chests, and scrap to randomly craft new gear out of. Honestly there are so many items that you'll soon find your 16-slot inventory stuffed to bursting, and you'll need all of them to battle the denizens of the dungeon. Or you would, if you even had the remotest chance against them.\n\nI keep coming back to the enemies because Vampire of the Sands is possibly the most vicious roguelike I've ever played, and I've played IVAN. What you need to understand about this game is that EVERYTHING is stacked against you. All of the classes in the game die in one hit, except for one that has literally no other advantages. Cloaks can take a hit for you but immediately break, and there are plenty of monsters in the game that can double-tap you (or triple, or quadruple if you find other forms of protection). Your masks that provide key bonuses break in a single hit as well. And don't expect to lean on your weapons, because they break in less than a dozen hits and leave you with your short, delayed melee attack that most enemies can outpace. Oh, and there's stamina too, which you can't attack or dodge without.\n\nOn top of all this is the soul system, which is a counter that counts down to your re-death. Since you're a reanimated abomination, you need souls to survive. The only way to get them is to kill enemies or find soul stones, so a slow and methodical approach to combat and exploration is right out. There are classes that mitigate some of these issues, but horribly handicap you in others. One character is fast but can't use potions, one has unlimited stamina but can't use weapons, and one doesn't need souls but can't use armor. The fourth character can take multiple hits but has no other advantages, so you still have to deal with slow movement, breaking weapons, and the countdown of death.\n\nThe end result is a game that's just too damn hard to find any fun in learning. If even one of the limiting systems were removed (one-hit kills or the soul countdown would be my vote) the game would still be hard but manageable, but this is ridiculous. My best runs have been ones that just bee-line for the bosses and cheese with unbalanced scrolls and masks. Most of the time I just get swarmed the moment I step onto any level other than the first and die. You can earn coins between runs to spend on Tetris-style runes that start you with advantages like items or new abilities, which is a good system for making overall progress. But it still isn't enough to mitigate the absolutely punishing difficulty, especially when so many runs end too soon to earn you any coins for runes.\n\nYou only need to beat 2 of the 8 bosses to enter the final dungeon, but of all the people who have played the game even once, only 17% have managed that feat. Think about that, 17% of people who TRIED to play the game could beat 2 bosses in one run. This is a game for the folks who managed the never-get-hit achievements in Binding of Isaac, and no one else. And even THOSE people are bound to be frustrated by the strange bugs that remain in the game (despite the developer's dogged efforts, at least). In the end, Vampire of the Sands is the most disappointing kind of game, the one that has a great premise, great style, and all the right parts, and then cranks up the difficulty to where virtually no one can enjoy it.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

There are a few reasons for this, such as:\n\n\u2022 The enemies are either too easy or too hard to kill. There is a general lack of balance in this regard. For example outside of the Sand Zone they are swarming the screen so much, that barely anything will save you. \n\u2022 The vast majority of items are useless. After a few hours of getting used to the game I found, that all I need is rocks and/or other throwing weapons. Magic items, Scrolls and Melee weapons are outclassed by them. Since almost everything dies in one hit, ranged combat is far more powerful than melee. Some of the spells are good, but you get so much to throw, that they are unnecessary.\n\u2022 The runes are either too strong or simply useless. Again, a balancing issue. Why would I waste slots for a key (opens chests) when I can simply kick a chest open by default? \n\u2022 It is full of bugs. I encountered numerous fatal errors, multiple looted coins always count as one, chests are sometimes unreachable, etc. \n\nNow I mentioned the things, that may keep you away from purchasing and playing the game, but there are some redeeming factors - they are just a bit overshadowed by the negatives.\n\nI did enjoy the gameplay for what its worth. Reaching the end of a chapter felt good, mostly because it is a testament of one's dodging skills mixed with a bit of tactic. It is challenging, and trying to clear all zones in the same round is pretty difficult. Since it is a roguelike, you start fresh after each death, and your loot is randomized. The rune system is also a good general idea, I just wish it was a bit better balanced.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459088782, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499765321, "recommendationid": "22085519", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525574", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437238657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 57, "steamid": "76561198029561896", "num_games_owned": 195}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": 0, "review": "When the game released I was having issues remapping the controls and after posting about it on the forum I was contacted within the hour by one of the developers who genuinely seemed concerned about the issue. Not even a day later the game was updated and I was able to remap controls successfully. Mapping the diagonals directly isn't quite working yet, but it will accept UP + LEFT input as a northwest ( Using a Xbox 360 controller). Regardless, I was still impressed by how fast the developers responded to feedback. It wasn't until now that I realized that the numpad looks like the most comfortable way to play at the moment; I should have known better coming from an ADOM, Angband, Brogue, ect. background.\n\nThe game itself is somewhat simple but difficult roguelite that I felt had a good amount of content for what it was worth. The combat is a little bit on the clunkier side but I got used to it after a little bit and being able to actually defeat some of the  more difficult enemies was satisfying.\n\nI'd highly recommend playing Practice before actually diving in to the main game because it tells you what the controls are, otherwise you'll have to go in with trial and error or just looking at the menu.\n\nI'm also a big fan of the classical guitar main track.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437187790, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437238737, "recommendationid": "17101261", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529503", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487701239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 165, "steamid": "76561198005229090", "num_games_owned": 190}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I picked up Vampire of the Sands while it was a part of the Black Shell Media roguelike bundle and finally got around to giving it a try. Unfortunately, it's one of the games in my library that I wish I never played. Even more unfortunate is that I want to like this game, but some frustrating design choices and bugs made the learning process not fun.\n\nPros:\n+Art style is unique and engaging\n+Skill-based combat with varied weapon styles and a dodge mechanic\n+Several visually unique zones, and dozens of enemies\n+Rune system is interesting and serves as a form of overall account progression usually not seen in traditional roguelikes\n+Relatively short game lengths coupled with the boosts you get from runes mean that deaths don't set you back too much in terms of time spent playing, and the permadeath mechanic seems fair (or it would if the other game mechanics worked, but more on that below)\n\nCons:\n-The hunger clock (or Soul clock if you're so inclined) is poorly implemented. It's a pretty standard and straightfoward clock: your Soul bar will deplete gradually as you play the game, and defeating enemies gives you a small number of souls. There are also soul \"container\" items similar to those in Dark Souls that provide you with a chunk of Souls immediately, and defeating branch bosses will always reward you with Souls. With the wealth of other difficulty mechanics at play (as well as the fact that VotS is a real-time game as opposed to a turn-based one where this particular type of clock tends to work better) I find it a little baffling that the devs decided to include a hunger clock at all. There are a lot of other directions the devs could have gone in when designing it, but unfortunately they played it safe and went with a relatively genre-standard variation that ends up not jiving well with the real-time pacing.\n\n-The combat is clunky. To name a few gripes I have with it: weapon hitboxes can be very hit-or-miss with multiple enemies on screen, some weapon effects fail to trigger at all in combat (such as the Mace's knockback effect), and the dodge/tumble is just as likely to get you killed in combat as it is to save your life. The controls in general feel kind of clunky, especially movement.\n\n-Difficulty. I'm no stranger to the roguelike genre (5 DCSS ascensions, 2 ADoM ascensions, thousands of combined hours in Brogue, ToME, IVAN, FTL, etc.) and games with steep learning curves can be some of the most rewarding to learn how to play. I don't really get that feeling with VotS though, mostly because it's hard to tell when you're playing well. This is a blanket problem with a lot of 1HP roguelikes due to the difficulty that comes along with balancing them, and when I was attempting to learn VotS I found myself being killed so often with so little explanation that it was hard to gauge if I was making any real progress. There were several times that I was killed by a mid-flight projectile the instant I loaded into a new branch, or a unique enemy would pop up onscreen and I would die a second later.\n\n-Bugs with combat. Enemies would very frequently shoot off projectiles after they had disappeared from the screen, weapon hitboxes would phase through enemies seemingly randomly, weapons would occasionally only hit objects underneath enemies (monster spawns, traps, decorations, etc.) and deal no damage to the creature on top...the list goes on.\n\n\nTo summarize my above points, Vampire of the Sands is a conceptually interesting game that unfortunately is marred by a host of design and technical issues. If, despite all of this, you still want to give VotS a shot, I would highly recommend waiting until it drops under $1 again, because it just isn't worth $5 in its current state.\n\n\n*NOTE: Review was edited for grammar and to expand on some of the listed cons", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485999403, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486058075, "recommendationid": "29639827", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511144", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477799742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 128, "steamid": "76561197970938346", "num_games_owned": 266}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This feels like a 60% developed game.\n\nThey've got the graphics and the basic mechanics, but there's no depth, no care, no love, no soul anywhere.

This game is also a real time hack n' slash rouguelike. It isnt turnbased, so even if you dont have all of the perks, the game is completeable on runs where your rune grid is not as upgraded.

I guess I would say this game is an \"arpg\" action roguelike playing game.The game wasn't ever in Early Access, which I believe would have help with alot of the initial bugs and gameplay problems but for whatever reason the game was released as a finished product. There was some trouble with controller support and a few other minor things but most have been patched. The dev listens and is working on the next patch as I'm writing this and it should be updated around the end of october 2015.\n\n Ok so on to some gameplay mechanics, it definitely has permadeath and procedural level design but also has collectables (ruins) that enable you to add permanent bonuses of your choosing once you've collected enough coins. These \"ruins\" can drastically change the game and make your character much better and well equipped to handle this games harsh realities. There are cape's that act as armor and also have specific traits/bonuses. Plenty of weapons and throwables to mess around and kill things with. If you play on \"hardcore\" mode there is a mechanic called \"soul level\" that basically acts as a timer and goes down gradually.  If you don't keep moving and collecting more \"souls\" then you will eventually die if your \"soul level\" reaches zero. There is a \"ruin\" you can get that does away with your hunger for \"souls\" but it takes up alot of your \"ruin\" inventory space. \n\nThe difficulty would turn alot of people off but the dev is adding a \"normal\" mode that does away with the \"soul\" mechanic altogether which is the way I prefer to play the game. Normal mode will allow players to experience all the game has to offer while making the game much more forgiving. As of now the game is 50% off so if you're interested in the game at all go ahead and get it cuz at $2.50 it's worth the gamble and worth it to support an indie developer. If you enjoy action roguelikes I recommend this game and believe it will only keep getting better with every update.
