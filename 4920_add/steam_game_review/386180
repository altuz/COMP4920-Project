But the in-game way of gathering things is sooo slow. And yeah, I get it, they need money to actually continue to maintain and update the game. That's fair, that's what you expect in a free to play game with a cash market.\n\nThe problem is that the game just feels unbalanced. You can sit there for hours working on building your machine. You can fine-tune it, build it with multiple weapon-types to help cover weaknesses at a specific range, shifting your armored pieces around for maximum protection, and even try to make sure your center of gravity won't leave your rig doing awkward flips on tight turns.\n\nAnd then you'll get shot down by someone who just built a flatbed of the basic frame 20 feet long, line it with the cheapest gun, and basically just shut you down by force of 'the game is designed this way'. Basic frames can't be destroyed like armor, after all. Put your guns on it and bam, they're far harder to pick off by peppering armor. \nBut that's rare. Let's move on to the next game. A lot of people with neat designs, some just copies of one-another, and so on. You take your rig into the next game. And then you see it. Is that an unarmed enemy? No turrets, no melee weapon, just charging at you? Why that's an easy- What are those flying things?\nBefore you know it, you're shredded to pieces, shooting at someone who has to do nothing but drive around and avoid your shots while his drones rip you to pieces. In seconds, your guns are picked off, your wheels fly away, and you're shredded before you can even do meaningful damage.\n\nNext game, rigs packing nothing but double-cannons that can pick your rig in half in a salvo.\nNext game, invisible rig lined with bomb-tipped spears destroying you instantly. Well at least he can't do that one again. \nNext game, frame shenanigans. \n\nThe game just feels AWKWARD, and as though the effort you put in is wasted. And if you get unlucky and picked out of a round early on? Sucks for you! 10/several thousand experienced needed to level up. And if you leave early, you get nothing. Not like World of Tanks where you can basically start another game while your tank is 'left' in the battle to finish it, no. You have to sit there and watch your loss or victory the entire time or you get nothing. Satisfying gameplay, 10/10.\nSo you think 'I'll drop some money on this game, fuck it. I'll buy some parts.' Well you better do your damn research on good builds or your money is wasted. \n\nOh, right, and don't diversify. Just stack as much of one or maybe two weapon types on your rig and go for burst damage. Chunk someone and they probably won't be able to fire back to take advantage of any weakness in your weapon lineup.\n\nIt's a shame, too, because the game has potential and is overall pretty cool with mad max-style fighting, but when you actually start playing the pvp you go from 'cool post-apocalyptic cars/tanks' to 'just stacking whatever helps me kill as fast as possible to overcome the ridiculous grind'.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505898419, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505898419, "recommendationid": "35080344", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504107", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501256836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3659, "steamid": "76561198122095554", "num_games_owned": 66}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I spend 30\u20ac to support this game in hope that it will be something awesome. nvm take it back", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505509733, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505509756, "recommendationid": "34981334", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496574", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506729261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 154, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 950, "steamid": "76561198138148512", "num_games_owned": 58}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's like if Mad Max had a child with robocraft.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506176512, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506176512, "recommendationid": "35154840", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500070", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493479883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 620, "steamid": "76561198029151838", "num_games_owned": 242}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "At first it seemed fun game but after buying it and plaing it became boring for me.
