[/h1]\n\n[b] The Short Version[/b]\nThe game has a solid curnal but you will spend more time fighting the controle scheme than you will fighting the enemies.\n\n[b] The Long Version[/b]\nSo, I remember this game from back when it was on The Daily Click years ago. It frustraghted me soooo much. Because I could see there was a good game in here. But any enjoyment I might have had was totally hobbled by the terrible controls. Though the author seemes to have fixed the issue with moving up stairs and throwing away your weapon just to lock a door the game is still plaigued by design issues with it's control scheme.\n\nFor instance, in order to pick up a weapon or item for the first time, you first have to investigate it. Now, this is not a case of, you press the investigate button and then you can press the pick up button to pick it up. No, you press the investigate key a second time to pick it up for the first time. [b]But every time after that you have to press the dedicated pick up button to pick it up.[/b] The issue with this is, my muschle memory now assosiates the investigate command as a general interact command. So when I go to pick it up again, my instincts tell me to press the button I pressed the first time I picked it up. So when I hit that button and nothing happens it creates disonence. I have to stop and think, what is the button to pick things up again?! This leads to death. Having to fight the controls breaks your flow, breaks your imersion and the subsequint deaths really kills your enjoyment. I feel cheated.\n\nThe sence that the investigate key seems like it should be the general interaction key is increased with the fact that you use it to lift and lock the doors. By the time you get to the point where you have to start resetting the doors you can sometimes remmeber that the dedicated pick up key is used to pick things up. The door reset symbol pops up and you are enclined to use the pick-up command... but you have to use the investigate command instead.\n\n[b] The Weapons Break?![/b]\nOk, I haven't actually survived long enough to have a weapon break on me. Because the controles keep killing me. But come on man. I can't even have a weapon that lasts 10 bloody minutes?!\n\n[b] Recommendations [/b]\nI think that you should ether make the investigate button a general interact button, or just have it investigate and do nothing else. Because having the investigate button pick things up the first time is just confusing. These are not insurmountabel problems, but they are fundemental ones. I'm fearly confindent I'm not the only one who has these issues and I think you could garner a much wider audience if you made the controles more intuitive.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496582666, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496634804, "recommendationid": "32176308", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500178", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
