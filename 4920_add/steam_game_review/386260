It's got a very similar visual and aural aesthetic.  The gameplay is where things diverge.  I enjoyed Osmos, but found it to be a bit frustrating at times.  I've never (so far!) been frustrated with Microcosmum.  Anytime I fail a level, I feel like it's my fault instead of some game randomness I have no control over.\n\nThe biggest con with this game? So addictive! It's got that \"just one more level before bedtime\" feel. \n\nIf you enjoyed Osmos, you'll probably enjoy this game.  If you enjoy very simple, stripped down RTS games, like Mushroom Wars and its ilk, you'll also probably enjoy this game.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504742656, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504742656, "recommendationid": "34785363", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502617", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504653952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1892, "steamid": "76561197993617334", "num_games_owned": 168}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I want more, would buy again.

Too drunk to say if it's your own cells or an enemy ? No problem the little guy will absorb the antibodies and become a fat ass with an ehnanced resistance and a faster spawn rate.\n\nIt's cheap and  it often gets huge (like my dick) discount, so you can afford it even when you have paid the child support to the ogress. \n\nIt might not satisfy your libido unless you are one hell of a degenerate, but it's always better than  crying yourself out at night after a frenetic fapping session and it's definitively better than having a horde of females tracking you down for unwanted pregnancy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505069505, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505080888, "recommendationid": "34868799", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497666", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 139, "total_reviews": 216, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 77}}
