If the game was a lot cheaper, I would actually recommend it, since there is a good game buried somewhere deep beneath dozens of optimization issues and bugs. I'm willing to look past many issues for any game that lets you take the helm of your own ship, be it starship or sailship, and sail to the open seas.\nBasically this game is like poor man's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. Except you can get Black Flag cheaper. Wait for a decent sale at least, before buying.

The game hasn't crashed on me once yet but I've only played it for 6 hours so far.  There are a few bugs however.  Some of the characters were all grey (relaunching the game took care of that).  One of the foes fell in the water and just stayed there swimming instead of getting out and coming after me.  The foe was also invisible unless I was in the water right next to him.  I'll probably try to finish this game but it seems more like work than enjoyment at this point.  The controls are not very intuative.  Feels like they came up with their own recipe for controls without researching the controls of similar games.  The result is a disaster.  I feel like I need 20 fingers to do anything on my controller.  Might be easier to play the old Twister game of physical skill by Milton Bradley.  Honestly, I'd rather play the Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End video game than Curse of Raven's Cry.  I should just unistall it but I paid for it and I am unable to get a refund since I have played more than 2 hours already.
