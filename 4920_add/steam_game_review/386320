But I'm scraping from the bottom of the barrel here.\n\nAs far as cons go I'll just say: \n\n- Unoriginal\n- No settings option, so I couldn't change the resolution or anything (Unless somehow I missed it!)\n- Not scary at all\n- Some of the gameplay mechanics don't really make sense.\n- Not entertaining\n- Either the time goes too slow, or the power drains too quickly\n\nI did a short let's play video of it if you fancy seeing a bit of gameplay.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=487896314\n\nYeah, I suck at reviews, but I think what I'm trying to say is: Just play FNAF and don't waste your time and money on this, unless you wanna laugh at it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437832336, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438372731, "recommendationid": "17220783", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554129", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1437949451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561198078582252", "num_games_owned": 852}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 38, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'll start by saying its no sin for taking a leaf out of the popular FNAF series. A simple game built around, simple functions required to keep the numerous animatronics at bay. Of course the back story, and the ingame methods used can be anything but simple in the juggle to stay alive. Love them or hate them the FNAF series are the pinnacle in their genre.\n\nSo where does Naninights fit in? Well the entry is \u00a31.99. It covers the very basics of a point and click horror game. There is a threat, cameras and at least 3 ways to stop that threat. You would think that its all that is required to give Scott nightmares? Well no.. you see where Scott has mastered and understood what makes FNAF what it is. Maxim Moore clearly doesn't understand whats required or hasn't the ablitiy to put it in place. \n\nFor a start off, the game launches only in windowed mode. The night lasts forever more or less. Only one threat, which I'll add doesn't add any horror to the title. The bare min of rooms and cameras added, unclear instructions, poor translations (or getting Mary's sex wrong), Testube Mary disappears somewhere while still viewing the camera and just overall a game that feels dull and put together with little thought.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437867051, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437867148, "recommendationid": "17228325", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524406", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438138523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 29, "steamid": "76561197970507247", "num_games_owned": 196}, "votes_funny": 9, "votes_up": 34, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1]AN ABOMINATION - DO NOT BUY[/h1]\n\nA Five Nights at Freddy's clone, assuming the use of the word [i]clone[/i] could be extended to describe a tapeworm's relation to a human: As in yes, they are technically both alive, are both from the animal kingdom, and share some basic DNA between them, but ultimately one is simply a parasite that tries to feed off the other.\n\nSo it is with this game.
