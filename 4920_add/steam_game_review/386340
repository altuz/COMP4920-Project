This makes it a game that would be ideal for some sort of shield, evade, or deflect mechanic, yet none exists. You can't even hide behind cover, since the terrain is incredibly destructible by most enemies.\n\nWhile just about everything about the game is beautiful, it suffers from the identity crisis issue of not throwing itself entirely into one genre or the other. In one sense it has some Dark Soulsian difficulty, a 'bonfire' mechanic (manually activated in-world checkpoints,) and a world that only vaguely tells you sometimes where you should be going. That clashes with the seeming randomization of the game, where enemy placement is mixed up and unpredictable, meaning that the aforementioned problem of not being able to effectively deal with enemies is absurd. At least in Dark Souls you could roll away. The dash in this game is virtually worthless, (it amounts to the body length of ATAI, the main character,) since it covers almost no distance.\n\nIf you shoot at something long enough, it does eventually die, but there are so many random enemies everywhere that I have no idea what most of them do until I've either died or lost 90% of my health. It bears repeating, since it is obvious the devs are taking concepts from it, that Dark Souls used pacing very efficiently in the enemy types one faced at various stages of the game. This game doesn't. \n\nI've seen laser cannons, missile launchers, incendiary automatic weapons, and basically everything else on the enemies and I barely played an hour and a half. In most games of this genre, you see smaller, weaker enemies with less dangerous weapons to star. Sure, I'm fine with them doing a bar of health, but when I'm fighting something that can chase me into a corner with all the health in the world, fire almost continuously, and chunk my health with bullets that never end, that's a problem. That's a mid-late game situation in most games of this genre. They do that right. This game... you have every enemy and weapon combination attacking you from the start, but you have access to a peashooter with a couple superficial (read: worthless) upgrades like bounce, penetration, and multiply. Those don't help me kill anything faster, they just let me cheese certain enemies by abusing line of sight and aggro.

As its still in Early Access i know and hope things will change with the game and i will keep that is mind as this review goes.First and foremost my overall thoughts on MegaSphere can be summed up in a few short statements: Wow this looks and sounds greats! What am i doing? Whats going on? What does this do? Man this feels bad, however i want people to play this game.\n\nTLDR: Fun game and great looking, however due to the unclear nature of how certain macanics work and a few, but very impoartant, game feel issuses cant recommend. I have hope tho.\n\nA lot of this review will center around two major issues i have with the game. The fact that not a lot is explaination or information is given to the player on what anything does and how this work. and two Game feel. The first is big part of my im having trouble both moving forwrd in the game and want to recommend the game to others. I dont know whats anything does. Upgrades dont tell you anything but a very vauge idea of what it does beyond the name of said up and info hidden behind ingame missing files, which the game doesn't tell you how to unlock those extra bits. it also doesnt tell up once a upgrade is put in it locks it in unless you use a upgrade token to free up the slot. this wouldnt be bad but drop rate in the grade are laughable at best netting you mostly health bits that disappear all to fast. More on that later. I understand though if this was intentional as it fits the theme and ideas of exploring a dirlict space ship filled with aceint tech. It works to have bits and pieces of information on background stuff, ie how something works but gameplay impact should be clear. other then the name and visaul effects not much info is given on what upgrades do and how they work or how the upgrade system works at all. Other things include the map and how no infor is given on it other then through exprieance you dont know what the icons stand for and therefore have to go off memory. this would be easily fixed with either a legend or telling the player what it is if hovering over it if you have discovered it this would help with exploration and all around feel which i will go into later. Lastly in information or lack there of is some red screen comes up when the player dies in game and you have the opption to select hexs filled with seemingly, to me at lest, random letter, numbers, and sybloms. What is this? at no point is this explained so im reduced to mashing tiles till either \"Injection Successful\" or \"Injection Failure\". What? What injection? What just happened? this big first chunk all boils down to not given the player information either by intention, and i hope not, or over sight. Either way i feel it needs to be adressed. \n\nOn to Game Feel and before everything thins is more minor-ish stuff but still very important, because good game feel means a fun game. First off the game is about exploration but they take away the Map right away, which is fine really, it shows the importance of it when you get it back, however its one of the last things you get back after haveing to go through two areas to get it. So upuntill you get it back the game is just follow the arrow to the next objective point. You can exlpore all you want, and i did and i got lost. thought game looks amazing its very hard to tell one ares from another and on a new life things change even more. it got to the point where i just wanted to move on and stop looking for new things. this could be fixed very easily by swithing th order at which you get your HUD back. The second part of bad game feel involving the map is no mini map. having to stop moving to open a map and still be at risk just feels bad. It happen to often where im looking at map trying to figure out where to go and i get attacked in a place i thought i cleared out. On that note the HUD itself, doesnt pause the game when looking at it this may be a personal thing but in this kind of game that just shouldnt happen. This isnt dark souls so its shouldnt matter if you \"pause\" it just because you want to see upgrades, the map, or new unlocked information(when you get it at lest). this just had me straight up ignoring new finds till i got to the next area and then just forgetting about new drops ive collected. Quick note on drops. they dont happen enough. Moving on but still keeping in line with drops is health drops. all to often when i go to collect them they sling shot past me then disappear like a child's wish. either just make them bee line to the player or if they fly by ina a certain range you get it. the baddies do so much damage that i need all the health i can get since there is no healing macanic in the game which makes gang up and bully baddies all the more frustrating ie 6 spawns of the purple of pinks firing floating or the spining blade balls that just push you into a wall and you have no real way to evade. which gets into the next topic of the Dash. it feels bad and i never use it. ever. only to get to a platform and thats it. it doesnt work as a avoid damage macanic or a mobility macanic. it needs a lot of love. certain weapons feels  not good to use on cerain baddies, not sure if these are bugs or by design but some time shots go through floating baddies. if by design, where is this explained? easy fix if by design could be in weapon description, short and sweet ie RPG old blah blah blah high damage weak at hitting flying baddies. The Guns themselfs have a bad feel to them. not if firing or aim just knowing when the ammo is about to run out. i understand that the light of gun dims when close to empty but im not looking at that when i have to avoid on coming fire make the light a scale the drains or add a HUD display below the health bar. keep the light on the gun no matter what that's good polish. Next are the check points. i get these are a big part of the game's design but it has bad feel when you die and you are throw back the the previous area. this issue, and i do believe this is an issue, can be address in a few way that dont hinder the over all feel of a harder and challenging game. either add more cheak point throughout the zone, depending on size, but make comepoing to the new zone a checkpoint or atlest put one very very close the the door. also make check points save what you have on you if they dont already(never got to one with anything but the default gun). i had to force my self to keep going after the first time and evertime after just a huge sigh and an eye roll. feels bad and doesnt make me want to keep playing. if its my fault for activating a checkpoint with nothing but the default thats fine, im dumb, but if it just gives you the default gun no matter what thats not really fun its bad game feel.keep only one extra life per area though that fine that works, it rewards exploration. Lastly is progression, now this is both game feel and information based but all in all cant have one with out the other i believe. i never once beyond getting the HUD \"words\" back did i feel any progression, other then going to a new area of course. I feel like adressing the informations side will help greatly with progression or atlest the feel of progression. i dont really have any solid ideas on this area. i wish i did.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis is a fun game that is very very very close to being where it needs to be. All these issuse that i have are little by themselfs but pile up. i understand that its \"not done\" yet but if all it gets is praise then its not gonna get the attention it deserves and I DO think this game derserves a LOT of attention its great! the music and sound is on point, the lighting is like a new stantard for 2d Pixel games! However i cant over look these issues. untill these are addressed i cant recommend. these are my favortie types of games so im very critical on them. I will be making a review open full release as i still even now have high hopes for the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502588329, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502588329, "recommendationid": "34203864", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492615", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485301382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1108, "steamid": "76561198050273388", "num_games_owned": 34}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "repetative and shitty", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503413855, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503413855, "recommendationid": "34417494", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488354", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "total_reviews": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 12}}
