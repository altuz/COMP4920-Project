Next to no content with inane solo experience and dead multi\n\nHOMM style turn based strategy with a gimped hero and no unit production ends up more like a simplified version of chess than a computer strategy game. The meat of the concept is supposed to revolve around multiplayer but the matchmaking will never work as no one is seeking a game of this. You could challenge friends but why bore people you care about. The game unfolds mostly as a slow trek forward clumsily positioning your units and trying to use a basic rock paper scissor mentality having your cavalry outflank, your shield guys take the arrows and the axemen doing much of the finishing off of foes but in practice you will just turtle all your troops forward and let them mash each other with little to no strategy out of frustration and boredom. The art style was rather nice in a cartoony kind of way and the audio was muted and not taking too much space but was appropriate and not too bad at all. I am removing this for library declutter, there are much superior solo and multiplayer experiences to be had centered around turn based medieval combat. The single player content here is a glorified puzzle game/tutorial as there are no story or reason to care about any of it just three difficulty generals who place the same units you do and battle it out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496965132, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496965293, "recommendationid": "32278911", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503641", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "total_reviews": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
