Being one of the 5 people who own this game is pretty rewarding as you are the only one with these cards and badges and what not. Its sort of fun, I mean, I played a bit of it then idled the rest. I play this when I am bored and literally have nothing else to play. I think it is worth the $5 and I am sure its decently fun if you get ohter friends to play with you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456438107, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456438107, "recommendationid": "21452803", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467200428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 604, "steamid": "76561198027938810", "num_games_owned": 904}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's ok only with heavy discounts and only for four-player shared screen party.
