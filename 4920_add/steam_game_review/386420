It's difficult to jump and grab a ladder without being right under it. You will often slide off and fall if you try to run and jump to it. Moving platforms are easy to miss and fall to your death, even though it looks like you should have made it. Overall, the controls are tolerable, but could be better.\n\nThe biggest problem for me is that you have 3 continues (of 3 lives each) and then you have to start over. This means if you finish 25 levels then run out of continues, you get to do those 25 levels again. Both times I played it, I lost most of my lives on the same level (the fireball throwing birds...I keep running out of time.). I am currently not motivated to try again, but probably will at some point.\n\nThe levels are even labeled 1-1 through 1-x, 2-1 through 2-x, etc. I don't know why you can't continue from 2-1 if you get that far. This is pretty standard in these types of games.\n\nIt is fun for an hour or two, and pretty cheap, so give it a go if you don't mind starting over.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444674510, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444674510, "recommendationid": "18445434", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501424", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492359438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 34, "steamid": "76561198271894421", "num_games_owned": 20}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "2", "review": "very good game. kept me entertained for years", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459016602, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1459016602, "recommendationid": "22068921", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496768", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486727265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 453, "steamid": "76561198000544100", "num_games_owned": 342}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm sure it's a great indie game for low budget makers looking for recognition, but I'm also pretty sure 95% of the people that play this game will just do it for the easy achievements and full completion, at least that's what I did.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460347043, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460347043, "recommendationid": "22351668", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501294", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1480905014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 29, "steamid": "76561198147874247", "num_games_owned": 152}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I could see jacksepticeye playing this. :3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438436301, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438436301, "recommendationid": "17333344", "language": "english", "votes_down": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456788", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458717581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 34, "steamid": "76561198040466770", "num_games_owned": 824}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Those damn ladders.
