There isn't a whole lot of gameplay in this game. It's not a Metal Gear situation, either, where about 50% of the game is awesome cutscene and the other 50% is awesome gameplay. This game could probably last about 2.5 hours on a normal playthrough, and about 80% of that was cutscene.\n\nSo, let's get down to gameplay and story. First off, this was made in RPG Maker. It's not some amazing thing, but it's not bad, either. You can't move diagonally, or anything fancy. The controls are very simple, and you never have more than four buttons besides the arrow keys (A, S, Z, X) that do anything. So, what's the story? Again, pretty simple: Blue Bot wakes up in a pod. He's drowsy, fading in and out of consciousness, but eventually he breaks the glass pane of his pod and crawls out. And thus, the adventure begins. As Blue Bot, you'll wander the world for a while on your own, then you'll suddenly hear the only other voice in this world. The first puzzle begins: Dig up crystals that will power the teleporter that will hopefully lead you to the source of this new voice. And once there, you meet Blue's companion: Red Bot.\n\nSo, at this point, I should digress to mention why my play time is lower than the play time I suggested to be an average. It's because the puzzles are optional. Yes, you read that right. 50% of the gameplay (10% of the whole game) is optional. Why? Because this game is supposed to be simple.\n\nIf the puzzles are too complex for you, like a few of them were for me, or you don't want to spend your time on them, that's alright, you can skip them after a few failed tries, because Wanda isn't intended to be complex. The game's two stories (one told through the cutscenes, and another told through the collectible photgraphs) are very simple as well, using imagery clearly to indicate what's going on in each scene, so you can relate that easily to other scenes.\n\nY'know what, whatever. I'm done trying to be accurate, or sound fancy. I'm recommending this game because it's the most heartwarming experience I've had in the last week or so. I'm a sucker for simplistic storytelling, and as far as that goes, Wanda takes the cake. Wanda isn't even a simple game, really: It's a simple story, told in a relatively simple way. And if you don't love that, that's alright. I did, though, and if you think you would too, this game deserves your money.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504205781, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504205781, "recommendationid": "34641224", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500140", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
