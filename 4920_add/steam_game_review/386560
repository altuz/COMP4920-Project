I buy a lot of cheapish games on steam and rarely sink more than an hour into any of them... I played this one through to completion (only took me 5 hours, but they were a very fun 5 hours).  I haven't tried survival mode yet but if that's done right I'll definitely sink more into that.\n\nFrom reading the negative review (someone thinking it's too hard/unfair) it seems that it could take some significantly more than 5 hours to play, but to call any of it unfair is nonsense.  I had a few points where I struggled to beat areas but that's because I'd try to tackle the hardest available levels (relative to your current power) most of the time.  And after all of that later in the game I figured out a significantly better way to change up my ship that made me much more powerful.  Half the game is how you outfit your ship and that part is done well.  The menu for it is a little clunky/a bit of a learning curve to navigate through it fluidly but after the slight learning curve it works great.\n\nIt's well worth the price.  This is only the second game I've bothered to review on steam.\n\nOh.. and the negative review about controls not being customizable is bull.  The customization is simply done part by part in the ship editor (and not some sort of global menu).

If you die, that's it - game over, start from scratch. I've died from some really, really stupid circumstances and buggy physics, too.\nSo what's the point in such a complex customization if you lose your design every time you die? I could see having to save the scrap to remake at least the physical structure in a future run, but anything less I would have assumed would be unthinkable.\nIf this absolutely can't be implemented for whatever strange reason, then there should at LEAST be presets or something equivalent.\n\nI've played Gradius, R-Type, Ikaruga, RayForce, Touhou and on and on since I was a child. I'm not new to the genre. At all.\nI'm using a controller, and PSR STILL feels like you're an ice cube sliding across a floor also covered in ice, shooting at snowflakes. Difficulty spikes and dips violently - it's either a little too easy or murderously hard (and I've tried several different routes with different difficulties). Blueprints are too random, so you're either OP early on or totally underpowered for the majority of a run.\nThere's a way to die without a run immediately ending, and revert to the previous system you were in to choose a different route, but I have no idea how this is triggered and there's no indication of how to earn 'lives' nor is there a counter of any kind. It happened to me once, and I was totally lost as to how it happened.\n\nSome blueprints are way, way, way too expensive (I've never even seen what the black hole generator looks like, despite being frugal on scrap expenditure) and once you clear the campaign, your save just loads back to the mission before the end - so that masterpiece you've spent all that time building up and tinkering with basically gets shelved.\nThat's no fun at all.\n\nIt's an awesome concept. I feel like there was a lot left to experience, but the reward is not commensurate with the investment.\nThe campaign ending is brief but has a shocking and dark twist, hinting at a much deeper universe than we're shown...but there are no achievements or unlocks or anything for clearing it. At all. You would think there would be a NG+ system or something, or maybe a sandbox where you could test wacky builds, but no.\n\nI can only hope some of this stuff comes as DLC.

I'll go to the good things first.\n\nThe ship customization is ingenious! It gives you all the freedom to create a ship that suits exactly your taste. This includes the shape, weapons, weapon directions, energytanks and so on. You can even assign different keybinds to different parts of the ship. It is easily the best part of the game.\n\nAlso destroying enemies feels great and satisfying. The music fits in the game quite well, though I only liked maybe one song. The songs resemble those annoying chiptune songs too much, but that's just my opinion, I don't count it as a flaw in the game. Graphics are also nice and flashy, kind of what you would expect from a space shooter.\n\nWhile the ship customization is fantastic, along with some smaller things, the rest of the game isn't that tempting.\n\nStarting with permadeath. Yeah you read it right, this game has permadeath, which affects many other things that ultimately lead to an unsatisfying gaming experience. Permadeath happens if the enemy wave reaches your position on the world (star) map. This means that you have about 6 lives, as every time you die, the wave moves closer to your position. This means no free exploring and collecting various items on the map, that you would maybe want.\n\nYou have to keep moving forward towards your goal. But you cannot move towards it too fast, since the levels are too hard compared to your level, so you always have to take the \"easy\", \"medium\" or at maximum the \"hard\" route. This means that you have to zigzag your way through the map. This then leads to a situation where you are only a couple of steps ahead of the permadeath wave at all times (so maybe 2 lives).\n\nThis then affects to your decisions regarding what weapons you'd like to equip. When you've found something that works, you cannot really differ from it, since if you try out a new setup and it doesn't work, you're back to your previous setup with maybe one life remaining. So there goes all the fun of trying out new things. Also you don't get to keep the items and scrap you collected before you died, which means no extra boost after death.\n\nThe enemies and levels are all the same, with the exception of enemy movement and bullet patterns. Every enemy and boss is the exact same red wireframe thing. Bosses have some kind of pattern, but mostly they just shoot masses of bullets everywhere. And yeah, don't expect any difference in the last level or boss either. Playing the levels just get boring halfway into the game. And the ship's acceleration and deceleration are more annoying than good game desing, though it does help with small movements, but I'd rather have none or very tiny values on those.\n\nIt's a damn shame, because the ship customization is so well done here, but the negative things really outweigh the positive. It's just annoying and frustrating most of the time to play this game. There is really nothing memorable outside the ship customization system. But this gives potential for future releases, I have to give it that.
