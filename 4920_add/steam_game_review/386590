It is very reminiscent of games such as Life is Feudal, but especially Wurm.  The major difference here is that there is no terraforming and I do not beleive it is planned, which is too bad becuase that certainly adds a level of customization to the world.\n\nWhile the game is currently only single-player, a full multi-player world is planned.  You can however currently join others in a chat while you play single-player, I assume this is done just to begin the infrastructure of the multi-player elements.\n\nThe thing I love most about this game is the leveling system.  Everything you do adds to your skills.  Repair an item, Repair skill goes up.  Make some twine, ropemaking goes up.  Chop a tree down, forestry goes up. ETC ETC.  This is how survival game leveling should be, it makes it the most fun for me.\n\nI highly praise this game for its UI asthetics and controls.  The UI is simple but intuative and easy to understand.  The controls are pretty standard to other modern games.  You are given a WASD + Mouse Look for movement.  EF and mouse buttons and wheel for interaction.\n\nThe game is set in a sci-fi far in the future after all other civilizations have long been dead and forgotten in a somewhat \"fresh world\" sort of setting.  Despite the sci-fi setting you learn recipes from finding blueprints that allow you to create objects from every stage of development of the ancient forgotten civilizations.\n\nI will also reccomend this game just simply for the amazing devs.  They are quick to respond to almost every issue and have fixed bugs the very same day as receiving the bug report.\n\nI purchased 3 copies of this game, one for myself, one for my brother and one for a friend.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504718935, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504718935, "recommendationid": "34779784", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558069", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504583081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 701, "steamid": "76561197983952246", "num_games_owned": 47}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Only 11.7 hrs but there doesn't seem to be much of a game here and it was released as an EA title 2yrs ago. Not sure if I am missing something or if I am just more used to actual content in a game. I do realise that this is in ea and they are workig currently on the game but it is the core systems and core gameplay that does not seem fun even if they do fill the game up with things to do. the building system is very frustrating at times and it isn't just because of the bugs.\n\nJust fyi I by EA games sometimes just to support a project that seems interesting and did that here. I checked back in to see what progress they made 9/4/17 this is how I felt. I do understand EA projects are not final in anyway and the gameplay could change dramtically I just do not see this ever becoming fun.

It needs work most definitely, but the crafting is bar none the best I've seen since EverQuest 2, and no game to date has ever matched that level of possibilities and enjoyable workmanship.\nYou nailed the sh*t out of it. I could craft on your system for days and be content with life. VERY well done. Can't stress that enough. You really truly nailed the crafting. So good!!\n\nBut the rest of the game needs work. Build mode has some glitches (am sure you're aware), whereby the one you raycast (look at) isn't the one affected by an operation (craft/build, or delete). And in actual build mode, you can't perform removal operation - highly useful missing option. \n\nThe game is short once you reach \"that\" level, where you have everything you need. Need more anomoly types, and need \nmuch more in terms of end-game. I realize you probably invision PVP to cause \"replayability\", but some bosses for pve might be nice..  A dragon or something. The city anomaly is in desperate need of some zombies (foreals).\nFor after all, what is the point of base building, if there is nothing out there to attack you, and thus no reason to have a base or to defend it? Need some sort of attack to survive, and force us to rebuild and repair.\n\nNeed some balancing on hunger/thirst. I feel it's appropriately realistic in terms of time spent, but maybe make it slightly harder, so as to increase the value of cooking and managing your body state.\nWeather effects aren't harsh enough (in fact they do nothing?). I saw the tea recipe, so clearly you have intentions to upgrade this aspect. Good.\n\nFinally, the religious aspect (shrines, temples, ruins) needs more aspect to it. You could easily put a story into this, foundation is quite solid as is. But need like a flashback to a God type of cinema when you walk into it, something to give a man his purpose. \nAnd perhaps some magic of any sort... For instance. Where did the ruins come from? Who created the ruins? Why am I alone in this place with clones of myself? Why not jump off a cliff and repeat until no clones remain? If the shop exists, who exactly am I buying loot from?\nGive us some context. Not in game description, but IN the game. :)\n\nGood luck guys, this game could be fantastic, hope you can achieve that next level. gg\nThoroughly enjoyed playing it. And considering it's alpha/beta, it operates impressively well.\nKeep up the hard work, looking forward to checking in on this next year.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505966591, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505967204, "recommendationid": "35097013", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507848", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505177764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 675, "steamid": "76561198048878054", "num_games_owned": 243}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Has potential, but that's about all it has at the moment.\nDifficult to grasp what exactly the point is.
