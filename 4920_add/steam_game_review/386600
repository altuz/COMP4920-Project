There is so much more structure and refinement on display that it's like a total conversion and t didn't need that much work to be good. The developer has stuck with it and went above and beyond what I would have expected. Well done. \n\nI won't comment elaborately on the unnecessary aggression shown by the developer regarding my review. I know how hard it is to work hard and release something into the world only to get hit with a negative review. \n****************************\nOld review below\n\nWhy would I say 90% nice things about a game that I do NOT recommend? \n\nTLDR: This game could be a perfect replacement for Expendabros and I mean that in a complimentary manner. It has tons of characters to choose from, although I find the current differences to be less than thrilling, it's a lot for an early access game to have so many choices already. Same thing with the world choices. All of this sounds good still, so why not recommend it? \n\nIt's all content and they have yet to fix basic function. It's really frustrating, which isn't new to EA games, but it's frustrating for an entirely new reason. The menu functions are awful and you have to switch back and forth between keyboard, mouse and gamepad. The physics engine in the game needs a lot of tweaking making basic controls a little wonky. Again, these are things that EVERY developer fixes before exposing the game to the public. There are a few other basic issues like this that make me nervous. With so many of the budget priced developers abandoning their games right after cashing in with a launch I HAVE to tentatively say wait to buy. A competent developer will get this under control in a week or two at most. If I don't ammend this to a positive recommendation by Sept 15, I never will. To be fair to the Dev, I have set a Google calendar reminder to check in on the game and ammend my review.
