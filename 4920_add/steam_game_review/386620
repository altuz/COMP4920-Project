I have an 80 day normal save and a 15 day extreme mode save with 150% buzz.  Never finished the game as it got a bit repetitive for me but I still enjoyed it immensely and will be using it as a basis to review this game.\n\nThe positives the sequel brings are pretty evident;  The food looks unashamedly glorious as does most everything else, the UI looks clean and the animations are swell.  There's enough restaurants to fill a metropolis and a variety of dishes that would intimidate even an emperor.  However, I find that the game makes these advances by sacrificing the depth many of the foods in the previous game possessed.\n\nMany of the dishes in CSD1 felt totally unique.  The bananas foster required patience and timing, the stacked enchiladas frantic repetition, the soup and kebab mind-bending combinations of ingredients, all of this interlaced with the manual actions of knife-chops, drink pours and dish scrubs.  A few were copy pastes of each other, but the most complex ones stood out to me and tended to be the most rewarding to make.  So much of this flair is absent from this game:  Pick an ingredient and it's on your food, that's it.  Just slap on ingredients, cook a little and add more later, serve now or serve later.  Foods take all ingredients and either one or two motions or all motions to make, severely neglecting the complicated processed of chopping, mixing, pouring and heating that come with them.  There are a few exceptions, but many of these are the same dishes from the last game, and these are few and far between in the vast sea of otherwise similar foods compared to the rather diverse preparation CSD1 had.\n\nI don't mean to undermine CSD2's new mechanics:  The introduction of holding stations is brilliant and adds unprecedented depth to your gameplay.  CSD1 focused on simply maximizing buzz and getting perfect orders, but trying to serve side dishes and drinks with every meal, being able to prep dishes ahead of time and needing to deal with dishes getting stale is a HUGE advancement in terms of depth.  However, as much as the game has advanced in these regards, it has regressed in the cooking of food, which I'd argue should be the focus.  Every dish has a delicious exterior (and a hilarious description to boot) but making them can often feel monotonous and samey, no matter how exotic the origin.\n\nThe game is also missing much of the miscellaneous gameplay and alternative modes from the previous.  There aren't concrete objectives available to upgrade your restaurant, there's no cooking challenges available, the health inspector is nowhere to be seen nor are the weather mechanics (if they're still in, that's a fault on both the tutorials, the e-mail system and the boosters/detractors not being fully complete), and robberies actually just feel like another chore now.  I will concede the robberies are a trade-off of variety for balance;  In the previous game, having to deal with one usually meant you lost a perfect day, here it's just another chore.  Ironically, having to deal with your robber directly is less threatening than losing customers to him was in the previous.\n\n[strike]The UI in its current state leaves much to be desired, ...[/strike] A recent patch has added a notice to distinguish chef-for-hire from your own custom restaurant before you start, and suggests you check out the tutorial.  This alleviates most of my initial concerns, with the rest of the UI bugs fixed and remaining features added in (e-mails in particular) it should prove pretty servicable.\n\nI'm unable to rate the balance of food bosters/detractors yet as that feature is currently hidden, but I guarantee you making them visible won't make the catalog much easier to approach without a better way to sift through it.  You absolutely need more ways to filter the foods, whether through individual boosters/detractors (simplying sorting by those would be another headache in itself), origin/culture (which doesn't make any sense gameplay-wise), or otherwise.\n\nIn it's current state, I'm afraid I have to give this a thumbs down.  A \"mixed\" rating would be more appropriate but steam reviews don't allow for that sort of nuance.\nI know I went on a lot about the reduced complexity of creating individual dishes, but the additional mechanics of sides and holding stations bring a huge amount more to the table.  The tipping point for me between a positive and a negative is the intuitive design the game currently lacks;  Fix those bugs, make it more user friendly and you've got a thumbs up.\n\nBest of luck with the continued development!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505367006, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505982517, "recommendationid": "34942799", "language": "english", "votes_down": 58, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723272", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505671388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 234, "steamid": "76561198041620963", "num_games_owned": 290}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 112, "comment_count": "8", "review": "This game is good, and it almost feels wrong to not recommend it, but a lot of what made the first Cook, Serve, Delicious! feel so right and so good is currently gone. Some of it has yet to be added, for sure, but some of it seems to just plain be missing. I will avoid talking too much about what's currently missing, as I trust the developer for sticking to his promise of adding these features soon.\n\nThe first and probably biggest problem I personally have with this game is that there's no real progression. You are introduced to new foods at a rapid pace, and barely get any time to get used to them before already being shoved onto the next set of foods. Rather than having a small set of foods that you upgrade to slowly introduce more elements to them like in the first one, you get to buy a massive amount of foods for your own restaurant that have all of the options unlocked from the begin. This doesn't really make me want to use the foods, it feels like after seeing every recipe card once you've already seen all there is to see of this food (which is both the case and not encouraging to use said food more). The new Chef-For-Hire mode has a similar problem, but at least it makes more sense here. Where's the upgrades, both for food and the restaurant?\n\nThe second problem is related to the first problem I talked about, and the Chef For Hire mode. Now, I have nothing against this mode existing, in fact, I think this mode is a really good idea and I'm glad something like this is in the game. The problem for me is that it feels like the mode is what the game is focused on. Instead of working on your own restaurant, gradually unlocking upgrades as you go (which was really the thing that made the first game so good in my opinion), you just go from one place to another, making foods you likely haven't even been introduced to or have had practice for, only to get some money and a gold medal for that specific level.\nI feel like this mode needs to be secondary. Working on and upgrading your own restaurant is what the game should, at its core, really be about. It isn't, though. The game is at its core just making foods in other restaurants that you don't actually work on improving. Your own restaurant is as a result not really even upgrade-able. It feels like a side mode where you just practice on foods you unlocked instead of being an actually important thing in the game.\n\nThere's other problems I had with the game, for sure, but those were more minor than these two, and other negative reviews have summed these up better than I probably would.\n\nRest assured, this game isn't without positives. There's a lot of smaller improvements, and a couple pretty big ones. Biggest probably being the holding stations, but I don't really have anything to add onto this as everyone has already explained how much more depth these bring the gameplay.\n\nIf this game was its own thing instead of being the sequel to Cook, Serve, Delicious!, I probably would've recommended it, but as a sequel, this fails and it ignores most of what made the original so good for me. If you ask me, just buy the original instead.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505493407, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505493719, "recommendationid": "34976193", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635785", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505905761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 115, "steamid": "76561197999686949", "num_games_owned": 331}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 110, "comment_count": "3", "review": "I was a huge fan of the original CSD game and I'm disappointed to say the second one just doesn't live up to the first despite some good new features.\n\n[h1]The Good:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The game still fundamentally plays to the system of \"everything's chaotically messy and you're trying to solve orders as fast as you can\", which is a fun game mechanic even if it can be stressful. Unfortunately a bit part of the \"run your own restaurant simulator\" is the progression, which isn't great and I'll be coming to later.\n\n[*]The addition of the holding station system means you can prep main meals in advance so you only have to do the post cooking prep when customers ask for it. You can also do small meals as a big batch so you can \"fire & forget\" when they're ordered to quickly clear those orders. Adding sides to increase customer wait time was a good idea but it feels like they were added to pad the number of menu options. Overall the system is a nice twist on the ticket system.\n\n[*]The addition of the restaurant designer lets you build your own restaurant background to look at while serving. It's a nice inclusion even though I'm not personally interested in the feature, I know there're people that will like it.\n\n[*]The music's still good, but I kinda prefer the music from CSD 1.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Bad:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The whole food preparation element of the game has gained tonnes of new food things to learn and add to your menu, at the cost of everything feeling kinda the same. In the original CSD each food felt like it's own beast, you had to learn a unique set of rules for everything, some of which were as simple as just remembering the \"cut fish\" buttons and others as fiddly as executing the exact order of a highly complex arrangement of sushi or waiting for a specific moment in the cooking process to add something else. Those things are still present in CSD 2 for a few of the menu options but because there are SO MANY ITEMS that all behave with the same mechanics (just add toppings to something) you don't really feel like each food has its own soul, instead it's sharing it with half the other menu options. The menu you constructed on a day-to-day basis in CSD 1 was a challenge of balancing complex to make foods and simple things that still felt interesting to prep, but the foods prep all feels kinda bland across so many of the menu options in CSD 2. Overall, less food options that were more interesting individually would definitely have been more.\n\n[*]Because a lot of the food options feel the same, and there are so many, most of the times I try to do a day of serving then I never really feel like I'm learning anything because I've got another 2 new things on the menu and they have another 10 buttons I'm meant to know just to cover the toppings that they have but don't share with other foods. I'm grappling to actually remember any of the food preps and that memory aspect is what makes you feel like you're getting a handle on the chaos. When rush hour starts I'm just desperately scrabbling through the three pages of toppings and I'm maxed out on orders so panicking about it all. I've definitely been that busy in CSD 1 but the fewer items meant you got a grip on them more and knew which items you could fulfil in a flash and get them off the queue to give you time to do more complex things. In CSD 2 there are some items that look very similar and while you don't have to include them on your menu together, they do mean you're basically learning each one again because they have enough variation between them to be the same to make mechanically (and thus a bit boring) but a pain to remember when you're doing different ones each day. If more foods felt more unique then you'd remember them better rather than just desperately scrabbling for a food that feels completely new every time.\n\n[*]The taking out of specific food upgrades combined with the huge menu really gimped the feeling of progression. The nice thing about CSD 1 was that you could buy a new menu item for your menu and give it a few run throughs when it only has a few toppings or processes to make. Then, when you get good at it, you upgrade it for more money per order but a higher complexity. That upgrade system let you gate the difficulty of foods while still making it meaningful to want to get up to the next level of difficulty when you felt competent enough. I get that the progression in this is meant to be about unlocking some of the other food type options but there are already an insane number of those as it is so it doesn't feel like a reward to get something I already have way too much to remember of. The other progression (unlocking new items to decorate your restaurant) is fair enough but doesn't feel like a reward/progression of your skills. \n\n[*]The change from the TV chef programs and challenge parties you had to do in CSD 1 to the \"Chef for Hire\" system was an attempt that had merit but overall I just prefer the original. The original system gave your chef a sense of prestige and progress as you attended increasingly more dramatic/important side games. Comparatively, the Chef for Hire system just feels like a huge slog of endlessly preparing the same things for different restaurants to unlock some menu things and decorative items for your restaurant. I like the idea but the execution fell flat for me.\n\n[*]Small point but while the font rendering was patched recently, it still looks kinda horrid to me. Furthermore, I actually preferred CSD 1's art style and dislike this one's a lot more but that's both a comparison and subjective.\n[/list]\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nNormally I hate fanboys of an original game that bash the sequel just because it wasn't more of the same. Sequels have to try something new in order to distinguish themselves from the original and trying something new is often alienating for the previous fan base (people hate change). So normally I like to appreciate a sequel on its own merits and there are definitely some nice new ideas in this game, but I feel that the problem with this game is that it traded its fundamental game mechanics and gameplay proposition (pretty much its soul) for the sake of having a sequel at all. Some of the new ideas worked, some didn't, but the real meat of the game (the food prep) has just gotten way too lifeless compared to the original. Props all the same to the developer for being a one man band but I don't hold out much hope of this game improving without a fundamental overhaul of the entire food preparation elements from the ground up. There's too much on the menu that's too much the same and the lack of the way preparation progression worked like in the original really holds back the feeling of getting better in amongst the manic food serving.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505660665, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505676775, "recommendationid": "35025596", "language": "english", "votes_down": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644963", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505363278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 286, "steamid": "76561198077966374", "num_games_owned": 107}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 134, "comment_count": "18", "review": "So I guess let me begin by saying that I love the creator, I love the first game, and I did have high expectations for this sequel; unfortunately, the game has not delivered yet. Many people are parroting the fact that the creator has mentioned on his Twitter and within the game that there is still work to be done, but hear me out.\n\nInitially this game was set to be released late in 2016. After an announced delay of significant time, it was slated to be released three weeks ago. It was again delayed. If the game was delayed multiple times then the least we should expect is a finished core game. This game is NOT FINISHED. I repeat, the game is UNFINISHED.\n\nFirst, you have to purchase the actual game to see a note from the creator stating that over the next week he hopes to add more things, like the ability to USE THE MOUSE in the main menu. The game is beautiful and sure, there's great music, but I don't believe those were two things that were paramount to the Cook, Serve, Delicious franchise to begin with. The game was always cute and punchy, it's not exactly demanding high graphics.\n\nSecond, there is NO progression. No campaign seems to exist currently (besides being able to decorate and sort of customise a restaurant), there is none of the cool challenge modes people came to know and love in the original game, and you don't unlock parts of a food as you progress. In this game, you simply unlock one of a ton of foods as you play through some random restaurant options that you're given and you are immediately given dozens of options per piece of food. You don't unlock each option as you progress, slowly adding different things to your growing menu (i.e. the ability to add a new ingredient to a menu item or an upgraded ingredient) now you just get bombarded with options, none of which are truly simple to start with.\n\nThird, there is in total only a couple of minutes of tutorial footage, none of which explain the point of the game or what you're supposed to REALLY do next. This game was announced with a cute little storyline and you see none of it within the game itself. You're introducted to the new way to make food (similar concept, obviously) and the great new ideas of a holding station and sides. These new concepts are awesome and, if they were being added to a finished game, would be a really great feature. Unfortunately, they aren't, they kind of just stand alone in a random game with no direction.\n\nFourth, and this is a small issue, the menus aren't really very polished and they are, at times, hard to navigate, especially when decorating your new restaurant. Information isn't always where you would expect to be and sometimes it's hidden from sight, which just makes the game a little more cluttered.\n\nFifth, you're never given directions on how to RUN your new restaurant. Seriously. You can decorate it and buy TONS of foods but apparently you run off of pre-designed menus at the end of it all. \n\nOverall, this game is lacking most of what made the first one so incredibly addicting and replayable. No catering events, no cooking competitions, no campaign, no cute e-mails (though those are guaranteed to be added within the next few days), and overall a lot of things that should have been a given in a game that's been delayed twice over several months.\n\nTL;DR: I have faith in the creator to eventually deliver a complete game, but it certainly hasn't been delivered as of release. The game is still almost a bare framework of what it will eventually (hopefully) be.

You have a sushi restaurant, ice cream and desserts, pizza, breakfast, and more. The skills and progression is tied to you as the chef, and is more reliant on your skill and experience gained than seemingly-arbitrary requirements to play x number of days to progress. Experience can be gained from both your own restaurant, and the chef for hire options.\n\nThe so-so: The new layout also offers multiple and repeated use of keys for different foods. Back in CSD1 every ingredient or item had to have its own key option. In CSD2 items and ingredients are split into multiple pages, allowing the reuse of key bindings...but this can also cause a small issue if you're used to the CSD1 method and input what you *think* is the right combo, only to put an unwanted ingredient on the order.\n\nThe bad: No food progression. I know the idea of improved ingredients was nixed reasonably early on, but you can find yourself thrown into the deep end with a huge mass of ingredients to use. In CSD1, the initial purchase of ice cream gave you vanilla and chocolate ice cream, sprinkles, and cherries. Level 2 earned you mint choc chip, whip, and nuts; level 3 earned you butter pecan, strawberry sauce, and chocolate sauce. That totals four ice cream flavours and six toppings.\n\nIn comparison, in CSD2 your purchase of ice cream sundae gets you eight ice cream flavours, seven toppings, and three additions. There is no purchase or progression upgrade, so you get thrown all the options and seemingly told to deal with it, rather than being guided along and having options unlocked as you progress.\n\nTL;DR: Due to having all options available for meals upon purchase (rather than offering upgrades and unlocks), the difficulty is much higher than CSD1. The chef for hire feature is a nice addition, showcasing new recipes and menu options.

In my view Vertigo Games has taken the excellent gameplay of the first title and made it even better, with generally superior mechanics.  There's nothing quite like the thrill of desperately trying to keep up with the pressure of a Rush Hour, when the music flares up and the orders start rushing in.  The amount of content added in this game is immense, with quintuple the number foods of the first game and an enormous catalog of fixed levels to select.  That's not even counting the campaign mode, which is currently unfocused but has wide latitude for the customization of your restaurant.\n\nYou play the role of a chef, with the basic gameplay being the completion of orders from customers and various chores throughout a working day.  Chore tasks have a time fixed set of inputs based on chore type, however most food items are cooked to order, so you will have to check the bottom of the screen to figure out what to do.  On paper every kind of food is straightforward if you follow the recipe faithfully, but if you want to cook at lightning speed each food is essentially a different minigame to master.  Once things get serious you need accurate execution and quick thinking to succeed.\n\nWhile the core gameplay above is the same as in the first game, this game has added extra depth to the system beyond the stunning number of foods.  This game adds the feature of 4-8 holding stations (at the top of the screen) you can use to prepare food ahead of time, especially useful during the lulls before and between rush hours.  This includes some of the entrees as well as side dishes, which are a new gameplay element. Holding stations can be used for side dishes or a subset of entrees. In short, the situation might call for different strategy, which deepens the already busy moment-to-moment gameplay of prioritization.  \n\nThere are major changes to the campaign.  In both games you are in charge of your own restaurant, responsible for setting a menu and purchasing ingredients from your profits.  The second game adds in a new game mode called 'Chef for Hire', where you do shifts at other restaurants.  The previous game's checklist of requirements to earn stars for your restaurant has been replaced simply by the need to gain experience, which can be done in both game modes.  You can now unlock decor for your restaurant  and some new foods either by gaining levels, getting medals in the 'Chef for Hire' levels, or by completing various milestones in your restaurant.  I confess that I had a surprising amount of fun messing around with the restaurant designer after I had earned a number of unlocks.\n\nI have been fairly detailed in the changes to the campaign since it's probably the most controversial part of the changes.  The campaign mode in the first game had a number of issues.  For instance, the checklist to gain stars required playing a certain number of days, which if you were doing well felt like a pointless grind.  There were also a greater variety of upgrades you could purchase, in addition to having to level up your foods to increase their sale price and adding complexity to their recipes.  My view is that while the chore reduction upgrades are popular, the game as it stands is better off without them: juggling chores is a core part of gameplay, and gives teeth to the food modifiers that increase the trash or dishes produced. \n\nUnfortunately, the changes to the campaign have their drawbacks. In the new game the only way you invest in your restaurant is by buying dishes, and once you've bought a dish you don't have to upgrade it any further.  Unless you are prone to experimenting thoroughly in menu design, this means that money becomes basically useless fairly quickly.  I think now that level advancement isn't tied soley to the main restaurant, players don't really have the same emotional connection with the progress of 'their' restaurant.  It's currently not hard to gain stars by playing 'chef for hire' levels exclusively.  There might also be an issue that without food upgrades a new player might easily set up a menu that is unreasonably complicated, whereas in the first game that was generally avoided by having artifical barriers to obtaining complicated foods.  I will note that the developer has noted feedback about the campaign, and has announced that he intends to offer improvents in a future update.\n\nIt would be remiss of me to not mention that several other issues remain with the game at the current time, due to bugs that cropped up late in the development cycle.  Food modifiers are currently hidden from the player, and a system of emails similar to the first game is currently disabled (the lack of emails might be a contributing cause to the lack of player attachment to the main campaign mode).  I am personally optimistic in the developer's ability to fix these, but am aware that my review should address the game as it currently stands.  For this reason, I had initially planned to put off my review until after after a few patches, but I'm honestly having way too much fun with the game as it stands right now to give anything but a thumbs up.\n\nIn conclusion, if you have any interest in the high-tension gameplay then this game is absolutely a must-buy right now.  If your primary interest is in the feeling of progress building a successful restaurant from scratch, then I would say that you should wait and see for changes to the campaign system.  The game currently gives you a very wide ability to customize your restaurant through menu selection and decor, but that sense of progress just isn't there right now.  However, the chef for hire levels alone are worth the price of entry, and the game has a staggering amount of content in its current form.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505879823, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505879823, "recommendationid": "35077165", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534128", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507106008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 306, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1729, "steamid": "76561198124734781", "num_games_owned": 48}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I've enjoyed playing this game, but I do not find it as fun as the first one was.

More of a casual player really.\nI feel CSD2 is an overall improvement, and some of the changes which hardcore players of the original dislike match my tastes quite well.\n\nI personally didn't think highly of the original progression system, it felt very slow and the limited time that I had to play the game left me feeling as though I hadn't made much progress. However, the new progression system, which has been stripped down in some respects, feels a lot more rewarding for playing only a few games at a time, with fast unlocks to decorate your restaurant with new items, new levels and more income to buy new food items to play with. I prefer the wide variety of food, but not having to worry about upgrading a few, in the early game at least it feels as though you aren't stuck with your few best food items and can try something new everytime. However, the many dishes do feel a bit samey, compared to the original where they felt more unique. Personally this is more a win than a loss for me, but I can totally understand why people may not feel the same.\n\nI enjoyed the original gameplay, but I feel the changes to have only made it more fluid. The more but faster chores fit nicely between the customers. The introduction of holding stations adds a management element that, whilst definitely there in the original, is much clearer from the very start. The chef for hire is a nice system that fits more nicely into the main run your own restaurant game than the originals challanges. However, the individual chef for hire levels aren't quite as interesting as the challanges, so this point comes out to a nuetral for me.\n\nPrefer the new art style to the original, no opinion on the music change, but that's all very subjective.\n\nOverall, I much prefer this sequel over the original, but a more hardcore player probably will not.\nSo my review is: Recommended if you want to play it casually, if you want to get really into it someone else can give you that perspective.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505736074, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505736074, "recommendationid": "35043921", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526072", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507130135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1355, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2027, "steamid": "76561198421133052", "num_games_owned": 1}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 49, "comment_count": "3", "review": "I've been patiently (and anxiously) waiting for this to come out ever since CSD 1 was released.

This game does a lot of things well, not least of all giving us so many food cravings we never knew we had.  I've been playing through the game with my fiancee casually for about two weeks now and while the game is just as much fun as the first one was, there are a few things I'd like to highlight as things that are particularly great about the game and things that are particularly underwhelming as well.  We'll start with all the things I really liked about this game - things that make it even bigger, better, and more delicious than the first one.  Keep in mind that this is simply my humble opinion, and I encourage you to have your own whether you agree with my points or not.\n\n1. Graphical Improvements\nThis point goes without saying - the graphics and detail in everything in this game are really well-done.  The level of detail the developer went in definitely shows.  No doubt about it, this game is beautiful.\n\n2. Variety\nNot only the incredibly diverse selection of different foods - noticably much bigger than the selection in the first game - but also the seemingly endless choices of restaurants, menus, sides, and drinks make this game much more emersive and expansive than its predecessor.  Certainly this game lacks no amount of gameplay.  As a gamer with ADD, this is exactly what I want in a game - tons of options and the ability to get bored with one restaurant and simply jump to a different one for an entirely different challenge.\n\n3. Detail\nThe incredible amount of detail that was gone into the development of this game is one of the strong points that I feel many people might unfortunately overlook.  Did you know that some people like eggs on their burgers?  Have you read the backstories behind the numerous different restaurants in the game?  So much work was put into the little things in this game that it really feels polished and well-done, sunny-side up and grilled to perfection.\n\n4. Customization\nYES!!  I am a very big fan of games that allow for customization of players, levels, and everything!  The ability to customize your restaurant's menu was a given even in the first game, but the amount of customization you can have with drinks and side options is incredible!  You want a Burger and Oatmeal with a side of Bacon and pineapple juice to drink?  No problem!  But beyond that, customizing even your entire restaurant is an experience of its own.  Sure, there are a few nitpicky things, but overall they don't detract from a great additional feature in the game.  I'll be sure to post screenshots when my fiancee and I have completely finished our \"most sexy\" restaurant theme.\n\n5. Multiplayer\nSeriously, if you haven't tried the multiplayer yet, you need to grab your boyfriend/girlfriend/casual fling/random guy off the street and just go for it.  My fiancee and I used to have two separate keyboards plugged in to my PC to play multiplayer in the first game by making food together; now it's much more sophisticated and much more realistic.  The multiplayer allows you and your player 2 to run everything about the restaurant together.  I get this order, you get that one.  I'll do these chores, you prep the holding stations.  Everything feels so natural and flushed out that I honestly can't even play single player anymore.  It's also just not as fun for me to do everything by myself either.  That's a sign that a game has a good multiplayer.\n\n\nAnd now that I've spent far too long bragging on all the things about this game I like, there are a few things that I want to highlight that I feel could've been done better.\n\n1. The Level System\nThe level system is a neat addon that I really like - however, the biggest criticism I have of it is that it just doesn't feel like it really means anything.  Sure, you get customization rewards for levelling up, but you also get them for completing days at almost any restaurant in the game and for earning milestones.  Sure, you get new stars for your restaurant, but that really doesn't have any significant effect outside of earning new holding areas and prep stations to make your own restaurant a worthwhile challenge.  At the end of the day, the level system just feels like more of a tracker for how much you've played the game and doesn't really warrant any of the things we crave for earning higher levels (most namely bragging rights).\n\n2. Your Own Restaurant\nMost of the people I've seen play this game (and myself included) almost exclusively tend to focus more on the alternative restaurants in the game than on their own.  Customization aside, there isn't really any benefit to playing in your own restaurant.  I keep thinking that its weird how levelling up increases your Star Rating for your restaurant.  How does doing a week's worth of cooking in Max Weiners make my restaurant look good? (#ROASTED!  Sorry Max Weiners I still love you and your hilarious name)  Then again, if you're the most renound chef at XLR Purple then people may hold your own restaurant to a minimum standard.  At the end of the day, having your own restaurant is basically just a glorified sandbox - which is nice, don't get me wrong - but a bit underwhelming considering that the first game made it such a big deal.\n\n3. Food Upgrades\nWait, what food upgrades?  Oh, right.  It kinda bothers me that this game completely got rid of one of the biggest mechanics from the original - all the foods are as is from day 1.  Understandably it would make a TON of extra work to include 3-5 upgrades for each of the 186 food items currently in the game.  Still, I can't help but miss my favorite foods getting progressively more stressful to make as the game gets harder and harder with no remorse.  It's part of the Cook, Serve, Delicious charm.\n\n4. Realism / Lack of Gameplay Variety\nWhile this isn't necessarily something that's wrong with the game, it does feel like a really big missed opportunity.  These two headers are coupled together because they're both raised by a single point.  Being able to play in a bunch of different restaurants is awesome and enjoyable, but at the end of the day, they're all too similar.  Sure, different menus and different food styles vary up all the different locations enough for them to pull their own weight, but they're all more or less the same challenge with slightly different button combinations.  To expand on this, as you would expect you'll always see a rush hour at noon and another one at dinnertime.  For most restaurants this is expected.  But why are so many people in Breakfast & Breakloose ordering cereal and pancakes at 12:30pm?  I mean, I like to sleep in as much as the next food patron, but you'd think a breakfast joint would have a rush hour much earlier in the day, right?  And this is the missed opportunity I brought up.  Instead of the same day with a different menu, each restaurant could have different rush hour times and operating hours.  Sure a breakfast restaurant may be easier to work at than a bar with literally All The Sports, but are you prepared to handle a Rush Hour at 8am?  I feel like this kind of realism can add a new prospect for the game's challenges - that just like in real life, all restaurants have different rushes and slow periods.  They also have different hours, too.  This dessert place has an adorable mascot, but it doesn't really feel like most people would be swarming to get a bowl of ice cream at 9am in the morning.  Then again, who am I kidding?  I'd eat a bowl of ice cream any time of day.\n\n\nBecause of Review length limits, I'm going to have to stop here.  Overall I would certainly recommend this game if you enjoyed the first one.  Feel free to leave your own opinions about things that were done well and/or things that could've been better.  Please be respectful and polite, and if you offer criticism please make sure it's constructive.\n\nOverall, I rate Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!! as 7.5/10.

Yes. Am I mad it wasn't? Absolutely not. Does it miss that story charm from the first one? Of course (but it will eventually be implemented).\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I would've purchased this either way, and it's kind of fun in a frustrating way when you encounter a bug, and then the developer actually LISTENS and REPLIES and FIXES it within a reasonable timeframe! It's absolutely impressive how fast he has pumped out fixes, and had he just waited the extra time to release the game, there would have been a group of angry individuals anyways. I cannot reasonably tear down a single developer for not having his timing on point. \n\nWhen it comes down to the gameplay itself, like I said, crazy and challenging. Sure things get 'easier' once you've memorized the keybinds, but that doesn't necessarily make those final levels of each restaurant any less challenging. I've seen a few reviews trash the side items for adding time to dishes, but it's really not that easy if you have to prepare 4 items around the clock (e.g. Lasagna, Spaghetti & Meatballs, Chili, Soup), some of which you will want to have multiple prepped due to the TWELVE order tabs that spit out like crazy during Rush Hour, and then having the challenge of one, two if you're lucky, extra side tabs for side dishes.\n\nI can't wait for what the future patches add to the experience!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506389471, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506391655, "recommendationid": "35213766", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511533", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505409447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 45, "steamid": "76561197972588080", "num_games_owned": 444}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": "1", "review": "After anticipating this for a long time, I found myself very dissapointed with CSD2.
