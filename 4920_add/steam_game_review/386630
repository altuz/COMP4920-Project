The rotating rooms and redirectors are an interesting challenge in themselves.\n    [*][b]Nice graphics.[/b] \n    [*][b]Fun puzzles.[/b] \n    [*][b]Cheap.[/b] \u20ac3.49 at the time this was written. Even if you don't really like the game it's not a huge loss.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*][b]Very short.[/b] 2 hours at most.\n    [*][b]Controls feel slow.[/b] The gun doesn't follow your movements like in most games, but instead lags behind you a bit, making it feel disjointed. The jumping is also a bit dodgy. Half of the time I died was because I just walked into one of the pits without jumping.\n    [*][b]Poor voice acting.[/b] I'm pretty sure this was just voiced by the developer, and the lackluster delivery makes the story seem bland and uninteresting.\n    [*][b]Broken interactions/textures.[/b] While using the red sphere I managed to accidentally teleport myself out of the map and started falling into oblivion. Towards the end there is a blatantly missing floor that makes you wonder if you're going the wrong way.\n    [*][b]No controller support.[/b] It really feels like the kind of game that would benefit from a controller.\n[/list]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438563809, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438563809, "recommendationid": "17359593", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508473", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438400651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 15, "steamid": "76561198055361045", "num_games_owned": 435}, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you like weak story telling, horrible and floaty movements, and horrendous voice acting, this game is for you!

It was only $3.95 when I bought it so it wasn't that big of a deal. You can tell the actor is probably the dev or something but who cares. What you are left with after the in game dialog is a very clever game with interesting gravity mechanics. It is obiously inspired by portal but there is nothing new under the sun, so most games are like most games anymore. I recommend this game and in fact decided to try and beat it while doing a let's play after all.
