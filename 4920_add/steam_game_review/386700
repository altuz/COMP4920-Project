The setting is that you are drilling oil underwater. There are four types of machines you use to get oil, and each of them have their own little minigames you play. You will soon be managing three or more at the same time, so this is basically a \"Diner Dash\" style multitasking game. The problem is that it doesn't change much and you end up doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nAlso, it doesn't upload your saves to the cloud. Really? Who doesn't do that these days? I switched computers, lost my saves, and decided not to start back up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492772864, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492772864, "recommendationid": "31272858", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468086", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 64, "total_reviews": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 25}}
