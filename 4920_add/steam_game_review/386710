GIVEN YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN THE GAME BY THE DEVELOPER, this game should be fairly simple to navigate while using your arrow keys as well as  Enter, Back Slash (\\), And Delete as A B and C buttons. A and B work exactly how they would on a standard gamepad A is accept and B is back and C is to activate other things and go up stairs and stuff it's really not that hard to figure out. \n\nthe main problem with this game is that it doesn't cater to dorito dust snorting CSGO players or your classic TF2 or Gary's mod players it's a weird game with a really cool idea most people just don't read how to play the game and then go in to a dungeon and die fifty times until they write a bad review because they failed to understand that you need to READ the INSTRUCTIONS. \n\nmy buddy and i were having a good laugh at the creatively random generated names for items and enemies such as:\n\n\"Home Grown STD\" a real actual item i found\n\nand \"jazz Jelly\" a real actual enemy i fought.\n\ni absolutely recomend this game because it's really fun and a nice break from the minecraft and terarria rip off games and also a break from survival game and zome game ripoffs i've never played anything like it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499238692, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499238692, "recommendationid": "33263805", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501820", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499045772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561197967458119", "num_games_owned": 554}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This looked interesting, but trying to play it got me locked into menus and no input was able to get me out.
