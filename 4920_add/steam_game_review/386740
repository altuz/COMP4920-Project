No playerbase, period. Just now, two hours of waiting, played one MP game. AI is too stupid so you can't really learn to play in singleplayer in preparation to non-existant MP. Almost no youtube videos (other than some reviews). No word of mouth, no advertisement. It has no existing playerbase and no way to keep new players in the game.\n\nSingleplayer... Well, AI can't play it, and given that it's a logic/tactics game, AI = content.\n\nNice game mechanics, probably one of the best for that type of the game... But without players it's useless.\n\n***\nI added my responce to a comment to this review, i think it will be helpful too.\n***\nKeith, i agree that Puzzle Strike is kinda okayish as a singleplayer. But i like Ascension much better as a deckmaking singleplayer game. It has much more different cards and effects, and you can think how to combine them together and it's fun. AI is also weak, but i have more fun playing it because i can play it like, well, a Puzzle game :) Comboing cards, making a deck, things like that.\n\nPuzzle Strike is great differently, it's great in it's simplicity. It's more like chess. But AI can't use the greatness part of Puzzle Strike simplicity :) How top ladder players play in Puzzle Strike (they're like half of the active players actually playing Puzzle Strike)? They see the cards, they see the champions, they make a winning plan and they go for it. AI here doesn't do the \"analyze\" and \"making a plan\" part, i think it just buys \"good\" cards and that's it. The difference is striking. Puzzle Strike is designed as a competitive game, but AI does NOT compete with the player, it just plays randomly based on card weights. AI is just too weak to make use of the best things in a game like Puzzle Strike. They're there, but AI can't show them to you. You need MP for it, but then again, there is no players. That's why i said that it's probably one of the best game mechanics in that kind of game, but unfortunately we can't enjoy it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453153798, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1462788125, "recommendationid": "20613281", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523070", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1455710863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 86, "steamid": "76561198003076915", "num_games_owned": 689}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A really fun deckbuilder with a nice video game interface.

The mechanics are solid as the game is known for it's deck building elements, but can that do enough despite an interface that's lacking in several areas? Will the chips fall into place in terms of the multiplayer and the challenge that it gives? Will you go all in on aggro, or will stay back and build up your resources? Will I ask more silly questions in the description of the video? Come find out!\n \n\n[u] Summary: [/u]\nIt's nice that there's a virtual version of the famous tabletop game, and the strategy element here has a core RPS element to it, but it's much more complicated then that. Granted, I wish the interface was a lot better: it's servicable, but it shows its browser based routes and some elements of it are particularly ugly. However, I found it to work a lot better then it's browser based counterpart, as online matches were easy to find with no connectivity issues that I could see. If you can stand that, there's a fun core game experience here that will keep your attention in the multiplayer seen, as the different characters do play reasonably different despite only having differences in the character chips. Good deck building mechanics that punish being too aggressive and not thinking about your next move, while giving you reasons to not just horde buying chips.  It's fun, I just wish it was better in the end, but you can find out via the browser based version if the game is right for you (if it works). \n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/w_E828NWyxc[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Great strategy elements that work on a couple of levels. Good back and forth strategy that has you trying to get two steps ahead of your opponent.  \n[*] Characters being the only unique chip aspect makes it feel like you've got a reasonable chance against anyone, despite maybe having a strong weakness against them. \n[*] Deck building element does a good job of punishing negative moves but also making sure that you don't go to heavy on one strategy that can't be countered. Good Balance. \n[*] Network elements work, matchmaking was quick and there's cross-platform which helps things out. No major lag or latency issues as well.\n[*] Like the Challenge mode that helps bring a little bit of thought and understanding of mechanics, even if it can be a little confusing at times on what it truly wants you to do. \n\n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The interface and application implementation is ugly. Elements feel tacked on in terms of the interface, and some of the text and color choices are down right bleh.\n[*] Could have had some animations, some things to help the presentation elements of the game, as again, it's implementation is pretty ugly. \n[*] Doesn't save information. Even after playing a match, simple choices like who's going first reset to their default, or the chips you've chosen reset on exiting the game. Annoying. \n[*] Tutorial could be implemented better.\n[*] Do wish there was some options in terms of gameplay regarding the choosing of chips in the bank, because it would have helped some interesting issues of siding the bank to the host players advantage. \n[/list]\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450981865, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1450981865, "recommendationid": "19915339", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512202", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456805180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 536, "steamid": "76561197990925745", "num_games_owned": 567}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Puzzle Strike is a video game adaptation of a board game that's an adaptation of a video game called Super Puzzle Fighter. Yes, that weird Street Fighter spin-off game that plays like Tetris, but isn't quite Tetris. So how does it work? This game is actually a deck-builder similar to games like Dominion. Unlike most deck-builder, this one has a lot more interaction between players and the ultimate goal is to defeat your opponent by crashing Gems into your opponent's gem pile (similiar to filling up your screen in Tetris or Super Puzzle Fighter). The game is also a bit assymetric compared to other deck-builder games in which each player selects a character. Each character has 3 special ability \"chips\" (cards) that makes them different from other characters changing up how a person plays the game and the strategy they employ. There is more to the game but this, like Yomi, is easy to learn but challenging to master. The PC adaptation is solid, and I think it plays better than the physical boardgame counter-part due to everything being automated.\n\nFor more information, check out Watch It Played's Puzzle Strike Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og01q5_zbD8", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450987612, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1450987612, "recommendationid": "19918026", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505487", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492070333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 254, "steamid": "76561197984224864", "num_games_owned": 238}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "As a fan of the tabletop game, I'm really happy with how this turned out.

It was a rare game that had the perfect balance of strategy, tactics, and randomness to promote table talk and interaction among players. It's an excellent game to play with friends.\n\nWith Puzzle Strike, the deckbuilding format is evolved to be more competative and aggressive, with its fascinating Crash Gem mechanic making the game feel more like a bar fight then \"multi-player solitaire\" as some of Dominion's detractors call it. I wouldn't go so far as to say its better than Dominion, but it definitely has a strong, competative feel that makes it exciting in ways Dominion never was.\n\nIf you like Dominion or other deckbuilders, this is an excellent game. If you are new to the genre, I'd start with Ascension or Dominion to get a feel for if that style of game is right for you.
