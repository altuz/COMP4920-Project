In fact, for that larger game I'd actually pay more, but I have to judge what is in front of me.\n\n[i]Essentially, this is a roguelite space shooter.[/i] You collect money, buy upgrades that allow you to collect more money, and repeat. The catch is that a lot of the upgrades have a risk/reward factor. The upgrades are wildly different and really are very cool. One may be the ability to purchase a mercenary ship that follows you and helps fight, and another upgrade may be the introduction of another type of currency.\n\nController support is great, and playing local co-op split screen was a decent amount of fun. Even though I have two more upgrades to go - I see where this is going. The ceiling is near and knowing this already makes me want to stop grinding. Because, like most progressive roguelites, this is a grindfest. A fun one, nonetheless.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Definately a neat setting and something that hasn't exactly been done before\n+Controller support is good\n+Co-op split screen is a very welcome addition\n+Has that addictive quality of [i]Slither.io[/i] (not sure why, but it makes me think of that game lol)\n+Upgrades are all unique and definitely change how the game is played\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Small amount of content for the asking price, IMO\n-Once you know where the ceiling is, it is hard to keep motivated to play\n\n[b]Yeah, it's fun, but I'd wait for a sale.[/b] The most you'll likely get out of this is a fun afternoon.\n\nPeace,", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1475154685, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1475154685, "recommendationid": "25765027", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529226", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440469484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1870, "steamid": "76561197997027704", "num_games_owned": 627}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A compulsive twin stick asteroid-mining rogue-like set in procedurally generated space with a brilliant \"risk\" system where at the start of the game, you can choose to enable any or all of 10 different scenarios to make the game more difficult in return for a higher percentage of profit.\nOne risk makes your armour weak so only one hit can be taken. Another adds gold to some asteroids but also adds competition in the form of big mining ships.\nThe game eases you in gently, the 10 risks are unlocked as you play, letting you add more challenge as you get more confident.\n\nYou have a starting area which includes an ammo and fuel shop, a shop to sell minerals to, a place for upgrading your ship parts and a police station which rewards cash-monies for any teeth you bring them as proof of a baddy bashed.\nFrom here, you go out exploring space, blowing up asteroids to find juicy minerals to sell on for profit, searching for cash crates, ship upgrades to beef up your engines and weapons and bad lads who drop teeth and cash on death.\nBlasting benign civilian ships into space dust and collecting their cash and hopefully ship upgrade parts will set off a GTA style wanted state where police will chase you around the starting area until it wears off.\n\nThe game keeps you on your toes, every time I've gotten cocky or I've started to relax a bit, I've been chinned.\nThe starting screen shows your own personal high score and the highest score from around the world for that day which spurs you on to have \"just one more shot\".\nThis is early access but feels like a complete and polished game already.
