Sentinel 4 tried to innovate upon a proven formula, but it was unsuccessful and made the gameplay worse.\n\nWhile players overlooked Sentinel 3's graphics due to its well-designed gameplay, the amateurish-graphics were not updated at all for Sentinel 4; in fact, some of the new graphical addition in Sentinel 4 looks horrible, and the poor graphics now really stands out when combined with the game's poorly-designed gameplay.\n\nSentinel 4 tried to build upon Sentinel 3, but it completely went in the wrong direction. The main problem with Sentinel 4 is that they added destrutible turrets and completely changed the reason why players enjoy Sentinel 3. Tower Defense games with destructible turrets sometimes work, but Sentinel 4 is NOT one of them.\n\nSentinel 4 have a similar upgrade system from Sentinel 3, and players who have played Sentinel 3 would be familiar with the new UI and upgrade system. For Sentinel 3 players, Sentinel 4 is easy-to-pick-up, but will find it changed and overall unenjoyable.\n\nThe game starts off by throwing exploding enemies that takes big chunks off of player and barrier health, then not long after, the game introduces airborne enemies with no path indicator that fly past defenses to attack your turrets. If your setup is built for attacking ground units, and have no anti-air turrets setup, the defense that the player set up is completely ruined on a random wave that the game announces will contain airbourne enemies.\n\nThe combination of destructible turrets and airborne units is frustrating and not an interesting gameplay feature. It creates a lot of busy-work where the player have to micromanage to avoid having your mech destroyed and constantly monitor and repair turrets. Tower Defense lovers who enjoy finding perfect turret placement and watch waves run into their immaculate tower defense design will find this game to be frustrating having to fiddle with repairs and micromanagement.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439981381, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439981381, "recommendationid": "17612749", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538417", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454047658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 2014, "steamid": "76561198028441712", "num_games_owned": 900}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "4", "review": "Any game series that can spawn 3 sequels has to be doing something right; [b]Sentinel 4: Dark Star (S4:DS)[/b] is no exception. Offering a more traditional tower defense experience with solid & balanced game mechanics, there is [b]26 levels (plus 5 secondary campaign levels)[/b] in total with some good map designs & waves that can challenge, throwing your planned strategy into turmoil!\n\nFor seasoned TD fans, initially the game does feel rather easy on normal difficulty level. Myself, I managed to get through to level 15 before running into any real progression-crushing issues, which resulted in me having to go back and replay levels to upgrade up my towers. Unlike TD games like [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/235360/]Prime World Defenders[/url] [i](which also has upgradable towers)[/i], the rewards for replaying are reasonable, which means although somewhat repetitive, you can progress at a reasonable pace even when you get stuck or continually loose at a level. Replaying earlier levels on hard or psycho difficulty will speed this up as well. For longer term replayability there is also [i](the always welcomed)[/i] endless mode with Steam Leaderboards for some competition. There is no maze/pathing in [b]S4:DS[/b].\n\nAs the title implies, you also have a [b]unique unit called a Sentinel[/b] [i](basically a giant mech)[/i] that you can jump to certain locations on the map. They defend stronghold gates & support other fixed towers, allowing another layer to your strategy. As with the towers, your Sentinels can also be upgraded as they gain experience. Using these effectively can be the difference between success & failure. I really like the Sentinel feature & adds something different to what could be seen as a more generic TD game.\n\nGraphically it's competent but not great; tower weapon effects are ok as is the environments/maps, but could have benefited from some higher quality textures for the PC version & some smoother animations. Alien types are easily distinguishable even when things get hectic which is always a plus with a TD game. The musical score was good, getting stuck in my head long after I have exited the game, but other sound effects were a bit bland, but this does add a bit of an ol' school flavor to it all.\n\nThere are a [b]few minor issues[/b] that did lead to frustration though. Firstly, attacks from the air can happen from almost anywhere on the map & from multiple sources at once [i](not following the traditional 'known' paths)[/i]. These are not highlighted in any way at the start of the level [i](such as in [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/18500/]Defense Grid[/url])[/i] often leading to restarts once you learn where they come from. It drove me nuts at times! It diminishes the strategic element of the game, instead changing it to memorising the specific waves & entry locations.\n\nAlso, what I believe is a new introduction to the series, is destructible towers. Without having a fully upgraded tower, most are very squishy especially versus certainly aliens & can completely demolish any attempt to complete a level sometimes within mere seconds. Later levels seem to have specific waves designed just for this purpose. I am not against towers taking damage or being destroyed, as it adds yet another layer of strategy, but it is not as well balanced as the rest of the game in my opinion. You can cash-in/recycle destroyed towers to help cover the cost of the rebuild, but that down-time generally means a restart anyways. Very frustrating to see your precious towers built up over the last [i]xxx[/i] waves of the level destroyed so quickly!\n\n[b]S4:DS[/b] is not perfect but does offer good value for money, refined gameplay & a reasonable difficulty curve that can keep you coming back for some time after your initial round.\n\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TrueBlueReviews#curation]If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow [u]True Blue Reviews[/u] for more recommendations![/url]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453968489, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454034994, "recommendationid": "20800581", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533808", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453365532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3299, "steamid": "76561198015547525", "num_games_owned": 611}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Really good and solid tower defense game.
