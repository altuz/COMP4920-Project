I thought I would be disappointed by the quality, and would stop playing relatively early on. Nope. This game's athmosphere is exceptionally well made, and I feel that not enough games have really stepped into the \"supernatural but not really\" genre, involving Bigfoot and other creatures that people claim to have sighted. As for graphics, on \"Very Low\", which is what my laptop was initially set to, it looks terrible. But when I raised it to \"Medium\" it really changes. Shadows look nice and the grass is much better. Thought I didn't have the opportunity to try \"Ultra\" as I would've been watching a PowerPoint, I was really happy with the quality.\nNow, here comes the bad. The animations are alright. Firing a gun looks ok but doesn't have the same feeling as in other horror or fps games. The controls are somewhat tricky in the beginning, but thankfully you can change the scheme to whatver you'd like. AI is ok, though I feel it could be greatly improved. The ability to hide in hunting shelters is nice, but the fact that you're literally invisible to non-player-controlled things isn't that immersive.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 7/10. I think that while it is a lot of fun, there is still a lot that could be added, and I'm really looking forward to when it is complete.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505539944, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505539944, "recommendationid": "34988326", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502016", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451865401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 42, "steamid": "76561198197922431", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Good game my dudes.
