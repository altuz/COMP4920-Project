Then, suddenly, the game was slapped with a VR exclusive label.\n\nThe game was never once advertised as VR exclusive. I think you can see where this is going, yes?\n\nThe devs basically spat in the faces of everyone who supported them earlier. Saying that they intend to keep the old, unfinished version of the game up is bullshit when they don't plan to do much with it, and when the game as it is now REQUIRES a VR headset, no matter what. I don't think I can EVER recommend this game to anyone again.\n\nTL;DR: The game switched suddenly to VR exclusive, despite never advertising that before.
