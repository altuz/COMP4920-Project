[/h1]\n\nUltimate Chicken Horse (UCH) is a Level Designer-like Platformer. When you're in a level with other people, you can add platforms and traps each round. When everyone's done placing their objects, you then play the level. Your job is to be the only person to get to the goal, and prevent the other players to also succeed. If everyone makes it to the end, nobody gets points for that round (unless someone got an object called a Coin.). If everyone dies, nobody gets points for that round.\n\nThe controls when the level you're in takes some time to get use to. To me, they were really floaty the first time I played the game, which caused some accidental fails (like accidentally falling through a small gap). While they do need to get use to, the control layout is simple and easy to learn. I played this game with my Ps3 controller (I did some thing that makes my computer think my Ps3 controller is a Xbox 360 controller.), and the controls never got confusing, but since they're floaty in this game, again, they need to get use to.\n\nWhen in the Build-like Mode, you can place 1 object every round (but I think you can change the amount of objects you can place down in the rules). In Party Mode, you and the other players get 4-5 random objects to choose from every round. If you see an object you want, you need to be quick, since the other players can take that object away from you. In Freeplay Mode, you get to select 1 object of your choice every round. If you want to place down a trap? You can do that if you want! Want to delete an object someone placed? You can do that if you want!\n\nIf you're the host, you can change the rules for your game. You can increase rounds, change the Game Mode, etc. So if you want your game to be different or more interesting, you can try to do that.\n\nAt the start of the game, you only get 3 levels, 4 characters, and no outfits. In order to get more levels/characters/outfits, you need to find these boxes with a \"?\" on them in the levels you have. If there is a box, a ? appears on a level in the Lobby. In order to get the boxes, you just need to touch them or put a trap next to them. It's easier than it sounds.\n\nThe Soundtrack and Artstyle are really good. Can't say anything else.\n\nThere are problems with the game: Bugs and Online Issues.\n\n-When I was playing with other people I don't know, one of them said that they couldn't select an object, even though he was pressing the left mouse button on the object he wanted. Because of this issue, he/she couldn't put any objects down, only the the two players and I.\n-I put stairs on a rotating object that had honey on it. At first, the stairs rotated like I wanted to, but then the stairs stopped rotating and was at a different place the next round.\n\nI've encountered more bugs, but those are the bugs I can think of right now.\n\n-When playing Online, things are out of sync at times. Like for example: I jump into a saw that's rotating, and I fail. The next player jumps, and even though it looks like he/she touched the saw, he/she is still going. Or like an arrow hits a player, and he/she's still going.\n-Some things do disappear from a player's view. Sometimes an object disappears on a player's screen, which might screw them over.\n\nOverall, if you want a really fun party game, Ultimate Chicken Horse is for you! Don't want to get 4 copies of the game? No worries! You can hook up 4 controllers to your computer and play the game together, just like that. In my opinion, 15 dollars is worth it for the super fun gameplay that never gets old.\n\nHighly Recommended!\n\n[b] This is my opinion. If you don't like this game, that's perfectly fine.
