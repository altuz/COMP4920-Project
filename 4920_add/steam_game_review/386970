Strong \"action-y' VN with a protagonist who manages to stretch the mold in some places (not quite breaking it, but things like [spoiler]attempting suicide to get closer to someone[/spoiler] (that's literally the opening of the VN so it's not much of a spoiler) and [spoiler]having intelligent counterpoints to the main villain's arguments rather that being overwhelmed by cuckoo logic[/spoiler] make him more interesting than some. Gets a bit chuunibyou at times but for some that might be a bonus. And ends on a sobering and yet hopeful note.\n\nWorth it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505016334, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505016334, "recommendationid": "34852717", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 21, "total_reviews": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
