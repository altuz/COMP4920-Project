It is clearly, by far, the most interesting VN on steam and easly one of the best values.   However, it isn't for everyone. \n\nFist, the story isn't really about depression, drug addiction and all of the other stuff you read in most of the other reviews. Since the chracters are all based upon very damaged writers, there is depression, drug references, and there are images showing death by drowning like in Hamlet.  But, that isn't really what the story is about.\n\nThe stroy involves Sam as she trys to regain the friendship she lost of her best childhood friend.   As you read, you will learn, like any good famous author, Sam has a lot of issues and is obsessed.   You probably shouldn't read past here if you don't like a few spoilers... but the few negative reviews need a proper resposne.  \n\nIf you play all the routes and really think about things, you will start to see that even the \"good\" ending has very dark overtones. People who think the game is just about depression, are being far too literal.  The game has more to do with the way several characters (including our hero Sam) tend to love people in smothering ways. Nothing good comes from that. In the \"good\" ending Sam gets the \"friendship\" of the person she loves back, but if you really think about the conditions imposed, you will realize that ending could end up being nothing short of a living hell of sorts. The whole point is to get you to think about the relationships, how damaged each of these character is, and to think about things. The \"good\" ending may not be the best, it is better than the implied suicide one, but it may not be the best. For Sam, it might be best to let go and move on.  If you ever messed up a relationship, and did your best to put it back together again... it is almost an attempt to show that might not be for the best... even if worked.  \n\nIn short, I think the title has more to do with every single aspect of the novel. The author was trying to recreate the stifling atmosphere of a book of the time period of the names of the author's characters of the book are from. And the novel does an amazing job of that.  Not so much Hamlet (depite the image) but more like the Awakening.  Unlike the novel the Awakening where the lead character drowns herself, in our book (if you go with the \"good\" ending) she finds out that the character she loves is secretly more damaged than anyone else (even herself) and Sam agrees to something (that if you think about carefully) will be very painful. Drowning in another sense.  It will likely be far (FAR) more painful than not being that person's friend in the long term.   Tragic in a way.  Sometimes, a false hope may be worse than no hope at all!\n\nSo, Asphyxia isn't a game about just depression.  The author was going for the kind of story you debate over in college, and they succeed brilliantly. It is the kind of VN you think about and then reread parts to soak in the true weight of what people are saying. But, that dosen't make for a happy book.   It is really cool how the tragedy of the whole thing sinks in... and that is for the \"happy\" ending.  \n\nThis VN isn't for anyone who really didn't like English in college, the books they asked you to read then, or for anyone who really screwed up an important relationship and is still depressed about it.  While I think the author really has some helpful things to say, it may be too painful.    \n\nHowever, if you want to read something that will make you think about what you read and its full implications, this is probably one of the few games on Steam that will ever fit that bill.
