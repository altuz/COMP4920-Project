Toki-Tori is in the latter category as a puzzle-platformer/Rube Goldberg game formerly on the Game Boy Color before being remade for the Wii, smartphones and, finally, the \u201cdefinitive\u201d edition PC. \n\nWhen I describe this version as \u201cdefinitive,\u201d I am not saying there are missing features as only the PC version has all the bonus levels, the rewind button and various control methods and level-editor. It\u2019s when you put the history into perspective that the question of whether playing this game on the PC is the intended experience, or is likely to find its intended audience, on a platform with concerns about the first two hours of every game as well as access to the internet to find solutions due to a lack of patience with modern day puzzle games. These concerns as well as the difference of expectations for these types of games from retro handheld and modern smartphone audiences are all the weight of history Toki Tori must overcome on its bird brain. \n\n[h1]You Can\u2019t Save Eggs Without Breaking A Few Skulls[/h1]\n\nAt its core, the puzzles behind Toki Tori are not meant to be intuitive the farther you delve past the training levels that introduce mechanics and area-themes before the real challenge begins in the hard and bonus levels. Even when it comes to the basic/\u201deasy\u201d levels, the latter half varies specifically how much you grasp the subtitles of your tools but also in how to analyze rationing out the tools you are given for success. This combination is likely to result in player fatigue without frequent breaks.\n\nTo say that puzzles behind Toki Tori feel dated is an understatement, and that is both indicative of how modern puzzles have avoided this problem as well as simplified their challenges. In games like Snakebird, the difficulty behind the challenges may be obtuse but most puzzles can be solved in less than a minute when you know what you\u2019re doing. In many other puzzles, the teaching of the puzzles is the real challenge whereas the precise mechanics are never a concern as players are within safe environments (a.k.a. Portal). Toki Tori, however, possesses puzzles that are so elaborate that encourages the player to try all the alternatives before coming up with the one solution that can result in the puzzle taking upwards of two to three minutes on top of the amount of time for level resets. The worst feeling a game like this can create is making you restart the whole level because you used one tool in a spot meant to psyche you out that would be required at the very end. \n\nIf you are the more patient type that enjoys spending between 15 to 30 mins on the more difficult challenges, then the satisfaction these crafted levels brings will reward the most diligent of players. These types of people are probably also the type who would enjoy making their own Toki-Goldbird Machines from the Level Editor that would test the limits of a player\u2019s ingenuity. The result is a puzzle-game that is difficult to recommend not because the puzzles fail to be engaging but test the limits of all but the most dedicated in rigorously testing out solutions. (Thankfully, there is a demo available if you are not sure if the game is for you.)\n\n[h1]Puzzles Are Not Universal; Word-searches Are Not Like Crosswords[/h1]\n\nWith videos like Mark Brown\u2019s \u201cGame Maker\u2019s Toolkit\u201d gushing in praise about Toki-Tori 2, this is perhaps a cautionary review for people interested in playing Toki-Tori chronologically to understand that just because they are both puzzle games does not make them the same. As someone who tends to have a lot more patience than others, even I found the bonus levels\u2019 difficulty spikes and some of the later stages to test my own limits whereas I enjoyed Toki-Tori 2 as much as possible without guidance. Does this make the first game worse? No, it\u2019s indicative that these two games have differing tastes and that comparing them is like comparing collecting Oranges to utilizing Orange Portals."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500063304, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "33543871", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198371457687", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1502344067, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 60}, "timestamp_updated": 1500063304, "received_for_free": false, "review": "enjoy playing"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500324378, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33616117", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198142170335", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1500357100, "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 22}, "timestamp_updated": 1500324378, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Time killer."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502826793, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497027", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34262784", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198166245047", "num_reviews": 60, "last_played": 1499026360, "num_games_owned": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 381}, "timestamp_updated": 1502826793, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Very difficult puzzle game.

Story was either non-existent or laughably bad, with characters much the same. If the gameplay hooked you in, you would like the game, and if it didn't, you probably wouldn't like the game. Why? Because the game was \"just X.\" That's typically all it was. The entire game boiled down to doing a very specific thing indefinitely. \n\nAs time wore on, extra variables were added. Sometimes, other gameplay elements would be added in, so you could have X, Y, and Z, while non-gameplay variables were added in as well, such as an A, B, and C, where A was plot, B was characters, and C was an amazing sountrack. Games had so much more going on in them; not just multiple gameplay elements, but these other elements, too. Those non-gameplay elements could appeal to players who normally would be bored out of their minds with \"just X.\" I have been swayed into liking some games I never would have liked if not for non-gameplay elements that I enjoyed.\n\nToki Tori is a game that ignored this form of gaming natural selection, choosing to focus on being a puzzle game with a cute look, and nothing more. For folks who are sold on that - which is a large number of people - the game may very well be enjoyable. However, for people who think the puzzles just look \"alright\" or \"decent,\" that may not be enough. Story, characters, some non-gameplay element of some sort was needed here to appeal to the crowd that doesn't want \"just X\" with this game's puzzles being \"X.\" Just look at Portal's GLaDOS dialog for an example of adding something that isn't the gameplay to a puzzle game. That kind of thing wins me over, while Toki Tori was \"just X\" and did not. I wish I liked it (I paid for it), but I didn't have fun."}]}
