So basically looks and feels about 10 years older than it is.\nThere's a couple of really annoying things:\n\n- Can't speed through the narrator story bits... so either have to sit it out or skip the whole thing.\n- It's basically force feeding you 'biblical information and insight' which felt annoying to me.\n- Everything looks and feels old. Which is okay in an old game you have nostalgic feelings for. But is really a turnoff for a game from 2015\n- The voice acting isn't horrible, but it's not great either.\n\nThe comicbook style story bits between chapters are a nice touch.\n\nSo.. I wouldn't recommend the game unless:\n\n- You are the biggest hack 'n slash dungeon / diablo clone fanboy and want to play every single game like it.\n- You just want to play a christian game and take the fact that it's below par for granted (which seems inevitable anyway)\n- You get it really cheap", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499676664, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499676664, "recommendationid": "33425762", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503925", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504973464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 772, "steamid": "76561198017286261", "num_games_owned": 119}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great Game!\nI am loving the game!\nI bought the next game as well.\nIt is a fun little hack and slash rpg.\nI love the biblical references just wish not in King James but I understand why.\nI am still getting use to all the controls and mechanics.\nHere is a link to my game play- https://youtu.be/gmZ5Pjo5lMQ", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504097881, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504188472, "recommendationid": "34606961", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497960", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499225121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561197962956172", "num_games_owned": 587}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Those comparing this game to Diablo 1 or 2, you should be ashamed of yourself. \n\nSave your shekels.
