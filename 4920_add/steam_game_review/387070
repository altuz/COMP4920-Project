Even though I went ahead and purchased the game, I still think the Developer has an obligation to people who already purchased the game to provide them with a key.... enough on that subject...\n\nWhere to start with One Final Breath, it looks in the trailers to be your prototypical First person horror experience..  The graphics are decent, not the most impressive but very passable.  The game play is your typical search the random dark place to answer some burning questions or solve some type of question.  This game isn't an exception as you are tasked with finding your daughter who has run away from home.\n\nAs you explore the abandoned St. Mary's school, you'll find scattered notes left behind to help you piece together the history and get some back story on the building.\n\nThe first part in what will eventually be a five part episodic game.  So my review could change as future episodes are released (if they are released)  Ultimately it still remains to be seen what the developer has to offer in the future with this game.\n\nSome negitives I've taken from the game... it's too dark with no options available to brighten it up.  Dubious audio quality with no option to turn on Subtitles.  Seems to be a key hunting simulator thus far.  In fact when it comes to in game options non exist..  Prior to starting up the game you can alter a few settings but for a game like this you should really be able to have on the fly changes.  The audio is either missing or needs to be made more clear/ or turned up as my character made numerous references to sounds which I didn't hear from my speakers or headphones..  The spelling, well this one isn't a deal breaker but still.... what is a WONG key?  \n\nAlso about 40 minutes into my playthrough the screen became transparent, then slowly went dark, the mouse cursor was stuck in the middle of the screen and I couldn't control it, attempts to move the mouse were meet with the cursor thrashing back and force in a one inch hidden square.  I was unable to do anyting at all, I eventually had to ctl, alt, del out of the game then manually close it out..  It wound up costing me the 39 minutes I had played...\n\n\nThe positives..  the atmosphere is fairly unnerving, even with the above mentioned sound issues.  The art style is rather unique and sets it apart from alot of the other FP horror games flooding the market.. The story seems engaging and interesting for the most part.  Provided you care to seek it out from the various scraps of paper which lay around.  The map layout is fairly simplistic to remember (not overly complicated to increase)  the puzzles are simple.  \n\nI would have to not recommend this game currently, this may change provided the developer goes back and attempts to fix some of the bugs and glitches I mentioned above, and at the bare minimum includes some type of settings in the game menu.  Subtitles would also be very beneficial, especially for people who are hard of hearing like myself...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441863475, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441863475, "recommendationid": "17965520", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578596", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478981415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 48, "steamid": "76561198041688793", "num_games_owned": 710}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 49, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a bunch of garbage. A kickstarter game that never followed through on its promises - Only one episode out of a purported six ever released, meanwhile the developer went on to make other games since. Just a cashgrab, and a particularly lazy one at that.\n\nThe game itself is just a keyhunt. You don't do anything other than pick up keys to unlock doors to pick up other keys. Sometimes, you find yourself with the \"wong key\" and end up walking around with multiple keys, which is the most excitement you'll experience playing this. The rest of the time, you'll be reading notes written in the tiniest font known to man and listening to flat, albeit entertaining, voice acting from the cliche alcoholic investigator protag.\n\nThat about wraps it up.

First of all, there's the rather wacky \"detective\"-style monologue of our booze-happy protagonist, which while a little on the \"inappropriate\" side for a game whose primary aim should be SCARING us, is at least...er...yes, \"different\", I suppose.  Secondly, the slightly cartoon-ish graphics are...well, again, DIFFERENT!  You may be getting the impression by now that I'm not necessarily using the word \"different\" to imply \"genius\", but points to the devs for vaguely trying and all that jazz. \n\n   Then there's a lot - and I mean a LOT - of things in this which are all-too-familiar to those of us who buy every second first-person horror game that comes out.  A lack of a flashlight*, which doesn't so much add to the atmosphere, but makes searching around for keys and what-not a bit of a chore.  And did I say KEYS?  Yup, lots of THEM in this game, too.  You know you're in for a key-heavy game when you attempt to open the door to a public bathroom and are told, \"I need to find a key to open this bathroom\".  Thank fuck it isn't that hard to gain access to a public toilet in the REAL world (unless you're in France).  What else?  Well, the sound effects drop in and out and seem unfinished at best; some of the \"animations\" (e.g. our character raising his phone to answer it) are lifeless and robotic; there's oodles of doors which you not only can't unlock, but indeed can't seem to interact with any more than you could a perfectly featureless brick wall; keypad panels next to doors which are almost impossible to successfully interact with...and so on and so forth.\n\n   There's some other distinct lacks of originality which I noticed, but these are really more observations than complaints, as I generally eat this kinda thing up for breakfast in all honesty.  How about a school with weird \"overhangs\" from a hospital, such as wheelchairs with ghostly spinning wheels...sound familiar?  How about said hospital crossing over into an asylum?  Spooky little girls with black hair?  No...none of that rings any bells for you?!  Man, you really don't watch too many horror movies or play too many horror games, do you?!?\n\n   Alas, almost everything that I've stated thus far might be eminently forgiveable, if this game didn't commit perhaps the cardinal sin of any self-professed \"horror\" game...that is to say, it just ISN'T THAT SCARY.  Sure, it's a tiny bit \"spooky\", and yeah, there's a couple of very minor and faintly effective \"jump scares\" up its worn sleeves, but nothing even remotely inspired.  \n\n   I guess it goes without saying that this game isn't QUITE as good as it looks in the screenshots.  But really, what should I expect at this stage?  We should all know by now that any game whose Store page makes you go \"Fuck me, that looks fucking AWESOME!\" is probably going to fall substantially short of expectations, unless it has words like \"Outlast\" or \"Amnesia\" in the title.  I only have myself to blame, really.  I really should know better.  Oh well.  No doubt there'll be another game just like this in the Store by this time next week, and unless the price is suitably outrageous, I'll probably be a dick and buy that one too.  Sigh.   \n\n   Now, I see you're waiting anxiously for the PUNCHLINE to all I've said thus far?  C'mon...you know it already.  You've looked at the Store page.  You've heard my testimony thus far.  And you've had a glance at my playing time.  What you maybe DON'T know is that I have a tendency to pause things for short periods whilst I go off and do other (quite possibly more productive) things, like visit the toilet (the one in my flat, which I definitely don't need a key to gain access to).  So yes, sure enough...IT'S A VERY SHORT GAME.  \n\n   Now, granted, it still has a few \"episodes\" to go, and I believe I'll get these for \"free\" down the track as part of my mighty four dollar expenditure.  But unless future episodes are substantially longer, it's still going to be only a few hours in length, tops.  In all sincerity, such things affect my opinion of games very little, as long as they're high quality games for whom the short length seems more than justified given the narrative being told (see \"Among The Sleep\" for one such example).  Now, I honestly can't see the limited charms of this game improving THAT much over the course of subsequent episodes - should said episodes even appear - but I'm nothing if not over-generous, so I'm going to give it a thumb-up anyway.  A very WEAK thumb-up.  Like, say, a HALF-SEVERED thumb at best?  \n\n   ONLY BUY IF YOU'RE DESPERATE OR A HORROR COMPLETIST, LIKE MY IDIOT SELF.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. \n\nVerdict: 5/10.\n\n(* Yes, I too can see a flashlight in the screenshots and video.
