Seriously, my whole evening gone in a fascinated trance. I'm quite impressed - and my players will be as well. I was on the fence as my table-topper friends use a similar utility that's been around for a while. \nI'm glad I waited. This is the one. Revolution is way more fun. It didn't feel like work for one minute. \n I can't believe all the resources it comes with right off the bat! It even has enough variety in gaming resources for a palladium or even shadowrun (or other cyberpunk / fantasy style / post modern ) campaign. If you know that pain, get this. Hu- frickin -zzah devs.\nThere are some things that could make it more user friendly so I'll list those but hey, this is way awesome.\n\n1. One command to take a tile and make it the floor for the whole place - anything to save a few minutes, I will edit later if I wanna get fancy.\n2. Mouse-over function explanations. Yes, I want my hand held. I am not a smart man.\n3. Scroll-to-fit  or drag-to-fit object commands . It looked like there was a hard way to do this but see #2.\n4. As mentioned in other reviews, Steam Workshop support must happen asap. The amazingness that could come out the community with R:VS with even limited content sharing is obvious.\n\nYeah that's right, specifics. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to plan out a trip to a fight scene, in a unique neighborhood, in a city you've never seen, on a new planet, in a distant solar system, all in 3d, with robots and dragons. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437640421, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1437640421, "recommendationid": "17184756", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542730", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444252887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 501, "steamid": "76561197999587457", "num_games_owned": 241}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Hasn't recieved an update in over 4 months and the developers already start a new project.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1474612370, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1474612370, "recommendationid": "25646266", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528306", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462500488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 49, "steamid": "76561198124324739", "num_games_owned": 68}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": "6", "review": "It has a lot of potential, but I can't reccomend this at its current state. The optimization is terrible, having to be online in order to play isn't super cool, the map editor could do with improvements, and it could do with more key bindings. (For example: Pressing escape to either bring up options or to exit.) Regardless of its flaws, it does have a lot of assets it seems. Although the 2D models don't look too great in my opinion, the 3D ones don't look bad, even on the lowest graphical setting.\n\nI'm no game designer, so what I'm going to say next is purly from my little knowledge of how games work. I think one way it could improve preformance in the map editor is to, perhaps, ditch the mountains and water and give the player an empty space to just mess around in. I say this because frame rate skyrocketed for me once I turned off the lights, presumably because the mountains and water weren't being rendered as much at that point, but you kind of need to see in order to build stuff, and having to place lights isn't the most conventional way of doing so. And a big pluss would be not having to log in in order to play. If there is a way to do so, then awesome! I also think it could do with a way to edit and play at the same time, however that could be complicated to add.\n\nI got this game hoping to replace Tabletop Simulator so I can play D&D and not worry about smacking my dice into the characters and everything exploding, however I think I'll stick with that until this game improves a bit. I barely scraped the surface of the game, however my first impression wasn't the best. If you can put up with the flaws, then by all means get this game.

No, you can't use something like tungle, or hamachi, you have to port forward through your router. This can be an issue for some people, especially less tech savvy people, and those warry of port forwarding. I for one, am unable to even attempt due to technical issues. \n\nI don't want to out right say it, but the dev claims this is something they chose to do, rather than to have a paid server host. (would you want to? I wouldn't.) I feel that is more of an excuse to not spend money on servers. Instead, leaving it up to the players. I really would rather a refund on this game, but it's not that big of a deal, and I'm not looking for one.

You also have several themes to work with from fantasy to sci-fi to help keep things fun. The controls themselves look tiny and daunting at first, but it took me less than an hour to figure out everything I needed to do before I started having fun. \n\nThings to know about this game: Don't get it if you want to share it with your D&D group over the computer. It's a real pain in the butt to do because they don't allow it to go through any servers. When ti comes to being a host for a virtual campaign, it has a long way to go. Also, the controls aren't really set for a \"walk\" mode, meaning if you want to walk your halls and see all the awesome that is in them, you need to move slow and watch your direction. \n\nOther than that, it's an amazing tool for every DM and player to have.

It's out of EA and it has the SAME problems. The biggest two problems. Horrible camera controls and no hotkey to delete placed items. HELL, you can't even EDIT a placed item!

The \"minis\" are not 3D models like they appear to be. Character sheets are customizable but very limited. You can edit anything, but if there are not enough slots to add all the data you need to input, bummer times, you can't add in more slots. Once you do get a mini editted and made, loading it into the game is a process. You have to constantly save your character sheet manually if you have a spotty connection or you might lose progress. This may be worth it in the future, but right now, there just isn't enough here, outside of the map creation. On a positive side, the map creation is absolutely fantastic and I really have no complaints. The minis need a TON of work. Instead of it actually being a 3D model, it is just a 2D image that moves as the camera moves, and it has a shadow behind it. Cheap way to go about doing it... Once that part of the problem is fixed, this would be an awesome tool to play tabletop RPGs, but if that makes as big of a difference to you as it does to me, don't buy this yet.

It has allowed me to lay out scenarios for my friends and I to play while also allowing me to physically create worlds in order to better understand them. I've truly enjoyed my time with this virtual playspace, and I can't wait to see what the developers bring out next!\n\nI think what I love most about it is that you can create almost anything you like using their extensive set of assets and models! It allows you to create something unique each time, and therefore creates a much more exciting experience for you and your friends! Not only can you create interesting scenes, but you can also fully customize rule sets, quests, characters + monsters, items, loot spawns, purchaseable items in specific stores, and even conversation! It's fantastic because if you don't want to take the lore/rules of another RPG, or you don't necessarily know much about said lore/rules, you can simply create your own! This part of the editor is a little more tricky, and would definitely require a bit more time to learn how to use it - but from what I've seen it is pretty clear and concise about how you go about doing things.\n\n\nOverall I have really enjoyed using this virtual playspace! The only gripe I have with it is that I don't really know how multiplayer works. You need to open ports in order to host games, which is a problem for me because I am using my university wifi, and therefore don't have access to any of the information I'd need to open ports.
