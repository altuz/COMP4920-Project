Like The Witcher series, the primary conflict is really between people rather than with the monsters. It also has a very similar theme in terms of combat - a lot of investigation and legwork beforehand to set up for the actual encounter.\n\nThe protagonist is pretty realistically part of the world, i.e. somewhat of a newbie ignorant racist that means well and tries to be moral within his society's definition of morality. If you enjoyed the culture clash digressions in The Witcher, you'd probably like it here. Also seems to have the same chick magnet thing going.\n\nIt's pretty short as of now and somewhat limited in choices, but if it continues as is throughout the series, it could be pretty impressive. Note though that the prose does tend towards the purple side of the spectrum, which I find somewhat annoying.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503459604, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503459604, "recommendationid": "34429139", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504058", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505329173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 581, "steamid": "76561198057253217", "num_games_owned": 322}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's like playing chess but you need to find all your pieces before you start the game. \nIf you didn't find enough of the pieces your dead.\nIf you don't know how to use the piece your dead.\nIf you forgot the sequence on how to activate the piece, it blows up in your face and you guessed it your dead.\n\nAlso the main protagonist is a stoic masochist, interesting how I enjoy his interaction with the opposite sex.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503341383, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503341547, "recommendationid": "34400578", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
