The statement of it being a modern bullet hell style shooter is ridculous, as the slow and lack of impact gameplay will immediately turn anyone who's played a SHMUP before off. With badly written dialogue, lacking visuals, absolutely NO sound effects, and a really really silly choice of using the mouse as the only means of controlling your ship, Shmup Love Boom fails on pretty much every level. And yes, clothes do get destroyed on the protagonist, but honestly, if you're that hard up for those kind of visuals, I'd like to introduce you to the thing called the internet. I'm still attempting to figure out how the pricing of 10 dollars and full price made sense. Avoid. Run. \n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/uWTNFDc5yaw[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The character models.....are ok I guess? What you'd expect from an anime influenced game.\n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Gameplay. Slow, SHMUP like only if you put it at 25% speed. It's boring.\n[*] Restarting. Oh by the way, you know what you want to do when you're playing a visual novel/SHMUP? Start over when you lose all your lives. And have to go through the text again. Nope. \n[*] Controls. Store page says no controller support, OK Fine. But only Mouse controls that don't respond 1v1 to your movements, with a delay on them? How did this make sense?\n[*] Visuals surprising make missiles hard to see, and generally is an eye sore. \n[*] Sound. Were you expecting sound effects in a SHMUP? Silly you.\n[*] Writing. Typos. Bad dialogue. \u201cI feel tingly.\u201d I could go on.\n[*] No resolution options. Plays in a small window and that's it.\n[*] The fact that it tries to ask for 10 dollars, when games like Jigoku Kisetsukan blow it out of the water, and that game is free. \n[*] Pretty much everything.\n[/list]\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442611389, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442611389, "recommendationid": "18089785", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579339", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1461135227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561198037244210", "num_games_owned": 441}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So, this game is a space shooter with VN elements.\nIt's also shit, let me say that right away.\nThe gameplay is total arse, your ship moves like a paraplegic with a broken wheelchair and your weapons are about as powerful as a wet cough. The choosable waifu sub weapons don't really help much either\nThe selling point of the game, the story, is badly written, with spelling mistakes and poor grammar in it.\nThere are no sound effects, just the background music which isn't bad, but when it's all you hear, it really does get annoying.\nThe other thing that this game does is the lives system. When you die, your chosen waifu loses a bit of clothing, nothing too risque, they just end up in their underwear by the last life.\nSadly, even this was ultimately disappointing and could not redeem the game.\n\nOverall, I would give this a 2/10, playable but not for long.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461135779, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1461135779, "recommendationid": "22529291", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501040", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
