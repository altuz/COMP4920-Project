It's got classic side-scrolling shoot-em-up action, at its core.  Between missions, your ship levels up skills and buys upgrades.  After you finish levels (planets), you gain access to a city placement resource-gathering tool.  It doesn't work flawlessly; it works often enough you forgive it for the few shortcomings you encounter.\n\nIn my Dariusburst review, I criticized that game's failure to mix MMO and shmup compellingly.  Steel Rain, on the other hand, does it well.  Quests and planetary sieges provide randomized fleets to take out and earn extra money.  Each mission attempt, not just mission, is unique: some enemies spawn at different times, in different numbers, from different locations.  The action could've quickly gotten stale, but Steel Rain's gameplay lubricates the long-term experience as you grind into late game.  It makes grinding feel like less of a tiresome chore, thanks to ten difficulty settings.\n\nGetting to the late game is where the city-building and research trees come into play.  As you develop your acquired planets, your income shoots up and you unlock helpful research upgrades.  Most of the upgrades I found inapplicable to my style of play, a roadblock to get the stuff I actually wanted (T2/T3 Drones, Steel Citadels).  Switching Research production to Production ...uh, production is an option once you've fully researched all tech.\n\nThe menus are plain, and just effective enough to not totally piss you off.  The music, sound effects, and some of the visuals are forgettable and underwhelming.  These are minor qualms, however, compared to the rest of the game.\n\nSteel Rain is a shmup whose innovative idea is numbers.  You don't grind high scores exactly; you don't need to, really.  You grind your ship's level and credit amount to astronomical (no pun intended) heights.  You rebuild human civilization one new planet at a time.  You upgrade your ship into a catastrophic one-man army, mission by mission, quest by quest, skill by skill.  It's a slower, RPG-like progression that fits well enough for a recommendation.  Steel Rain could use improvement via a sequel, but the foundation laid here is solid.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501131071, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501131071, "recommendationid": "33824339", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 18, "total_reviews": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
