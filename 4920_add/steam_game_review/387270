Mystical was a bit awkward for new players upon release, but the dev has made it much more fun! \n\nMystical is a fun, well presented and unique matching game were you have to match trios of items of different colours and pairs of items of the same colour. Each item you pick costs a coin, so it's important that you have a stash. The number of coins you can earn has been increased making the earlier levels much more fun than now than when the game was launched.\n\nThe only issue that I find now is that the English explanation of the rules is a little difficult to understand as the dev's native language is French, however it doesn't take too much effort to work out how to play. I may offer to help improve these though as it would be nice to see more people playing Mystical!\n\nIn summary, I will definitely be playing Mystical more now and say that's worth picking up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441220813, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441830222, "recommendationid": "17851357", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519144", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454861084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561197984269843", "num_games_owned": 670}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A unique game of matching, kind of a mix between Concentration and Tetris.  If it weren't by French developers it would be awesome!\n\nVarious tiles drop from the top of the screen and your job is to match them.  There are different objects in the tiles -- books, shoes, pants, scrolls -- and different colors of the different objects -- red, blue, and green colored books, for example.\n\nYou need to collect pairs and trios within each family.  For example, two red books make a pair, or a trio in the book family would be one of each color (red, blue, and yellow, for example).\n\nAdded to this is a time limit, which ticks down faster than you realize.\n\nAlso, you have to manage resources -- you have to make sure you have enough magnifying glasses or you won't be able to collect pairs or trios.  Collect coins for your final score.\n\nEach level becomes more difficult, collecting more pairs and trios as the game adds more objects -- bags, hats, flowers, envelopes.  And each time that clock keeps ticking down.\n\nAs you progress into the different chapters of the game, another wrinkle is added -- for example, you have to knock gears off the background of the playing area.\n\nIt's a pretty simple game but is addictive.  It's hard for me to play this time of game for a great amount of time as it gets my heart racing trying to match everything.  I'm not sure if I'll ever be incredibly good at this type of game -- it requires a lot of visual-spatial reasoning and planning.  But I do enjoy the game and even though I'll never be a superstar.\n\nWell worth the money and time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454861678, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454861678, "recommendationid": "21028981", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516044", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504132306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1912, "steamid": "76561198040536336", "num_games_owned": 324}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": " Not a bad game, takes sometime to figure out what you have to do though,\n But once you know what your doing, its not bad at all.\n\n\n8/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449743472, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449743472, "recommendationid": "19598047", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505837", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471871663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2107, "steamid": "76561197995447075", "num_games_owned": 166}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great puzzle-game with different elements so it doesnt get boring too quick.
