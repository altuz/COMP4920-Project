It's a shame that thus far only his latest is on Steam, many having started on XBLIG and a few (notably JoyJoy) making their way to tablet and mobile.\n\nBut damned if he didn't further refine the pure fun and pressure of the original Inferno.  The experience isn't simplified, but rather distilled: four guns, each the right tool for specific situations, four missiles, each likewise unique and providing more oomph at the cost of limited ammo (there's plenty to be found, but you still need to be careful not to shoot yourself dry in the middle of a firefight), and four triggerable powers suiting different playstyles.  You can focus your powerups on the missiles and guns you enjoy most, and the specific boosts can be chosen in any order (for example, one of the guns may have more damage, faster shots, or a stunning effect... rather than being arranged in a tree, you can pick which to get first, with the knowledge that the cost of getting a second, then the third is going to increase afterwards.)\n\nPersonally, I'd love to see more of his games arrive here, though for now I can at least strongly recommend this one.

I cannot recommend it enough!\n\nI liked the twin stick control+shooting interface of [i]Inferno 2.[/i] It's similar to [i]Inferno[/i], with each level consisting of a maze to traverse while avoiding baddies trying to kill you before you kill them. As in the prequel, some walls are invisible and lead to more enemies and/or caches of upgrades and weapons or ammunition. Levels contain keys (they look like keys, so they're easy to know what they are, although they might be more difficult to find. Passing your craft over a key (or anything else) will collect it or activate it if it's a switch. Enemy bullets will damage your craft\u2014\"you\"\u2014or (hopefully only) your shield. Shockwaves from explosions will push you backward and possibly have other repercussions.\n\nHover over circles with an [b]i[/b] in the center to display windows containing [b]i[/b]nstructional [b]i[/b]nformation that will explain the game's mechanics as you progress through the levels. The [b]i[/b]nstructions are available more frequently on the earlier levels of the game to help ease you into the mechanics of the gameplay gradually and whenever you encounter a new type of level or upgrade or new mechanic so\u2014as long as you read these tutorials and hints\u2014you'll never encounter anything you haven't either learned about via an [b]i[/b]nfo circle or been given a suggestion regarding a method to bypass. e.g.  [spoiler]an [b]i[/b]nfo circle has just notified you for the first time in the game that walls can sometimes be fake and passed through. What do you think that might indicate about your immediate surroundings? ;-)[/spoiler]\n\nYour primary object in most levels is to reach the final circle (though not all levels are this way\u2014some are bonus levels reached via a \"bonus exit\" from the previous level where you grab whatever bonuses you can before running out of time or exiting, or survival levels where your only goal is surviving until the counter reaches 0, for example), tasks made more difficult by the various obstacles in the level, disappearing and reappearing \"doors\", disappearing walls which can release hordes of enemies after you collect a specific item or pass over a switch or another, flowing arrows which move in one direction and act like a breeze of some sort, hastening your (and enemies') movement when you're moving in the same direction or reducing/stopping movement if you try to move in the opposite direction. Levels usually contain multiple locked walls/doors (one reason purchasing extra keys at a Store can be very helpful!). If you have a key, touching the locked door will remove the door and can also make walls in other parts of the level (behind which enemies might have been spawning the whole time you've been navigating the level. The easy levels place a key, followed by a door, behind which you'll find another key and another door, etc., until you reach the end. Some aren't so straightforward and you might find yourself searching for fake walls and keys after having used all your keys before requiring one more to access the only exit. Usually sticking around to eliminate as many enemies as possible is beneficial for the bonuses and XP they give you, but exiting sooner might be more helpful depending on the status of your provisions.\n\nGaining XP and/or (?) points will have you levelling up from time to time, at which time you'll be given upgrade points. You can pause the game at any time to unlock and upgrade attributes (damage, shot speed, shields, multi-tiered bonus modes, etc., and choose between bonus modes you've unlocked. Bonus modes will run for a specific time after activation, doing things such as giving you extra damage or slowing time as long as the bonus bar is reducing. When it reaches empty, the bonus effect will end and the bonus bar will recharge (faster bonus recharge speed is one of the many upgrades you can obtain with your level-up points)\n\nA tutorial integrated nearly-seamlessly into the gameplay of a game is always good nowadays when games are delivered primarily digitally and people typically start games without reading a manual, even when a [b]PDF manual[/b] exists as a direct link on the game's Steam Store page or when right-clicking the game in the Library view. (Often those reviews explain in detail everything the writers of the game's negative reviews complain about not knowing anything about... but I digress. I haven't even checked for a manual [i](YET)[/i] for [i]Inferno 2.[/i]\n\nI haven't made it there yet, but the [b]New Game+[/b] mode should provide me with even more fun after I complete the campaign mode of the game or do whatever is required to unlock it.\n\n-------------\n\n[list]\n  [*]I think [i]Inferno 2[/i] is the first game by Radian/RadianGames to have been released on Steam. I was very excited when I saw it because I didn't even know it was in development!\n  [*]If you're unfamiliar with [i]Inferno[/i] or any of the previously-developed games by this developer, I recommend them wholeheartedly. I purchased them all on D****a and hope they will all someday be available here on Steam now that *esur* has departed the land of game sales viability (as of the time of this review, at least).\n  [*] It's possible that bugs exist in this version of this game; the developer was developing for mobile platforms for a while inbetween the games on Desura and this one on Steam... sigh.\n[/list]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456380259, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1474361155, "recommendationid": "21438812", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495768", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442746198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 946, "steamid": "76561197968493816", "num_games_owned": 132}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game has a lot of great things going for it, like consistent design, zero slowdown even under the craziest projectile load, and some seriously excellent sound.  The mazes are large and simplistic, and no level takes any real amount of problem solving to complete.  The neat tricks on offer - secret destroyable or passable walls, bonus exits etc - are used sparingly enough that the core gameplay is always front and centre.  It never feels like a weak game behind obscured by distracting tricks.  It is, I have to say, a real heap of fun, except...\n\nIt's too easy.  Powerups are generously awarded, not so fast that you fill all the gauges in a hurry, but fast enough that by level 20 most stages have become a cakewalk (and I'm playing on hard).  Even as new, bigger baddies are introduced (ooh, this vector circle's a different shade of purple, what does it do oh it's dead already) they're killed just as quickly.  It doesn't take more than the least amount of effort to keep from dying.  Boss fights are rare but never take two tries.  I'm 50 stages in (out of 80) and I've had to restart a stage maybe ten times, mostly in the first 20 levels.  I play a few rounds a few times a day but usually stop because it's just not exciting enough to keep going.  \n\nI wish I could wholeheartedly recommend this game, but it's got some issues.  I sympathize with the developer who has said it's not been anything approaching remotely profitable, and I suspect as a result the game's bugs will never be fixed.  Some powerup options cannot be selected, or sometimes they can depending on whether the game gifts one to you or if you earn it with experience points.  And sometimes not even then.  The game is always in-focus even if it's behind another application, so that it's always making noises as if you're hovering over a menu option.  It doesn't detect my gamepad, while every other game does.\n\nIf it were harder, if there were fewer enemies that were harder to kill, perhaps it wouldn't feel so inevitable that I'll beat it without dying 20 times.
