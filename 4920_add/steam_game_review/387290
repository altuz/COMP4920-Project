This review applies to the original version as well, but you should purchase this one if you're looking to buy, it includes that version as well.\n\nPROS: \n+ Great Platformer\n+ Excellent Mechanics, leaving the challenge of the game up to user skill.\n+ One of the best soundtracks you will ever hear.\n+ Especially for the price, a fair amount of content that will keep you busy as you find every secret there is to be had.\n+ Outstanding world design, with seamless transitions between very distinct and unique \"levels.\" The levels are designed to make you use every power in your arsenal as you acquire them.\n+ Phenomenal story. Although in this game it isn't exactly needed, the story is well worth the price alone.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n+- The ONLY one there is, and it is minor: a good portion of the secrets require a fair amount of backtracking to previous \"levels.\" However, you will have to use powers you didn't additionally have, thus making the revisit a new-ish experience.\n\nCONS:\n-None\n\nDefinitive Edition Differences:\nWhile the graphics remain the same, as they should, the definitive edition does offer a few new things over the original version.\n1. New powers not seen in the original game.\n2. Some levels are changed very minorly to accommodate usage of these new powers, which is a good thing.
