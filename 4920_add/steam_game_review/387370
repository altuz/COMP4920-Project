So based on that time I have played this game I find it to be very fun and challenging. Although there are still some minor bugs which may need you to click and reposition your units..... The challenges set are very challenging enough to help keep the interesting as you may not do them all in one gameplay. I would say this game would provide around 100hours of fun.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507023822, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507023822, "recommendationid": "35440757", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504975139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 2653, "steamid": "76561198124394677", "num_games_owned": 87}, "votes_funny": 13, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I make the Best Colonies. \nTremendous.
