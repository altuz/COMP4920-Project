But in a good way.\nSound: No music as far as I heard. Just monster and people voices.\nGraphics: *Please refer to Gameplay for this answer*\nReplayability: Seems ok and could be a potential time waster\n\nI do have a couple of small cons with this game.\n\n1: You have to manually reload every squad member or equipment you get. Wish there was a squad member or equipment for that since theres 2 for squad health and equipment health.\n2: Wondering what the people who made the description thought when saying \"Many different weapons\". Theres 4 guns and a knife. Maybe \"Several different weapons\" would have made more sense but \"Many\" is overselling it.\n\nOverall its not bad... but not extremely good either. It kinda meets on the center of the teeter-totter if you take my meaning. I mean give it a try and see what happens really. Least its cheap. Have a good day fellow gamers.
