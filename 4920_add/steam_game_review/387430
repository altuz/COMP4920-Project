This is quite an interesting simulation where you set trends for the populations in a cluster of star systems. I would personally have preferred that your actions were even more subtle and long-term oriented, instead of being somewhere in the middle. Overall, I think it's a good game that I do recommend if you are looking for a strategy simulation. It feels very much like an indie game, and it is a bit rough around the edges, but I've enjoyed it so far.\n\nWhat could have been better:\n- The UI. This is the biggest problem I have with the game. No hotkeys, no way to scroll between planets/systems, no filtering system to find your industrial districts and so on. There's a lot of clicks in just one territory, and a lot of searching for that district that had X.\n- Combat. They way it is, I'd actually prefer a full simulation. The way it works now, you need to have ~4:1 advantage to be fairly certain you'll win, and a ~6:1 advantage to be fairly certain to not suffer any casualties. And you can do it manually, which lets you set up your forces and see them scatter and die alone. Really, there is no point at all in watching (you can't do anything once combat starts) the battles except ensuring higher casualties.\n- Grinding-based level system. In order to get a territory really nice, you need to grind territories until you have high level in a series of skills. I would personally very much prefer that each territory took longer time to finish and be rid of the grinding system.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499861373, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499861373, "recommendationid": "33478021", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505537615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 550, "steamid": "76561198121203990", "num_games_owned": 665}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "good", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500430216, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500430216, "recommendationid": "33642384", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490784", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 19, "total_reviews": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
