This time, the player is tossed into the terrifying world of PowerPoint 2013. The gameplay, format, and pacing remains true to its predecessors, so veterans will feel right at home, and newcomers will have no problem quickly getting in on the action!\n\nWhen this brilliant choose-your-own-adventure style game begins, you'll find yourself face-to-face with some crucial options that will affect the final conclusion of the game in a creative and profound way. You'll be faced with the daunting and sometimes intimidating task of selecting your path from choices such as the \"Main Menu\", \"How to Use This Course\", \"Legal Notes\", \"Index\", and \"Glossary\".\n\nThe \"Main Menu\" options start you down the main storyline of the game, while the remaining options serve as tutorials and preparation for the horrors ahead. Throughout the main game you'll be greeted, taunted, and even chastised often by the booming voice of God himself, as he leads you through the main story, testing you and timing you as you complete the critical tasks necessary to escape from the dark and twisted world of PowerPoint 2013. Only those who can endure this pain and push through to the end will be granted their freedom, and subsequently the satisfaction of having completed one of the top psychologically jaunting experiences available on any modern gaming platform.\n\nWill you be victorious? Or will you fall victim to the greatest evil?\n\nIt's highly recommended that you play this late at night, in the dark, and with your headphones cranked for the best experience.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438115417, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438115417, "recommendationid": "17271656", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534757", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1474685272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 317, "steamid": "76561198156639632", "num_games_owned": 34}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nice software for basic learner!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1476226965, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1476226965, "recommendationid": "25989817", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501241", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
