It seems to be about the same size as one would expect from a flash game, and has about the same animation(Very poor explosions). A price of 10 euro is then very, very steep for what you get.\n\nCoupled with the simple gameplay comes a few issues. The resolution is tiny(The steam preview pictures? That's almost full size, almost.), full screen mode will stretch everything if you're on a widescreen monitor, and your area of operations is tiny to the point where you can not even see the aircraft before they're starting their landing on some of the maps.\n\nTo say it's an amusing way to spend a few hours is correct if you're a fan of the game and have absolutely nothing better to do. But to call it a full game and worthy of 10 euro? Not even close. If steam had a rating lower than 'no', this would be the one to get it since it's definitely not worth the price. But if you can pick it up really cheaply it is probably an idea to give it a shot.\nMaybe at a 95% sale or something similar, but if it's for anything more than one euro you should avoid it like the plague", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437965821, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437995160, "recommendationid": "17245084", "language": "english", "votes_down": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569613", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441403334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 159, "steamid": "76561198069391991", "num_games_owned": 182}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A few ATC prep books actually reccommend that you play this game for practice!

APM4 focuses on challenges more than just diversifying the airports, but there are some interesting ones like like Area 51 and a Carrier battle group.\n\nTo add some flavour to it all, a chopper can drop by to fill up on juice, and there can be a snowstorm, which turns the ground white which does not help with the white aircraft you are trying to guide. APM4 fortunately also have hotkeys for quickly assigning speeds to aircrafts instead of you having to click em, and you can simply drag airplanes to whatever runway you want it to land on.\n\nOh and emergencies and weather can be turned off and you can manually adjust how much trafic you want using a slider.
