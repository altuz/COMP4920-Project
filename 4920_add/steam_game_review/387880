But soon enough I started running in levels that had very tight timing requirements to navigate successfully. There are only so many times you can die, spawn back at beginning while hearing the same notes being looped over and over again. The envinroments felt like they switched up on the player a little more than the original ninjahtic but the variation was just a recolor with another short music sample most often. The foes sprites were not very well animated and some of them only looked like amorphous blobs and were not very convincing. The chtulu style monster presence was not really well explained and the game felt rather contrived. All in all this is mostly exactly like any other games from this dev in this engine, has the same strong points and weaknesses and I come to the same conclusion that it just is not a good investment of time for the average player that has built a decent library.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497427638, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505087047, "recommendationid": "32405707", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496359", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 6}}
