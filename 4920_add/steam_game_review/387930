That being said, many people may find the game's overall slow pace combined with the very grating effects as too much to handle and not enjoy the experience at all. \n\nWhat audio is present in the game is very well done and immersive with eerie, subtle sounds from your surroundings emanating as you slowly creep through the environments. Though a personal preference, I'm glad the player character remains silent, with no repetitive \"breathing / startled\" sound effects or narration affecting how immersed you become. There is very little voice acting in the game aside from the occasional scream, lurch, or moan from NPCs during the gameplay or cutscenes, leaving much of the cutscenes and characters up to the player's interpretation, for better or for worse. \n\nThe game often presents macabre, surreal situations to the player including torsos popping out of bloody beds or cult members shuffling along distant bridges while carrying torches. The game does a good job of making you dread what you will see or run into around corners, but is less reliant on jump-scares than other horror titles. The game (thus far) has instead opted for a slower, more sinister feeling as you explore its dark corridors. \n\nThe game is very limited in its options and the save system seems checkpoint-based, with no user determination of when it saves (or where it loads) other than a vague \"continue\" option at the start. Also, the heavy video effect is either set to on or off, with the off option looking quite bland. The character models during cutscenes also clearly show their limited complexity, with textures and model complexity resembling more of a PS2 era level of detail. Its hard not to find some of the cutscenes as comical when the models of the characters are so simplistic, such as one where a character's bones and joints are popping out of place but the model looks more like a doll than anything super realistic. \n \nWhile this game's pace, effects, and somewhat simplistic / vague cutscenes may turn off many players, I am enjoying the experience and think it's a good game in the Horror / Walking Simulator genres.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502943565, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502943827, "recommendationid": "34299713", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501825071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198198786679", "num_games_owned": 115}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Doesn't seem like a game.
