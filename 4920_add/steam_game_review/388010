It's a short game, but it's fun once you get the hang of it.  A couple of stages were gimmies.  It was almost like they were trying to fake you out, but still quite fun.\n\nThere were a couple of minor bugs that I noticed - I forget the stage, but one of the orbs wasn't lit and it passed me anyway.  There was also a stage where I used all the orbs, but it wouldn't fail me right away.  I hit 'r' to retry and that got it reset.\n\nOverall, worth the cash and doubly so if we could get some more game modes or more stages.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440396651, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440396651, "recommendationid": "17688944", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510082", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448767743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561198116419206", "num_games_owned": 188}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It doens't work at all, so many bugs.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468113878, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468113878, "recommendationid": "24220743", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501197", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439023541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 39, "steamid": "76561198211186531", "num_games_owned": 1}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Been playing the game more, up to Stage 27 but cant do it ;X\n\nIts really good game, different than other puzzle games, well worth $3!\n\nTo the developer, i notcied a few things\n\n1) Sounds bugged out at the beggining of some levels\n2) My retries seem to not display after 100ish", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438956850, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1439023571, "recommendationid": "17429365", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499301", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439572491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 52, "steamid": "76561198173496986", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "3", "review": "The main screne is fixed now im happy :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439140609, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1439220565, "recommendationid": "17460327", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486272", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
