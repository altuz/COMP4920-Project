They didn't lie. How am I supposed to unlock the achievements (get 3 stars on each level) when I can't even pass level 2 ?!! Believe me, I tried. \n\nProblem is, to get the stars, you have to complete the level as fast as possible AND with a minimum of moves. Simply impossible (read \"cons\" here).\n\nAt first, I liked the colors and the \"minimalism\" of the game's design (read \"pros\" here). So, tried it. But having little patience, I can't go on. I won't finish it. It is way too hard for me. So, sorry for the negative review, but I can't give a positive one either.\nI'm idling for the trading cards -because after all, I bought the game- but that will be all.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496378665, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496378665, "recommendationid": "32121621", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519022", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5}}
