It it not story driven at all and is more like the original Escapists in the sense that hi must escape different locations.\n\nAlso random lines everywhere, [spoiler] like on Hershel's farm, Rick saying lines that are taken from the comic, but not until the Govoner does, soo [/spoiler] \n\nBut yes get it if you like the first game, TWD comics and if it's on sale, also if you want a good experience, The Escapists, but both are good.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501474482, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501618889, "recommendationid": "33919966", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519527", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471048830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 434, "steamid": "76561198247796530", "num_games_owned": 51}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I would highly reccomend you spend your money on another game or product, as this isn't worth the full price.
