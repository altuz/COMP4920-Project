Project Druid - 2D Labyrinth Explorer may be one of the cheapest and worst games ever.\n\nFirst of all, they throw you into the game with absolutely no directions on what to do, including the keys. Everything else is just random ghosts spawning and trying to block you. I could have designed this game myself in a relatively short period of time on GamerMaker Studio. There was little to no effort put into this game.\n\nOverall, bad boring and cheap game.\n\nRating: 1.4/10\nRecommend Price: $0.00 Don't even bother getting this game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493702311, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493702311, "recommendationid": "31500335", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524971", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493238345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1973, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 4956}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Tags: Casual - Puzzle - Maze Related\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from library\n\nTLDR: RPGMaker Bundle Filler Trash\n\nThis game is bad in a different way, it feels like whoever made this didnt have the stomach to deal with the fact that they were incompetent, and rather than try and fail, decided to make an obnoxious game on purpose just for the purpose of bundle sales and trading cards.
