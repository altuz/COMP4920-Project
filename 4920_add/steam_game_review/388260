I must say it's great fun and varied enough to keep you interested for many hours. Fitting visuals, great soundtrack and a good sense of humor! \n\nSome minor issues with the goalee and friendly AI can be forgiven, especially when playing with a group of four.\n\nNot too sure about the price point and the lack of measurable sales though, especially on PC. Still hoping for a Switch release where this kind of game would shine, due to nostalgic nintendo fans, a coop-friendly environment and the current lack of competitors!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504089055, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504089451, "recommendationid": "34603717", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
