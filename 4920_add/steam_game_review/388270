The 99 was awsome, the 05 version was pretty similar but ok.\nWhen i opened the 2015 version, i had to check if i havent started my 2005 one.\n\nIf you take out the 1, the expansion draft team, (that featured is pretty nice. You can take any expansion team and do the drafting if you want to) and the database for season 2006 to 2015, well its almost the exact same game.\nSame UI, same good for 99 A.I but way to weak for a 2015 game. Very limited managing options.\nBasically i paid for an update roster of my 2005 version. Yep feel pretty dumb for it.. Even worst if youre\nlike me and loving to play oldies team. Meaning that update roster from 06 to 15 really means nothing.\n\nIf you want an easy to beat and learn baseball sim for cheap this is for you.\nIf you want something more serious do yourself a favor, spend a few more bucks and go get\nthe last or next to last OOTP. I only have the 2011 of OOTP but its still a much, much better sim than this last Mogul.\n\nOne day i'll learn to do some research before i jump on a title even at 60% off.. :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438136899, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438136899, "recommendationid": "17275615", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577506", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505614981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1321, "steamid": "76561198333832297", "num_games_owned": 15}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Awesome Game!

Get myself one of the top 5 pitchers in the league, Spend way more focus getting good itching together than anything else. Two years into the franchise and my team is the same as it was year 1.  As long as i dont sit and watch the computer play the game out i have a chance to win.  If i do watch, my top pitcher is guaranteed to give up several runs in the first two innings, 90-95% of the time its a home run, gives up ground balls 68% of the time.  You can set a watch to it its so consistant.  Its a 95% chance that the other team will score multiple runs in the first 3 innings regardless of wh is batting or pitching.  I was really hoping for a game that would reflect the abilities of the players on the team but it does not appear to be the case.  I can have the best team in the league and if i take them over and just watch the game, they will at best end up 500 for the season.  There are a million adventure games out there that i can play if my goal is to end up pissed off  and frustrated.
