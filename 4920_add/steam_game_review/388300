You are forced to survive in a uncharted location, infected by ravenous mutated creatures. The games issues overwhelm the things that actually work.\n\nThe game has a basic level tree system, its a good feature and it adds a sense of progression and gives a purpose to killing monsters and animals. Aside from that it is your basic survival game, accept it feels unfinished and sloppy. There are numerous minor but important details that are missing from the gameplay and without thoes details it puts it below other survival games. \n\nThe only way I could reccomend this game is if they add more of content and polish the hell out of it. The base of the game is there, exept alot of needed features and tweeks are not. Even if this game was on sale you could probably get another survival game that's better, for the same price or a little more. Before closing I would like to point out that the developers are kind people. When I bought the game there was a probelm with the servers and they contacted me personally to resolve it. They seem like they care for their game and they want to see it thrive. \n\nI would suggest you to stay away from this game untill they give it the attention it needs, if they ever do.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438034952, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1471061732, "recommendationid": "17256737", "language": "english", "votes_down": 56, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586550", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441469696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 34, "steamid": "76561198200515330", "num_games_owned": 6}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "OK this game will pass as a free to play on game jam or something but asking for almoust 9 CAD for this game is insane! this is a mix between dayz mine craft and rust but has no point at all! -small map -horrible graphics -buggy im just to tiered to go threw everything but in a survival game that gives you everything u need to survive at the start is not gonna be fun to play! look they have a hunger system well thats not a problem because the whole small space is filled with animals! those weird half human things take like 10 shotgun hit directly in them to kill and just plain out stupid! the speech at the start tells you that someone knows where u are does not bother to help you! \n\nFinal Word is that this game makes no sence you might as well spend a bit more money on minecraft dayz, rust and you will bet a much more enjoyable expirience out off it :)  \n\n(if this game goes free to play then it will be much better :))", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440196962, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441425258, "recommendationid": "17651793", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516066", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438040186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198110329686", "num_games_owned": 197}, "votes_funny": 24, "votes_up": 40, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Definitly not ready to be released, needs allot more work and polishing.
