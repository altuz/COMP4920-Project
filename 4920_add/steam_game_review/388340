Unity Engine. Does not fullscreen correctly. Barely any animation at all. Unfinished protag sprites. Level design is just a bunch of unity engine rectangles that are color coded as platforms or death. Controls are imprecise amateur and floaty. Comes across as a tech demo of someone who just finished a tutorial on gamebuilding. Game shamelessly puts in a bunch of royalty free classical music.

The contols are awful, and the physics don't work. Many a time, I've landed a jump to be mysteriously pushed off the ledge by some invisible force. In a way, it's a perfect metaphor for how this game pushes away my will to live. It might be tolerable in short spans of time, but the game freezes whenever you try the \"load\" option from the main menu, so saving and continuing isn't an option. The low quality, public domain, classical music taunts you all the while.
