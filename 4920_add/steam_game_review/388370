Other players have reported this also occurs when attempting to start a normal game.\n[*] The way the AI plays cards is unfair due to the simultaneous play mechanic; the AI has a tendency to play wait several moments into a turn's main phase, then play all their cards at once, making it very difficult for human players to read and respond to any individual action taken by the AI, which also causes problems because of the short timer.\n[*] The Initiative system determines who attacks first during combat, and is governed by who played a card or activated an ability last; unfortunately, this does not work well with the way AI plays its cards all at once, because the player either plays all their cards early and end up being unable to respond to anything the AI does in order to keep initiative, or the player waits for the player waits for the AI to play all their cards and loses initiative every time.\n[*] Individuals have to decide which enemy to block before attackers are known, another problem of the simultaneous turn system.\n[*] Draft system costs a investment of in-game currency or real money, but (A) it's dead and you can't play against AI, and (B) you don't keep the cards you draft.\n[/olist]\n\nBasically, you could say a huge problem of the game is its conceit that a simultaneous turn system is a good thing, when, as implemented, it's a huge hindrance. Ultimately, the central conceit of the game is either poorly implemented, or just a bad idea in the first place.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485724104, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1485724104, "recommendationid": "29573311", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501181", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486245550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1353, "steamid": "76561198080078228", "num_games_owned": 1508}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "It's a dead game.
