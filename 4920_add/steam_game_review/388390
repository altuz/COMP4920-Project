But unless you are already really, really good at pool you may end up as dissapointed as I am. Yes, the game is fun and colorful, but it is VERY hard. It took all my skills (harhar!) to get past the second level with my near-zero pool experience.  (Offline. I really did try. I hoped my enjoyment of math puzzles might be enough...foolishly, it seems.)\n\nIn truth, even losing is fun. But since all it takes to lose all progress on a level is one poor shot, fun quickly gives way to frustration as you repeatedly go back to zero. This game would be SO much more fun (and more commercially successful, possibly) if there was an \"easy\" or\"beginner\" level where any shot could be undone (much like Radium does, where even failure requires instructions to proceed.) Any chance, DEVs? It would be SO MUCH more fun, not to mention accessible!\n\nA feature I really liked, that I'd like to see in every game, is the means to change the music at the press of a button. KUDOS!! (This makes what is already really nice music even better!)\n\nThe fault is not that of the game or the DEVs (though they might have been more expressive about the degree of difficulty) and I won't give up for good. Therefore, I will recommend the game....IF you are a pool shark already. Who knows, perhaps I can cheat with YouTube, and get past level 3.\n\nThank you. (DEVs - Please consider the \"undo\" feature for people who are more puzzle than pool.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438042281, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438044798, "recommendationid": "17258137", "language": "english", "votes_down": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500493", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
