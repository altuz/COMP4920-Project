This is what you want from a franchise!\n\n[b] Story - [/b] Darksiders II follows the story of DS. While the DS story was really good, there were lot of questions and DSII answers lot of them. The story follows the oldest brother of the four horsemen, [b] Death [/b]. And i must say that they gave us the story as best as possible. It's much more better than the first one IMO. It's not just huge, it's huge enjoyable story.\n\n[b] Gameplay - [/b] They completely changed it to RPG style. Your usual primary and secondary weapon combo but in Darksiders way. The fighting style is different than most other games. You can build your own way with abilites and stacking with different kind of armor. Typical RPG element. Then there's few different abilites to have more fun while fighting hordes of undead/monsters. Just like War, Death has his unleashed form as well. In Reaper form death is literally immortal. Tho it's almost same as wars demon form. \n\n[b] Graphics - [/b] It looks beautiful. The visuals are great in the Deathinitive edition. Of course not as good as recent game but still pretty good!\n\n[b] Optimization - [/b] Average optimization, not that good. No crashes tho!\n\n[b] Controls - [/b] Controls are easy to access and won't eat your mind unlike some other RPG out there.\n\n[b] World Design - [/b] Incredible! The different places with different enviroment and the puzzles just makes it helluva fun. This is a game where i actually enjoy the puzzles and there's alot of them.\n\n[h1] Overall - 8/10 [/h1] [b] This is Darksiders II but with better visuals. Problem is that with better visual it's optimized badly. But after all it did so many thigns good that you would forget about the optimization. If you enjoyed DS then you should definitely go for this. It's your good ol DS2 and i would definitely recommend this!

But unfortunately I would not recommend getting this game for PC since it is somehow broken. I was playing the game for about 9 hours already and there is no problem, then my screen froze, I can't type anything or even alt tab the game. I force shutdown the pc and then when I opened the game I saw my save file saying data is corrupted. My 9 hours of playing this game was a waste of time since my save file was erased. When I checked on the internet I read that a lot of people are complaining about the same problem and lots more.\n\nI regret buying this game on PC just because it was on sale.
