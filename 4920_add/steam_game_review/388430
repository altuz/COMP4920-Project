However, I am somewhat mixed on it.\n\nEven on 1v1 in \"Normal\" mode, the computer AI is very good and knows where you are straight away, which does make it somewhat frustrating (and not in a funny or a good way), and then reduces the dynamic to a battle of \"who can fire faster and has a better gun\".  The element of surprise or hiding seemed to be completely lost, it was like the AI had X-Ray vision and was able to find ridiculous angles through the holes in the covering walls every time.\n\nVersus a human player, I would expect very different results and a more balanced match.\n\nSome information on what the controls are would have been nice, maybe a tutorial as to how to aim the gun (red crosshair vs green crosshair ?!), distance to fire vs damage and reload speed etc. and how gun dynamics can affect a battle (as per my point above...a gun with a slower reload that does more damage can be offset versus a smaller gun that reloads faster, meaning that 'anyone can win' if they are skilful enough, it doesn't degenerate into a one sided match versus the AI).  Also, basic information on whether or not 'real life' applies, as in, a tank's armour is traditionally less at the rear, so does that apply here ?  Like Kelly's Heroes...\"If you're gonna shoot a Tiger Tank, aim at it's @55\"\n\nGood concept, but it needs some work on it, I'd like to see some refinement / add ons, e.g. a faster tank or ways to increase speed, different camera angles (first person etc.).  I'm going to try it again versus as many PC opponents as I can, hopefully I might even have some bots to help me on my side if I do that.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501245888, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501245888, "recommendationid": "33854883", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510814", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504530795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 537, "steamid": "76561197972499605", "num_games_owned": 104}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I forced myself to wait after I had played a bit longer before reviewing it.\n\nBasically, this game is a lot of fun. There isn't a ton of depth to it, wrt loadouts. There is a bit of variety, but where it really shines is the battles themselves. They are a lot of fun. The game has you with very little downtime, and being broke from losing something expensive doesn't mean that you can't compete for a few rounds.\n\nI highly recommend this game. It is very much an indie game and that isn't a bad thing. It's ui is super minimalistic, but everything you need is there.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502516932, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502516932, "recommendationid": "34184287", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 23, "total_reviews": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
