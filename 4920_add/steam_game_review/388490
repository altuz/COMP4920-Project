Tried game today. Regret my decision\n\nYou get a bit of fluff text, followed by a simple dialogue tree with basic options. No matter what option you pick, you get asked by the game to input a number between 1 and 14. Somehow that value is fed into the script and can determine what next script fires, and thus how you die. Creates a lot of variety, which is a selling point. But you can also wind up running into the same deaths because the same number pops up in the equation even if the sequence of events you took leads you elsewhere. The game is nonsensical really, and has a randomly generated feel to it at times. Such as dying from molotov cocktail in the face after skipping breakfast and getting out the door. Dying of cannibalism... It just is too loosely connected to feel like choice&consequence. I did not encounter bugs or typos and the engine and interfaces were clean. There very little audio to speak of at all. The trial and error nature of the game would mean you would need to take pen and paper and map out the dialogue tree or rely on memory and always repeat the same path and the same RNG values for the equations to ensure constant progression which sounds very laborious.
