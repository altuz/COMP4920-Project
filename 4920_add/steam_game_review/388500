Each level can be completed in under 30 seconds without much of a problem at all, just spamming the spacebar.\nGot to level 20 and got a game over so not sure if it was the ending or what but it seems to be the cap.\nAll the achievements I got were increadibly stupid to get.\nDidn't use any of the junk at the bottom. Seemed to waste more time to use them then to just shoot the aliens.\nI wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends, though its not bad for a 30 minute time waster. Maybe not even that long.\n3.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438391065, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438391065, "recommendationid": "17325470", "language": "english", "votes_down": 26, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487604", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
