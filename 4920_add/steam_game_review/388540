Reminiscent of busta move, but firing down and the projectiles obey the laws of gravity. The firing system is a constantly swinging pendulum so timing is important, but also comes into play in later levels when you have to swing the projectiles under platforms.

And I have no idea what in the hell determines your stage ranking when you're done. If it's time/number of moves like I suspect, then to hell with this game, because it's still got RNG-based drops, and that means HELLO REPLAYS FOR LUCKY CHAINS.\n\nGame's bad is what I'm saying.\n\n* Google it, younguns", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447940345, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447940345, "recommendationid": "19158619", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521143", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
