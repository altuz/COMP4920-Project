Multi/User support is a bit pricy.\nIt supports importing text from Articy Draft, it can export to number of formats including cvs file that can be imported into Unity's Dialogue System plugin. Makes a great combo for that.\nThere is also native Unity Support option. \n\nYou can write dialogue trees, test them in simulation. You can add variables and simple logic, easy to use stuff.\nYou can create entities, which is generic term for any kind of stuff that might need data tied into it. You can assign custom fields and variables to entities and thus create from them NPC, Items, Spell, Powers etc. \n\nThere is simple document writing tool, that lets you write and format dialogues similar to profesional script tools like Articy Draft, Celtx etc. If you like to get started on story and dialogues in more traditional format this is good thing to have. You can then transform this into regular dialogue node with simple drag and drop. But working on actual dialogue tree this way is messy. \n\nYou can create locations and plan level design as well, but I didn't find this workflow particularly productive. Might work for others or different kind of projects. \n\nOverall this software still has the ways to go to become \"ultimate game developer tool\" but theres been good progress so far. There is also a free 14 day full feature demo on developers website for testing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499031153, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499031153, "recommendationid": "33154231", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504505", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
