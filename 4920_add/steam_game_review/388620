It combines dungeon crawling with puzzle-like resource optimization. The base mechanics are very simple, and especially easy to pick up thanks to the intro story-tutorial. The later zones in story mode rely on gimmicks that you are highly unlikely to discover naturally, more or less necessitating reading up on them. I strongly disapprove of such gimmicks from a game design perspective. However, the gameplay itself strikes such a perfect balance between mindless and mindful -- making it a fantastic way to relax and have fun -- that I'm willing to let it go! In addition, the retro graphics and music are absolutely charming to a middle-aged fart like me: reminding me of happy hours spent playing Dragon Warrior 1 is a sure-fire way to get in my good books. Finally, the game takes up very little space, has high value per dollar spent, and the developer is friendly and responsive. I think this one is a winner all around.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498790126, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498790201, "recommendationid": "33019659", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511328", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 52, "total_reviews": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
