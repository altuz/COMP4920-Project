You play as an unfinished drawing who wants to be complete.\nThe game serves as an effective metaphor for the creative process in general: everyone who has tried to create something, be it art, writing, a game, or whatever, can recognise the story this game tries to tell.\n\nThe art style is great. All hand-drawn, and it stays this throughout. The art is accompanied by soothing music.\nThe narrative is told through voice over -- sadly no subtitles -- that is clear, if at a little low volume compared to the music.\n\nGameplay wise, you walk through white, empty environments to find body parts (different legs, different bodies, different heads), all of which give you enhanced abilities. As you progress the levels become more... drawn.\n\nUnfortunately Unfinished is hard to get in to. I was stuck at the first real puzzle for far too long, since the game didn't make it clear at all that I could swap abilities in mid-air, and I only found this by chance.\nIt is also short. Too short perhaps for Steam refunds. If I hadn't gotten stuck at the  beginning I could've finished it within 30 minutes.\n\nWhile a bit rough the game is mechanically sound and the story resonates with me, as a fellow (want to be?) creator.\n\nAs for the price point, \u20ac5 is perhaps steep for such a short game, and (disclaimer) I didn't buy it for that price: I had a 50% off coupon. At that price level (\u20ac2,50 or less) I can recommend it to everyone.\n\n[strike]Just don't be a dick and refund it after you've finished your speed run, okay?[/strike]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440450542, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440450976, "recommendationid": "17699772", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543689", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438882981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 56, "steamid": "76561198034681718", "num_games_owned": 217}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Simple but effective, and pretty much aimed at artists.\n\nIf you're in the business of creating things, it's quite easy to relate to the story being told.

I'm an artist myself and have studied both illustration and animation. I was honestly expecting to connect with this concept. Sadly, my artistic senses were offended more than anything. I feel bad for saying this about any other artist's work, but this is also one of the few Steam purchases I deeply regret.\n\nLike the title says, it's unfinished. Not even in any artsy way. The only lament I experienced from this game was that of my wasted money.\n\nMaybe the idea was good at some point, but the mechanics feel broken, and navigating the world is terrible, which really just killed the experience (hence my very short playtime on record). I went into this hoping for a short, thoughtful, story driven experience, but instead I was apalled by bad coding and environment design. Simplicity can be great; I knew what the game looked like from screenshots, and I was still expecting to like it. Instead, it felt uninviting and badly planned out. This is an example of an indie game where simplicity and idea doesn't win me over.\n\nThe 2D animation and the video of the artist drawing are easily the best parts of this game, but I found myself mostly looking at the equivalent of Google SketchUp blocks without textures, meshing badly with the hand drawn art. Those who are finding deep artistic meaning in this probably have far more going on in their head than what's going on in this game.\n\nBottom line is, I feel like the creator of this game had ideas that they couldn't properly convey in this format.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1476901017, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1476901017, "recommendationid": "26118808", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504460", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1438720387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 37, "steamid": "76561198040776009", "num_games_owned": 262}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A fairly short game that sheds light on the difficulties that artists have to face from time to time.

(Cannot hit 1-3 while moving to select a different item, must ONLY be pressing 1-3 at that time)\n- Game forces player to admire artwork or listen to storytelling at some points, which can be a positive, but given the context that this game is a platformer it was done in such a way that it became more annoying rather than adding value to the story.\n\nOverall I think there are a lot of improvements that can be made to the game.
