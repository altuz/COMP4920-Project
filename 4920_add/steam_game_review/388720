You start off as an anime girl who seems trapped in some sort of void or chamber filled with ethereal beings which you can pass through. Afterwards, you jump into the actual puzzle platformer aspect of the game. There\u2019s a very helpful tutorial that teaches you the basics of dashing, moving, flying, etc that should appeal to newcomers to this genre and game overall. Soon after the tutorial is finished, you get placed into the game where you have the freedom to dash, fly and move around the area to reach the goal piece which is a glowing statue of sorts that you have to hit in order to proceed to the next room or level. I\u2019m going to list some pro\u2019s and con\u2019s this game has to offer and finish off my final thoughts on this game.\n\n[h1]Pro\u2019s[/h1]\n+Intuitive Gameplay let\u2019s you make your own choices and act accordingly\n+Japanese and English layout and subtitles\n+Challenging to the point where I got stuck on room 2\n+Fast Paced\n+60 FPS\n+High resolution settings\n+No cutscenes or dialogue saves the developers a lot of money\n+Full Controller Support (I personally use the Xbox One Controller)\n+Only $10\n\n[h1]Con\u2019s[/h1]\n-Single Player makes it so there\u2019s no interactivity with other players (not even leaderboards)\n-Little sense of direction\n-Decent Graphics (if you\u2019re looking for Unreal Engine graphics, look elsewhere, they\u2019re decent enough)\n-Very few graphic settings. (Only \u201cresolution\u201d)\n-Not an original concept (lot\u2019s of other devs have made games like this; i.e Cloudbuilt)\n-Hit detection for certain models slightly buggy\n-ONLY Japanese and English layout and subtitles\n-Puzzle layout\u2019s feel familiar (copypasta)\n-No cutscenes or dialogue makes the gameplay slightly stale\n\n\nHonestly, this game is pretty decent for this dev studio\u2019s first indie release and for being only $10. If you don\u2019t mind the slightly repetitive levels, little sense of direction, no cutscenes or dialogue, the game offers a cool experience if you\u2019re looking for something you can play for a little bit at a time and if you\u2019re a fan of the genre, you should get it. [u]I recommend it for the price tag and the fact that it\u2019s a generally decent game for this studio\u2019s first release.[/u]\n\nBy the way, you can also find this review on my review site [url=http://www.tacotaku.com/reviews/link-the-unleashed-nexus-review]here[/url]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440202949, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440203249, "recommendationid": "17652974", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508322", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440388821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561198073951786", "num_games_owned": 151}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game itself is in depth and challenging but the UI needs work.

The presentation of the game itself is pretty solid, however, with cool introductory bits for each level. Checkpoints are scattered throughout the level, but are sparse enough to balance both a challenge and avoid frustration from having to redo too lengthy of a section should you fall off. Numerous abilities beyond \"just jumping\" ie divebombing onto certain platforms to trigger other effects, as well as a midair kick to activate platforms round the game out from being too simplistic.
