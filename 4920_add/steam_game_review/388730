Maybe. I guess. In the same way Sonic the Hedgehog is a horror game for imprisoning cute baby animals inside armed steel caskets and forcing them to kill or in the way that much of Ecco the Dolphin is an extended drowning simulator.

A lot of the designs and interactions with objects in the game are unique and pretty left field and I really enjoyed what it had for that. The game itself however, wasn't enjoyable to me or didn't give me the motivation to really be all that interested in progressing through a lengthy maze portion of the game or to collect all of these tarot cards for what I guess shows a message of some sort. This game would've done better if it did have some sort of explanation on what to do, or at least make itself more interesting with the assets that it had with encountering the eyes that chase you in the game. At times it felt like I was running away from the eyes and couldn't pull off sneaking pass them as much as I  hoped for. This game has some minor bugs, such as the A.I. of the eyes suddenly freezing or dropping to the ground rolling away, but this game just came out and I'm sure the developer will do something about it in the future.\n\nOverall I would not recommend this game to anyone who thinks this would stand out from other horror games, it's just another (but more prettier and intriguing) run-from-monsters horror game with a kick ass sound design at best.\n\nI am looking forward to what Lonliest Pixel has to offer in the future.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1437440104, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1437440426, "recommendationid": "17149225", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509392", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465788298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561198153434487", "num_games_owned": 45}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Barely played much of it yet but I already think its really cool.
