I like the notion of a portion of the proceeds going to a humane society but I actually doubt that will take place due to the sketchiness of the dev.\n\nArcade mode and Jump mode are subpar flash games. After attempting to play those two my brain began to melt and I was unable to even figure out how to start the Puzzle mode. Pet mode and Cat Toy are both forgetable. All I remember is one was a knock off of Nintencats. However I set a 'high score' on Arcade Mode and got to World 2, so I guess you can call me the Project CATS Grand Master. \n\nWhat stood out to me in the description was playing a game from the perspective of cats, the idea piqued my curiosity. As such comes the final mode, aptly titled Hunter mode. You play as a cat in first perspective hunting down mice in a room. This one actually looked alright and was actually fun for the 45 seconds I played it.\n\nI would pay between 1 or 2 bucks for the Hunter mode alone, but with the ridiculous price of 29,99 it is impossible to reccommend.
