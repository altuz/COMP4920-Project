I've played through...four times in its totality, and each time was different. Each time got me a different ending.\n\nAt the very least, I recommend playing through twice - not necessarily to see a different ending but because...well. You'll see. I won't undercook it.\n\nMy one complaint is that Alex, the player character, moves very slowly and there's no run button. This can make backtracking a little tiresome. Still, I did play through four times and enjoyed all four, so it wasn't that bad. Just a minor niggle.\n\nWhile this is a ghost story, I really wouldn't call it a thriller. Or a horror game. It isn't scary in the slightest, and while there are a couple of minor jumpscares, they're well-timed and not at all cheap. It's a spooky story, just...don't go in expecting horror, and don't be put off by the idea that it might scare you. It won't, but it might [i]unsettle[/i] you.\n\nDon't worry too much about getting the \"true\" ending on your first try. Just pick the choices that feel right to you.

I was immediately attracted to the game for its soundtrack alone, and the solid voice acting and stellar writing kept me around for the rest of it.\n\nIf you're coming into this game expecting pure, raw horror, you will be disappointed. It's not really a scary game. It's creepy and intriguing. The art work is wonderful. The soundtrack is an enchanting blend of old and new. The characters are well crafted.\n\nMy One Complaint: At times, it felt like the voice acting betrayed the intended tone for certain, more chilling scenes. Characters who were initially freaked out by weird lights and other little occurences were suddenly unafraid, even snarky, when more terrifying (at least in my opinion) things started happening. It felt inconsistent. That is my only complaint with this game. On rare occasion, character reactions didn't feel genuine or believable. \n\nTHAT BEING SAID: The rest of the voice acting is some of the BEST I have ever heard.\n\nThe story is effected by your conversational choices, choices whose effects are not made directly apparent until the end. The supernatural elements that unveil themselves as the pages turn lend to the fear of making the wrong choice, and the fear of making the wrong choice is amplified by the likeable, believable characters those choices affect. It really feels like your friend's lives are in your hands.\n\nAll of it leads to an ending that will infect you with a shuddering dread.

You play as Alex who is currently on a trip to a Local Island with her life long friend, Ren and her recently met Step-Brother Jonas. Actually so recently that today is their first day officially meeting. \n\nRen is a socially awkward stoner, who is a huge history buff and knows pretty much everything about this little fictional island known as Edwards Island. \n\nThey meet up with the rest of the group slightly after reaching the island. Here you meet, Clarissa, Alex\u2019s dead Brothers Ex Girlfriend, and as much of a spoiler as that sounds, it\u2019s really not. You find out in the first 5 minutes so don\u2019t worry about it. Clarissa is very short and snappy towards your character, she\u2019s the classic pretty girl in every Horror movie. \n\nAt this point we also meet up with Nona who is friends with Clarissa. Nona invited Clarissa behind the backs of the other characters to the island. Ren also has a huge crush on Nona.\n\nThey sit around and talk for a bit and then Ren decides he wants to head to check out the Caves. There\u2019s something spooky and weird going on in the caves. You carry this radio and can tune into certain frequencies causing voices as well as portals to open up.\n\nThat is basically as much of the story as I want to tell because anything else would be spoiling you guys on experiencing such an amazing game. Lets talk about the actual gameplay for a little bit.\n\nOxenfree is very story driven. You can respond to questions and talk with a choice of three responses, pretty much exactly the same as say the walking dead, or Life is Strange. These responses are timed, so you can choose to pick one of them, or just skip the whole deal. I was completely involved in the story of this game from the moment I started playing. They characters dialog usually goes on longer than the walk time to the next destination, but I always found myself sitting around listening to them talk about nothing that actually directly impacted the story, just because I wanted to learn as much as possible.\n\nThere are Items in the world that are Highlighted with a little circle that you can click on which provides more dialog, and if you watched my Firewatch review you would know how much I enjoy games that let me learn about pretty much every object in the game. The neat thing about this game in comparison to The Walking Dead game by Tell Tale, is in this game the choices actually matter. People will remember what you say, and it impacts the ending, having huge differences. Not just one replaceable Character being at the end over another Replaceable character.\n\nYou can also choose who accompanies you for most of your journey by making specific choices, but no matter what choices you make you\u2019ll end up hurting someone. It\u2019s like in real life, you can\u2019t win all social situations. Sometimes your end goals don\u2019t line up with everyone elses. It helps to keep the story grounded.\n\nThe game is also pretty damn terrifying, there was always this really creepy feel to the whole game, the voices in the radio, the \u201cJump Scares\u201d and I put them in quotes because they didn\u2019t feel cheap and shitty like every modern day horror movie. They were there for a reason, and had solid backing. It keeps you on edge the whole time you\u2019re playing it and I freaking loved it. I can\u2019t believe I used the Edge line it\u2019s not like this is a review, but it is a 100% recommendation and I really think you guys should pick this one up.
