After enough workers spawned, the game engine would begin to lag. After the lag would come a failure to follow commands, and ultimately the inability to add, remove or modify elements in the game world. Not to mention the buggy physics-based structures that explode or fall apart when placed on any sort of incline, or too close to trees, rocks, etc, or that some units fail to spawen visually, even in large numbers (about 10 on my mate's ballistae were completely absent on my screen). The game has a lot of promise, and would likely be fun if it was playable after reaching the current \"cut-off point\" where the game becomes unplayable.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504911714, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504911714, "recommendationid": "34824847", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501122", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 53, "total_reviews": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 23}}
