The story of the game is told through naration in between levels and pictures on screen during the naration.\n\nYou control 3 characters, a marksman, a mage and a melee character. which is really unique and implemented well. Each character has there own set of abilities that you can choose from the menus as you level up, upgrading their damage or applying new effects as you progress.\n\nIf you feel as if you arent strong enough to do a level (or in my case not good enough at the game) you can do the side quests in between main quests to boost up your experience a bit. You walk through different levels fending off enemies  collecting loot from chests and trying to beat the boss at the end of the level.\n\nNo problems with how the game ran and enjoyed the game alot.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485128311, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485128311, "recommendationid": "29433339", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505461", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485075719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 833, "steamid": "76561198040557124", "num_games_owned": 1419}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": " Control is no issue, just use keybinds to switch characters, use q,w,e,r, for powers, space for amulet, rings do their thing, just picking the right ones is the task there. Mouse to aim and move, couldent be easier, and responce is fine, unless you get mixed about who your on or something dumb.  Tab also switches who you are controlling. \n Game has easy starts to chapters, shows lvl you should be to go. the higher lvls are tough, and I couldent see you letting it play itself with out being killed in a few seconds, without using proper strategy. is Not a clicker. more like Diablo with chapters and diffeculty settings.\n I do have complaints about map size, a bit small in spots, gets tight to fight in, but adds to battle sometimes. Not really a problem to backtrack to a crossroads or path split, as they are not too big of maps. Sometimes pathfinding on non-controled avatar gets blocked for a sec or two by pets, but works pretty good.\n The inventory is painfully small, and with just the opportunity to junk, no crafting that i have found, but have not finished the first run thru yet. would be nice to pull gems and have bank or something, and ability to craft.\n I wondered at first about this party control, but when fighting the troll, opened the fun up, as I adapted to control and had a blast fighting him,  the game is too easy in parts, but as it does ramp up, I see no problems so far with pacing.\n I will continue to play, I am enjoying it, and looking forward to getting deeper into it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1484774356, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1484774356, "recommendationid": "29344684", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501140", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485128539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 135, "steamid": "76561198207373289", "num_games_owned": 5}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "From what I've played so far, I can already tell that the game's unique concept will keep me hooked - those looking for an interesting and ever-so-slightly dark story will not be disappointed.\nThe combat and navigation systems took no time at all to get used to, and I enjoyed being able to switch between the three main characters as well as exploring different traits and items depending on the situation at hand. The bosses are particularly fun (and some deceivingly hard to beat!) and you quite literally never know what is coming round the corner - it very much keeps you in suspense.\nOverall my first impressions have lived up to my expectations for such an interestingly stylised game and I look forward to exploring further - would highly recommend to everyone looking for an innovative and engaging experience. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485129457, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485129457, "recommendationid": "29433567", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502973", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486592656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 226, "steamid": "76561198033196327", "num_games_owned": 155}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Squad based RPGs are not games I typically play, but Torn Tales had me coming back time and time again for a really enjoyable experience.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of League of Legends - a game that I think has an interesting playstyle, but I am not a fan of the full multiplayer experience. Torn Tales is a great alternative, having a similar playstyle but instead of humans, you are fighting through groups of AI enemies.\n\nThe feeling of having Jekyll tear through a mob of enemies with his cane cyclone is immensely satisfying, all the while Snow White hurls spells of poison and healing to make you feel awesome. I love the rune system, when you level up your skills it has a random chance to pick a sort of modifier for your skill, such as making you do more damage every time you hit. These really vary your playstyle and different runes can be swapped out depending on the situation you have at hand.\n\nThe game has a nice balance of easy enemies to beat your way through and tough ones that require a little more strategy. Every time I died I felt like it was my fault for being too bold or not using my characters strengths correctly and it just motivated me to go back and have another go.\n\nI'm also a big fan of the earlier levels having side quests with very high leveled enemies so there is reason to go back to the beginning and play the levels again.\n\nThe game runs fine on my laptop, I don't have any issues with it.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game, especially for \u00a310.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485616863, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485616901, "recommendationid": "29543606", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490407", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485288020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 121, "steamid": "76561198060501353", "num_games_owned": 70}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1]A Good Idea, Executed Relatively Well[/h1]\n\n[u]Game Synopsis[/u]\n\nI like this game, the idea is original and the gameplay is almost there. The story is based around an evil story writer who mashes together 3 stories in an attempt for revenge, Robin Hood (The hybrid) Snow White (The Mage) and Dr.Jekyll & Mr. Hyde (The tank/bruiser) are together in a team to try and fight their way through to the truth. The game works well, employing hack n' slash mmo and rpg games into one, the wide range of weapons and levels give way to hours of gameplay and endless amounts of exploration.\n\n[u]What I like[/u]\n[*]The idea: I've never seen something like this before in a game, the story is definately an orginal one, something i love to see in indie games.\n[*]The graphics: The characters look a little fuzzy and small on the screen but overall i love the look of the game, the devs clearly spent a lot of time on making each map look pleasing to the eye.\n[*]The items and levelling system: Torn Tales has a wide range of items that are dropped throughout playing the game, each one relatively unique from the others, abilities and levelling allows the player to  really get involved and never feel like they have reached an \"end\" i really like how the devs pulled this off.\n\n\n[u]Neutral Points[/u]\n[*]Maps: I both love and hate the choice the devs made with the maps in this game, the simple \"follow the path\" maps do make it less demanding to play and easier to unwind but leave out side quests and exploring differant realms and areas within each mission, although there are \"dead ends\" to find, this is as far as the game goes with this.\n\n[u]What I Dislike[/u]\n[*]WHERE ARE THE NPC'S??:This is a big one, and almost stopped me from playing the game had it not been for the other points made above, this game lacks any sort of interaction or storylines during a quest, this is something that really needed to be added to the game, as it helps the player stay engaged and willing to continure.\n[*]The beginning: While the game does provide some instructions at the start, many things in the game are left un explained, leaving you spending a good 30 minutes figuring out how to use the abilties etc.\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\n\nI think this game was released a little too early and needs a little more refinement. Nevertheless this game is enjoyable to play and a great time killer, would recommend a try.", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1485290345, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485290345, "recommendationid": "29469987", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498625", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
