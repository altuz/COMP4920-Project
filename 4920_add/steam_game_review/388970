Therefore, I do not recommend this game.\n\nThe controls are fine, they are very responsive. That's not a problem at all. The thing is that with the exception of the funny messages you get when you get the HardToGetium and the beginning intro, there is not much of story to tell, and there is not much content. It's simple and runs well, but it gets tedious as you go through 20 levels and the boss in the end when there's very little variation. The enemies don't wary between the areas, either.\n\nFrom going through the levels, we get to difficulty. At first, the levels felt too easy, but when I got into the third area, the difficulty became high. Now I'm pretty much stuck attempting to get through a level many times and ragequitting soon. It's all about skill, I guess, but for my taste the game gets far too punishing. I'd prefer getting good at Dark Souls which I  can play for hundreds of hours, but not a small game which I can get through 100 % in just a few hours.\n\nI did enjoy this at first, but now I'm in a try to play -> ragequit -> try to play loop and don't enjoy it. With two hours played and far more than two weeks since buying this game, there's no way for me to have this refunded.\n\n9,99 \u20ac is far too much for a simple and short game like this. I mean, in two hours, I got to the half of the third area with being stuck for fairly long while getting all the HardToGetium until this point. I got this game on a sale, paying just 1,49 \u20ac, luckily.\n\nIf you're going to invest ten euros into a game, I suggest you go and find something else to buy. For a small price like the one I payed, this is good if you enjoy it, though.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502562922, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502562922, "recommendationid": "34197277", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495915", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 23, "total_reviews": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
