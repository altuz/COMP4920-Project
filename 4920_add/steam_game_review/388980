There is actually NO way to directly export the track into either rF2 or Assetto Corsa, unlike its predecessor, Bob's Track Builder. It only exports it into an .fbx file with the image files used in the project. Unless you have advanced knowledge in Blender, 3DS Max, etc., then consider making anything good out of this program [i]impossible[/i]. Even if you do know how to do this, this is very time-wasting and I don't think you would want to do that.\n\n- Due to the vaguely-placed user manual, you would be stumped for a while when you use the program for the first time. If you go into the actual program's installation files, you would find the instruction manual in the form of an .html file. Why is this not linked directly to the library? No clue, and this is time-wasting to find.\n\n- The customer support really takes the cake for how bad it is. Although it never happened much to me, I have heard from others that the only person who knows more about this program than anyone else is Brendon (he's the creator of it, duh), and he has actually banned people from his forums for having issues with this program and... pretty much giving it the rating it deserves. You would be lucky to get any sort of response at all from Brendon, because he rarely responds to any feedback or issues (somewhat understandable since he actually has a family of his own, but why not hire moderators?); he rarely even updates the program anymore and has not yet added any support for the games the program claimed it could export to.\n\nThis program is simply Brendon pulling the middle finger to those who wanted to build tracks for games quickly and easily. I do not recommend buying this, especially with the outrageous price tag for the minimal amount of content it has. I recommend Bob's Track Builder much more; it's a stellar program that is far better than RTB, and also cheaper.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500865977, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501109146, "recommendationid": "33757812", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510841", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501995895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 41, "steamid": "76561198024909559", "num_games_owned": 248}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Lack of features, crashes every now and then.
