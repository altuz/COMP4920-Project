This shouldn't even be allowed in, for early access for how much of the game is still missing. And yes you \"CAN\" quest and play, however good luck finding where you need to go and what to do most of the time. A lot of the game is still missing, and most of what the population may have been is now gone. Or no where to be found. The chat in-game is pretty much dead, So yeah... I'm still keeping my hopes alive, but I'm not sure for how much longer.

There are tons of quests to do and the leveling system is a huge seller for me. The story is pretty weak atm so if thats what you need to have fun then you may want to wait. I'll try and come back to this review and give more details after i put some more hours in. Keep up the good work devs!\n\np.s. VERY IMPORTANT: The live server and PTS are quite literally a night and day difference. There is a lot of grief on these reviews about missing features or graphics not like the pictures or not seeing much change over whatever period and so on, take all of that with a grain of salt because most of it is from people who only played on the live server and may not have known about the PTS. The PTS is currently the only way you will experience everything the devs are working on and have changed over the past year. Although questing is not implemented on the PTS, you DO gain instant access to all the gear, monsters, and features the game currently offers via the yellow portal at the entrance of the Ark.This portal will take you to an instanced demo area where you can view and interact with everything the devs have created so far including all the best gear. You can then use that gear on all the monsters in the demo area or use the teleporters within the demo area to go anywhere in the world. It's a very fun way to see just how far the game has come so be sure to try it. Accessing the PTS takes an extra step, but i promise it is well worth it. Here is the link on how to access the PTS:\nhttps://pgenom.com/community/threads/start-of-the-pts-servers.2721/ \n\np.s. If yall get stuck or have questions or need some help just use the in game chat, im always keeping an eye on it when im playing just in case someone else needs assistance.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506830709, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506862691, "recommendationid": "35362967", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504840", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504827458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2029, "steamid": "76561198410314302", "num_games_owned": 4}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "   This 3rd person Sci-fi shooter is still being developed however it shows great potential. to sell items go to any merchant or vendor and right click items you want to sell. you'll get a radial sub-menu. select thi fist on top and the item is sold( note if not at a merchant the fist will equip the item instead). It is advised you select 1 aromr skill tree and stick with it otherwise you can use higher gear when you need to advance in the story. assult can soak up a lot of damage and greatly midigate incoming  damage when sheild drops. tactical armor is light armor has decent sheilds but low protection. sabitoge is medium armor and provides a good balance between tactical and assault armor. wepons also have a skill tree but in the being the most readily available weapos are pistols and assault rifles they also have skill trees.\n\n   The skill trees advancement is based off item useage any armor or weapon used will gain points to use in the skill trees. And like mentioned earlier choose which skills you want carefully. the skills are divided into multiple catagories. Each catagory having main and secondary traits. the main trait is the class lv you can use and consume advancement points gained. the secondary traits are buffs you can get based off how many points you have spend in 1 tree. So the greater the focus the stronger 1 skill becomes.\n\n   Finally crafing. This is still in the test state but in order to use the crafting machine use must 1st buy blueprints from the merchant to the left of the machine and after that gather the nessicary items needed for the blueprint you want to try to produce. there is a percentage success or fail based off the materials used that percent will raise or fall. other than that I haven't tried much else with it.\n\nQuesting and some issues being worked on. the earliest quests are displayed on map the higher quests around lv 12 start becoming search eventially you will find them the main story quests so far have all bee marked just the sub quests have issues at this point. well that it for this reveiw or is it more of a walkthur on basics. shrugs....", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504829758, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504829758, "recommendationid": "34805074", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497593", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507048361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1159, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1159, "steamid": "76561198077207359", "num_games_owned": 59}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Firstly Id like to say clear the air i bought this game and was floored by not only the amount of content that ppl are saying isnt there but also the awesome imersive experince i got from just the first 20 min of game play if i could dicribe it\nits like the develpoer took all the best sifi movies from the 70s 80s and 90s shoved them in a blender ran them through a partical accelerateor and the frame work for this game showed up on a moniter in the room", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506893600, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506893600, "recommendationid": "35397048", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499968", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 242, "total_reviews": 411, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 169}}
