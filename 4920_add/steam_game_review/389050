It fits both a tournament environment and a party, as it's quite simple yet even deeper. The retro sprite work is just gorgeous. \nThe music is also a nice point of the game. it won't blow anything out of the water, but it's still pretty enjoyable. the online is smooth as butter thanks to the GGPO netcode. the game also has pretty good single-player content, such as the career mode which (supposedly) uses player data to control ai behavior.\n\nOverall, it's worth every penny.
