That's about 85% of the gameplay.\n\nLater on in the game you'll find a dragon among the enemy that shoots fireballs at your men. Kill the dragon and you can recruit them for yourself and use them to shoot at the enemy. That's another 10%.\n\nEven further in the game you'll find cavalry that you need to tell what to do, meaning you need to tell them to charge at point 1 and then point 2 before the battle starts. This leads to them running past the enemies to point 2, unless they are blocked. Then they attack the closest enemy, which can be a wall or an actual enemy. You also get a banner that you can use in battle to guide your men, kind of anyways. Both of these are generally useless and when you can find a for use it, it won't make much of a difference. This is the last 5%.\n\nYou can finish this game in about three hours on standard difficulty and honestly you only need to finish the first map, out of a total of ten, to experience the entire game.\n\nThe time played compared to the price paid (\u20ac9) and the gameplay itself aren't sufficient to justify a purchase.\nDuring a sale it might be worth to check it out if your looking for a casual strategy game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454100791, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454100791, "recommendationid": "20833667", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511051", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453973033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561198006524453", "num_games_owned": 668}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I won't say this game isn't fun, because it could very well get really fun later on in the game.
