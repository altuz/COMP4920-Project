Have no delusions, it's like the love child of a tablet runner and a flash game.\n\nIt's a single button game where the player jumps over spinning disks, whirlpool disks, ninjas who pose, ninjas who menace, a dog and an explosive tower that kills you sometimes.\n\nDespite only having one button the controls are still unresponsive with the character sometimes not jumping on downhill slopes.  Left and right 'move' the player but I got all the way to level 31 without ever having to use those controls.\n\nActually the the left / right controls are basically broken with left accelerating the character towards the left of the screen - sometimes so enthusiastically that the stage starts scrolling backwards and the character falls off into nothingness.  And right accelerating the player towards the center of the screen - generally causing the player to get hooked on something.  Do not touch anything except the jump button.\n\nThere's very little in terms of graphics.  The stages are black with the exception of the weirdly out of place and low resolution skyscrapers.  Red clouds obscure blades, ninjas and the player.  Jumping over something when you can not see yourself nor it is bad game design.\n\nBlack clouds also hide ninjas and blades against black backdrops.  In the all stages I played the only real challenge was learning where the mostly hidden obstacles were.  \n\nThere's no significant ramp in difficulty, once you've played the first few stages the others was just variants of tap-the-button.  Stage 24 introduced a glimmer of fun because there was a genuinely tricky timed platform jump but that was it by the 30th stage nothing else had happened and the tedium had set in.\n\nFor a game with controller support it's shoddy - you can jump with the 'A' button but not restart the level.  That requires a mouse click.  Curiously the players death 'animation' kicks in only about one in every 8 deaths, usually you're immediately kicked back to the menu.\n\nAnd the menu.  There is no way to reset progress so if I ever wanted to go back to a previous stage I can't.  The options menu is a picture saying you must play the game by jumping.  There are no options.  The story menu is a picture of some poorly laid out comic frames that cannot be exited.  The only way to exit the story menu is to close the program.\n\nCollision detection is atrocious.  Huge bounding boxes around both the player and the obstacles will see you dying in mid-air time and time again.  Particularly bad are the strange little kill-you-at-a-random distance towers and the explosions; some of which do not kill you at all.\n\nShadow Ninja feels like a half-finished student project that someone is asking money for.  It's not worth it; even it were free it would still not be worth it.
