You hook the 'treasure chest' and you have to release it because you can't open it. There are 'creatures' and there is no freeplay. Slog through each and every fishing spot till you mercifully just turn off the game. Additionally there isloud  rude commentary from the 'fisherman' when you catch a fish. Broken rods, props tackle, all too common with very little start up money. Too many snags extremely loud noises. It isn't even close to what fishing is. It's not peaceful, and it isn't fun. I played for nearly two hours offline and grew so frustrated I decided it has to go.\n\nRefunded. 2/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1479427581, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1479427581, "recommendationid": "26653432", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509844", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487732522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 147, "steamid": "76561198041739277", "num_games_owned": 992}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "theres just not much to do and they really dont explain enough. and theres no really no career mode or anythign its jsut bland and theres not really much to do", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489109628, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1489109628, "recommendationid": "30418331", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504270", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1457641069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561198261066527", "num_games_owned": 211}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "good game however too many bugs make it unplayable  know its early access but when i get the chance and treasure chest theres no way to move it stays there till round over and the buttons at the bottom dissapear sometimes good game though", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457641140, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1457641140, "recommendationid": "21753618", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482004", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
