( A more detailed review is coming later, after I discover more. )\nWanted to see how easy it was to learn - there is an intro tutorial, but it doesn't ( ? ) cover what you must do to \"climb\", which on the Oculus Touch is use the \"grip button\" to try and hold on to the walls.  ( Usually you will \"bounce off\" instead of climbing. )\nI wasn't amazed by this at first, but more will likely be revealed though exploration.  As the title suggests, it has the feel of being inside a surrealistic dream.\n\nMore later, see my YouTube video.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493141758, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1493141758, "recommendationid": "31361491", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499041360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 42, "steamid": "76561197969913402", "num_games_owned": 1966}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "review": "TL;DR I think this is kinda meh, but you may still want to try it out yourself.   Read on for the full review.\n\nWell, I have played a bit of this and I think I can form an opinion.  First things first... what the fuck is this game anyway? \n\nYou have a disembodied pair of arms and a pinkish blob that might represent a head...or a heart... or something.  You're apparently on some low-gravity world  with some gems hidden around, and some glowing lights that you can touch/absorb... oh and you have thrusters in your hands that you can use to rocket up higher.\n\nIs there a point?  Well, I think the point is to explore, grab the gems and store them (and maybe put them somewhere else?) and the rest is just you gliding around the world like Rocky the Flying Squirrel or something.  I don't know what else to say about this.\n\nThings I Like: \n[list]\n  [*] at times, gliding is kinda liberating/cool.\n  [*] you can use your arms to slap the ground and launch yourself up high\n  [*] when you run out of rocket power you can at least continue to glide instead of falling back to the ground\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't like\n[list]\n  [*] Your \"arms\" are about 1-2 feet in front of you so it's more like you're standing behind acting like a puppet master.\n  [*] There's not enough rocket power to get up really high.\n  [*] There's not a whole lot of documentation to tell you how things work.  The tutorial explains the basics only.\n  [*] All locomotion is arm based, but if you're sitting on the floor, it can be a pain to do the \"launch into the air\" move without banging the controllers on the floor.\n[/list]\n\nBasically, the controls are simple (fly/glide or crawl around with your arms) but still awkward and kinda annoying.  The \"find the hidden gems\" game mechanic doesn't really make  me excited to keep playing.  Maybe if each gem did something unique or added to my power somehow...\n\nI can't give this a thumbs down because it's not really a bad game, but I can't really give this a thumbs up because it's not really a great game either.  I got it for a bit more than $5 and I feel like that's a bit much given the content, but I haven't tried the \"challenges\" the game has, just the exploration.  \n\nIt's kinda neat and it might even be fun for a while, but I don't know if this is going to be something I come back to time and again or if it just stays in the \"eh, maybe later\" category.   I'm marking it thumbs up but it's really a Meh.  Get it in a bundle or on sale and maybe you'll enjoy it more than I have so far.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492640121, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1492640121, "recommendationid": "31245762", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503774", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 40, "total_reviews": 45, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
