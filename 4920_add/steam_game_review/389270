A puzzle normally has a finished picture or a solution when all the parts are together. In this 'game' the puzzles are puzzling enough. I just feel deprived of a conclusion to the story. I won't spoil the ending, because there's nothing really to spoil. \n\nIf you play the game, just knock yourself out solving the puzzles and finding the little letters (which I don't see the point of the letters still.) Then open the last door... to open another door. Read a note with no answer and then get a message that this is the end of the game. \n\n[h1]That's it. Sorry. [/h1]\nIt looks like they sliced a game in pieces to save more for later to sell another part of the same game. It's not the cheap price I lament, but the time wasted in this game. It wasn't worth it.
