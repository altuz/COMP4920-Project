However, there is an issue:\n\nThe game itself has seven or so currently flyable aircraft, all of which are general aviation aircraft (Piper Cherokees, Cubs, etcetera.) meaning we have nothing but light propellor aircraft. This is understandable [b]for the moment[/b] as the game is still in the early-access, in development phase. Apparently we'll eventually get some larger, turbojet aircraft, so that sorts that issue out, as long as they don't have each and every single future aircraft released as a paid DLC.\n\nDLC. That's my issue with Flight Sim: World. [b]It's in early access, thus not even past the full release, and Dovetail are releasing paid downloadable content.[/b] Yes, some of the DLC are aircraft models made by third parties which is a thing I am fine with, however Dovetail is releasing additional content for the game prior to it being completed - something of which I strongly dissagree with. Surely, one would think, you would complete and fix the game and the issues within, as I have encountered [b]many errors and bugs[/b] in my fairly short time on FSW before even considering the release of additional content. For example, lights do not illuminate the ground when taxiing in the dark, and the ATC sounds even worse than that of FSX, shadows often flicker in and out as well as clouds playing havoc with textures on the ground.\nThat's what I mean. Complete/fix the game prior to releasing extra content we don't (for the most part) need yet.\n\nIf you're going to get FSW, wait until it's got a bit more going for it (that's included in the base game - not the ever-increasing amount of DLCs)!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505540256, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505540256, "recommendationid": "34988390", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581085", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505501475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 701, "steamid": "76561198071078881", "num_games_owned": 38}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Compared to the other flight sims that you need 100s of dollars to make look good this game holds its own.

If they have no intentions of adding more free planes, and only plan to have $30-$50 DLC planes I cant reccomend this game to anyone. Offering DLC for a clearly unfinished product is just not a good way to do business. Instead of wasting dev time on making $12 of new \"missions\" I would have rather have see more bug fixes (or more additions to the base game that is clearly lacking content). If I put the graphics on max you cant fly more than 20 mins without a CTD. I bought this early access game because it looks better than sims with $200 in visual upgrades and seemed to have promise. I was really disappointed this week when I saw 2 DLC and a small bug fix patch.

Somehow it reminds me Microsoft Flight - which is a good thing. Another major improve over FSX is loading time - shaders and scenery are cached during the first launch and than every other launch is almost instant (at least on my rig).\nIn the current state of game you will get only few planes, all are general aviation, mostly single engine. Which is not a good choice, because you dont get anithing new regarding the landscape, so no eye candy for your VFR flights. Flight models seems to me same as were used in FSX. Planes that I have tested so far looks and handles well, and the big plus is adding of automated checklist, which again reminds me strongly Microsoft Flight (which is again a good thing I have to admit that I liked Microsoft Flight a lot and I was a huge letdown for me when they tried to change the direction to turn it from bush plane sim to casual airplane game - which was doomed to fail from the beginning, because instead of game for everybody it turned into a game for nobody. But the developing team did a great job in terms of graphic and optimization and introduced a lot of fresh ideas, that will be hopfelly re-used also in FSW)\n\nBut now for something completely different - the cons\n\nFirst of all - no real weather - why?\n\nSecond - do you remeber that ugly text to speech voices from older versions of X-plane? That's what you get in FSW. My guess is that thay wanted to improve ATC communication, but that would mean to re-record everything, so they choose to use speech synthesis. If you are used to FSX ATC communication, or radio chatter in current version of X-plane you will be freaked by this (and probably turn ATC volume to zero).\n\nThird - there sems to be no improvements regarding landscape. So all the FSX problems like ugly linear coastlines etc. remains also here. X-plane is now miles ahead in terms of autogen scenery. This is one of the main reasons I am giving it negative review - next gen sim have to offer much more than unnaturally lit procedurally generated landscape\n\nSo at the current state of the game I cannot recommend it. If you want to throw yourt money into some sim\n- either into current version of X-plane, which has it's own issues but still is the best alternative to FSX and I have to admit, that current version is huge step forward\n- if you dont mind early acces game try Aerofly FS 2 - it is currently in a similar stage like this game but offers a beautifull scenery for VFR\n\nSo far I don't know if FSX will be able to deliver what I expect from a modern sim. And I have  two more big isues with it.\nFirst - they are releasing paid DLCs for early access game. Like seriously? Dovetail games are notorious for milking it's customers via plethore of expensive DLCs, but in early access stage it is simply wrong\nSecond and most important - why they do not invest money and time into improving existing Steam version of FSX, but instead they are creating a clone of 11 years old game?
