The only way to do this is to replay the level itself over and over until you get it perfect, or replay the whole set from the start of you have multiple non-perfects.\n\nThe hidden object portion of the game is really easy and if you get stuck you have the hint button that will fully recharge over a little time. \n\nIf you exit the game midpoint through a set, it will fail that level once you restart the game. So, if you do not want this to happen, make sure you are fully commited to playing all 10 rounds in the set before you exit the game.\n\nAchievements are easy to get.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499115242, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499115242, "recommendationid": "33201785", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508901", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
