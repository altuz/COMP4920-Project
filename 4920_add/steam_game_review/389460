Easier on the less mathematically inclined. More casual. Might had preferred to angry birds in 2013 on a tablet back when these games were a thing. \n\nOutstanding issues : Game does not register inputs correctly and keeps trying to slide the screen back to the default position while you are trying to place waypoints. Of course the options are lackluster, the 2D assets are low end and the sound was designed with a shoestring budget. Also all levels appeared as locked on the level select screen, I just pushed level 1 anyway and it loaded... whatever man", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494662863, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505094165, "recommendationid": "31718394", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "total_reviews": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 36}}
