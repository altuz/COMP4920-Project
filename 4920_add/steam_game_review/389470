Lovecraft, so if you have not read his work, you may want to before purchasing. It will give you a greater understanding of the themes and key players in the game.\nFirst lets cover the many positives. This game is genuinely creepy, from beginning to end. The pixelated art is beautiful, if you appreciate pixelated art. I would have done so many screenshots, but sadly with DOSBox I was unable to. The town of Innsmouth is charming, yet you can definitely sense the sinister presence that surrounds and invades the town. The people themselves are also not quite right. It's fun trying to discern who is there to help, or bring about your demise.  The soundtrack is very creepy, letting you know that you are about to enter a world of nightmare. The sound effects are also great. There are times when you are walking through a forest, and you can hear the animals, which can create either a very pleasant or sinister effect, depending on when you go. There is an instance when you have to visit a cemetary, and there is no soundtrack. The sounds of what you would expect to hear in a cemetary at night is all you need to set the mood. The voice acting, for the most part is pretty good, with just a hint of cheese. You can either read the dialogue, listen to the spoken dialogue, or use both. If you use both, expect lag. The written text stays much longer than what the actors say. You can right click if you want to skip the awkward pauses. This really is the only technical hiccup, and I find it forgivable, since there are other modes available. \nNow the puzzles. They range from everywhere to pretty easy, to having to use your head, to receiving no help at all, and just figuring it out by trial and error. Don't worry, there is not a lot of the latter. Save often, since there a million ways to die. The game takes place over a span of three days. The first day lays the groundwork for the mystery and the horror that you will encounter. The second day is the most stressful, yet it is very rewarding once completed. The third is...well that would be telling. \nNow I must cover the things that separates this from every point-and-click I've played to date. First, instead of using your mouse and clicking where you want Mr. Parker to go, the mouse is in the shape of an arrow, and you move him by choosing which direction you want him to go. Once you get the hang of it (it shouldn't take long), it's easy to maneuver. Next, and this is the awesome thing, is that if you are within eyesight of something you can pick up, a dotted line appears, directing your gaze to an object. NO PIXEL HUNTING! It's great because you find things you didn't know you needed, and when you get to the part of the game when you need said item, you have it! However, you still have to open cabinets and search places, but once you see it, you'll know immediately if you can pick it up. Why don't other point-and-click games do that? \nI could talk quite a bit more about this game. The look, the sounds, the soundtrack, the game mechanics, are just great for the time it was made. You also have a journal to keep notes that can help you on your way. The cut scenes and animations are creepy, disturbing, and well done. Lovecraft would be pleased.    \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455158897, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1455158897, "recommendationid": "21117891", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567655", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450627574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 22, "steamid": "76561198057491262", "num_games_owned": 174}, "votes_funny": 8, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Mister Paaaaaaaaarker, you must solve the puzzles that make no sense!

It takes place over three days and nights, and the protagonist progressively unravels a mystery about a cursed town and eventually finds himself in a position to save the world from a terrible fate.\n\nThe game came out in 1993, which means a couple things: the graphics are obviously extremely dated, but more importantly, the market audience was more patient and forgiving of obtusity.  Obtuse PnC games were the norm.  I have fond memories of the Goblins and King's Quest games, to name a few similar examples, and I don't know that I beat a single one of them as a kid.  It wasn't that my interest trailed off, it was simply that I got completely stuck, and I didn't have internet access to find help guides.  That didn't bother me 20+ years ago, but it does now.  I don't mind having to take notes and make maps and such - I actually think that's part of the charm of these games - and I enjoy solving the (sometimes weak) riddles as well.  I do not, however, appreciate having to rely on walkthroughs despite those efforts.\n\nMy only other complaint about the game is based on the emulation (DOSBox).  I frequently ran into issues where the number of times I hit a key wasn't registering properly, and so I would accidentally skip several lines of dialogue or find it impossible to navigate the inventory.  I can't knock the game itself for that, though.\n\nRecommended for PnC fans who are used to this sort of obtusity, or for Lovecraft fans that don't mind using walkthroughs occasionally.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1484101714, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1484101836, "recommendationid": "29174948", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499429", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478489468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 272, "playtime_forever": 546, "steamid": "76561197967229781", "num_games_owned": 425}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Comet is a point and click adventure in the HP Lovecraft universe where you play a hapless reporter thrust into a seemingly random American town with not-so-seemingly ties to the macabre.

Even though SotC gives the simplified viewing and inventory system (where you just walk around all game and mash either L or U) it\u2019s very clumsy and takes a lot away from the typical experience of a point and click adventure. I spent more time struggling with this game\u2019s controls than I did actually accomplishing feats, and I\u2019m not even exaggerating.

I grew up in the 80's and 90's, I played all the Sierra games, King's Quest, Space Quest, Quest for glory, Black Cauldron, you name it. This game has all of the bad aspects of those games and none of the good ones. The bad aspects are: you can't progress in the game until you have done certain things. That means you walk around forever looking for things to do. If you didn't talk to someone, you have to go do it. And you just can't move on. In the old sierra games, you might have to backtrack in the game to get a certain item or do a certain action. Here, the game does not progress until you are current with the plot. Here's an example: You go into the woods with your guide. He's carrying your camera tripod. He runs away. You use 3 branches and a vine to make a tripod. The problem is, if you don't have those items, the guide never meets you. So you wander around the game with a tripod, wondering why the hell you can't move on. It was this kind of crap that caused the death of the point and click adventure games. The great thing about the Sierra games was you knew to go back to an earlier save point and look for  what you needed (I can't get by this laser. Wow, it would be great to have a mirror to blow up the laser. Aw shit, I need to back up and find something mirrored). Now let's talk about the controls. In the sierra games you direct your mouse at the top of the screen and select an icon to do what you want. In this game, you have to press [TAB] to access those icons, and you can't even point and select like in the classic adventure games. You have to cheat! You have to go on the internet and find out the keys that correspond to each action. And on top of that, the keys are SLOW!!!! You have to hit (L) to see anything, and then walk around it and hit (G) over and over and over, to pick it up. Every action in this game takes FOREVER. Just picking up a branch takes MINUTES. The logic puzzles are fairly straightforward, but because they take so long to carry out, you're frustrated. You know you need to talk to the dying man, but you have to be standing in exactly the right position, hit (L), to look at him, then (T) to talk to him. By that time you're so pissed that you don't even want to listen to what he's saying, you just want the game to PROGRESS!!! What would be fun adventure puzzles in an old Sierra game just enrage you in this game, because everything is so damn slow. It's a badly made game and you shouldn't get it.
