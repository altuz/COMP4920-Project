The unreal engine, the stability, and the gameplay are all quite good. HOWEVER, Tekken 7 is by far the farthest thing from the Tekken games we've all grown to love over the years. When I say that, I'm not complaining about the game itself, just certain aspects of it. For instance, The character roster has been dumbed down to half of what it should be. On top of that, about a third of the characters that we actually DO have are new to the franchise. In addition, the bound (!b) system has been replaced with the Screw Attack (!S) system which changes combo potential, and somewhat limits characters who used to be a lot more viable. And most importantly (to myself as well as many Tekken fans), the addition of the Rage Art/Drive feature completely changes the way the game is played. (Keep in mind that this review will not cover certain features. This guide is purely informational and what I felt necessary to discuss.) With these things mentioned, let's begin.\n\n The first topic of discussion is the character roster (or lack thereof). Any Tekken fan will tell you that one of the best things about the game was the character roster. We've been blessed with so many diverse options over the years, some of them unique, others....ehh....not so much. Despite that fact, we've always had mostly the same characters since the beginning (with some new additions of course). Characters like Lei Wulong, Jun, Kunimitsu, Michelle, Julia, Anna, Baek, and Wang. Albeit some of the characters listed haven't been around for several games before TTT2, they have become fan favorites. With Tekken 7 being the \"end of the Mishima Saga\" you would think that we would get some sort of closure with each of these characters, but instead we were flooded with a plethora of new faces. Characters such as the easily spammable Shaheen, Katarina, and Josie, or perhaps the more complex Kazumi, Eliza, and Master Raven. Upon adding these characters, some of which having no place in this franchise, the developers of Tekken 7 took it one step further and added the banes of everyone's existence. You guessed it, I'm talking about the absolutely broken characters such as Gigas, Lucky (Cancer) Chloe, and Claudio. Characters with frame traps so difficult to break, that players that once struggled to get out of silver ranks are now sitting amongst the green and yellow ranks. Characters that are so unbelievably fast, that they completely change the strategies of some of the best players in the world just to compensate for the spam. Characters that replaced some of the names that made this beautiful franchise what it once was. Who in their right mind found it acceptable to wipe out over half of the Tekken roster and replace it with this elementary trash? And let's not even discuss the additions of Akuma and Geese Howard as those characters deserve reviews of their own. Enough of this rant about names and faces. Let us move on to our next point, shall we?\n\n For my next move: the SCREW ATTACK! But seriously, all jokes aside, The change in the \"Bound System\" (!b) to what is now referred to as the \"Screw Attack\" (!S) is another change that I wasn't too thrilled about. !S changes the combo potential of many characters, and leaves many viable options to sit at the lower tiers of the roster whilst others now thrive instead. I will admit that !b made it exceptionally hard to get out of some situations, and allowed your opponent to turn a round into a one-way cinematic of your character getting juggled from one side of the screen to the other with no hope of salvation. In some ways, the change was warranted. The swap to !S has impacted certain characters far more than others though. Characters such as Bryan, Lars, and Lee Chaolan got the raw end of the deal. I mean that in the sense that certain combos will no longer link, leaving these characters to use the same stale inputs repeatedly. In a lot of cases, this leaves a good bit of the moveset untouched due to being unsafe or punishable. I feel like this somewhat promotes spamming with these characters which is why it's more common to see in matchmaking (especially in ranked). On the other side of that, Characters like Xiaoyu, Dragonov, and Feng were relatively unaffected, causing them to be more deadly then ever. I guess this is good news to all of you who abuse AoP, but I personally am going to miss those iWS+1 Resets with Nina. I suppose the change was necessary and not that big of a deal, but it still doesn't sit right with me. Anyway, on to the next one.\n\n FINISH HIM! Yep, you guessed it. Rage Arts. Do you remember the good old days when you worked so hard to get your opponent's health down, excecuted your next input, and you actually won? Or perhaps the sense of accomplishment you felt when the tables were turned and your health was low, you executed a perfectly timed parry/punish into a combo to run it back and win the round? You can forget it. Those days are over. Why? One Button. One simple input. Something so easy that anyone of any age, caliber, and rank can pull off to ruin all of your hard work. The Rage Art. Now...it is my personal opinion that Tekken used to stand out because it was different than it's competitors in the sense that there were no finishing moves. No flashy cinematics with high damage that could potentially turn the tables or spontaneously end a round. Just straight up, hand to hand, precision and skill. Now? The lower your opponent's health, the worse of a position you're in (potentially). Not only do these moves do INSANE amounts of damage, Not only can you combo into these finishers, NOT ONLY do they only take 1 button to use, but they have ARMOR. These moves can LITERALLY ABSORB your attacks before landing. Yeah sure, you still take damage when executing a Rage Art, But none of that matters if you're going to eat a third of your enemies' healthbar and win the round anyway, right? How or why was this a good idea? Why is this just now taking effect in the 7th (and possibly final) main installment of the game? I personally don't have a problem with Rage Drives. Most of them are pretty docile. I would have been fine with the addition of the Rage Drives if they didn't show up alongside their counterparts. They do damage, hit fast, and some extend into combos that could make a huge comeback slightly less challenging. (But you would still have to put forth some effort to make it happen.) If you want my opinion, Rage Arts do not belong in Tekken. If you wanted finishers, you could always go back to Street fighter and Mortal Kombat. In this sense, Tekken has lost what made it Unique. I suppose there's still Smash, right? Inb4 Rage Arts.\n\n I guess in the end we get what we get and if we don't like it, we can always play other games. I personally, will be right here playing T7 despite its flaws. Hopefully the roster expands to show some more familiar faces before it comes to an end. There was a need for change however, I don't feel as though we got the change we needed. New characters will drive new fans to the game which is nice. Instead of the niche fighter that it was, Tekken is now appealing to newer fans. Less people will be complaining about endless combos and resets do to new mechanics. And less experienced players will have a way to feel good about their matches at the end of the day du to new abilities and features. Though the game isn't perfect, it is still phenomenal for what it is and I hope to see more titles in the future. At the end of it all, Harada came through with one of the best fighting games ever created and I am proud to say that I got the chance to play it. If you're looking for a fighting game, I definitely reccomend trying Tekken 7, though it isn't for everyone. \n\nFinal Score 7.5/10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505462260, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505462260, "recommendationid": "34966532", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527265", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505844566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 326, "steamid": "76561198015491450", "num_games_owned": 68}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Havent played since tekken 3 and this was fun!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505521369, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505521369, "recommendationid": "34984185", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520650", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507181632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 951, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6347, "steamid": "76561198066288220", "num_games_owned": 232}, "votes_funny": 25, "votes_up": 45, "comment_count": "5", "review": "I want Eliza to be my mommy", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505450879, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505450879, "recommendationid": "34964128", "language": "english", "votes_down": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530447", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507195300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1131, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10639, "steamid": "76561198142498411", "num_games_owned": 56}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Best fighting game in the market right now.

I started as a Street Fighter player, then got into the NRS games like MK9 and Injustice when I used to travel to tournaments, and now I've transitioned into being a Tekken player. To but this short - Tekken 7 is one of the greatest fighting games I've ever played.\n\nIt is a tough game to learn but it constantly rewarding. It demands a lot from the player just to get the basics down. For one, there is no traditional tutorial in the game. While that may be unforgiving to new players there are plenty of resources out there to learn the game with from the Tekken Zaibatsu forums to all of the youtube content creators helping educate players. Also an incredible perk of the PC version is having access to the frame bot which can help you learn character frame data. However even if you're a veteran of fighting games you'll quickly learn that Tekken is a different beast altogether.\n\nTekken 7 is a game of movement mastery. In order to really play the game well at all you have to learn how to properly move in the 3d space. This game allows you to cancel movements with other move inputs. This allows you to cancel things like backdashing and sidestepping so that you can create whiffed attacks from the opponent that you can punish. Creating space, conditioning, whiff punishing, and juggles make up the majority of the gameplay in any given match.\n\nFighting mechanics aside Tekken 7 is a beautiful game to look at with great presentation touches like the slow-mo that occurs towards the end of a round when two players' attacks are about to meet at the same time, giving you a moment of hype as you witness whether or attack hits and kills or if you are the one who is KO'd. It also includes a fair amount of detail options to tinker with and in my experience runs fine at 1080p med-high settings on a gtx 1050ti.\n\nI don't dwell on the content outside of the versus fighting much but there is a decent story mode that wraps up the Mishima saga pretty well. There are also little character chapters that give you some background information, one match against a rival, and a goofy cutscene. There is an arcade mode but there are no character endings as it looks like those assets where impliment in the character chapters. I kinda wish they would've just scrapped the chapters and gave us arcade mode endings but once you've seen them that's as much as you're going to get out of them. There is also a special boss battle versus Akuma that is extremely challenging and will probably be your last achievement/trophy to go after.\n\nThere is a good training mode that'll let you practice movement, combos, and recreating any situation you'd like to practice against. Treasure battles serve as a constant single player goal to unlock all the customization items in the game since it takes over 2000 battles to unlock everything. As mentioned you can customize all the characters in the roster with different outfits, hairstyles, colors, effects, ect. I really like the addition of New Japan Pro Wrestling clothing and outfits for the characters, especially the Rainmaker Okada outfit for King which actually changes his Rage Art into the finishing move of the current IWGP Heavyweight champion. There's also UI customizations for the health bars and player profile.\n\nFor online play the game highly encourages you to play ranked move as it allows you to play against opponents you've matched with as much as you two want and gives a visible indicator of your progress as a player. Unfortunately player matches suffer from the lack of an instant rematch option unlike ranked so you'll be going to character select after every game.\n\nA breakdown of Tekken 7 as a package doesn't do the game justice since there are other fighting games out there with more single player content and tools to learn the game, but the pure fighting in T7 I feel outmatches all the other games. Combos are fun to execute and every punch, kick, launcher, and counter-hit feels powerful. It's always fun to play and is a game I'm going to be playing for a long time to get good at.\n\nIf you're looking for a fighting game that you can invest yourself into for the long haul, Tekken 7 is the game for you. If you're a more casual fighting game player that just wants to play by yourself against the computer and not against other people then I'd look to Netherrealm or Ark Systemworks games to fill that need. That aside, this is easily the best tekken game since Tekken 5 maybe even as far back as Tekken 3 and I can't recommend it enough for people who love fight.

[/h1][/b]\n\n[b][u] Disclaimer, this is my first Tekken game, but I do have experience with other fighting games and have played a bit of the series at arcades and other friend's houses [/u][/b]\n\nTekken 7 is the first Tekken on PC and an amazing introduction to the series. The game compared to other triple A fighting games currently being made is no doubt at the top. The gameplay is smooth and so is the visuals ranging from effects, to the slow motion camera angles, to simply the look on Heihachi's signature hair. The singleplayer doesn't have the best voice acting from the narrator and feels unnatural and robotic, and the story isn't amazing but good quality for a fighting game and feels as it just makes the standard, but the cutscenes are impressive. However the story is a bit short but keeps you engaged, and doesn't give you ai that are jus bodies that are animated, but some feel like genunie opponents (to a certain extent). It is also funny to see how Tekken made Akuma feel better in this game, than in Street Fighter V, mostly because it's a redesign of the SFIV version of Akuma. The Treasure mode is a blast to play and I find myself playing that much more than I do the Arcade mode, and the online community is very nice and polite, which is very hard to come by and only makes it the frosting on the cake for me. Compared to other Tekken games it is a bit limited on customization as far as I am aware of, but that doesn't mean it's bad, it still has plenty of cool/funny/unique customization options for characters. Who wouldn't want to dress Bob up as a fat nerdy school kid with a tree on his head, or have Law look like a sterotype for a white guy in the 1800's? I recommend buying Tekken 7 regardless of a sale or not due to the amount of fun and replayability.
