D/Generation HD sure does the trick, and the game looks slick in 3D, with some nice touches here and there. But just because it looks slick, don't expect a fairly good game here. I mean, sure it reminds us of the good times when this game came out, and I saw love seeing the same levels and scenes remade in 3D and the nasty creatures and traps being given a nice enhancement - who here would expect those green turrets to be remade as red worms that spit explosives when they see ya, eh? - and the ability to save at any time is a nice touch, but there are issues here that make one wonder if the developers truly beta-tested their creation.\n\nFor starters, the courier's movements when running seem jerky - you make him sprint and he suddenly cuts back to the point where he had started to run. Next, the control scheme - it's not really as perfect as one could get, and it certainly could have been improved somewhat here. Other issues include the music - its nice, but I don't feel it too well here - the fact it doesn't feel any easier than the original, the lack of charm despite the nice graphics, and a few bugs here and there. One such bug is that if you die, any speech text on screen is stuck in place when you restart and doesn't clear itself away, meaning you miss out on dialogue later on, no matter what scene and level you move onto.\n\nAll in all, this is a hit and miss here - a nice effort to remake a classic game of the past, but the issues with it raise questions on whether this is a worthwhile purchase. If you like reminsicing on classic games, this might be for you, but play it with a strong amount of patience for the issues.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498644233, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498644233, "recommendationid": "32924693", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
