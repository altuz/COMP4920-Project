Final thing about design, it's entirely a game developed by beginners.\n\nBut underneath this beginner-made game is its uniqueness. The gameplay is enjoyable at least. I enjoyed running from point A to B. Kinda because I often play delivery guy. The AIs were easy to deal with too. At least they aren't impossible to take down. Did a lot of grinding for 10-30 minutes so I was able to get far and proceed towards the end of the game. I used every tactic of what a player would do in a top-down (car) shooter game.\n\nOf course there are several things I would've expected while I was busy trying to finish this game. That problem was: No conveniences, such as saving armor setups...at least that's the only thing I would've expected.\n\nFor a game at a beginner's level, I'd say it's worth my 3 and a half-hours of finishing this entire game.
