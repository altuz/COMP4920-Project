These sort of simulators are supposed to have poor controls which add to the humor level of the player's failure.

The truck then proceeded to ride me & my scooter for a street block, until we all crashed into a wall. Seems humorous? Not at all, stoic rooster face intact.\n\nThe majority of rounds end with you basically parked against a wall or object. Collisions should result in calamity.\n\nThere are no control settings. You are left to figure it out for your own. Which is ok unless things change for no reason. I played a few rounds & found that pressing select on my controller would do a fast round reset.

To be perfectly honest, it is definitely not worth the full sale price of $9.99 -- I bought it for $0.99 and I feel like, for that kind of price, it definitely was worth it. I could see the developers realistically charging maybe something like $3.00.\nIn terms of gameplay, if you love \"ragdoll-physics\" games, then this could be worth adding to your collection but I wouldn't expect anything near the level of \"depth\" when compared to the very popular Goat Simulator, etc.\nThe bikes are extremely hard to control. Typically, your rider has a very hard time just staying on his bike, let alone clearing jumps and collecting \"peace points\". However, this level of difficulty does not/did not leave me feeling frustrated or potentially enraged. Due to the simplicity of your objectives -- clearing rubble throughout town (simply by staying on the bike for as long as you possibly can) collecting peace points, and hitting ramps/speed-boosts -- it's actually, at least for me, incredibly relaxing. The game simply doesn't expect very much from you. Surgeon Simulator, on the other hand, frustrated me a lot faster, to the point that I simply stopped playing/lost interest (I'll just stick with Trauma Center).\nEventually, controlling some of the bikes gets easier and some of the riders are better for maintaining a good grip on your bike (example: Ninja), allowing you to hit those jumps, etc.\nI feel like it's a funny game, as most \"ragdoll-physics\" games usually are.
