Take with you: weapons, a valiant heart, and the Emperor's blessing, and engage the enemy where it makes its lair. Acknowledge death as it approaches, but do not succumb to its touch, for your purpose is great. You have proved yourself to be worthy of the status you now hold. I charge you now, go forth and vanquish the foe.\n\nDo not fail your brothers. \n\nThere is no enemy. The foe on the battlefield is merely the manifestation of that which we must overcome. He is doubt, and fear, and despair. Every battle is fought within. Conquer the battlefield that lies inside you, and the enemy disappears like the illusion he is.\n\nThe honour of our Chapter hangs in the balance, brothers. Failure is not an option.\n\nLook within yourselves, brothers, and you will understand. You have been waiting for this day, even if you did not know it. This day, when you are reminded of who you are. We are one great legion, one heart and one mind! We are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, the war gods and terrible swift sword of our Emperor!

Not at first (as you are greeted with wall after wall of text) but as you get into it and relax into reading stuff fully, it's a choose your own adventure book in game form.\n\nThere is some light combat (which is slow, but not terrible, and it keeps you on your toes) and some animations as well as sounds. The only repetative sound is \"Focus\" which sounds like something out of the 80s for the NES...\n\nThe story is pretty good, even though I have no love of the Imperial Fists. You get drawn in to the main character as things progress, and it was REALLY fun wiping out all the Orks (if only I had had a flamethrower).\n\nIf you don't know the terms in the Warhammer 40k universe (such as nethacardium, etc) it will help to look them up via google.
