Couldn't find a menu option to rewatch the tutorials.\n- Moe Kill (game mechanic): Instead of fighting the enemy you can make the enemy fall in love with the main character for faster grinding. Not very consistent and too random for my taste.\n- Combo attacks seems to be weaker than normal attacks.\n- Game crashes sometimes/Long loading time in battle\n- Time-consuming to get every achievement\n\nIf you like JPRGs then this game might be something for you. \nFor achievement hunters I strongly encourage not to buy this unless you want to spent a huge amount of time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500134323, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500134323, "recommendationid": "33562667", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514638", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499728069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1994, "steamid": "76561198034666581", "num_games_owned": 204}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I had hopes going into this based on what I had seen advertised, sadly I can't say they were met entirely.\nAside from clunky controls regarding battle and running around dungeons, after about halfway into the game I started encountering bugs or glitches in the form of audio chirps and character portraits stretching across the screen during certain side events, the affinity system was so odd it was awkward just trying to memorize it, I had ludicrous stats and levels but was getting my ass handed to me thanks to random crystal effects that I had to check every single time a battle started, the G-Castle battles were a nightmare until I realized how to grind for more peons to bring up it's power and even then most of it came down to rock-paper-scissors style combat which wasn't made any easier with the \"helpful hints\" in battle that were completely wrong at least half the time even when it was Ryuto giving them and not the enemy...\nHonestly, I can't say I'd reccomend this game to others, don't even get me started on the fact that it felt 80% like a Nippon Ichi game but then the last 20% was just... I can't think of nice words at this point in time.\nBottom line, if it's on sale for really cheap, then maybe give it a chance if you like these kinds of games, otherwise I can't suggest buying it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499746023, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499746023, "recommendationid": "33447340", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507369", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503596745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5410, "steamid": "76561198340446975", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Good anime game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500998211, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500998211, "recommendationid": "33789227", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480952", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 89, "total_reviews": 137, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 48}}
