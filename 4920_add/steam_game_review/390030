Nice graphics suits most specs out there so even dual cores can handle them, you won't need much to have neon sightings like dope in Tron-like colors. But it lacks photo mode for better delight.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1109433879\n\nDifficulty isn't exactly noob friendly but it's progressive enough to invite even arcade-phobes, if this isn't inviting enough then [i]Daniel Deluxe[/i] might be, because he beats your ears with intoxicating darkwave synth music and its pretty retro nuts. It is a good [spoiler]LSD[/spoiler] generator in rogue-like fashion, combat is addictive and blasts right up your veins, you just have to track all levels with upgrades, lots of tweakable weapons and different enemies and beautiful bosses all around divided zones in linear maps. Don't go looking for cover, fast pace is the law - run, jump, shoot, use level hazards, repeat - the AI can be very dumb but never static, though achievements are satisfying to best when slo-mo catches the momentum.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1109451913\n\nPausing this endorphin generator will play a low bass version of its sexy music, as if you were in a backstage and missing all the fun up there. If you don't want to feel like puking in the backstreet of some rave club, just find action and don't pause that game.\n\n[h1]WTF?[/h1]\nThis is one of those cases when a game has everything right to have some multiplayer mode available, but it simply doesn't.

(blame speculators if it gets higher after this) \"The Encounter\" is probably the rarest background but it looks more like Transformers homage than Desync's.

FPS is not a genre I generally play on a regular basis, so I found Desync to be rather challenging with its face-paced, high level difficulty.\nBut certainly not impossible.\n\nUnlike most games, Desync will throw you in with little to no tutorial and you will fail over and over again. You will be forced the hard way in learning the mechanics of each enemy, the layout of each level and what each unlockable weapon does. Desync will not dumb it down for you. There are times where it becomes so unforgiving that you'll want to punch your screen, pour water over your keyboard and set fire to your house. But keep at it. With practice and patience, getting over that hurdle or boss battle is the most rewarding feeling! \n\nDesync achieves what its set out to do, and that is to improve your skills. Revisit previous levels and you'll see exactly that. Again Im not a pro in this genre but if I can get through this intense, tron-like world, anyone can. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499862191, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499862191, "recommendationid": "33478265", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503931913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 962, "steamid": "76561198044826320", "num_games_owned": 363}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I did a video review for the game here, but if you prefer text then see below\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnOo1gCLIZo\n\n\nDesync is a fantastic entry into the arena shooter genre. While unintuitive and unwieldy at times, if you get past the initial frustration you'll bear witness to a real diamond in the rough. You will not enjoy this game if getting higher scores doesn't have any appeal to you, this isn't the kind of game you beat then shelf.
