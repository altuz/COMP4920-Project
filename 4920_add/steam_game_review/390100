I have followed it from the early days from when it was published by Acclaim to present day where it is now published by RedFox Games. What a journey it has been. I\u2019ve played it off and on since 2007 until I finally quit in early 2014.\n\nDo I recommend this game to new players? No. Stay far away from this.\n\nNot only is this game a grind fest, it also is heavily pay to win. If you look at the item mall, you will quickly see that you need to spend at least a few hundred dollars just to be mildly competitive. I put at least 5,000 hours into this game and I regret a lot of them. It was a fun game back in 2007-08, but it has gone nowhere but downhill since then.\n\nThe mechanics in place are designed so that players are compelled to spend money in the item mall if they want to stand a chance against other players or even be strong enough to complete higher level content. This is even further enforced by the strong gambling mechanics built into the game. If you want to refine your clothing or weapons (gives a nice stat boost), then you must risk losing them after refining them to a certain level. The crafting in this game is generally focused on success rate percentages. Some items have a 100% chance to make them. Other items have less than a 1% chance to make.  You can purchase things in the item mall that mitigates the risk of losing your precious gear.\n\nThis brings up a pay to win element. Being able to sell item mall items in the game severely disrupts the game economy and favors those who are willing to spend hundreds in the item mall. You would think that the item mall would at least be fairly cheap if the game requires it right? Prepare to spend hundreds of dollars just to have a chance at decent gear. Even the item mall is built around gambling with things like boxes which give you random items when you open them. They aren\u2019t cheap either and you could literally spend thousands and not get anything worthwhile from them.\n\nEven if you look past all of those negatives and see what the game has to offer, you won\u2019t find much. Besides endless grinding; there are a bunch of fetch quests that don\u2019t really give you much for your time. The combat is hot bar based and uses a unique active skill system where your character performs a set of animations depending on the active skill being used.\n\nThe story itself is mildly interesting the first time you play through it, but it isn\u2019t much different for each clan in the game. The maps themselves are small and the graphics are extremely dated. The game does has a sort of charm to it though. Something about the whole package is appealing at a first glance. It will be fun and interesting at first, but it quickly grows tiring and you\u2019ll find yourself playing for the next level instead of having fun. \n\nTL;DR? It's just another grind focused Korean MMORPG that reached its peak about 8 years ago.
