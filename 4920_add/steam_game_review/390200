I can only recommend this title if you can get it in a bundle and want something quick to play. Overall, this game is a mess. Artifex has published way better titles made by other developers.\n\n3/10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494771755, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494771755, "recommendationid": "31749337", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561999", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 17, "total_reviews": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 14}}
