It's neither great nor bad, it's simply good. If you enjoyed the 3D platformers of the 90's then this is a good pickup. I've beaten the main game (final boss) and still have yet to 100% everything but so far I've put in about 20 hours of some pretty solid gameplay. There are a few gripes here and there but nothing game breaking. My biggest qualm of this game is the amount of content, if you're looking for a game with many worlds to explore then this is not the one for you. There are only 3 worlds to explore, 4 if you count the final boss world, and while they do feel good and open there isn't a lot of substance there. None of the worlds feel like the first time time you loaded up Super Mario 64 and jumped into a painting for the first time. The level design isn't bad, just nothing really noteworthy. \n\nAll that being said for less than 15 dollars you really can't go wrong, if you got the money to spend and are in the mood for this type of game I'd say give it a go, especially with Yooka Laylee being the let down that it is.
