It's gross, it's disgusting, but at the same time it's so whimsical and happy.  This game made me cringe one minute, and smile the next minute.  It's an odd balance, but it works out great and I really enjoyed this game.  It's worth full price, but definitely get it on sale if you can. \n\nThe game is very forgiving with autosaves and you don't ever lose much progress if you die, which is really useful because sometimes you might get stumped on a puzzle, and a few of them can be challenging, but the developers want you to be able to actually easily experience the story of the game, so there's even a little hint button that gives you a little clue on what to do next.  So the game kind of holds your hand, but is that really a bad thing?\n\nYou don't have to use hints, and maybe you can even solve a lot of the puzzles quickly, but the main point is to experience the story and see what happens in the end.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves horror like me, and if you want a fun point and click adventure then check this one out! :3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499785779, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499785779, "recommendationid": "33457994", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501887", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 95, "total_reviews": 106, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
