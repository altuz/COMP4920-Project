But you start the game running a deficit, which means you must increase taxes, while managing police and army budgets, avoiding a revolution. Basically one of these gauges is always going to suffer as there is simply not enough money for you to win the game and manage the colony at the same time. Even so, the implementation is too clunky for it to matter, the reactions from the engine seem very drastic and I usually find myself being overthrown fairly fast. The transitition between turns is illustrated by days in which you see an isometric screen of what is presumably the presidential residence. The screen always flickers black whenever those sequences start and stop. There are not a lot of policies you can adopt and are often limited to just waiting for a request coming from one group or the other to implement changes. I found the user interface rather cryptic and not very pleasant. The choices are mostly made through a retro CRT computer, the old windows sounds it produces are unpleasant. I would had said to just make a larger menu since this is where you play the whole game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499741247, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499961602, "recommendationid": "33446240", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494571", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 25}}
