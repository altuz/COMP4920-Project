Boy was i wrong. This game is tons of fun. I just got it and already spent 13 hours [in one sitting mind you] playing this. Getting the colectables, beating the levels on each difficulty, getting the achievments...its all so fun. at times i really wish i could skip though dialouge i've already seen, but quickly mashing a gets through in no time. theres a lot of humor, references and fourth wall breaking.
