The avatars movments look natural when talking to other people. I felt no motion sickness moving around without the teleport and flying is really fun. The ability to shrink and grow in size just adds to the over fun of the game. Lots of locations to visit. If they keep working on this it will be like entering the matrix lol only for fun!!
