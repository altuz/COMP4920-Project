The result is hopefuly a more strategic fightning game, where learning to read the situation and act accordingly is what determines the winner (while other FG are based on that plus execution).\n\nThe characters that are already in the game are quite interesting. They manage to cover many of the typical roles of fighting game characters, plus some original interesting twists.

Fantasy Strike aims to be a fighting game that bridges the massive and empty gap between Divekick (the simplest fighting game, almost too simple) and other fighting games, which are notorious for being difficult to get into.\n\nFantasy Strike changes a lot of things that are considered core aspects of fighting games. There are no joystick motions to do a special move, it's done with a single button press. Instead of light/medium/heavy punch and kick buttons, there is just a normal attack button. Movelists are simple and an entire character can be described in half a page (with pictures!). Combos are also short and simple. The game can easily be played on keyboard (or any other control method of your choice), no special controller is needed.\n\nThe idea is stripping away these things allows you to skip the [strike]hours[/strike] [strike]weeks[/strike] [strike]months[/strike] years(?) spent learning how to control your character and go straight to the part of fighting games that dedicated players love - outsmarting and mentally destroying your opponent (and improving after getting destroyed yourself). And in a few minutes you can do just that.\n\nYou might be concerned that the game isn't deep without these things. [i]I[/i] believe it's deep, but it's understandable that you can't take my word for it. The only way you could really be sure is to play against a [i]good[/i] player yourself to experience the depth of this game firsthand. The developers used to tell doubters that they would gladly play against them in a long set and see if that changes their mind. You might have to wait for the game to have a free weekend or play it at another trade show/event/tournament (psst: go to evo!) for your chance at that.\n\nFantasy Strike admits that it is not a complicated game, which is great if you're in that audience of ex-Divekick players or non-fighting game players and want to get more into fighting games. But if you're already deeply invested into fighting games, Fantasy Strike will not completely replace the one you're playing and it probably won't be anything more than a fun game you play on the side. It will not scratch that itch that only Fate: Unlimited Codes will scratch for you.\n\nThe upside to that is that people from different fighting games can quickly learn and play Fantasy Strike against each other. If a retired Street Fighter player and a Tekken 7 player wanted to play against each other in a fighting game, it would take weeks for either to learn the other player's game enough to give them a challenge. In Fantasy Strike it would take mere minutes.\n\nThe game is still in Early Access, but most of the core features are there. There's an arcade mode, a decent training mode, and online play powered by GGPO netcode, the best netcode there is. The characters are balanced, but two are still in development. I like the eight characters we have, but it's possible the playstyle you like might not be represented. They want to add more and more to this game, but the core game is already great and already playable (it's just a little buggy.)\n\nPlay Fantasy Strike.

The problem is, I was in my mid 20s at the time and they had been playing fighting games since they were children.

I understood that once you get past the high barrier of entry, there's tons of strategic depth and mind games to be played at a high level.\n\nNeedless to say, when I heard about Fantasy Strike, I immediately signed up for the free weekends, backed its (now failed) fig campaign, and purchased the early access version on Steam as soon as it was available.\n\nFantasy Strike does an incredible job of keeping the strategic depth and mind games of more advanced fighters while having the controls simple enough that anybody could play it. I still more often lose to my much more experienced friends, but now I feel like it's almost totally on me needing to better learn the game rather than not learning the many control movements from a young age. But the game feels much more satisfying to play because I get less frustrated over my own limitations and enjoy learning the strategic elements of my character rather than how to pull off their super/ultra combos.\n\nI highly recommend this game to those like me, or to those who have friends like me that you'd enjoy playing the strategic aspects of fighting games but lack the fine motor skills to perform complex combos.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506277878, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506277878, "recommendationid": "35187919", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505329", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506730345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 167, "steamid": "76561198041903289", "num_games_owned": 683}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Just found out about this game one day before purchase and my only regret is that I hadn't  heard about it sooner.  This title is gorgeous and it shines from the moment you fire it up. Every part of the game has purpose from the artstyle, to the music, and most importantly the gameplay.  You can tell that love went into crafting Fantasy Strike.\n\nFantasy Strike operates on a six button layout, but don't let the simplicity fool you.  The depth that lies within is amazing. Combos can be formed from just a few button presses, and underestimating what your opponet is capable of will bring you to your knees. The control setup is as follows with a button for every action mentioned: jump, attack, special attack 1, special attack 2, super move, and a throw.  Every key having it's own dedicated button ensures that every move pulled off is 100% intentional and is simply ingenious.  You do have the option of setting jump to up on dpad, or joystick, and you can still initiate a throw by pushing forward and attack if that is what you prefer.  To counter throws you simply let go of all buttons and your character will break the throw.  Before you think that having special attacks set to a single button is going to allow a person to spam the heck out of the specials think again.  Some specials take away from your health bar, causing you to really think about if you want to risk using that move or not.  Every move feels impactful and has the sound effects to back it up.  This brings us to how the health bar is set up, and makes you wonder why this wasn't thought of years ago.  \n\nThe power bar is broken up into sections, so you know exactly how many hits your characters can sustain before defeat. The match count is extended with more rounds to ensure you still get your healthy dose of fisticuffs. The interface and layout of the entire game is smoothly streamlined, and operates with functionality over digging through countless menus just for the sake of digging.  Even though this title is in early access it still has an arcade mode, local versus, practice mode, and online quick match.  This title shines in every way and feels very polished.  Fantasy Strike truly is a breath of fresh air in the fighting genre. \n\nThis title is worth every cent and gets 2 thumbs way up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505779968, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506533164, "recommendationid": "35055220", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502420", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506825727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 142, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 330, "steamid": "76561198045862527", "num_games_owned": 15}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Super solid game for how early it is in its development! The game definitely has a strong feel of direction the devs want to go. The controls are intuitive and let you feel like you're actually playing the game very quickly. As a fighting game fan, it's awesome to be able to quickly apply what I know to characters I just picked up!  I'm terrible with grapplers because of 360's and 720's but Rook (this game's grappler) gives me all that sweet satisfaction of grapplers without that frustrating learning curve.\n\nThe characters are fairly interesting for the most part. Geiger and Valerie are my favorites design-wise. Valerie's smile needs some work though. It just looks really off... Setsuki is just punk Ibuki, and probably my least favorite. It was bad enough when I could tell she was Ibuki from her design, but her move set and animations are the same too. I would rather the devs give Setsuki her own original animations that accomplish the same things rather than making a straight copy.\n\nFantasy Strke feels like is still finding it's identity (which is absolutely fine when it's pre-alpha). The menu screen is very Overwatchy, and (as stated above) some of the characters go beyond borrowing inspiration from other fighting game characters. Geiger does it the best in my opinion. He plays like Guile, but the devs gave him his own personality, style, and feel to make him unique to the game. I hope the characters go more in that direction as the game developes, but I feel certain the game, as a whole, will settle into its own groove.\n\nIf you're remotely interested in fighters or just this game, I can say, with a fair amount of safety, that this game is going in the right direction and is worth the purchase.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505689133, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505720582, "recommendationid": "35034874", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501048", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505764563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561197974168586", "num_games_owned": 143}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I tried the demos during their Fig crowdfunding campaign.

Sure, you may not have to do quarter circles or dragon punch motions on the joystick (or gamepad, which this game supports wonderfully), but that's were the \"simplicity\" ends, and this is a good thing. With this barrier gone, players can focus solely on learning the concepts and styles of their characters, which all play quite uniquely from each other. Complex mechanics like Grave's wind blast enhancing each of his abilities or the strange zoning \"zen\" state you can get into playing Jania are not apparent at first. But looking into the mechanics, watching a few character videos, and the gameplay's depth with reveal itself.\n\nThe game will draw comparisons to Rising Thunder, another fighter that touts a low execution barrier, but I found it having much more in common with DiveKick, due to its lack of long combo strings and emphasis on character roles. Combos in FS are generally 2-3 hits at max, especially due to the low health of each character. While this doesn't trigger that great feeling of hitting a million hit combo in Marvel, it brings back a feeling of tension and emphasis on fundamentals that is welcome. That's another thing I like about FS: It could actually teach a lot about fighting game fundamentals to newcomers to the genre. Labeling each character as a specific type (Zoner, Rushdown, Grappler, etc) gives players an immediate view of the character, but beyond that, I'll just say that Zoning never clicked with me in other fighting games, and I don't know why, but it does here. I put much more thought into it, and I'm thinking a lot more about the opponent's distance and whether or not they can jump in on me. It's a great feeling of \"clicking\" with a genre, and reminds me of that same feeling I got with the encylopedia like approach to the FGC that VF4: Evo did.\n\nObviously, I like this game. Let's talk about some of the downsides:\n* It's barebones right now: Online, local MP, and an Arcade mode that simple says \"Congratulations!\" and boots you back to the main menu. The Congratulations actually makes me laugh every time, it's so quick. \n* Visual polish issues: There are still some things that stick out as possibly not complete or simply not blending into the rest of the game. I thought something was a bit off about Grave's clouds, and this was confirmed when someone walked by watching me play and said \"ew, what's that\". Same goes with some of the VFX and animations on Valerie, I feel like she needs to go back in the oven for a while\n\nGiven those cons, lets run over some understated highlights:\n* The AI. It may not be complex or robust, but it provides a challenge, learning curve, is fun to play against, and helps in learning the game. I think there's probably a great foundation here to expand the AI to be more unique to each character and possibly more like human opponents.\n* The health UI. It's seems so odd at first, but there's nothing like seeing the actually difference in health so blatantly. Rook has a bunch of pips. Valerie has 5. This makes so much sense. It also provides a fast and intense gameplay experience.\n* Gamepads! As mentioned you can play this on a gamepad (Xbox / PS4 style controller). This might be a \"no duh\" to you, but a lot of fighting game folks prefer using arcade style joysticks for these games, because the joystick allows for better execution of things like dashes, double / super jumps, and quarter circles. Well, with all those things gone, and no need for a 6 face button layout, this game has parity between gamepad and joystick. \n\nThere's a ton of potential here, but in the end, this game is already well worth the 20 dollars.

It has been fighting game professional turned game designer David Sirlin's baby for probably close to a decade. In that Fantasy Strike universe, he has set several card and board games, some excellent, some not so, but the man has a real passion for game balancing, game design, and fighting game mindgames. On many levels he understands this better than the guys who inspired him, Capcom, etc.\n\nYou can see this in Fantasy Strike. Even in its infancy, there's a lot of love here. Beautiful polish, great character designs* and animations, great soundtrack, and a game design that is really daring but extremely effective. Bear with me as I explain the system. In Fantasy Strike, your fighters only have about 6-10 HP. That's it. Each hit knocks off 1 HP. Your moveset is similarly simple, you just have three buttons that do three different moves, with three more in the air and two more directional basic attacks, some combo, some have changeups, or charge effects, or grab immunity properties. All this is explained in the movelist card for each character. From there, the game is really tense, not unlike Divekick or Slice Dice and Rice, but with actual movesets and mindgames. Each character feels wildly different and specializes in different aspects. Worth noting, the grab is also shaken up. It beats most attacks and blocking and can be fired instantly on wakeup or in most situations, but if you don't press any button or direction, you immediately counter any grab attempt. This changes the mindgames considerably. With the stakes high and every move a potential game changer, victory in Fantasy Strike feels like it comes from reading the game state and outwitting your opponent more than learning combos or memorizing frame data. It is wonderfully intense and winning or losing, it always feels like you're at the cusp of something to learn, as opposed to many fighting games requiring dozens of hours of practice and research to get to the point where actually playing MP can teach you things. And yet the balancing and the skill involved is on point; this is some tourney quality game design from a guy who actually used to play fighting game tourneys.\n\nIn its current state, Fantasy Strike has a barebones Arcade mode with decent AI, a training mode, local versus, and online matchmaking that can be done while you muck around in the other two modes. I have no complaints about the netcode or the ability to find a match.\n\nFantasy Strike is going to grow into something special.

Simply amazing. Been a fighting game player for 12 years, i played almost every fighting game but this game fulfiled my dreams. Fighting games are dying because modern gamers like simpler things. SF5 tried to achieve the easy gameplay but that just made the game retard\u00e9d. With fantasy strike you can actually learn a character in couple of minutes. And there are tons of cool zoning, amazingly designed characters and awesome setups with super moves. This game doesnt reqauire skill but it requires your brain!
