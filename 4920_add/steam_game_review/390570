I want to amend that: if you want a challenging math game, get Hexcells or something similar. Don't get Three Digits.\n\nIt suffers from the same lack of game advancement as Two Digits, in that there is no innovation between level packs, and they become very same-y very quickly. With fourteen numbers rather than nine you'd think that would make it more difficult, and you'd be right. But it's less a puzzle game and more a really bad point-and-click adventure. I solved most of the puzzles I've completed through pure luck, randomly clicking until I make a connection and figure out what number I need to make.\n\nThe music isn't the worst thing in the world, but it isn't fantastic either, some plinky-plonky piano which is cheerful if irritating when you notice it repeating. You can turn it off with a tick-box in the options, but it's worth noting that the volume slider beneath that box doesn't work - the volume simply reverts back to full when you exit. \n\nIt's not absolutely awful - there is something to be said for the challenge of it when you're playing it - but the sheer number of false starts and leaps of logic it takes to actually finish these puzzles make it difficult in the wrong way. There's less math knowledge at work here and more random clicking.\n\nI'm gonna finish it, because I'm nothing if not bloody-minded about gaming.

All you have to do is find two groups of numbers with the same sum. It's fun for me because I like the math, but the scale is a little large: Two Digits was easy enough by getting differences and making the ones place match, while Three Digits feels a lot like a guessing game at time. 11 or 12 numbers would have been a little better.\n\nThe game doesn't save your audio setting. The background piano gets very grating very quickly and I've muted it every time I've started the game- and had to keep doing so! The UI is simple. Too simple- there's no back button, instead the game has to TELL YOU to use the Escape key to go back- on an otherwise entirely mouse controlled game! Oh and should you tab out for whatever reason, say to check IMs after finishing a level... you'll find the game does not advance while tabbed out. Meaning every single slow level completion/load animation can't be multitasked. This is a little nitpicky, but it's a completely needless addition and I'm already in an admittedly petty mood from this game.\n\nUltmately, there are way too many flaws with this game.
