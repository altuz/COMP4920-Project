There's just no incentive to play the game. It can be challenging if you so choose (going for no death and going as quickly as possible), but the fact that you can stop at any given time to think about the next segment builds no tension. It's not a puzzle game, you're not forced to a certain rythm like in Super Hexagon, and the game is not as mechanically challenging as a Super Meat Boy. The music is also chill, which is pretty underwhelming for a game of this genre because it's not stimulating you to push yourself. All in all, there's just nothing exciting to do, and I find myself leaving the game just 10 minutes after opening it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506653608, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506653608, "recommendationid": "35280320", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504248", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 84, "total_reviews": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
