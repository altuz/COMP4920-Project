It's a highly addictive game that you can hop on and enjoy if you want a casual but fun experience. The character is a loveable alien who has been stranded in space. The levels are interesting, as you go on the game becomes more and more challenging which provides a sense of progression. The art style is creative while at the same time slick. The music is well composed and fits the game perfectly.\n\nI think the game would be better with more mechanics and more diversity within the levels. Another thing that should be added is a volume slider because the volume can be quite loud in game.\n\nHere are some ideas for the developer:\n\nCustomization for the ship and/or alien.\n\nAdd a co-op mode where two players control two different aliens in a race against time.\n\nOverall this is a great game to play and is definitely worth the price. If you are looking for a game you.can relax and play then pick this game up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498500921, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498500921, "recommendationid": "32824943", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
