I don't know what it is about it but it brings back so many memories of crappy made flash games. I actually enjoy playing it and unlocking everything adds a lot of more gameplay styles and capabilites.

I started programming games when I was 12 and have continued to pursue game development most of my life. I attended high school in Japan where I became fluent in Japanese and gained an appreciation for global issues. I have spent my adult life in Hawaii attending college and working part time as a bilingual fire arms instructor and sales associate. It has been a life long dream of mine to publish video games, which I accomplished with my first game, Call of Tomsk-7. After finishing that game, I wanted to try developing a game that even more people could play so I made Burn Pixel Wood available for free for everyone. \"\t\nSaling page's review : \"Fight for your life in Call of Tomsk-7, a simple side-scrolling shooter. Horrifying monsters are pouring out of the forgotten and abandoned Soviet-era Tomsk-7 biological weapons facility. You must fight the creatures in a seemingly endless battle of attrition.\"\nMy expirience after successful  walkthrough till the demanding explosion : [u] It's a modest but at the same time mysteriously charming survival shooter. Call of Tomsk-7 require a tedious work to reach a result. Developer established an in-game helping page for newcomers with exhaustive information. Additional plus is  adoring \"secret\" soundtrack for the \"secret\" top-hat mission that you can get hiding as a small hat-like button on the right corner of the main in-game menue. \t[/u]\nConclusion : read a guides first then give it a try !
