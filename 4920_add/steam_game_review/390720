The game has a cute aesthetic based on chibi models, simplified yet interactive backgrounds, and catchy + cute electronica soundtracks.  It involves massing up rioters to gain abilities (which can also be lost if you lose rioters at certain thresholds), some of which you need to traverse, but the game works well in that you can find other routes and means to get through the level with what is given.  New abilities range from improving speed or stomping, to bouncing and endless projectles, as well as ludicrous ones like enamoring cops with cuteness or grabbing buildings and throwing them on your enemies.  Though I see the most usage out of the molotovs one.\n\nWhile the game itself is short, that is only if you intend to breeze through it without engaging it's ranking system.  Getting S ranks in cities can earn you cosmetics, from kimonos to tuxedos.  Also getting more critters unlocks special gliterry eyed exclusive animals that can only be gained if you gather all the critters of the city they are tied to.  But it takes alot of practice to get those S ranks, especially with how the crowd controls.  A bit wonky, seems to follow an invisible actor of sorts that they use to rally around judging by how they may crowd and circle at some times.  They also seem to be averse to bunching up to walls, so you may have difficulty trying to grab props to throw if they are in corners.  That said, it's not all that hard to get used to and once you get the hang of it the means to avoid danger is much easier than it initially seems, good reflexes help with reactionary stuff like mines and shock towers.\n\nSince this game runs in Unity, it could use a level designer function so people can make levels, and with steam workshop functionality they could effectively give this game more life.  But I can understand if that is off the table considering it's been out for a year.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game and I recommend it.  Heck, I even 100% it and I don't typically go for achievements and I did those while I was at it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505115460, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505117917, "recommendationid": "34878278", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506849", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506827357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 176, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 176, "steamid": "76561198005592808", "num_games_owned": 413}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's fun and cute, and reminds me a lot of Katamari Damacy (you have to grow your \"crowd\" to unlock new abilities and access new areas). .
