I highly recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of top-down shooters or someone that is starting to get into shooters of this type.\n\nThere is no story, you pretty much go from level to level defeating enemies while fighting bosses along the way.  You keep fighting until you lose then you start the whole process over again.\n\nThe gameplay is what makes it fun, watching the enemies explode is quite amusing.  There are different characters with their own special wepons that you can use to wreak havoc onto your enemies.\n\nAlso, this game can shoot in 8 directions only, but most of the time you mainly shoot in the 4 directions.  This isn't really a problem and I kind of enjoy it this way for the game.\n\nOne downside that I am not quite fond of which others might not like either is the power up system.  As you kill enemies they drop these blue crystals, you collect them to power up your weapon, and the more crystals you collect the stronger your weapon becomes.  But as you shoot or take damage you weapon starts to lose power and actually downgrades to a weaker weapon.  I know this system is a bit lame and kind of a downer, but it is really not that bad.\nThere are many opportunities to gain crystals to power up your weapon, the lowest I have dropped is weapon lvl 2, I don't think I have ever downgraded to my basic weapon (lvl 1) and I shoot quite a bit, but not spamming though.  Also, I have deliberately downgraded my weapon to 1 throughout the levels, you can still kill enemies but it'll just take you a bit longer.  So you're not really dead in the water, thank goodness, although I would like to see a buff in weapon lvl 1 damage eventually.\n\nOverall this is a very fun game, it is great to pick up and play whenever you want to shoot some enemies.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451037793, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451037793, "recommendationid": "19932058", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508510", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501561651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 905, "steamid": "76561197973172334", "num_games_owned": 270}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "4", "review": "Wow what an awesome twin stick shooter !!!   I swear this game brings back fond memories of sitting in front of the SNES with a Coke and some Cheetos playing Smash TV all night long.....the only difference is Circuit Breakers is MUCH more challenging.   The challenge not only comes from the amount of enemies and bullets you have to deal with but also from the fact that you must make every one of your shots count.  Fire too rapidly in excitement and you'll expend too much ammo.  This in turn downgrades your weapon power and leaves you running instead of facing the onslaught.   To counter balance this issue you've got to grab all the ammo enemies drop to level you weapon back up.  This leads to situations where you can't just endlessly kite enemies.  You've got to really think about where you are heading, what you are shooting, and how you will maneuver through an endless robot hell to keep your weapon powered up.  It's an interesting little system I've never seen before and it adds some tactical thought into what would otherwise be just mindless fun.

The controls are amusing, and the indepth setup said controls is commendable. Circuit Breaker's music and retro art sets it apart from the clutter of games with recognizable tunes and indiscernible drawings. Its rooms are delightfully varied and enjoyable, yet successful in not distracting the player from gameplay. The quick pace of the game is what makes it so addicting; being able to run at, run away from, and shoot at the robots in a swift manner creates a rush of adrenaline that makes you want to keep pressing the start button. The game does a great job of keeping the player actually focused by employing a system of crystals used to upgrade characters' weapons and double as ammunition. Instead of mindless shooting, you have to constantly pick up more crystals as you shoot so your weapon doesn't downgrade.\nOne of my favorite things about this game is how oddly soothing it is to shoot at the robots.

Better hope your buddies are too, 'cuz you're gonna need 'em.\n\nCircuit Breakers is a fun little Smash TV-inspired blastemup that puts one to four players in rooms loaded with aggressive robots, with every 10 stages ending in a challenging boss battle.  The four characters available each have their own weapon:  Aldo uses machine gun, Shelby's a shotgunner, Tay fires lasers, and Samson's got the rocket launcher.  I'm sure Circuit Breakers is a great time with pals, but what if you prefer to go it alone?  Well...\n\nYou see, I've been spoiled by one of my favorite games, Assault Android Cactus, so I went into Circuit Breakers in hopes of getting the same thrill of blasting through hordes of enemies while also getting overwhelmed by them.  However, the robots aren't the only opposition in this game, as one will discover just how strict this game is when it comes to simply shooting them.  Much like with Assault Android Cactus, there is a weapon level system that allows you to collect \"energium\" crystals from downed enemies to level up your weapon.  However, unlike with the other game, shooting your weapon here uses that precious energium, and at an alarming rate.  Level down your weapon, and it's not gonna do a great deal, yo.  So, aside from gobbling up them-there crystals, you need to keep your gun from weakening by avoiding damage and using short, controlled bursts if you want to survive.  Otherwise, it's \"GAME OVER, MAN, GAME OVER!\"  Don't fret though!  If those enemy bullets enter the fray, you can use your Shield to reflect them back at your opponents -- at the cost of energium.  Well, at least you're allowed to rush to the next room when prompted, with no need to kill every single baddie.\n\nSure, the energium gimmick is a unique idea, and I eventually adjusted my mindset to play by the game's rules.  Unfortunately with Circuit Breakers, those rules grew more annoying session after session, as I already had enough on my plate.  There is a good variety of enemies you'll face, and you'll grow to really hate some of them as you dance around the cybernetic swarms -- any dash-attacking droids and \"bullet-sploders\" are at the top of my list.  After defeating a boss and advancing to the next area, the enemies and their attacks become faster, making life more difficult for you and your gun as you grow desperate in staving off the aggressive A.I..  I ultimately realized that being a lone wolf here was foolish when I saw myself barely chipping away at the third boss' health bar during its berserk mode.\n\nOh, and Circuit Breakers doesn't believe in Continues.\n\nI really want to fully embrace Circuit Breakers, with its charming 2D graphics and lovely sound and music.  However, like I said, I've been spoiled by another similar shooter that provides a good challenge that happens to be more sensible.  If all of this is still appealing to you though, I would like to recommend this game.

It costs Energium to fire every shot, and most foes drop Energium pellets.  The more Energium you have the more powerful your gun is, the less you have the weaker your gun is.\n\nSo this means the core game is kiting enemies into a blob then shooting so as not to waste a single shot. Because if you do, you will find your weapon becoming slowly degrading in power.\n\nWhich means you have a shooting game where the core mechanic is all about NOT SHOOTING.  I get the intention behind having a \"gun power\" resource, but it should never have been made to deplete with each shot.\n\nWhen I play shooting games I want to blast the living &@#*%^ out of everything on the screen, not tediously kite around with my finger OFF THE TRIGGER.\n\nAside from the broken core mechanic, here is the rest of the gameplay experience:\n\nLevel 1 - Basic room where I shoot robots and learn the ropes\n\nLevel 2 - Died a few times intentionally to learn the health mechanics\n\nLevel 3 - Ok I got the mechanics, LETS PLAY!!!\n\nLevel 4 - Hmm...
