You don't directly control the party during the quests, which is fine, but you don't get anything that bonds you to the characters which is really what this game should be about.

Well, I've been playing OOTP for 13 years and games like it for much longer than that. And no... it's not like OOTP in the least. It has very vague aspirations in that direction but it's far too simplistic. It's more like a very basic mobile game that's been converted to PC. You will see everything that this game has to offer in the first 10-15 minutes of play.

Sure, you can figure it out from the character screen by noticing that there are zero days left, but instead of doing it that way, have big bold red letters that say \"NO PACT!\" Who knows, if a pact ends, you might even have the game ask if you want to extend the pact and take them to the screen to do it if they say yes.\n\nInterface: the interface is dated and clunky. Quitting the game gives me a a standard Windows confimation box with a Windows ding instead of a custom one. Makes me feel like I've just crashed the program instead of tried to exit.\n\nStats: What do stats do? As far as I can tell, they do nothing because there is no indicator when something happens if your stats helped/hurt you. How about giving me some target numbers and die rolls to show the stats actually at work. Anything less might as well mean you threw random numbers at me at the beginning of the game and never use them again.\n\nCombat: This is the worst offender. Combat is sheer luck. I might as well be flipping coins or playing rock/scissors/paper. How do I know what morale might be before combat. THat sure seems random. How do I know anything about how terrain might affect combat aside from a wag. (If you don't know what a wag is, the \"g\" stands for guess). The cards then are not really important since you don't even have a rough idea of what the random modifier may be.

To say a game is not \"worth\" 99 cents is one thing, while to not recommend it is another. Is the game worth 99 pennies? Maybe. 199 pennies? Perhaps. Do I recommend you spending any number of pennies on this? No.\n\nWhat to expect, from my game journal:\n\n[8 September 2016]\nI bought this game based on its self-description: \u201ca casual RPG/Sim game which combines the feel of an RPG with roster management sim mechanics.\u201d Thus far, it is exactly what I was looking for, but whatever RPG elements are purportedly within the game, I cannot find them. It seems more like a fantasy sim would be a more apt description, the RPG element being a misnomer without more role playing elements to the game. In that sense, it might be better described as a JRPG without any combat or storyline. But with all critique of the self-description aside, the first hour of playing it was a lot of fun, though repetitive. As for how repetitive, I haven\u2019t decided yet.\n\n[13 September 2016]\nAs soon as Heroes of the Storm went down for maintenance, but only after realizing that all Blizzard games were going down for maintenance, I decided this a good chance to break down the game\u2019s nuts and bolts. Overall, the game is pretty intuitive, assuming that the player reads the text tips on each screen.\nTo kick things off, you have the choice of how long of a campaign you want to play, limited either by a term of years or a fixed amount of quests unless selecting the endless campaign option. Then, you\u2019re given some gold and told to hire six adventures, who at first blush seem to not be different from others in any way other than their statistics and pact duration, i.e. time that they\u2019ll be at your service.\nLooks can be deceiving, as the old saw says. Each adventurer has two traits, some good, some bad. Examples of the former include having a lower chance of injury while off questing, finding more treasure on quests, or learning more quickly at the school (oh\u2014there\u2019s a school to improve attributes at the cost of gold). The latter\u2019s examples include perceived laziness and, my favorite description, a tendency \u201cto suffer silly injuries and not try to fight through them,\u201d indicating that the character, once injured, might be sitting on the bench for longer than usual.\nAfter hiring six adventurers, a player has several options for how to go about his or her turn: (1) Send one to four of your six adventurers on a quest; (2) Perform administrative malarkey including healing, resurrecting, or negotiating pact terms for the adventurers; (3) Hire new adventurers to sub in when others are dead or are otherwise released from their pact; (4) Send adventurers to school to improve their stats; (5) Redeem prestige points; and (6) Draw a random minion card for the displayed cost in gold. Only the first and last of these are worth elaboration, with the first potentially resulting in combat, injury, treasure troves of gold, death, morale boosts or slumps.\nDuring combat, a player can use up to three minion cards to improve the chance of winning. In fact, it\u2019s the only way a player can directly influence a combat. Putting the management in roster management, the adventurers are otherwise on their own, and the combat is resolved based on their, and their enemy\u2019s, character stats. Note that the player doesn\u2019t know the combat strength of the enemy until the player uses (or doesn\u2019t use) minion cards.\nUnless I\u2019m mistaken, which I\u2019m known to be, the game suffers in the management department by requiring a player to send at least one adventurer to one of three quests to complete a turn. Differently stated, to advance a turn in the game, the player has to select from one of three quests, rather than sending any combination of adventurers to complete different quests. As a leader of a band of merry men, or at least merry so long as their morale is kept high, it seems this would, or should, be a feature. Alas, \u2018tis not.\nIn closing, I must complain about the game\u2019s audio button, namely because it doesn\u2019t work. I must also complain about the game\u2019s aesthetics, lackluster to be sure. A good game in this genre need not be a stellar work of art, but it must at least fulfill those hallmarks of a roster management sim in lieu of pretty graphics. The inability to simultaneously dispatch your adventurers to multiple locations leaves me wanting more, too.\nBut because I\u2019ve been tinkering around with it in endless campaign mode, I\u2019m trying to reserve judgment until completing the game with fixed parameters. Specifically, beginning with a 30 quest campaign, followed by 60, then 25 years, and finally 50 and/or 100 years, depending on how long the game manages to keep my attention and/or how awake I am when Blizzard maintenance ends. To say things are not looking good for this game, both as to my humble opinion of it and its subpar graphics, is an understatement.\n\n[14 September 2016]\nThe Thirty-Quest Campaign. I lost halfway through. There may be more here than meets the eye, because I\u2019m going again. There actually was a semblance of a story unfolding, as well as other events such as internal strife within my team of adventurers that I could not quell, so I recant to a minor degree my complaint of it lacking RPG elements proclaimed in the game\u2019s description. Still, far from RPG it is, and nothing in my failure of the thirty-quest campaign changed my mind to the contrary. Nor do I anticipate my mind being so changed upon successful completion of this, or any, campaign. But not to demur what entertainment value the game does provide, my ordinary snap-judgment senses are being proven true, and I doubt whether I will ever successfully complete a campaign or if this game will ever be reopened on my PC.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1482930963, "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1482903913, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485224002, "recommendationid": "28740525", "developer_response": "I fail to understand why a game that you might have enjoyed for a few hours for 99 cents (and you got it for free!) deserves a negative.

It just didn\u2019t work for me.\n\nPros\n- Interesting approach to creating parties with members that come and go based on their fees\n- Relatively quick to get into, even with the lack of context and tutorials\n\nCons\n- Weak tutorial, couldn't find a walkthrough, some things aren't intuitive as they could be and more help could be provided\n- Too much randomness throughout the game.\n- I didn't feel I was building to something, quests come and go, team members come and go, \"strategic goals\" didn't have context or any sense of character building\n- \"Me\" in the game was simply a named thing?  Weird that they didn't build RPG elements into the main character of the game\n- Combat system is again, uncertain.  You know very little about the opponents and just select your minion cards (if you have some) and press Done.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1472352029, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1472352029, "recommendationid": "25196332", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498824", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444945211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 44, "steamid": "76561198006960784", "num_games_owned": 130}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "3", "review": "This game should have de \"early acces\" tag, as it's clearly not finished. Grab it if you feel ocnfident the devs will continue to work on it and if it's cheap; could be a good surprise in a few months.\n\nThe overall concept is quite good, but it's somehow confusing. You manage a party of adventurers, then send out only one team to a single quest per \"season\"; then the adventurers face some evil foes and engage in a...pokemon/card combat where you have \"minions\" (monsters of your own) that fight the enemies...I was expecting to see my warriors facing the monsters.\n\nFor a type of game that is basically a UI (a managing game), the UI is poor; needs more work, time and visual feedback as better floating textes, highlight buttons, better fonts (and pop-up screens). A back button would be handy, specially in the screen where you select the warriors you send (if you prompt me with a text saying that this action ends the turn, you should allow me to go back). And please, make a custom Save and Exit screen, generic Windows alert screens are not cool.\n\nThings that should be improved:\n- More responsive UI\n- Less text, or better placed\n- Text fonts\n- Better help screens and floating texts.\n- Allow for adventurers name customization.\n\nI paid little for this game, so I'm not disappointed but I'd like to see how far this game can get.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444824096, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444824096, "recommendationid": "18468850", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501203", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454802733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1, "steamid": "76561198049374190", "num_games_owned": 337}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Played the game for about 30 minutes.  I am not really impressed, it is missing the wow factor that would make me want to continue playing any longer.    \n\n*During my play through I place my adventurers on many quests and was unable to raise my gold level past 10,000. It was a continual loss of gold, with very little gains. \n*You contract your adventurers for 1-4 years. Each quest is a season long, four quests equal 1 year.  At the end of their contract you have to pay for them again or contract a fresh adventure. So if I can't make money and have to pay large amounts of gold for unskilled adventures what the hell is the point.\n*If there was a way to allow my adventures to rest without having to send anyone else out on a quest, it was lost in the explaination on how to play.  \n*Can't equip your adventurers to make them better party members.\n*Combat is one sided, set for you to loose.  Even on the easy adventures.\n*Apparently all my adventures are stupid.  Random bad luck occurs on every mission causing needless loss of life or permenantly bad statistics added to my characters. (yeah that is fun, instead of character progression, every quest my adventurers suck more)\n\nThere are more reasons not to play this game but I am too frustrated to list them all.

With this considered, this is a very good game if you like casual text and statistic based adventures in a high fantasy setting. This clearly won't appeal to all, but it definitely does to me as I like fantasy settings, detailed stats and management and reading stories and seeing random results based on my management.\n\nAdvice - Play this game once through for an hour to get stuck in.  Then start the game again, play through and read every '?' help bubble going.  After one hour you'll know if you like it to keep or want a refund.\n\nPositives:\n- You select 6 heroes to manage, each with unique abilities /100. You have to choose carefully what to do with them - rest them to heal or pay for healing? Send them on a quest, or send them to training? Choices will have a decision on morale.  You also have to choose who to hire again for another season of adventuring, and who to fire.\n- The quests can go different ways. Either you just get a story reported back, you enter a card game driven battle (simple mechanics of pick 1<3 support cards to play), you get to choose a path to take, whether to open a chest or not, and in some cases this game turns into the TV show 'Strike It Lucky' - choose 'Top, Middle or Bottom' across 3 colums, and try to avoid the 'Hot Spot' aka Trap.  The other two options are treasure or very tough monsters to fight.\n- I found myself thinking 'Just one more turn...' (i.e. Adventure).  Always good in a game, the addictiveness.\n\nImprovements required:\n- The developer is active in this game so look forward to more community aided improvements that may hopefully increase variety of encounters.\n- Could do with Steam achievements and Trading cards, but for the money I pay, it's still excellent value.  Achievements would be a no. 1 improvement for me.\n- If you're not into text and numerical games, and like top end graphics and real time action, avoid this game.  This game after all is around a 50MB download!  You have to imagine in your mind what's going on sometimes and how it would play out, something sadly lacking today in a lot of games.\n- May get a little repetitive, but again, it's cheap and good for a good few hours of play here and there.\n- There is no tutorial or manual, but you don't need one as its all explained within the interface.  As a positive: The interface is actually simple, well thought out, unlike the UI of a lot of games these days. This ones actually intuitive and useful, everything where you want it to be.\n\nBuy it - it's good value entertainment for fantasy and management fans! A very niche market, but good for those who enjoy the niche.  I suspect a lot of negative reviews are from people who don't like that niche or appreciate what the game is attempting to deliver.
