I can now replay 20 of these to achieve a star for completing them with a single attempt. Presumably, the other 30 levels are either too easy or depend on blind luck, much like a pachinko machine.  (Or maybe there were only 20 levels, and the numbering is weird? Who knows.) There are two or three challenges where you need to think out of the box.\n\nThere's no storyline, the game has been designed for touch interfaces to the point where there's no task bar icon, you need to enter your name using the onscreen keyboard, and you drag or click on everything, which doesn't exactly suit levels like the one with the two flippers.\n\nI can see this being a good-looking very short (45 minutes) time-waster on a touch device, but for a desktop game it feels overpriced.

Not that it\u2019s so difficult, but I needed some time to think.\n\nHow unfortunate that as humans we are only able to grasp a concept through comparisons, games perhaps being a more extreme example of that limitation. But to compare based on the most superficial aspects is just ridiculous. Those who see Collisions on the Store Page, then immediately think \u201cLimbo\u201d clearly got no further than a quick glance. Those saying \u201cNightSky\u201d are perhaps a bit closer to the mark, but still quite a ways off way off. (Actually, I\u2019ve yet to finish either of those two games. Collisions is much easier, considerably more inexpensive.)\n\nCollisions is a very nice game all on its own. The goal is perhaps the simplest possible, while also a metaphor for all life: move a ball from Point A to Point B, then again and again\u2026. through some 50 levels using the simplest of mouse clicks and drags. If you want the challenge of NightSky (now I\u2019M doing it!) you may be disappointed, because Collisions is essentially a pleasant way to spend an hour or so, whether you\u2019re an 8-year old child, or an old person with time on their hands, such as myself, who doesn\u2019t always want to start the day with a life or death challenge. (But then again\u2026.SPOILER.)\n\nNone of these Collisions challenges spend more than a moment even in the neighborhood of seeing the shadow of rage-inducing off in the distance, but can nonetheless be satisfying to resolve. If you love pinball as I and most of my friends do, you\u2019ll see that the DEV must as well to base some of the most interesting (IMHO) levels on hitting a ball with a flipper, so s/he must be pretty OK. Some levels aren\u2019t challenges at all, but simply movements on the player\u2019s part to create a mood, or teach an action that may be encountered later. In fact, if I still taught or had grandchildren I would likely use this game for bonding, or perhaps for evaluating a child\u2019s abilities. (Or even an adult\u2019s.) A very good diagnostic tool I should think, mostly because it really is fun. And so much easier to continue to the next level than to contend with the challenge of walking away while still wanting to see what comes next.\n\nOne of the more enjoyable aspects of Collisions are the comments (often hints) placed on each level. They display some of the humanity of the DEV, and they are as welcome as they might be out of context in this review.\n\nThis is one game that should be played to the very end, as the ending is both amusing and disturbing, and is a great comment on the degree to which we assign meaning to our lives (my ID being a similar comment), and the world we live in\u2026.for now. If you can get this game on sale, it\u2019s a must buy.

Not only will you NOT DIE hundreds of times over, as you are surely doomed to do in Limbo/Feist (your \"character\" in this instance is a ball making its way through semi-industrial, pinball-styled \"landscapes\")...but furthermore, the nature of Collisions' puzzles are perhaps best described by the very \"zen\" catchphrases which appear on screen, such as \"Patience is the companion of wisdom\".  Indeed.\n \n   Normally I'm not a great fan of such Buddhist-y musings, but in the context of this game they're perfectly appropriate, if not exactly groundbreakingly profound.  So who would I recommend this game to?  Well, anyone who can get behind a non-violent, mostly timing-based puzzle game, which isn't all that \"long\" (it took me a little over an hour to complete) or especially \"hard\" (I'm actually quite rubbish at these kinds of games)...yet has a nice visual and aural aesthetic which ushers one into a state of relative calm and so on and so forth and blah-blah-blah.  In fact, it's a wonderful antidote to the frequently \"troll\"-ish nature of gaming and the internet in general, as it has a tendency to tell you when you're \"doing great!\" and what-not; as opposed to, say, a game of Left 4 Dead 2 Versus, in which you will be informed by teammates of how \"shit\" you are at least once every two to three minutes of gameplay (and that's if you're playing with the NICER folks who play Left 4 Dead 2...the TRUE ass-holes would've simply \"kicked\" you two to three minutes INTO the game, period).\n \n   So if it's a relatively serene, laid-back, and only ever-so-slightly \"frustrating\" time you're looking for, and you have about an hour to spare, this could well be a game for you.  I'm not too sure about the four dollar price-tag (I got it for two), and there's obviously a fuck-tonne of very angry people out there in Steamland who will complain even if they pay well under a buck for a mere hour's gameplay, so if you're one of those people...YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  It's short, you don't get to shoot anyone, and there aren't any virtual lap-dances.  So if you fancy a game which makes you feel like a bad-ass, mo'-fuckin' PIMP, this may not be for you.

It seems like they put a lot of effort into the engine. Good marks there.\n\nI will not be recommending it for the following ( 4 ) reasons.\n   1. It took me longer to pay for and install the game than it did to complete. Needs many many many more levels.\n   2. Oversimplicity.  To me, this is a mini-game that belongs in a bigger title. No real nuance, just physics fun.\n   3. Any degree of difficulty is out of your control. If a level calls for timing, there are usually other elements that disrupt that timing.  When this happens it feels like you're at a pinball machine with the plunger, but no paddles. Frustrating for the wrong reasons.\n   4. Please add a \"point of no return\" feature on levels where (if you miss) you have to spend agonizing seconds waiting for your ball to roll into the wrong hole before you can focus on trying again.  On the level that I'm thinking of, just move the failure threshold from the point the ball goes off screen, to the point where the ball hits the \"floor\". Then when you miss the correct hole, you're already thinking about your next shot.\n\n\n\nFix these things and the game will be worth $10-$20. As is, it's not quite worth the price.

I tried changing the settings.ini file to turn it back on and checked the cache, neither of which solved the problem. Luckily I have a combination laptop/touchscreen, so was able to continue playing. I still have quite a few achievements left to gain, but I finally worked my way through all of the puzzles just now, and when the music at the end began playing I knew I had to stop and write my review right that minute! If my online name is puzzling to many (elpfan), it stands for Emerson, Lake, and Palmer fan. They were a prog band who began their career together in 1971, and whose second album release was their adapted and added to version of Modest Mussorgsky's \"Pictures At An Exhibition\", which also happens to be the closing music to Collisions! And while the devs didn't use ELP's version, I love the music regardless of who performs it, and greatly appreciate the fact that someone else loved it enough to make it the finale for this game. \n\nI know - as a game review, this one sucks. But honestly, it's a physics based get the ball to go places game, having a nice ambience, beautifully understated background graphics throughout, and an everchanging soundtrack of music and sound effects that soothe rather than intruding. Even with my disappearing cursor, I can easily give this game a 4.5 out of 5. I'm going to have to find the solution for the cursor though, if I plan on playing it much more...the pad of my forefinger is practically numb from trying to  bounce and spin and flip and otherwise maniipulate the flippers and buckets and wheels that move the balls around. Imagine playing an old-style pinball machine, but that you have to flip the flippers each time with your fingertips. There are times when speed and reflexes absolutely make a difference, and, while I have a sore finger, I also noticed that my gameplay improved considerably when using the touchscreen as opposed to controlling play with the touchpad and buttons.\n\nI'll be going back and playing more - if for no other reason than to make it all the way to the end again! Besides - I haven't gotten to kill any bugs yet, and I have a lot of frames that haven't turned yellow.
