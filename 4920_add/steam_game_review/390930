The gameplay is straight forward enough for players to into the game quick while having a fair amount of customizing options to make each game session different.  The weapons and mods you unlock have different strengths/weaknesses, allow players to try out different methods on how to play throught the various levels.  Each time you beat a level, you must choose a challenge which will carry over to the other rounds, which makes for some chaotic fun for you and your friends.  However, if you play the game by yourself, the game will get boring pretty quick, especially since you can unlock everything within 2-3 hours.  But if you got friends that want simple fun with easy to learn gameplay, AIPD is worth giving a shot.\n\nRating: B", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454057201, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454057201, "recommendationid": "20821968", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498581", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1473714232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 300, "steamid": "76561198003523412", "num_games_owned": 545}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's highly addictive, quite customizable, fast paced, simple to play, quite hard to master Twin Stick shooter.\n\nBuy it whenever you can", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1473459538, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1473459538, "recommendationid": "25433200", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1455959125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 148, "steamid": "76561198138681230", "num_games_owned": 197}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "https://youtu.be/YPs0tQImeq4\n\nA fun classic styled arcade shooter in design is similar to geometry wars if you like that asthetic, the music is great, and the gameplay is simple enough for hours of enjoyment.

Unlocks took a bit too long to unlock.  I was already bored of my existing weapons by the time I got the new ones.  The game lacks any real ability to bring yourself back from poor performance so it misses out on the rush of a comeback that games like Crawl do so well.  Surviving a level was always overshadowed by \"well now my health is low for the next level.\"  The sheer amount of enemies can be a little overwhelming so I always ended up missing the enemies that really mattered until it was too late, which would be forgiveable if all punishments didn't hurt your entire run.  I also may have been missing enemies because the camera is not centered on the player,  but enemies can still come from the short side of the screen which gives them an arbitrary advantage.  Ultimately it just ended up feeling like a slow crawl towards inevitable death and that crawl didn't feel particularly engaging.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454174915, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454175758, "recommendationid": "20852834", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498289", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466822530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198043040281", "num_games_owned": 489}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The game has nice graphics, but it's simply not fun.\n\nIt's extremely repetitive, even for a bullet hell type of game, and controller support is mediocre.
