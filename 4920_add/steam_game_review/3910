When I originally got this game it was super buggy, then I bought it off Steam and it was really buggy... wouldn't load. Basically realized you have to go in and change the compatability mode in order to play on Windows 10. After doing that it plays just fine. I like destroying Rome..all roads lead there and they're easily killed."}]}
