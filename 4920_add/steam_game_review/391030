I played this from a retail copy in 2008 or 09.\n\nThis game is a great old game for hardcore rpg fans. Has a brilliant story, a book adaptation in fact. But at the beginning, progression is rather slow. hence this is an actually long game to finish and with the adaptation aspects; slow progression isn't a negative factor for me. But even with that, from the certain point (after 4-6h playtime) it becomes very, very interesting. \n\nGameplay is clunky, but isn't anything unplayable. Acceptable for the time its release. One can expect magic for a medieval-style game, but this game has a very different sort of concept, and it's good.\n\nI highly recommend who likes a good rpg and doesn't mind the graphics.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499112372, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503956141, "recommendationid": "33199987", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505984", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "total_reviews": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
