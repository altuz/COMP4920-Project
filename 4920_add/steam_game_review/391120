The developers were gracious during similar feedback from other players, and as they worked to improve the game, the clip became irrelevant and was discarded.]\n\nWhen the game begins, it seems that the developers are hoping to tell a substantial story about mental illness. But it falls apart immediately - whether by your character's goofy, 19th century diagnosis (neurasthenia!), swallowing meds with no clue which of your SIXTEEN traits was affected, or having maxed-out \"Homicide\" and \"Psychosis\" with no effect but blurry vision. Despite a successfully tense atmosphere, there's no substance here. The navigation and interface are a chore, and the developer's attempt to simulate psychosis are silly, and sometimes abrasive.\n\nAnd nothing makes sense. Click on the video playthrough posted above (by the developer), and listen to the commentary: \"I'm dead! Well, it was for the best; I had absolutely not the first clue what to do next.\" Yup.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442496430, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443231344, "recommendationid": "18070458", "language": "english", "votes_down": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615236", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450576546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 263, "steamid": "76561198140299850", "num_games_owned": 1211}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 32, "comment_count": "1", "review": "(Please keep in mind that this is only ONE QUARTER of the total game.)\n\nWhatever horror games, or \u201cemotionally responsive\u201d games you\u2019ve played, you have not played \u201cThe Archetype\u201d. Many games advertise \u201cNo Handholding\u201d, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ever been so true before. Certainly not in any game I\u2019ve played. If you find something, or accomplish something, or learn something, it is significant, and very rewarding. \"The Archetype\" provides few hints of any kind.This is a game where you learn from failure, and can expect to play over and over, getting a little further each game (or not.) Quite possibly you will have at least 10 hours in \"The Archetype\" before you ultimately succeed in the first chapter.\n\nYou are Archty, a nine-year old boy with severe emotion and mental issues. Your father is a violent alcoholic, and your mother and three siblings have arrived to your father\u2019s creepy, dark mansion where the two of you live. And, except for your father, they all promptly disappeared. That is ALL you know.\n\nBut that\u2019s far from the sum total of Archty\u2019s troubles. The house is also inhabited by some sort of demon(s), and they do nothing to calm Archty\u2019s anxious mood. So, Archety must attempt to stay calm while searching for his family (or whatever happened to them), evading his bat-wielding, drunken father\u2026and avoiding demons (and worse!). All in real-(game)time. And almost everything upsets the poor child, quite understandably.\n\nA dozen psychological traits are constantly monitored in \u201cThe Archetype\u201d. Traits such as anger, jealousy, sadness, and nine more. Also, four more significant issues: suicide, neurosis, homicide and psychosis (I think that\u2019s correct.). If any of the four pass a score of 50 (on the way to top out at 100) Archty\u2019s world becomes very troubled, and those issues must be addressed. Medication can be found occasionally, but can\u2019t be saved in inventory. And if any of the four reach 100\u2026\u2026..\n\nThis is the first of four chapters which take place throughout Archty's life, and they should each be released about two months after the prior chapter.\n\nThere is one aspect of \u201cThe Archetype\u201d that is unique in my experience; the cursor. It isn\u2019t dead center, it floats on the screen based on the movement of Archty, and how his POV changes. It\u2019s an interesting choice, but in a game this dark (figuratively and literally) it becomes frustrating to locate the dark cursor against a dark background, with only an edge lit for contrast. Easier with time and practice.\n\nThere are some aspects of the game potential buyers of \u201cThe Archetype\u201d need to know. First, there currently is no means by which to adjust screen brightness, and that\u2019s deliberate (and significant to the atmosphere.) This is so significant that the DEVs actually recommend that the game ONLY be played in the dark. Since not all gamers have this option, it must be considered sooner, rather than later. It also might seem to fail to take into consideration different PCs baselines, the changes in brightness when playing with battery power, and differences in vision (such as with age. I have one game with eight settings for colorblindness alone), but perhaps not, as the DEVS seem very deliberate in all things. There have been discussions about a slider to compensate for these numerous variables, as is commonly used in games. (\"The Archetype\" has only been out for a matter of days at this point, so do doubt numerous positive changes are yet to be made.) On a separate topic, please be aware that there has also been an issue concerning a genuine 911 call used in the game WITH PERMISSION. That is no longer a concern, as a suitable replacement has been made.\n\nThe first time one tries to save \u201cThe Archetype\u201d gamers will learn that the feature will not be available until a certain point in the game is reached by the player, and that will likely be after a minimum of an hour of game time. I\u2019ve played 3 - 4 hours (offline, mostly), died 6 \u2013 8 times and haven\u2019t reached that point yet. Also, at this time there is no PAUSE feature (though it is being discussed), so the game will continue while you answer the door or check the baby. At some points in the game the issue is minimal, at others, significant. (Again, in discussion.)\n\nBut \u201cfear not!\u201d (except where appropriate, of course), the DEVs of \u201cThe Archetype\u201d are very attentive and concerned about their game. Even in just a few days, the number of ideas and suggestions from many gamers that have been responded to is quite reassuring. There have been updates EVERY 2 - 3 days. There seems to be an excellent possibility that \u201cThe Archetype\u201d will turn out to be a very special game.\n\nEDIT: Having completed Chapter One, I can say that in retrospect, it's fairly simple (except for one action that I don't believe is in any way intuitive, and is counter to every other similar action in the game, but can be found in the correct Youtube walkthrough.) And there seems to be no means of saving, only of completion, which I presume counts as a \"save\" for the complete, four-part game.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442794333, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442969504, "recommendationid": "18125828", "language": "english", "votes_down": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530321", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450923026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561198014454061", "num_games_owned": 590}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "In it's current state it's more of a early access. if you have multiple monitors then stay away since the mouse does not lock and you will find yourself constantly clicking out of the game and breaking \"immersion\".

If you are uncomfortable with harsh topics such as abuse and alcoholism, this game is not for you. As well as that, if you are easily frustrated or frightened, this is not the game for you. The Archetype, while having an end-goal, offers no explicit objectives beyond 'explore' and will not hold your hand in the slightest. It can be scary, it can be confusing, and that is the point. It's not just a standard game, it's bringing you into the world of this scared young boy with multiple mental issues.\n\nHaving finished the Archetype last night, I am very excited for Chapter 2's release (episodic format). The moment the game began, I could feel the dread and very quickly got my first scare. Note that this is not a game that relies on jump-scares, but rather a well-crafted and atmospheric game with the occasional nasty surprise in store.  Nine  year old schitzophrenic Archty, who also suffers from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, is home alone except for his alcoholic father. I admit, while loving the idea of the 16 emotional bars and how they affect Archty, I was skeptical before buying this game. Many works have included schizophrenia and yet portrayed people with schizophrenia poorly, either by making them automatically cloudcookoolander or exaggerating them. This work treated the subject well, as well as including another condition, General Anxiety Disorder. All of this felt treated respectfully and accurately, which is a well done to the developers.\n\nRecently I emailed the devs. and discovered a lot of the aspects that I thought of as bugs were actually features, added in such a way that they're not-obvious, but clear once you think about it. Of course, when you're running in fear, you can't exactly stop to think, which acts to that tension. As well as this though, the devs are extremely respondent to player wishes. I've read online several mentions of changes that have been made due to player wishes before I bought this game, and there's already talks of further updates. This game isn't early access level, but it is still being refined.\n\nNow, the game isn't perfect. It can be bumpy at steps. There may some mild glitches that affect gameplay;  However, the dev is quick to respond to any reports. Despite some annoyance and frustration, I would recommend this game to anybody looking for a good horror game with a rich storyline.
