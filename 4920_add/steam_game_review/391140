Clock didn't help.\n\nGameplay is harsh, but well-oiled, so most of the time you lose a lot, yet with a knowledge of why did you lose. Music and visuals are excellent. Reminds me of Beat Hazard a lot, which I also like very much, though Blast-off is a serious step up in difficulty of simultaneous sharpshooting and low-friction evading.\n\nAs of version 0.7.2, I don't understand why is it Early Access at all - plays like a solid early 2000's commercial game, quite sufficient for indie nowadays IMO. Other than some buttons seemingly missing, and Debug options, there's nothing that would hint it's a WIP version.\n\nI guess I'll check it back in a release or pre-release state.
