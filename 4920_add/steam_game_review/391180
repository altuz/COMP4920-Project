This is what you get when someone decides to make a Thief game with RPG Maker and it's a fun experience. \n\nNo combat, just sneaking through shadows, crouching behind counters and fences, hiding in crates and closets while observing the guards patrol patterns and waiting for the right opening to make your move. Get spotted even once and you have to restart from the last checkpoint but since every room you enter is a checkpoint this is not an issue and the game maintains a quick pace.\n\nGraphically, other than the main character's sprite, the game seems to use default RPG maker assets. If you ever played an RPG Maker game you know how this looks and controls.  Nonetheless visual design is clean. Everything is laid out well, for the most part it's clear where you can hide and important details like treasures to pick up or entrances to secret passages are clearly visible. There is also a minimal but decent story about the character trying to sabotage war preparations, it does the job providing some context on the missions and the character's motivations.\n\nOn the negative side there are odd spelling errors here and there. Controls are solid but they have some quirks that could have been ironed out (my main gripe is how you have to be completely still to crouch or get up from the crouching position) and early on it requires some trial and error to figure out how the enemies field of vision works. Also keep in mind the game is extremely linear, each room/screen has one solution/route you have to figure out so it's best to get into it knowing each mission is a series of connected stealth/timing puzzles rather than expecting an \"open\" stealth game.\n\nIn conclusion this is a neat little indie title well worht it's full (low) prize. If you're a fan of stealth games and don't specifically dislike RPG Maker games this should earn a cozy spot in your wishlist and hopefully your library.

Buy it on sale, you'll enjoy it.\n\nBUGS:\n\nAll bugs that were here before have been fixed, good enough for me now.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nGameplay is r8 8/8 m8\n\nbut in all seriousness. It's fun, intuitive, and (for a 2D game) very well thought out.\n\nWhile in the darkness you can't just walk right on by some idiot. You have to pay attention and plan your route both as you go, and before you start.\nVery interesting and something I haven't seen before in an RPGMaker game, was how they actually had crouching work fairly well in a 2D game.\n\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nIt's a retro indie game, so i won't judge its graphics to harshly, but personally i enjoy it.\n\nOVERALL:\n\n8/10 It's pretty great, although not necessarily perfect.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456979738, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463697361, "recommendationid": "21596653", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501226", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447441084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 292, "playtime_forever": 35, "steamid": "76561198053422627", "num_games_owned": 960}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 33, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Yes another RPG Maker game...\n\nHere is my quick look video: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AieoBV7On-4\n\nBut this one is pretty well done and has the unique aspect of trying to use stealth and shadows to sneak through halls and rooms unseen.  It's actually quite fun and makes it feel and play a little different then all of the other RPG Maker games I've played.\n\nThere are a few mis-spelled words now and then, but it doesn't detract much from the game.  My biggest gripe in the time I've played the game so far is that the escape key doesn't work at all, and I was forced to CTRL-ALT-DEL to manually abort the game.  The game saves automatically, but still the ESC key should work as a method of escaping the game.\n\nThese are pretty minor gripes, and I think people who enjoy these classic RPG style games will be very happy with this entry on Steam, especially at it's low price point of $3.99 USD.  Catch this game on sale, and it's even a better value.\n\nIf you are the type that doesn't usually enjoy these kind of RPG Maker games, then the unique steath aspect of the game will not likely make it fun for you, so I'd caution against buying it just for that aspect alone.\n\nGrading this game on what I've played of the game.. I'd give it a 7 out of a possible 10.
