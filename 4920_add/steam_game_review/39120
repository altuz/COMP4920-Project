I played Classic Rift almost every day, and enjoyed the first expansion very much. I was a huge raider and occassionally found PvP to be somewhat alright. I have nothing to say when it comes to bugs the game has as I am very bad at noticing bugs (horribly bad). The dynamic events that trigger throughout the game world were at one point something I chased after every time one came around and they were a lot of fun and rewarding enough to be worthwhile. You could make specific end-game pieces from the various crafting skills that competed with raid drops fairly well. I loved the class system and the freedom it had to make whatever you wanted (pretty much). Overall, the game used to be enjoyable.\n\nI emphasize \"used to\" as hard as I can. As Trion changed Rift from a subscription model to a free-to-play model it started to lose what made it so enjoyable for me. As they progressed further down the road of pay-to-win and diverted from the actually decent FTP model they started out with my hours of play very quickly dropped. Eventually I stopped simply because the game no longer felt worthwhile. The dynamic events became mostly ignored except for weekly quests that gave a rare in-game currency for gear. I never had an interest in dimensions except for the instances I roleplayed with my guild. I no longer find any enjoyment in the game.\n\nI am not active on the forums and never was, but I have also heard from so many people that Trion's policy when it comes to dealing with criticism is to ban you from their forums. A friend of mine also got banned from the game for finding an exploit and then presenting it to the devs. The game has lost the soul it once had."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500705632, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524137", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33713975", "votes_up": 35, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197994383050", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1320130800, "num_games_owned": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 104524}, "timestamp_updated": 1500705632, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Game was fun at release, bad response times from devs made my guild quit.  Tried to form/reform guild 4 times and started to raid but \"patches\" pushed so many away with bs changes.  It was llike Warframe's beta excuse but no brunette with a nice smile to calm the masses.  Bad PR, bad wow clone turned f2p and basically trion is just milking all their franchises.  From their tv show tie in game (forget is name now) to their various copy/paste games none ever feel complete, work well or have good responsive gameplay.  Optimization is not a word the devs understand and will get angry if you bring it up.\n\nIn any event there are a lot better mmorgs out there if you still like this style of gameplay.  Personally I think this style of game is not about it's original appeal.  A lot of players role-playing, raiding, pvping or whatever together.  Now mmos seem to be about instant gratification since there are so many.  Back when there were three or four, DAoC, Evequest, Ultima and the beginnings of WoW it was fun and then WoW sort of made it too easy then even still had 40 man, now its single player methodology just played together with 4 to 21 other anons.  This game takes all the worst parts of the above games."}]}
