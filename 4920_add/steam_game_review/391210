It's come a long way since that version but the core element of the fun is still the same.\n\nGameplay is fast and a little crazy in a good way. It's a nice twist on the usual twin stick shooter outfit. I personally liked the boss battle levels the best. It's not a large game, but a lot of the fun comes from playing it with friends and just messing about. Also, if you're a high score junkie you'll love trying to scrape a few extra points in each level so there's some replay value.\n\nThe overall production qaulity is nice and the graphics are geometry wars style glowing prettyness. Music is good quality but is deliberately a feature and as such is in your face/ears. So it could be irritating for some people. On the other hand it's good to just listen to and appreciate.\n\nOnly other negative thing I could say about the experience was that my right thumb got sore swinging the sword around but I can't really blame the game for that. Overall though, definitely a fun way to spend half an hour now and then.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452189327, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452189327, "recommendationid": "20379339", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
