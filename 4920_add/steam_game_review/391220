And expecting 11.\nWaiting for a long time, and finally play again so happy game, I spent 2 days to complete it, it is a favorite game.  \n-------------------------------------------\u6211\u662f\u5206\u5272\u7ebf-----------------------------------\nTALK ABOUT MY PLAY FEELINGS:\n*The plot length is reasonable, there is no long, monotonous pattern, there will be no play fatigue, resulting in give up playing feeling.           \nThe natives didn't give me too much work, so I could do it on the way. (If there are a lot of NPC, they have a lot of tasks, it makes me feel bored and irritable. )\n*The game view is very beautiful, often ready to press the F12 screenshot.\n*Press ESC to see your friend's score directly, And very concise.\n*The story tells a number of philosophical, very warm, very educational, and positive significance.           \n*It's really nice to have official Chinese phonetics and subtitles. It sounds awkward at first. After all, English has got used to it. After two hours, it really feels good. (You can see the sincerity of the producer. This is based on the amount of purchases made by Chinese players.)\n-------------------------------------------------------\u6211\u662f\u5206\u5272\u7ebf---------------------------\nTHE STORY HAS SOME ABNORMAL, PUZZLING PARTS:\n^^(Maybe tell us these questions in NEW DLC.)\nFor example, the prophets, the undead, the sacred source, The Soviet Union, these important parts are portrayed in a hurry. Their secrets and the past can be enriched. (Absolutely, This contents can be extended into small stories alone.)\n*A thousand year old Jacob, he should be more meaty, More attractive, more experienced and more vicissitudes. This guy is great, but his character is thin. Even to the extent that make it feel like a passer-by.\n*The Soviet Union's Story. And the undead's story.\n*Thousand years of original sin -- the source of holiness. Easily destroyed. What the hell? What about the secret? What about history? What about it? What about its larger conspiracy theories and foreshadowing? (because it's not Yamatai, You can't end up like killing a boss Himiko. That's sloppy. ) \n-------------------------------------------------\u6211\u662f\u5206\u5272\u7ebf----------------------------\nTHEN SAY THE FEW BUG:\n*DLC\u2014\u2014Evil Valley BOSS warfare, and sometimes witches and soldiers will not brush out, need to loading again.           \n*Jonah was injured, the task of \"resistance Trinity's attack\", by helicopter attack in real wood corridor, Lara will be lost, and sometimes the model action model fixed on the ground, WSAD will make her the statue of displacement.           \n*Ancient tomb -- the bathhouse of KITT city. At its entrance, there are three outfall, Lara stood on the vines. The local model loses movement, it runs on a vine but does not move. \n--------------------------------------------------------\u6211\u662f\u5206\u5272\u7ebf---------------------------\nMy cat says when I type, it press the keyboard:     \nAs much as the wind,more\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore\uff0cmore...\n\nThis game is turely nice works, i'm so happy.Thanks.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506965929, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506967887, "recommendationid": "35424576", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509768", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505628102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 861, "steamid": "76561198163839956", "num_games_owned": 95}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "On its own, yes.\nAs a follow up to the 1st game, no.\n\nThis is a good enough game in it's own right... but it feels like a drastic step down from the first Tomb Raider in the series.
