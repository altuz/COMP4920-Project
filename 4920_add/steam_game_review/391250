After I played a little I confirmed my thoughts, this game has a low quality visuals, but I also found some interesting features.\n\nThe story is simple and unnecessary. You came to planet and found hostile aborigines. You task is moving to the centre of planet and cleaning enemy forces. Nothing extraordinary!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1148128562\n\nThe most interesting part for me was the tech tree for towers. You have 2 basic tower: a depot for marines and a techlab. Each one has 3 upgrades. For example for outpost you can research 1) +1 marine (equal +50% dps); 2) grenade throw ability; 3) Training, which increases attack range by 40%. After you research any of upgrades, new towers unlocks.\n+1 marine unlocks the barracks, which puts marines on the road. Training unlocks the outpost tower with better damage and attack range.\nEach new tower has 3 upgrades too. 2 of them lead to new towers. New towers save  upgrades which were only before them. It means tower lose grenade throw ability if you gone with \"Training\" path. It's really interesting to unlock new towers and make decisions which tower needs all side upgrades and which one needs to be upgraded to next tier. This is the first TD game with such mechanics, so only because of it I gave the game a positive review. Because, it was fun... for the first couple of hours.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1148128774\n\nBut the game have a lot of negative sides. The filling of waves are boring, monsters and their abilities are usual. I think the balance of towers is average too. I found some of them are owerpowered and some totally useless.\n\nPros\n- Interesting concept of techtree for towers\n- Skill tree. You get stars for completing levels which could be spent on different 16 passive skills\n- No bugs was found\n- Cheap\n\nCons\n- Poor visuals and animations\n- Boring enemies with usual abilities\n- Boss fight are extremely disappointing\n- Game becomes monotonous after the ~10 missions\n- Balance issues\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1148128833\n\n[h1]Resume[/h1]\nThe game is cheap. I bought it on a discount. I had some interesting hours while I was playing and unlocking new towers and upgrades. But it wasn't enough to keep me engaged to pass the game. At the middle of the game I have found new missions uninteresting and unbalanced, so I didn't want to spend more time on this game. But, I am a veteran in TD genre, so it's hard for me to find a game which could entertain me from the start to the end. \n\nI can recommend this game with 50%+ discount for TD fans, because I think you will find some enjoyable hours there!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506458091, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506459033, "recommendationid": "35229791", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528302", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 53, "total_reviews": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
