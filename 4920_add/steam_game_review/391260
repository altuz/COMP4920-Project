All of it accompanied by good music, fine level design and different environments to interact with.\n\nAt times Labyronia reminded me of Zelda, meaning sometimes you are forced to find a specific item beforehand in order to progress in the story. However, very much like what happens in the dreadful Ocarina of Time's Water Temple, some of these items are very well hidden which can lead some people to feel frustrated when they realize their progress depends on them. Personally, I didn't feel bothered by the comings and goings and instead of seeing it as a drag, I appreciated the fact that the game encourages you to look into every nook and cranny giving you the opportunity to explore in depth the five main continents of Labyronia. In any case, this is not a a game breaking issue.\n\nThe world's background story is also very interesting. You start off as a complete stranger with a given goal. You don't really know the reasons behind your motives, or how to proceed but as you keep going on you learn new spells and get more experience until key elements of your \"mission\" are revealed to you in little dosis. In the meantime you try to gather all the information you can from NPCs and different books which gives you a better understanding about Labyronia and its inhabitants.\n\nThe game's difficulty is adequate as well. At first is harder due to your lack of resources but as you keep progressing and learning new spells it becomes much easier. Never to the point of making it trivial, though, and I have to say that Labyronia's combat system helps a lot in this regard. The system is simple but effective, you are presented with all the information you need at every moment and you set the pace of the fight, not the enemies. It can be a bit overwhelming at first if you try to defeat every enemy on your own, specially if you're used to parties, but more allies will join you in later stages of the game, sharing the burden of the fight.\n\nLevel design is one of the key elements of this game. As the name suggests the world of Labyronia is full of Labyrinths that you have to traverse. Some of them are short and easy to cross, but others are set as part of much larger environments  where, honestly, it is very easy to get lost. Two such places come to mind, an ice field and a desert. It took me time to learn how to move in this places but not so much that I grew to hate them, which is appreciated. The fact that enemies roam free in these labyrinths and you can spot them at site, helps a lot. Instead of worrying whether you're going to be jumped by enemies all of a sudden, you can deftly avoid enemie encounters and manage to traverse the mazes all the same. You need, however, to be able to defeat the boss that usually awaits at the end of the labyrinth if you want to advance.\n\nThe highest in-game level you can reach is 50 but there's no need to get to that point at all, and chances are you'll reach the endgame at much lower levels (35 in my case). Despite the difference, however, you'll be able to defeat every single enemy of the game, including the Final Boss and the two Secret Bosses. \n\nLastly, the story does feel a bit short, but I also think that part of the game's charm lies in its simplicity and it is clear that this is just the first game of a longer series. If there's something I can tell you, however, is this: I enjoyed every second I spent playing, which is more than I can say about many other games.\n\n\nOverall: 8,5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506253130, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506370039, "recommendationid": "35178452", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502827", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 251, "total_reviews": 367, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 116}}
