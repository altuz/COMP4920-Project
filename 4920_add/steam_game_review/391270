It has some tension in the atmosphere, and some decent horro-esque sound effects. The player character walks at a snails pace, as there is no key for sprinting or running. And that can get rather tedious quickly.\n\nThe narration to the plot of the game is rather... bland. The creator tries to make a deep philosphical ploy with themes about how morales are based on nature rather than from being a product of something else. And that the pursuit of scientific endeavors should be the only, and sole thing worth pursuing in life.\n\nIt quickly starts to come off as a very tiresome trope of someone who has just discovered atheism for the first time, at twelve years old etc.\n\nOther than the rather predictable and childish pseudo-intellctual rants. The game is not too shabby. Their are a few pass phrase puzzles, and find the hidden switch puzzles in the game. But none are so difficult, it's going to require you to use an Internet search to solve them. \n\nAll-in-all, I am reccomending this game because it's free, and very short to finsh. So I think it's worth the small download to keep you entertained for half an hour at most. I wish the developer in their future projects! By the time of this review, they have few already done, and one more that looks rather promising. So perhaps the experience from this short game has improved their story telling for the future.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486505839, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486505839, "recommendationid": "29770527", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509130", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471333361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561198281484746", "num_games_owned": 52}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A dark little game with an eerie atmosphere that draws you in deeper.\n\nWas a little disappointed by the dated graphics, as they were a little low res for my liking.\n\nIf you are a fan of psychological, and escape room style games, then this is worth checking out.

I finished this game with an overall response of \"...meh.\"  I wouldn't recommend it to *me*, but I see that many other players have enjoyed it, and the graphics were quite nice, the game ran smoothly, and it was a fairly simple game that didn't take long to play through.  I'm going with \"no\" by a very *small* margin, and mosly because the game has such a lot of praise already and sometimes I find differing opinions can help me make up my mind about a game I'm torn on (though for the moment, the game is free, so there's that to consider as well.)\n\nI think the biggest problem for me is that the game description, between the first paragraph and the \"facts about fingerbones\" section, just gives too much away.  I suppose the author was trying to avoid negative reviews by keeping people from playing it who might be looking for what the game \"isn't\", but I think one has to risk that, and based on the general positivity of the reviews I think the author *could* have risked that.  For myself, because I knew what *wasn't* coming, and I had a good idea of what was, a lot of the suspense was lost.\n\nThe second issue as far as suspense building went was the music.  I found it somewhat irritating rather than moody: if you stand in one place too long trying to figure out what you're supposed to do - which, since you're given very little lead, is going to happen - I found it would just stay on one note, and the irritation that caused would pull me out of the puzzle I was working on, and therefore the atmosphere that the author was trying to build around me.\n\nThirdly, I also think that one more setting should be added - because there are several back-and-forth runs, movement speed should really be something else you can increase.  I grew frustrated at the slow speed every time I was going through areas I'd already passed and knew - again, breaking that aura of suspense that this type of game needs in order to succeed.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488028323, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488028323, "recommendationid": "30166766", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487984687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 28, "steamid": "76561198362064353", "num_games_owned": 72}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "eh! kind of pointless lol but it's free so give it a try, it's at least got a little creepyness to it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487984785, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487984785, "recommendationid": "30154694", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487130697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 23, "steamid": "76561198054508172", "num_games_owned": 61}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "boring!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487130990, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487130990, "recommendationid": "29934371", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493480", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485715682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13, "steamid": "76561198292404296", "num_games_owned": 4}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this game is probaly good but the problem is that my computer SUCKS and for some reason the game doesnt work for me\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485715775, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485715775, "recommendationid": "29570826", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495458", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471924676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 79, "steamid": "76561198320469232", "num_games_owned": 19}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I tried doing anything and nothing happens , I just read a couple of notes and that's it....
