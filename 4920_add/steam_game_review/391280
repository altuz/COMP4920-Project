It's got descent depth, but does have a half-life. I think I had a couple experimentive play throughs before finally clearing it and then that was it. Maybe it's something people can play multiple times, once I beat it I was done. I think for the price point though, you could easily get a full 40 hours out of it, so it's worth it especially on sale imo. I think if the devs revisit this game concept, they could spend more time on the replayibility. I think some of the depth of the possibilities of classes reaches past the actual necessity the game requires.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506637820, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506637820, "recommendationid": "35274930", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 82, "total_reviews": 124, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 42}}
