You need to pick up some red cubes and then place them to make a path to the finish.  The third level shows you that sometimes the cubes will be somewhat hidden so you need to look around.  After that, the game goes downhill fast.  Levels devolve into a pixel hunting game to find the tiniest bit of red peeking out around a corner you can barely see.  Sometimes the cubes are hidden in a dark corner where they are nearly impossible to see.  Other times you have to quickly try to grab them while you fall from a height.\n\nIf this downright terrible level design wasn't bad enough, the game further insults your time by not offering anything else for you do to.  Seriously, this game is literally nothing more than pixel-hunting for 2+ red cubes and then painfully building your bridge to the finish.\n\nAlso, the controls... Hold right click, scroll the mouse wheel, and then left click while still holding right click.  Why not just use left click to place and right click to pick up?  The convoluted control scheme just doesn't make any sense!\n\nAVOID!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500435711, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500435948, "recommendationid": "33643600", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509542", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 10}}
