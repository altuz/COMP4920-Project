The controls are clunky, when using the keyboard keys to move around there seems to be a delay. And using the mouse to click and move feels better but I found it hard to engage enemies, my character and the enemy would just dance around each other while trying to initiate the fight. Also when it comes to your inventory and fights some things you can click on with your mouse while other things you can't, like using a item. The controls overall just feel awkward.\n\nAlso I only played the tutorial and intro but I noticed a lot of spelling and grammar errors which really made it hard to get immersed into the story, or to read for that matter.\n\nAnd the game doesn't have much in terms of graphical options, you can't even put the game into full screen mode.\n\nHowever, the game does have a turn-based combat system which I like and I did like the art style as well. But the other issues are a big turn off for me. If they got patched then I could definitely see myself playing this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468112663, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1468112663, "recommendationid": "24220468", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514471", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487358618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 98, "steamid": "76561198268110504", "num_games_owned": 20}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game!
