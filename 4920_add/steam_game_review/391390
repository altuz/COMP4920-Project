I do recommend playing the game with a game control versus a mouse and keyboard.  Game plays like an action movie.  You dodge through explosions, dodge through bullets, unlimited ammo clips, jump off buildings, and so much more.  All with a comical wit to the entire experience.\n\nStarted a Let's Play of the game if you want to see gameplay :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB5lIpCX1os&list=PLgJ7EwMZHOobxs1xLagMU0dxWQuFeFA7y", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448575126, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448575418, "recommendationid": "19295616", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505390", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447870303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 267, "steamid": "76561198102802911", "num_games_owned": 125}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "totally worth it the story isn't all that but it is funny and it's a super action filled 2d side scroling shooter you will have a blast playing it air diving while shooting bunny/rabbits and shooting like crazy wall jumping and par-core tons of option's and key rebinging BUT i could not get the game to run right till i disabled the steam overlay", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447096182, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447096182, "recommendationid": "18975207", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504433", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1463722404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 283, "steamid": "76561198003742382", "num_games_owned": 255}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a game for those boring days and nights when you need a break from reality.
