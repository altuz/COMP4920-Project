I can see why people thought this was amazing back when it came out but still claiming that it\u2019s one of the best rpg\u2019s ever made I just disagree with. I think it\u2019s mostly just nostalgia talking, this was my first time playing this game, I have played and beat Final Fantasy 4 and 6 before this and I do think that this game is slightly better than those, I thought those were very average as well. I find it very difficult to get invested and care about sprites on a screen or in this games case very low quality looking characters that can\u2019t emote especially after playing recent rpg\u2019s like The Witcher or Dragon Age. The poor writing/translation doesn\u2019t help either. But there has been games like Chrono Trigger where I did like the characters and the story so I don\u2019t know, maybe I just didn\u2019t find the characters compelling in these games. I didn\u2019t care in the slightest when a character died. In this game in particular I was so bored at the amount of time they spend on these drawn out backstories of Cloud, Tifa, Barret etc. These games do tell decent stories but I wouldn\u2019t call them good, the journey these characters go on always devolves into having the stop the big mean bad guy which is ok because there is so many different ways you can tell that same story it\u2019s just nothing too riveting. I also don\u2019t like the pacing because of the amount of diversions the characters get thrown in, it feels like it\u2019s done just to extend the length of the game it doesn\u2019t feel like it has a purpose. I do like how each game tries to change up the world it\u2019s set in though it keeps the games from feeling too similar to each other and I did like the setting in this game. The music was also pretty good the final boss theme in particular sticks out and it\u2019s just epic. Moving on to the gameplay I\u2019m not a fan of turn based combat, I think it\u2019s very slow paced, boring and a chore especially when you have to grind to level up. I do like the turn based combat in FF7 more than I did in the 2d games but it still felt like a chore, I had to put music or videos in the background to keep myself playing during dungeons or when I was grinding. There are some sections in the game that were just very boring to get through like the gold saucer for example where you have to run around for quite a bit to find and where you have to go and what you have to do to progress. The mini games are so clunky and awful I wish they just didn\u2019t bother. I don\u2019t think this game is still worth playing today, if you are curious about it then I would say give it a try but if you are looking for a genuinely good RPG to play then no because by today\u2019s standards I don\u2019t think this game is good. I can\u2019t see myself recommending this game to any of my friends, I have a few that tried it and couldn\u2019t get into it and I checked my steam friends who own the game to see how many hours they put into it and the most I\u2019ve seen is 3 hours. I think there are multiple rpg\u2019s released every year that are more fun and better than Final Fantasy 7. I hope the later games in the franchise that I plan on playing get me invested.\n5/10 (Average)"}]}
