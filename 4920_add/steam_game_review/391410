This is pretty bad game design IMO, as they could have just been added on the first level of the game. Or, like most games, the different tree colors could have been slowly introduced.\n    [*]The UI is visually bad, and somewhat broken (Every level has an ESC button at the top left that does nothing?)\n    [*]The control scheme probably would have faired way better with keyboard controls, but instead has you click and guide the rock with your mouse.\n    [*]Game only has one song, and it starts it from the beginning every time you start any level. If you're going to have only one song in the game, make it play continuously through level changes, so you don't always have to hear the first 5 seconds over and over (imo)\n    [*]Each level takes about a minute to complete * 15 levels is only about 15 minutes of game time, and that's a stretch even.\n    [*]Not enough content to even come close to 5 dollars.\n[/list]\n\nThis game a simple time waster at best. If there was more content/better design approaches this game could be much better. The concept is good, don't get me wrong! I can definitely appreciate where the dev was going here.\n\nTo be fair, it looks like it was made by just one person. That being the case, I can understand the lack of content and some of these flaws. Being a one man band is tough, so being able to make a finished product at all is an achievement in itself. I think the dev would be wise to look into game design, and to spend more time on touching up on the little things; it's the little details that often make video games pop. To be constructive, I think this game would probably kill as a smartphone app, with more levels, leaderboards, micro-shit-transactions, etc. If I were the dev, that's where my mind would be.\n\ntl;dr\nSimple time wasting game that you'd expect to be low priced/free on a smartphone app store. A good concept, but not enough content.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438437500, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1438437500, "recommendationid": "17333597", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566721", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
