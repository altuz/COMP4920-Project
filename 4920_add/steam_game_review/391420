There are two additional abilities to consider: A shoot button which fires projectiles (not to damage anything. This isn't an arcade shooter, but to create bumps or push other objects out of the way additionally there's a move which will make you imune to gravity for a very short time.\n\nAll in All [u]Gun Rocket[/u] is a very nice Indie Game! \n\n8/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep [/i]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503138516, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503138516, "recommendationid": "34347388", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499744", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481512585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 45, "steamid": "76561198087874301", "num_games_owned": 177}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "fuck you \nok so basicaly i play game it very fun very hard challange I BEAT Game no i lied i cant beat it im like not past the first level this game fucking sucks i payed like 1 bucks on it", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1502625412, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502625412, "recommendationid": "34212258", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485577", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500347902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 109, "steamid": "76561198048103773", "num_games_owned": 448}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this review is more a buyer beware than anything else\n\nGun Rocket is a physics based game where the goal is to get to the exit. sometimes it feels like a puzzle game. other times its more like a maze game where you lose if you go out of bounds.
