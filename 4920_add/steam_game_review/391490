I wish it was more grindable, but that's the only negative thing I could really say about it. Fun characters, cute dialog, and adorable graphics. I got this for 90 percent off and thought it was more than worth the .69 cents. I'll be picking up the other Braveland games as well.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500578153, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500578153, "recommendationid": "33679020", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "total_reviews": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
