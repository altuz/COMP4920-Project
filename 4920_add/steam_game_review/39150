It is true that you need an internet connection to pull up your save file from the Steam Cloud, but otherwise, I had no issues playing this game. \n\nThere are so many little booster/cheats in this PC version of FFVIII that will make your life so much easier in-game, with just a push of a button. You can automatically level up your GF's to level 99, you can not take any damage (unless you get hurt with more damage than the amount of HP you currently have), you can get 99,999,999 gil, and 100 of each type of basic level magic. I think you can even speed up the flow of the game. If you struggled with the unique gameplay and leveling style of this game, you don't have to struggle anymore with these boosters. I was able to do everything in the game that seemed impossible to do before without literal hours upon hours of grinding. Some people like to grind though, and you certainly do not have to use the boosters if you choose not to. \n\nIf you haven't played this game already and you love RPG's and cannot find any other game to play, I urge you to try this game or really any other Final Fantasy title. They are rich in story-line and each have their own unique style of gameplay, so you'll never get the same experience twice!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506669572, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506611", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35285163", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198063224681", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1506752474, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_forever": 169}, "timestamp_updated": 1506669572, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Squareeeeeeeee please remake this gameeeee\nwe wait for 18 years..."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505567959, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504416", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34996784", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197962917875", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1431202945, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3422}, "timestamp_updated": 1505567959, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Best Final Fantasy ever ;D"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504927157, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34828009", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198130406508", "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1504331363, "num_games_owned": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5191}, "timestamp_updated": 1504927157, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Definitely worth a purchase while on sale. I know a majority of people dislike the whole DRM thing and trust me, I am with you.

But I am not an video game analyst, I simply wanted to play a game and well, beat a game, that I had a lot of difficult completing as a kid....mostly due to Triple Triad.....\n\nbut anyway! worth purchasing.....and if you already own and wish to just rush through the game...the Steam Community definitely offers some helpful guides.\n\nEnjoy!"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504739060, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505432", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34784693", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198137003921", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1506182154, "num_games_owned": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "playtime_forever": 5313}, "timestamp_updated": 1504739060, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Don't get me wrong, this is truly an amazing game, BUT the steam version of this game is absolutely butchered.
