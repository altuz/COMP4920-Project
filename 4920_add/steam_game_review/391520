Looks like a Win95 game with memes and slenderman thrown in to add substance to a game that looks thrown together overnight. It has a level editor, which is basically the developers saying \"hey maybe YOU can make a game out of this\", but it's so buggy and unresponsive that it's not even worth trying. Enemies bugged into walls and didn't do anything to me, your hand and flashlight are way off center and it's disorienting, some hallways went on for way too long, and you jump like you're on the moon but only JUST BARELY not enough to see over the walls. Also, why on EARTH is the load time so long for such a piecemeal game? Don't waste your time on this.
