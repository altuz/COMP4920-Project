(TL;DR at the end)[/h1]\n\n     Undertale is a lovely game, and I enjoyed it nearly to the fullest... in my first 2 runs. Now, my credibility may drop because I only have around 16 hours in the game, but that was all it really took for me to play it. When playing it for the first time or your 2nd, the game will be enjoyable, have a good atmosphere, and the 16-bit graphics don't hinder it's playability. When being introduced to the mechanics of the game, it can be fairly exciting,  just like the first boss fight. After that it seems to drag itself on a bit with a few unnecessary battles and such. The genocide run wasn't too long, I enjoyed it because the difficulty of the battles increased quite a bit, as a new player wouldn't usually do this kind of run as to kill everything. It wasn't so story driven, even if it did try to give you some insight on what happened before you (the player) fell down the hole into the world of monsters. I feel asthough maybe some of the story elements and mechanics weren't necessary to make the game as enjoyable as it was. I'd say it is worth it for the price, but unless you are a patient person willing to play this game over and over, trying to find all the secrets, then I wouldn't recommend it. Back in 2015 when it was released I would say that if you were never spoiled the content of the game, then go ahead. But today, where every aspect of the game has been released somewhere, if you are or were somewhat interested in the game, you would know about 90% of the events that take place in it. I got spoiled a small portion of the game but I still purchased it to experience it myself. I was slightly disappointed, seeing that the choices you make doesn't really affect the ending much, since SPOILER ALERT [spoiler]You will still have to make friends with all of the main monsters to finish the true pacifist ending, and if you don't then you end up fighting Mega Flowey every time[/spoiler]. I thought that maybe depending on what I chose, my ending would be drastically different, this sadly wasn't the case. There are about 2-3 main possible endings, depending on what you count as one. All of them aren't very different, but one is a happy ending. My choices in what I did to each character did nothing but have them appear later or not. Even for an indie game, I would've expected it to have a little more decision wise, considering the hype it had on the Patreon page. I'd say my expectations were a little high for what I should've been expecting, but shouldn't we all want the best out of the game we want? Toby and his crew did an excellent job making the game, it just wasn't as much for me as it was other people. \n\n[h1]Too Long; Didn't Read[/h1]\n        Pros:\n-Bullet hell gameplay.\n-Decisions (for the most part) affect the future of the game.\n-Characters appear to have emotion.\n-Quite a few routes depending on the major choices you make.\n-Decent combat system.\n-Lovable characters.\n-Relatively large world.\n-Some replayability (depending who you are).\n-Story is somewhat understandable.\n-Soundtrack is quite nice.\n        Cons:\n-Most of the Fandom (yes, I know you saw this coming).\n-Repetitive after first few runs.\n-Story seems unrelated to you, as the main character; other than freeing the monsters.\n-Only major decisions will affect the story.\n-Only a few set endings, not as open as one would like.\n-Short \"campaign\" (take it as you will, some people like short games).\n-Similar enemies.\n-Repetitive combat.\n-Unnecessary dialogue.\n-Certain endings can only be achieved by following the exact same path.\n-Repetitive enemies.\n-Bland main character.\n-Convenience makes the game easier (some poeple enjoy that, though).\n-Although soundtrack is neat, it is for the most part a bunch of chiptunes.\n     The game was enjoyable for me, it just got old pretty fast.\n\nNot much of a TL;DR, but it works. The game may or may not deserve such praise from the fandom, and I would argue some people like it only because of the praise that others give it, but I don't account for those people. 2 years ago I would totally recommend this game, but now, it's just been so over-exposed to the point where the game was ruined for me, even if I already got a little bored of it. It was a semi-unique game that got too much attention and was ruined by the fandom it created. The pros of the game are quite nice, but the cons outweigh the pros by quite a bit. Overall it's a decent game, but parts of it make it tedious, boring, or unfunny to me. This is just my opinion though, so I guess it doesn't really matter what I think. For the most part I like to think about the game itself, not my personal gripes with it, so I can truly say whether or not to buy it, and not mislead people with what I personally think. For now it will stay a positive review, because I don't think it deserves a negative review. I can't really say I don't suggest buying it, but if you aren't particularily interested in it, then don't buy it just because you have the money, as you might never get into it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505018352, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505018352, "recommendationid": "34853141", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533342", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487635736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2049, "steamid": "76561198131530855", "num_games_owned": 72}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": "2", "review": "A Good Game Ruined By The Community", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506443030, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506443030, "recommendationid": "35225137", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524413", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506815776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1044, "steamid": "76561198001760637", "num_games_owned": 160}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I adore this game.

Now firstly I want to say if you are turned off this game because of the community, the game is definetly not as bad as the community. I think most of us can agree that most of the community is cringey, not the worst community, but still quite bad. Sure Undertale does have the relationships, the cutsie moments and the fucking spagetti memes but it isn't as bad as the community makes it out to be. Anyway on to the review.\n\nLets start with the plot. Straight away you get a breif summary of the plot but as you go through things get filled in for you. Theres great surprises everywhere and the two main storylines you can go down are both really interesting and feel like completely different games. \n\nYou feel instantly for the characters. Most of the time you are straight away in love with ( put emphasis on \"Most of the time\", *cough Alphys *cough ). They are filled with charm, which you might have noticed I love in my Shovel Knight review. They are so entertaining and are have so much personality and it really hurts when you fucking murder them...\n\nThe gameplays great aswell. Its bullethell turn based and its strangely addictive. The Spare and Kill choices really make both their own different challenge. Such fun and addictive gameplay and even the gameplays filled with surprises.\n\nHeres a couple of other positives to Undertale. First the soundtracks fucking amazing, its probably my second favourite soundtrack ever. Its soo good. The jokes are most of time quite funny, great art and graphics and good replay value.\n\nIn some minior nickpicky negatives im not much of a fan of any of the dates, some characters I find annoying and, even though not the games fault, made a really cringey community. \n\nThats all really.

Ahem, Undertale is a simplistic Comedy RPG (meaning it relies more on humor and dialogue/lore to give a story, It isn't even supposed to be a \"RPG\" per say.) It's kind of like Earthbound's quirky, dumb but still good younger brother. (The fanbase... Isn't really cancerous actually. I don't know how it was when you played the game, but for all I know, I had to actively search for cancer to find it. But chances are you had to upload your experiance of Undertale to youtube to attract that cancer.) There are three endings, Pacifist/Neutral/genocide. I'm not one of those people that judges you for wich ending you chose. (And to be honest more people BEG for genocide and Genocide youtube playthrough's tend to get more views than the pacifist ruotes) There are 27 seperate neutral endings, each adding on a hint of lore. There is a bunch of easter eggs (SOME of which refer to Earthbound). Now this is kind of the genre of RPG I'd label \"Dialogue RPG.\" It isn't suppose to rely off of Traditional RPG tropes (Infact, it even makes fun of and parodies some RPG tropes). I can see how people say its \"Overated\" but that still doesn't particularly mean it's a BAD game, it's called perspective and preferance people. The humor, while lowbrow at times, is pretty funny. The fighting mechanics are... HORRIBLE! But the fighting mechanics aren't technically supposed to be GOOD, you see that's why it's called \"The RPG where no one HAS to die.\" The soundtrack is phenominal, although it is heavily reliant on leitmotifs (And I mean, what videogame/movie/TV show hasn't been completely reliant on leitmotifs?) it is barely recognizable with how much reworking is put into each piece. The characters, although exagerated and over the top, have subtleties to their character that make them way more in depth and realistic/relatable. The thing I find fond most about games like these is how self-aware the games are. A little bit spoily but, the game breaks the fourth wall 10 seconds in to the game. People may argue that the Game looks super \"Crappy.\" I have to back it up by saying, that in the Undertale Conceptual book, the creator of the game \"Toby Fox\" even admitted to how it looked crappy and that he wasn't trying to make a flashy extravagent game like some may lead you to believe. It's just one guy( As well as Temmie Chang) who made a silly knockoff of Earthbound that gained more funds then they expected for their kickstarter, He wasn't going for a GREAT game in the first place. And even during the developement, there was more comments about the concept art in the Undertale art book that futher proved that Toby didn't wan't to make the best looking, or greatest game on Earth. His comment was \"Everyone says the protagonist's sprite looks terrible. That's right. If it looks good, you'll have a different expectation of the game.\" Meaning that he wasn't wanting the game to be expected of as some sort of MASTERPIECE, It's just a quirky comedy RPG that gained a little too much of a fandom. The thing I also love about this game is how it is a sad and disturbing game hidden by a facade of dumb jokes and crappy designs. I just love all the disturbing dialogue, SPOILER ALERT, like San's depression, Alphy's suicidal tendencies, The ending of ENTIRE timeline's at the hand of a demonic child, DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON GASTER. All these subtle undertones make the game extremely more enjoyable, throwing comic relief at you one moment, only to explain a bunch of horrific, depressing, and creepy lore the next. Like I've said, this is why I call it a \"Dialogue RPG\" because it is suppose to explain a narrative, whether creepy or humourus. I would recommend playing this game if your not looking for a standard RPG, because this is a comedy RPG, a genre of RPG more reliant on humor than engaging battle systems and fancy graphics.
