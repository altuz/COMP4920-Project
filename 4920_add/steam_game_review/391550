Know what their plans are...\n\nThe standout feature of BFB is the executions.  Run up to an enemy and you can perform an execution, which there are several different styles.  Executions on humans seem to be the most polished while executions on animals can be performed they are broken.  The executions are gory and generally end up with the victim being torn from their limbs, showing their spines and other internals dangling out\n\nCombat is not very inspiring, you are a giant mech trying to shoot tiny, fast moving, targets where pin point accuracy is required to hit your targets.  If this doesn't change then be prepared for a mediocre experience.  Having said that it's something that can be easily fixed by the dev's.  One option would be allow the projecticles to gravitate towards enemies (not homing missiles) allowing near misses to become hits, therefore slightly more forgiving on current pin point accuracy.\n\nThe first party of the game has you trundling around for around an hour or so through empty streets and building, before adding some K9's to kill, eventualy adding more intelligent, human, foe's.  All of which is interspersed by some puzzle mechanics that need to be overcome to continue on your journey.\n\nA hacking mechanic is in game, which all you have to do is hold a key down to perform the hack.  Hack a terminal and you get a little mono rail journey towards a camera you can view and then hack another camera  until you can hack a switch that opens a door.  Very similar to Watch Dogs, though it needs more polish and copying Watch Dogs mechanic and style for hacking would be no bad thing.\n\nLevel designs are OK, though you will find yourself inside narrow buildings and outside in streets being lead down a corridor, with only one way to go.  Outside there is plenty colours as the Manchester streets are over grown with fooliage, while the inside of buildings are mostly barren and empty.  Though there is a nice night club building you visit briefly.\n\nIt took me around 90 minutes to complete what is currently available, the total play time for Episode One is guestimated to be 3hours.\n\nIf the Dev's are serious about their game then I would expect EA development time to continue towards the 12 month time to apply the polish needed to this game.\n\nEarly Access games are difficult to review.  Line up 10 EA games together and their current feature set and level of polish will differ significantly.  If you don't like to play games which contain bugs and expect all features to be present then I recommend you never buy an EA game.

Being a resident of Manchester myself I can say they nailed what a futuristic version of our great city might look like. And the sound of the wood Pidgeon whilst walking around the city was a nice touch.\n\nI also like the idea of DOOM style fatalities/glory kills on your enemy\u2019s, these are not that well animated at this point but I am sure in future these will look awesome and will feel great to execute.\n\nThe only gripe I had with the game is the voice acting, the main guy who is guiding you through the game was simply a bore to listen to, and the sergeant wasn't much better, it felt like they were literally reading the lines as they were saying them, they needed a bit more enthusiasm for me, but I am sure these lines will be re-recorded for the final release.\n\nAlso the idea of customizable mechs with interchangeable augments and weapons, and the way they feel in game, makes me think this would make a fantastic multiplayer game. Big maps, multiple objective games, interchangeable weapons and fast shooting gameplay... Oh yes :)\n\nAll in all the game look pretty good so far, considering how quickly the team has grown and the fact that an indie dev is creating this AAA style game is amazing!

Broke it down just like talking heads. Most people would know what the break is for\n5. needs a hud or something to help find the attackers. Clicking c and using the scanner is very hard to find them . A hud radar would allow you to see them coming no need for talking heads. \n6. 2nd suit needs a better gun or the missle should stay online till you run out then refill\n7. you get killed running after the energy globes make them come to you I have had to restart game twice because of getting stuck getting the globes of energy.\n8. 4 human will kill you faster than you can shoot them. humans are much to hard to kill. \n9. why does some water kill you and other water you can wade thru either it kills you or it doesnt. and if it kills you give the humans squirt guns instead of rifles. Talking about the area toward beginning when you shoot down the trailer held by the crane. you cant explore cause the water kills you. \n10.Im guessing the GRU HAS A LOT OF Satilites so maube use these to get overhead view insted of talking heads. or send the missles down insted of them to stop working when you ned them.
