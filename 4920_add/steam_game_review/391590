However the soundtrack and the plot were very original. Controlling the main character was not always working smooth or at least on my computer, although that I doubt the issue was from my pc. Anyway if the game developers decide to continue and release a second part it would be a pleasure to see how the plot continues. I would leave the gamers decide whether to buy this game or not. If you like old detective stories with old fashioned clothes and nice jazz music, you may find the game very intriguing. Do not expect to spend more than 10 hours at most playing this game - you will end it up a lot earlier without using walkthrough.

It is mostly a charming and harmless Noir style point and click.  I'm not really a fan of inept heroes that are not specifically funny, just weak on intellect, but it definitely didn't annoy me as much as say... Whispered World.  I was plugging along just fine and more or less enjoying it, when towards the end the slealth mini game stood in the way of an otherwise fun experience.  Most people play adventure games to get away from the hair pulling, button mashing, anxiety fest of games designed for err...no one.  You have a bar on the right side which has to be not too high or too low as you mash or hold the mouse to maintain equalibrium.  At the same time your character has to go faster or slower, avoiding dozens of guards with circles representing their visibility while following just close enough to the woman you are following, but not too close.  I watched a walkthrough where it took at least ten minutes of repeatedly getting caught to finish.  I might just watch the rest of the walkthrough and forget finishing the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455682982, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1455682982, "recommendationid": "21267231", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501712", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488327738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 508, "steamid": "76561198123944279", "num_games_owned": 95}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "One thing I can not abide in a graphic adventure are badly designed finger-twitching puzzles with no way to bypass them.
