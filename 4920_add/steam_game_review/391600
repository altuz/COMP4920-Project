It's really a simple platformer with a very old school feel. Very simple game, navigate rooms full of traps and monsters to rescue the princess. Each time you rescue her, the castle gets bigger and you do it again.\n\nIf you like games like Montezuma's Revenge or Spelunky this will be right up your alley.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500787747, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500787747, "recommendationid": "33736704", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489240", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500714633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 41, "steamid": "76561198179544282", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "+rep at this game King Lucas u can play single and multiplayer how u prefer", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500904656, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500904656, "recommendationid": "33766374", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476415", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500301924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 456, "steamid": "76561198246924776", "num_games_owned": 195}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Este juego es un caramelito que hay que degustar poco a poco, saborearlo plenamente y disfrutarlo al m\u00e1ximo.

It's so frustrating to play this game, you can only jump one height high, there's no way to jump less high to evade stuff above you (just an example of what's terrible). Booooring platforming, lots of keys needed + when you die nothing respawns leading to booooooring revisiting of places a dozen times till you finally get through some annoying spot/have enough keys. The 5 types of enemies I encountered so far required me to use the complex technique of button mashing. All of them. Some took more hits than others for a real change.\nExcuse me, but I feel it's wrong to dedicate more full sentences to this game so...\n\nTL;DR:\n-boring platforming\n-boring enemies\n-boring fighting\n-swords breaking so fast they must be made of wood\n-boring find dozens of keys to open dozens of doors and cages that all look the same - \"gameplay\"\n-boring artstyle\n-boring jokes\n-it's so boring I couldn't spend more time on this, it's awful\n\nI cannot recommend buying this game under any circumstances. Avoid. this. \"game\".\nI literally had more fun writing this review than playing the game. King Lucas is a chore to play.\nI can't say anything positive about it. Who tf uses the X button on a controller to jump?\nNO I won't spend more time trying this, I'd rather get a depression for an actual reason and not from this", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503684603, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503684670, "recommendationid": "34486818", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500889", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 16, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 8}}
