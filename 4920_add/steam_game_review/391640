This is what VR is perfect for! \n\nBe on a Virtual stage, in the limelight, shout into the microphone, get cheered on or boo'd at, sing along to your favorite songs, destroy a styropor guitar, dance til you drop, make peace signs, join random people in their session to cheer them on or blind them with laser pointers or just get emotional with a rose microphone and much more - Yes, Im having a lot of fun playing this, and I havent even seen all aspects of the game yet. \n\nIts just a very nice feeling to get affirmative response from time to time, some kind words, even if its just from NPCs who are generically shouting how awesome I am.  \n\nWhat I also especially enjoyed, was the Karaoke mode in combination with Freeplay, so I didnt feel any pressure to perform good and could just sing along to my music. \n\nOverall, it is a very empowering, fun experience, which gives a nice confidence boost (although my neighbors disagree with me here ;D).  The visual effects are cool, I like the stage design (moon base!), the menu is easy to handle (although the font was a little small for the \"own music\" option) and for me it has great potential to be played more frequently. \n\n\nThere are some things though Id really like to see in future patches and I cross my fingers that this game is still being worked on. \n\n1) For example, when I was looking at the crowd, at all those jumping, cheerful people, I suddenly felt the urge to get a little closer to them. Just a little bit. I felt so distanced somehow. I wanted to interact with them more. And that I couldnt get rid of the microphone stand, which was blocking my sight and therefore breaking the immersion, was a bit frustrating, too.  \n\n2) When you accidentally drop an item, you cant reach it again. It doesnt spawn back, and theres no teleport option or whatever to pick it up, if its too far away. \n\n3) What does the fish item do? I couldnt grab it or do anything with it.  \n\n4) Sometimes the bandmembers were facing the speakers and not the crowd and were in general not responsive at all. They kept doing the same animations over and over again. I wish there was more diversity/content. \n\nBut this is just my opinion and it shouldnt hold you back from supporting this game. Big thumbs up from me \n\nI really look forward to future updates and optimizations - Love this game\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502046290, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502046290, "recommendationid": "34066667", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504411553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_forever": 64, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I cannot recommend this game currently.  It's a shame.  There's a very good idea here, but it's just not very well executed.  So the big draw is that you get to experience what it's like to sing or perform in front of a big crowd.  Well, the problem is that your singing or performance really has nothing to do with how the crowd will react.  You will need to adjust your mic so that you are loud enough and therefore the crowd will cheer.  You can literally say anything as long as it's loud and alternate your pitch.  \n\nThere's a multiplayer option, but there was nobody online when I played.  There's a karaoke option, but you have to go through a bunch of steps so that the words show up on screen.  There's items to pickup and play with, but most of them are just one trick ponies.  There's crowd reactions, but most of the crowd looks the same and their actions are so scripted that after 5 minutes you will have seen them all.\n\nThis game really needed to sell the multiplayer aspect.  It could be more like \"Comedy Night\"; encourage users to watch other people's performances and interact.  Set showtimes for people.  Give people a reason to want to see somebody else perform.  If nothing else, let us be able to record our own performances.  Include comedy or acting shows (not just singing).  Encourage friending of other players.  That would be the true \"STAGE PRESENCE\" VR title that we want.  This falls short of that social experience.\n\nRating 4/10 (would gladly change to recommend if future updates improve current experience)\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504138005, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504138005, "recommendationid": "34621658", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504843", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
