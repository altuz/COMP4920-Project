Played windowed at the time. Suffers from pacing issues due to heavy scripting and difficulty spikes that are hard to predict. Recommend saving often. Rules on when you can save and how are a little vague.\n\nPortrait and music are okay. \n\nPlot is okay but feels a little distant and half baked. World is almost not interactable. Game is on rails and very corridor like. In rpgmaker-engine cutscenes felt well scripted and presented, the intro cutscene with the handrawn art felt compelling. \n\nThe combat system was appropriate to the setting with some form of variety between party members. It varies from holding attack button to win to having to manage the ammo based mana system. It did not strike me as very well developped or thought out. \n\nGame is well structured with the intro clearly presenting the three main acts of the story. By the end of act 3 the linearity softens enough to allow you to grind rather than fight pre-scripted foes. There are +stat on levelup items that can affect balance if equipped or ignored. \n\nThe game does not prompt you often to save progress and I ended up dying at a boss late game and discontinuing play. \n\nXbox360 pad worked fine.\n\nGame had no resolution options and was stuck in a small window that would not enlarge. Very irritating to play in that manner. \n\nLoot variety, freedom, shopkeepers are hard to come by and underdevelopped.\n\nLoredumps that are actually well introduced and interesting were far and few between. I do not think this title is worth keeping around due to the heavy competition within the rpgmaker genre.\n\nConclusion: I liked the slideshow intro, and most of the heroic sci fi tone of the game, you control sub-sections of your squad, and eventually they meet up in one larger squad of 4 and you go defeat the boss from the intro. Its a simple setup that allows you experience plenty of action in a vaguely sci fi universe. Its not great however and the chances that you do not have anything better to play are slim to none.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501797064, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504671809, "recommendationid": "34002732", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504034", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
