THAT unfortunately was a bug.\n\nThe game struggles to communicate to you what should be normal and what fightning. It has this bland and calm way of \"stuff just sorta, kinda happening\" around you. And rare moments that are clearly communicated should be frightning, don't let you marinate in the weirdness for longer than 2 seconds so before you can even get scared everything is back to its bland tone of foggy dream.\n\nAnd so prop objects levitate around you, game is calm. Rooms change behind your back, the same way all the time, the game is calm again. There is no sense of danger just constant \"WTF?\" and occasional laugh at twiching \"scarry doll\"\n\nYou get to see very electronic glitch like screen effects, which are absolutely out of place in game about weird mindscapes of crazed painter. And serve only to remind me over and over that I am playing \"a game\". Killing the last bits of any possible immersion left in this strange game.\n\nFor something with \"fear\" in it's name it is laughable experience.\n\nPerformance is horrid it chops and shutters on system way above recommended. Mouse is weird and i get a glitch where my view slowly truns left or right so at times I had to fight my mouse to even walk straight.\n\nOverall: I feel like authors don't understand horror. Horror should be in thick atmosphere, Unnerving experience that uses video AND AUDIO! to get the consumer in to a state of mind of vounerebility.Unpredictable one off things, both small and huge.
