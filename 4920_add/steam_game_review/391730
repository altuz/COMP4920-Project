I can play on here, save my game to the cloud and load it on my Ipad or android.  I have a ton of hours between them all.  It's a fun, open world game with a fun crafting system and pet system.  It's not very serious either, just a funny indie game.  I would recommend this game to anyone, even if it were $20, it'd be worth the money.  I've have 50hrs on steam, probably just as many between my mobile devices.
