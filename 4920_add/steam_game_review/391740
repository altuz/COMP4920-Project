No background or imagery. And no music, which actually feels like somewhat of a relief as you will see.\n\n- The music sounds like overused stock loops from 2006 (FUCKING KEVIN MACLEOD MUSIC!! SERIOUSLY!?!?), and the graphics look like they were made in 5 minutes, meaning they also look stock. EDIT: recently, with the rebalance of level 1-4, i was able to make it to the first boss, which uses the exact same music the regular stages for that zone had. This is just terrible.\n\n- The controls feel broken and confusing with the sprinting acting like a dash ability. The worst part about said sprint / dash is that to be able to use it you have to be moving already, which, when compared to how sprinting / dashing works normally in games, is just plain wrong. EDIT: The recent update with controler support did not fix tis issue, however it did make it mildly more tolerable.\n\n- I have not played much of the game but i can say with certainty that the frogs need to be balanced as they are able to jump to my position in one leap even if i just entered it's (very large) line of sight.\nEDIT: the pirate ship fight also needs to be balanced, with the boss spawning pirates too often, meaining i end up with a party of about 6/8 pirates chasing me at one time.\n\n- Thats another thing that feels stock and childish. The enemies, the first three you encounter being a frog a bird and a scorpion. ( i THINK its a scorpion at least)\n\n- As previously mentioned, onscreen instructions for when you die or beat a level flash on and off the screen making them hard to read.\n\nOverall this game does not even feel like it was worth the 65p i spent on it.\n\n2 / 10", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1439589053, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439379404, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452273083, "recommendationid": "17503047", "developer_response": "I appreciate your constructive review and will take to heart much of what you said. There are a few things I wanted to address however if that's okay with you.\n\n-Enemy Variety\nAs you said you didn't get very far into the game but there are different types of enemies in each world. The world after the Desert has Trent's,Bears. The Iceland stage has Abominable snowmen, and regular snowmen. There are dinosaurs later as well as aliens too.\n\n-The Frog\nThe Frogs are one of the easiest enemies in my opinion so I'm not 100% sure what the problem is with them? Can you explain more to me?\n\n-Flashing Instructions\nThey're only 4 words so I don't think it's that hard to read them, but I could easily add an option to disable the flashing effect if that seems reasonable to you.\n\nThank you for being constructive in your criticism. I'll definitely try to improve upon the other things you've mentioned in the future.\n", "language": "english", "votes_down": 31, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553606", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486374521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 206, "steamid": "76561198027985974", "num_games_owned": 490}, "votes_funny": 13, "votes_up": 75, "comment_count": "38", "review": "Difficult is an understatement...\nFirst three levels where fun and easy to go through, but then the fourth level came...\nMy gun being completely useless, having to hit those damn ducks four times before they die, while in the meanwhile cannons are shooting at me.

Every level has 3gems to collect and a time trial.  Each world ends in a boss fight.\n- the worlds have a nice variety, sure you have the token ice level seen in every platformer but you also get cool levels like the moon and prehistoric times each with their own unique flair and obstacles\n-lots of characters to unlock.  Characters are unlocked by collecting gems and completing challenges, the character selection is pretty cool and lets you play as all manner of things from a cowboy dog to a banana peel and other silly things\n-each character has different abilities, they are not just pallete swaps.  Choosing the right character can make certain levels much easier and it is really fun to figure out the best tool for the job.  \n-good boss fights\n-cool dash mechanic, there is a dash button and you can dash in mid air as many times as you like.  Mastering the timing of your dash and how you control your jumps is integral to success.  \n-tight controls\n-challenging but not cheap.  The challenge in this game is just right, you will die but it is not hair pullingly frustrating either.\n\nCons:\n- no real joystick support.  Not a problem if you use joy2key but native support would be nice\n-the music and sound effects are generally pretty weak\n\nOverall for $3 you cannot go wrong with this game and if you have any interest in this style of difficult game you definitely should pick it up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440562557, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440564100, "recommendationid": "17719109", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434732", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439583337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 30, "steamid": "76561198118600664", "num_games_owned": 276}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Blaster Shooter GunGuy! is a fantastic game that can explained in one sentence: You play as a guy(s) who has to get jewels and kill enemies, while dying over and over again while smashing his keyboard.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439568161, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439568189, "recommendationid": "17536888", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437845", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440596606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 42, "steamid": "76561198102244261", "num_games_owned": 358}, "votes_funny": 12, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "And I would have finished the fourth level, too, if it weren't for you meddling ducks.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440596017, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1483233887, "recommendationid": "17723853", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499764", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440866612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 86, "steamid": "76561198032566054", "num_games_owned": 150}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is a \"blast\" to play!
