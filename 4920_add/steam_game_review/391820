Sooner or later you get a stable / stagnant mono-culture and no matter which mass-extinction events you introduce, it stays that way.\nWith Evolution, this moment comes very early, sometimes even before the 10th generation.\nWhile there is some complexity in the bots behaviour, the game lacks in any other regard.\n\nYou can't even save creatures in your pond to lett the \"winners\" compete against each other.\nThere is absolutely no environmental diversity.\nImportant evolutionary features like mating for example are missing as well.\n\nAlso, other than in the laboratory, you don't have a quick way to play intelligent designer and tweak a creature on the go.\nOther than the most basic stats like health and hunger, you have nothing. No save or load, import or export functions, nothing.\n\nI'd like to have a so-so thumb for this.
