The Campaign is really long so I won\u2019t be playing through it again obviously. \nIt says online that the campaign is 28 hours on long average which I could be but since this was the only RPG I had and one of only a few different PC games I didn't seem to notice the time going past as I just played a few hours day by day. \n\nI have good memories of this game, running through different zones, killing enemies and collecting loot, I remember dying a lot of a few points and having to run back and fight enemies one at a time when I'd reach a point I was to low geared/ level for the specific enermies/ area. \nI never played Diablo 2 so this was my old school RPG before I got into Diablo 3 and most likely what got me interested in playing Diablo 3 to begin with as I'd never played a game like this before. \n\nGame is pretty old to pick up and play in this day and age but it's a top notch isometric RPG and since there are only a few of those around its worth a play if you need more games like Diablo or Path of Exile in your life. \n\n[h1]8.7/10[/h1]\n[i]- My Nostalgia in a nutshell[/i]"}]}
