The puzzles so far are pretty easy,  but you do have to find them.  There's   a moon like gravity that enables you to jump really high. Also you can create objects that can be used as stepping stones to otherwise inaccessible area's of the game and to help you complete missions.  While   wandering around, you are also  pelted with massive blocks of rock  that are constantly falling  from the sky.  If one hits you, you're dead.  you have a gun that shoots  photon like pulses that  destroy blocks when they are hit.  The gun is also used to activate the  switches that unlock other area's of the game.  You  can fly around using a jet pack, but you do need to collect blue fuel packs which can be found around the world.  There are other (pink) packs to find as well, these give you extra ammo for your  gun.  You can pick up objects, rotate them and even change their  size. \n\nThe developer originally created this game in one of the Ludlum Dare  competitions, where the theme was minimalistic.  You can download the original version [url=http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=15359][b]HERE[/b][/url].  The game has been massively improved especially graphically since   then and now looks   really cool.    \n\nI highly recommend you check it out.  I was looking for a you tube video to add  but as yet haven't found one.  Maybe i'll create one myself if i have time.  :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445031766, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445036669, "recommendationid": "18511752", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560307", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467704518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561197997171987", "num_games_owned": 2106}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Cute idea, but still VERY rough around the edges.
