The story is somewhat reminiscent of Mario looking for the princess but the action is different.  There is far more intrigue to be found in the messages along the way than you ever experienced in Mario.  There is also a \"Link-like\" flavor for those that remember that classic.  Really when you think about it, this game is a conglomeration of a lot of the favorites from the past. \n\nIf you only play the game an hour or so, you can hardly even begin to experience the intense battles that ensue; as with almost any game, the first few levels are easy so that you can get accustomed to the game play (or maybe that is just to make you feel like \"you can do this!\").  Of course, if you are someone that doesn't like a challenge, you will be put off by having to back track when you come to a level unprepared.  This facet of the game reminds me a lot of Link...if you were not ready to go to a certain part (or land) of the game, no way were you getting in.  Had to go back and get what you needed!  Just thought about Boy and His Blob!  That's the way it is with this game. \n\nOf course, any serious gamer wants to experience hours and hours of entertainment, frustrating moments (trying to get through all the laser beams or going back to get bombs because you blew up too many needlessly), intrigue and bewilderment (exactly how do I get out of here???? moments).  Definitely a game worth your time.
