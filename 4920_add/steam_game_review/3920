It is equal in glory to his other smash hits Civ 3 and Civilization.  This game is complex enough to interest the expert, yet simple enough to not bore the novice.  Ignore my 26 hours, I used to play this off the cd in XP and spent many hundreds of hours in it.  True, the graphics are a bit dated, and true, you can only play this in 4:3, yet in my opinion, this is one of the best Windows games of any time. (As I see things only Civ 3 and Railroad Tycoon 2 surpass it.)\n\n[u]Pros[/u]:\n[list]\n[*][u]IT WORKS ON WINDOWS 7 PROFESSIONAL, 64-BIT[/U]  Seriously, when you think back or look at all the old games that don't run on modern computers, this stands out as a great game from the mid 2000s that still plays today.\n[*][u]Replayability[/u]: Yes, each game is similar, in that the map is the same.  Yes, the cities are always in the same spots. However, you as a pirate have four different factions to choose from and you can cause invasions to flip a city from one side to another, assuming of course that you win. :)  \n[*][u]Graphics[/u]: They are great for 2005, decent enough to pass today and require little enough power that I could play it on 64mb of vRam back in the day.  Obviously any recent processor's integrated chip should be able to play it. My Intel HD 530 has a breeze with it.\n[*][u]AI[/u]: In swordfights there is not set pattern of slash, block, dodge, and slash again.  Yes, the ai projects his next move, but then so do you, and so does any swordfighter ever.  The ships do not always sail the same paths, though there are general shipping lanes that the ships do follow (unless they deviate to avoid a pirate).\n[*][u]Simplicity[/u]: This game is easy to  pick up whether or not you have ever played a similar type of game.  There are guides online as to how to be a better player (NOT in any way cheating or exploiting it, just understanding of the finer points of the game).  If you want a relaxing game when you are falling asleep, this can be one.  You don't have to stress to do a good job.\n[*][u]Depth[/u]: There is so much about the game that you can pick up that you won't see at first glance.  Various Special Items add extra abilities.  Intricacies of dancing or sailing, when learned, enable you to do what as a beginner you failed miserably at attempting.  So much so that what you might have raged at as a beginner, you can now do in your sleep.  \nEven when you are a master of the game, sneaking through town is still fraught with peril, and gets the adrenaline flowing.\n[*][u]Open World[/u]: You are not locked into the role of a pirate.  You can go an entire game without ever once firing a shot or harming anyone.  You can choose to essentially be a merchant and spend all your time trading cargos at the various cities.  If you want, you can be faithful to one faction from start to finish and never switch sides.  You [i]can[/i] effectively switch sides, if you so choose.  You can try to see how big of a bounty you can get on your head from one or even all four factions.  You can choose to play to follow the story or not.  You can essentially do whatever you want that the game can do.\n[*][u]Geography[/u]: It taught me the geography of the Carribean better than any textbook ever did.  \n[*][u]Animation[/u]: The cut scenes are quite good (some of them are even funny) and, once unlocked, you can rewatch them over and over again, if you want.  The characters' movements are smooth and not in the least choppy.\n[*][u]Music[/u]: Period-style music that varies from faction to faction and dance to dance.  I find myself turning off the music in-game in most of the titles I've played.  Not so with this one.\n[*][u]Mods[/u]: They are available.\n[*][u]Engrossing[/u]: This is one of those games that is so good you don't want to put it down.\n[/list]\n\n[u]Cons[/u]:\n[list]\n[*]Occasionally the game (graphics, not fps) stutters a bit when two SOLs fire full broadsides simultaneously at maximum zoom out.  Again, this is not a fps drop so much as the game slowing cycles or something.  You dont miss any action, because the slowdown applies to the ai as well.\n[*]some of the dances are super hard.  This may not qualify as a con. ;-)\n[*]Despite the manual talking about different options for starting a game, you first game after installing it will be the default start, without the ability to change the minor options (start year, skill, etc).  Nowhere does the game mention this, it just is.  It was a bit disappointing as one who started up playing it after years of not.  I remembered playing as a medic and was hoping the steam version wasn't lacking.  It isn't, the option jus't isnt there the first time through.\n[*]NOTHING ELSE THAT I CAN THINK OF!\n[/list]\n\nTL,DR ;) This is one of the best games you can buy.  It works on Win7 Pro-64, and I've heard that it works on win 10-64bit.  It is worth every penny you spend. You get more out of the game by reading guides, but you dont have to.  If you wish to use your money to its fullest potential, wait for a sale, but I wouldn't wish to wait. :-)  This game truly is a largely under-appreciated gem. Hours and hours of potential fun.  Mods are available.\n\nPS: This is my first review, so I apologize for any gramatical errors."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506312978, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501950", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35196082", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198123716834", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506362307, "num_games_owned": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 221, "playtime_forever": 273}, "timestamp_updated": 1506312978, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ton's of fun.
