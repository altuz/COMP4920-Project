Only fall back is with windows 10. Your mouse cursor will NOT show. Go into launch options and enter fullscreen=false then launch the game.

(I highly recommend checking the guides)\nThe AI is still shit, but less likely to just kill itself than in the first game (however more likely to just not engage at all.\nhad to pay \u20ac3,99 for borderless gaming, which is just stupid and shouldn't be neccesary.\nall in all a way rougher experience than the first itteration, if you want a game that's playable from the getgo than go for dungeon siege 1.\n\nAll in all I wouldn't really want to recommend it because it should just work in my opinion, but it's a great game nonetheless.\nIf you want to buy it just be aware of this versions downfalls, maybe get it on gog.com or something"}]}
