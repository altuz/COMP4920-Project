At first it may seem the puzzle element overshadows the shooting game but that's only when the game is teaching you the mechanics in the beginning. Later on it gets demanding and expects you to master both strategic shooting and bullet dodging.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game is sort of a block puzzle. By shooting colored blocks on the backround layer you can push them around. Knock blocks of the same colour into eachother and they explode dealing damage to enemies and bullets. Larger chains deal more damage. If you cancel bullets this way on bosses they take damage. This may sound confusing but the game really shows you through it and in the end the core mechanic is quite simple. The challenge to the player is figuring out how to deal with various situations on the fly. Often times you'll find yourself thinking out when to shoot and figure out a plan while managing your way through bullet curtains. Murasaki encourages you to be smart about your shooting sort of like Ikaruga or old school 80's shmups.\n\nA bullet health system is the other half of the puzzle mechanic. A bullets color matches its health and they are damaged by block explosions or the players shot. It's implemented quite well and makes you choose between shots or the size of block chains to go for. The default character is far better at cancelling bullets (ie. defense) while the other can land bigger attacks off the puzzle blocks. The latter also has to be careful going to the top of its screen as she has little range to shoot downwards. However dont expect to be able to always rely on bullet cancels, on higher health patterns this wont work. Often to get larger block chains for tricky sections you will end up not shooting for extended periods and having to dodge much more.\n\nMurasaki's soundtrack is really amazing, top notch and there's a lot of competition in this genre. The chill music on stages goes well with the puzzle element and boss themes match their intensity. A fair bit of music syncing, especially with the true route of stage 5. Even if you're not a fan of the gameplay itself the music might surprise you.\n\nAfter getting the ending you unlock the 6th extra stage which is far more challenging than anything preceding it. The boss of this stage truly demands some dodging skills and figuring out the tricks of its patterns. If you're not a shmup veteran this stage will likely be a wall, but smart play is still always rewarded so it can be enjoyable to learn shmups in this way.\n\nThe game includes a hard mode for the first 5 stages which makes their difficulty curve match more with the extra stage. The bosses get significantly harder and you need to approach some stage sections more as a puzzle. Stage 6 on normal is still tougher than anything in hard mode. There's also an endless stage that really tests your skill in the puzzle element as you cannot memorize and it keeps on getting tougher.\n\nDefinitely one of the best value for money for STG/shmups on Steam unless you have an aversion to bullet cancelling gimmicks. Murasaki implements its idea well and is a joy to play. Should be refreshing to anyone who thinks shmups are out of innovative ideas. It's worth noting this was first released as a free game, and for that it is quite amazing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491661128, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491661550, "recommendationid": "31018522", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538101", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498603934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 265, "playtime_forever": 569, "steamid": "76561198160868511", "num_games_owned": 433}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A cool Touhou inspired shoot'em up/bullet hell with a couple of very interesting twists.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498614853, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498614853, "recommendationid": "32904269", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519154", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "total_reviews": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
