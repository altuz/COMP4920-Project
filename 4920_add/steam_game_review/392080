I would say to give this a few more updates before buying in, however this game is well worth keeping an eye on or picking up if it ever is on sale for sure. \n\nThe ship building mechanics they have inplace right now is wonderful for an alpha stage of a game, but it does take a bit of getting use to playing with it between ingame and free build. As ingame it is not clearly pointed out to you while the free builder has a unmisable option on the games main menu screen, which I hope will be changed in later updates.\n\nIt will take an hour or two for most to get use to the ships momentum as each one handles differently as well as has a stronger drift to them until you master ship designing.\n\nSadly the trading system they talk about in the second video is VERY lacking... NPC ships will perma dock at stations and never sell off what they brought there to sell at times. Which means it is easy for you to get a huge jump start in your early game play(Just go to a small station and hijack a battleship class ship which more then likely holding 200k worth of tradable goods).\n\nAll in all, if the devs stick with working on this game it will be well worth the sell price, only time will tell how this title turns out.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504642281, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504642281, "recommendationid": "34763798", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503564", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505996387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3698, "steamid": "76561197974275772", "num_games_owned": 350}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "review": "So ... this game is going too be A  No .. but that could very well change.\n\n\nThe Good...\n1). Game is fun once you understand it ...  and cant wait to see what it turns into.\n\nThe Bad...\n1).  Price $30.00 U.S. for this game is WAY To High, for an unfinished broken game.  For Early Acess  this game should only be $14.99.  Maybe retail for $24.99....  $30.00 seems steep for what it is ... all that being said .. the game is fun even tho is is broke.   \n2).  Crashes ALOT .... I do mean alot , more then any other Earely Access game.  \n3).  Saving / Saves / Quick Save.   I hate how it is done.   You only have one save and A quicksave.  The Quicksave is Numpad #9 not F5 like every game ever.   Their is no Quick Load, have to exit to main menu and select Load from Quick save or last save. ??? HUH ? (AND with all the crashes this is A very bad save system, you might find  something you need then it crashes and you wont find it again) \n4). Tutoral / info on the game is bad, trying to fig out WTF is going on A first is .... GRR.   Only one youtuber really has any info , most of his content is out of date vs what you will see in game.\n5). Very Grindy early on.   Need to make money (trading is the best way and its slow and boring).  Need to unlock ship models (layouts), by Capping other ships ... but they will be broken from the battel so have to repair (slow) and fly broekn ship back to base to unlock it.   Now you want too mod A ship you have unlocked... you need too find the parts ...get these from killing other shiping and they have a chance to drop research of parts that ship was using. ... cant remove parts from ship you have capped till you have found that same part from combat... go back and grind some more.\n\n\nOverall .... Cant lie the game is Fun .. not sure how much I have played it ... I would say more then 20+ hours .. so i have got my moenys worth ... but I dont think it is worth it for others to buy.... its hard and broken ... dont think most would be happy how it is at this point.'\n\nHowever .. KEEEP AN EYE on it ... ONCE THE GAME IS WORKED ON IT WILL BE A WINNER ! \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505276981, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505276981, "recommendationid": "34913165", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489552", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504608390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 59, "steamid": "76561197982581894", "num_games_owned": 159}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Overpriced.
