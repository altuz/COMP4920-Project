I tried Archeage, I tried Tera, I tried Rift, I tried every recent mmo. They're just all... Terrible.\n\nThen I tried FFXIV. The combat is WoW-like. The main quests are like a single player story-driven RPG (don't let this line drive you away, they're one every few levels).

They key differences that FFXIV, and say, WoW have are that:\nFFXIV has a 2.5 second gcd, reducible with skill speed, as opposed to wow's 1 sec gcd\nFFXIV makes up for this additional time by putting a greater emphasis on abilities that are off of the global cooldown, so in effect you get a very similar gameplay pacing once you get access to your ogcd abilities\nFFXIV does not have talents, so the gameplay differences between one ninja and another are going to be minimal.\nFFXIV tends to have more of a focus on a rotation/priority system rather than a proc/priority system.  \n\nSo what it boils down to is that the games play very similarly.  It doesn't exactly innovate anywhere in this department, but it works, and feels decently rewarding.\n\nThe crafting system is one of the best I've seen in an mmo because it is an actual system, not just a press button get items task.  Same for the gathering system.  \n\nStory: 8/10\n\nFFXIV is an MMO with a heavy emphasis on story.  You have to complete every quest of the main story line to actually get to endgame content as opposed to other mmos where its just level locked.  However, the story is pretty decent, not amazing, but decent.  If I were to have any complaints about the story it would be that you(the warrior of light) have copious amounts of impenetrable plot armor.  \n\nPacing: 4/10\n\nProbably the game's weakest point, to the point that I give it its own section.  The story, gameplay, and everything do not become interesting until around level 35-40 ish.  Up until that point, the game is paced painfully slowly.  For instance, your rotation as lancer has a grand total of 2 spells until about level 26, 1 if you don't care about a mere 10 potency increase, and this problem persists over other classes.  \nThe story sends you on a lot of pissing quests up until that point as well, to the point that the game makes jokes about it.  Then once you get to to 50, you get to do about 100 quests that give you practically no experience and are just there to advance the plot, and there is a fair amount of piss taking in these quests as well.  Heavensward, however, was interesting start to finish, so there is that to look forward to.  \nThe game also requires you to do dungeons while leveling.  I'm not wholly against this, but this plays into the issue of the pre 40 pacing, there is a grand total of 1 healing class pre 30 since arcanists are counted as dps, so your q times are moronically long as dps.  Doing a string of quests at your own pace just to get a quest to do a dungeon, and then having to wait 20 minutes to find a party really breaks up the immersion and feel of the game.\n\nMusic: 9/10\n\nis final fantasy has good music, nothing new under the sun.\n\nVisuals: 8/10\n\nThe game is rather pretty.  Not much to say here.  The only potential downside is that particle effects can be rather overbearing in fights and make it hard to tell what's going on.  \n\nOverall:\n\nAbout a 7/10, but if you can get past the pacing it goes to a 8-9/10 pretty quickly.\n\nAs an aside, there are a lot of complaints that the steam version gives people troubles, so you might want to get it through square's website instead.  It is also of note that you can't refund the game if you get it on steam unless you're able to download and install the game in under 2 hours.

I started WoW early 2006 in the original game and played every expansion since.  At one time, I was among the top 50 internationally rated Alliance Trees.  Not a rookie, as these things go. \n\n I just recently started FF14 and in the 140 hours or so played thus far, I must say - nice!  Polished, very few bugs, if any and thus far no great horking game-breakers at *all*.  I say \"if any\" because I'm starting to think that some of the 'bugs' I thought I encountered were just my unfamiliarity with the game, not bugs at all.  Nice environment, atmosphere, game mechanics, players - the whole shebang.  And you can have *every* class in one character, which means, of course, that I'm levelling the lot of them in lock-step.  It will take longer to level that way, but at any point I can pick and choose what suits me best at the moment or for the day.  It's a very nice feature, that.  \n\nYou can, if you wish, rush a single 'toon to max, or play along at a leisurely pace, as you wish.  There are a set of 'tests' that you must pass before you can play a dungeon in any particular role (tank/heal/dps) - they're not hard, but they ensure that if you're in a dungeon, you know the basics of dungeon/party play, which greatly reduces the chance of newb mistakes.  \n\nThe crafting is comprehensive and well put together - and *useful* which is a nice thing to have in crafting.  If I had to ask for anything, I would say the ability to craft using materials that are in your retainers' packs without having to summon them and withdraw it.  \n\nThe combat mechanics are interesting and nice to watch while at the same time not being onerous or overly difficult to learn or use.  That's very nice when you can literally be a healer in one moment, a rogue in the next, and a tank in the  next.  The switches aren't disorienting - you can pick up a new class/role in a minute or two even if you haven't played it in awhile.  Yet the abilities are suitably nuanced that there is a definite skill level involved - you better you know your class, the more effective you are at playing it.\n\nActually, having played this, I'm done with other MMOs for awhile - probably at least a few years.  This one is going to be entertaining for a *long* time, I think.  I'm glad I bought it, and I think you will be, too.  Highly recommended."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507072981, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35458639", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198120315216", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1507169790, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3711, "playtime_forever": 6094}, "timestamp_updated": 1507072981, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Coming into this game with the only MMO I've ever played [strike](WoW)[/strike] probably hampered my experiance a little with Final Fantasy XIV. Well, that and the tedious grinding played a role in me having a bit of a sour taste for this game. As of this moment I have almost 100 hours of play time, have just reached level 58, and have barely started the second expansion Heavensward. You would think that with all this conent it would be a good thing right? No. Not when most of the content has you just fast travelling all over the world to talk to one person and then have you travel somehwere else over and over and over again. \n\nAll this while I'm playing a White Mage (healer) I can get instant ques for dungeons and raids which helped me progess a bit faster than others, but for DPS I can only imagine the wait for a que pop. I was lucky enough to of had a lot of free time within the time span of 2-3 weeks to be able to play this game so much and level up quickly, but to the ordinary Joe/Jane who have to deal with school and work or sometimes both, you're going to be stuck at the beginning stages of the game for quite some time I'm afriad. Seeing everyone run around with all the cool gear and the likes gets you really envious and hungry to reach end game content faster only to lament the fact of the snails pace you're moving at which will lead most people to dropping the game I believe. \n\nWith that cry baby rant over, there are a couple of things that stood out to me while playing that made me want to continue the grind. The game overall is gorgoues and the different areas of the world are designed pretty well. There are a plethora of things to do besides quests and such. The community is generally rather quite nice and more than willing to help those in need. But the one thing that led me to want to keep playing was when I was in the middle of running through East Shroud and had just stumbled upon a mass of players (about 40-50 or so) just about to start the Odin (Fate). I just sat back and watched a tiny Raid playout in the middle of the forest. \n\nI think with all that said it is best to just to download the free trial which lets you play up until level 35 to ground youself with the game. Once you hit 35 for free you should cough up the $20 for A Realm Reborn and enjoy the free 30 days of playtime to its fullest. I think that will be more than enough time for you decide wether or not you should purchase the next expansions/monthly subscriptions. If you do purchase the game off of Steam you will have to buy the next expansions off of Steam too I believe.
