The game looks spectacular and the old narrative feeling is back.\nGameplay is relatively similar, though combat has been overhauled to some extent, with tactics being a once-a-battle thing now and it's decided before-hand not mid-battle.\n\nThe new combat is great by the way. The new land battles helps add to the flavor of the game, though sometimes I feel it doesn't make sense, such as when you want 30% of your army to be aircraft and you end up with loadouts you can't control where you might have 80 infantry, 30 tanks, and 2 aircraft.\n\nFrom there we get onto some more disappointing points.\n\nFirstly is performance. A game of Endless Space 2 is meant to run about 300 turns. If you play on slow, about 450 turns. But with my own specs of an i7-6700K, GTX 1080Ti and 16GB RAM, on top of having the game on an SSD, performance becomes sloppy inside 150 turns with ease. Battles start having random stutters and turns themselves slow down to some extent (Though I will give it credit for not being anywhere near as bad as Firaxis' trademark mega waits for Civilization turns)\n\nWe come to the two points now that I feel are the most critical in why I'm unfortunately disappointed so far:\n\n1: The AI.\nThe AI feels incomplete. It mocks you every few turns like clockwork, simply tells you what it's going to do in a few turns (Like going to war), and its ability to build up its own empire is...strange at best.\nThe AI manages to expand rapidly at the start. I'm not the most experienced player but on normal I definitely felt the AI outpaced me by miles in the early-game periods. However that quickly changes as the AI gets bogged down over nothing and thus doing nothing. An AI can go to war with you and simply never try to attack, or when they do it's for the one system they seem to want and that's it, or they just want to abduct people for 30 turns.\n\nFrom a diplomacy standpoint the AI is full-on idiotic. An AI declares war on you due to having the opportunistic trait and you are at war already, but you take 10 systems off of them and they will still simply refuse peacedeals point blank when the war is about to wipe them out the game. It simply feels like the AI barely takes anything into account, and ultimately after about 100+ turns I feel like the AI just falls apart entirely.\nOn a side note, if you get an AI ally, they will go to war without saying anything, then insult you for not helping every 3-4 turns, but there is simply no way to be asked to join a war or offer, you just have to know who they are at war with and do it manually. It might work but it's impractical in this day-in-age for a 4X game.\n\n\nFor the second point, we have UI and events.\n\nI enjoy the atmosphere of Endless Space and I like the overall gameplay, but I swear that I have *never* seen a game with such blatant disregard for player input as Endless Space 2. The standard 4X events are practically full-screen on this game, and they will pop up almost randomly. Sometimes a start-of-turn event will popup 10-15 seconds after you are navigating some other menu. There is no coherency between menu panels because you will get an option to go see something, click it, and then it has simply replaced it with a new event to go see something else.  \n\nUltimately the events could outspam a dedicated spambot on reddit, with the game basically mandating that you try and manually turn off as many of the more pointless events as possible so you can feel sane when you click end-turn.\n\n\n\nUpdate: So I've put a bit more time in, another 5-6 hours and found a few new issues. Some petty, some outrageous:\n\n- The AI shutting its borders whilst you blockade them appears to despawn your blockading fleet from the game, but it keeps it in your lists and keeps charging you for it, you effectively lose the ships permanently. If this is otherwise, the game is not saying. (So I just lost about 1.2M dust worth of ship value and it's now draining 9,000 manpower a turn at random. Seems to be 100% broken)\n-AI's late-game tactics appear to be trying to spam one planet with 5-6 bad fleets so that they can keep it permanently guarded and keep getting land battles in, even though they cannot win a single space battle\n-Even trying to work out what treaties you have with everyone is a serious hassle. You might as well write them down because unless you are allowed to cancel it right now, you can't see what treaties are there.\n-Performance has become cripplingly low in terms of turn timers and just trying to get battles to load, this is by turn 200-210 on a 300-turn game on a large map with 8 players...\n-Nothing and I mean *nothing* scales properly in this game. I make 9,000 dust a turn but the AI offers me peace and 39 dust per turn. At the start of my latest game, with 3 systems in my empire, a minor system asked me to build 18 buildings in 15 turns...suffice to say that was impossible.\n-Lastly, I won a supremacy game and it turned around and told me to go to the score screen, only to sit on the loading menu for 3 minutes and never load it at all.\n\nEnd of Update\n\n\nIn summary, I want to reiterate that overall I do like the game. I feel the best way to describe Endless Space 2 is it feels like a AAA company made it, but it's as if they've never done anything even remotely similar to this game before. I enjoy the game for only as long as the events can be kept at bay (Which they often can't) and the AI stays competent(which again it often doesn't).\n\nI'm going to have to say that even on sale, you might be disappointed with the state it is in, despite how visually appealing it is and how great the core gameplay itself still is too. I would check back and see if the devs have been able to alleviate at least the AI in the future.\n\nAfter all the stuff I posted in the update section, I have to say this is an even greater disappointment than I thought. It's a shame because Endless Space 1 is great.

I liked the original game, have truly enjoyed the refinements added in Endless Legend, with faction specific quests and overall improvements made. Now, ES2 is another improvement made on the series.\n\n+ absolutely crisp, elegant graphics (as always, style is a personal preference and I like it)\n+ very interesting races, with their own playstyle. Entangle systems in the \"roots\" of a giant tree? Buy whole planets with cash? Twist time or simply play the science game?\n+/- As always, the tech tree is a bit of a challenge. So many options, radial progression along spokes of a wheel. Interestingly enough, you have to balance. Terraforming or a new weapon? Happyness for your pops or a new space ship class? The search function helps to find important things like command points.\n- Spaceship design. Yes, all the basics are there. Hulls, thruster types, special resource weapons, armor and shields. But they all are a bit too generic, no really surprises. Lazors, slugs or torpedoes? What about time bending local distortion cannons, swarm launchers, acid goo? A bit more daring and faction unique designs, please.\n+/- Space combat. While an improvement over the old system, the tactics are not a bit better. It is still an absolute passive, coffee-brake-sit-back-and-enjoy-the-show event. Mass usually wins.\n+/- Ground combar. The ground combat is actually more challenging as you have to assemble enough starship troopers to invade and the ground resistance can be pretty tough. You even can invest in all three forces, soldiers, tanks, air crafts. The \"simple graphics\" are fine for me. I still yearn for special troopers here as well. Stellaris shows the way. Psi corps, alien bug riding cavalry, smart killer bots, you name it. \n\nOverall, I am very pleased with ES2 and will enjoy the occasional round here and there until I played through most factions.\n\nRecommended, if you like Stellaris, Endless Space 1 or Master of Orion.

A great sequel to Endless Space, and a great game on it's own. The customization options for creating custom factions is fantasticly done.

Go for ultimate hardcore mode with tons of enemies, difficult smaller factions, chaotic start, and a custom faction that has only negative traits! It's a doozy. Or go for an easier method with fewer enemies, easier small factions, and a hyper-focused custom faction.\nThe variations of potential factions is crazy fantastic. Unlike other games that provide some trait differences to production of food or materials, or a slightly different start bonus, you can have factions that don't even use food, and can warp time. Or you can have a faction that has gigantic motherships that can move between systems to claim ownership, leaving the other system open to colonization in the process. Or a faction that buys out production with influence. Or another faction that buys out smaller faction favor and settles new systems with dust (gold equivalent). The possibilities are endless, and are a great example of how to do a very varied faction/race system. \nThe research trees are well done, and are being well tweaked for balance and gameplay fun as the updates roll out.

Endless legend is beautiful, immaculately detailed, well-tuned and engaging.\n\nTotal \"one-more-turn\" fun-ness.\n\nAll that being said. The game could use a few improvements. Namely, combat. It's quite confusing. I don't get the combat cards. It seems all a bit random. And after watching one space battle I pretty much skipped them all. \n\nThe other thing that could be improved is the AI. Which is pretty much a given in just about every game these day, amiright? But yeah, the AI seems to act just a bit insane and isn't very friendly even when its in their best interest.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, the UI could use improvement. The detail is amazing but gets really, really cluttered, especially on the \"system\" screen. An in-game help system like an \"Endlessopedia\" would be great. Also, some indication of where pirates are going to be and how to stop them. Maybe even the ability of certain ships to just \"hunt pirates\". It's a PITA to manually spawncamp on independent systems to kill pirates.\n\nOverall, I still like the game. Very detailed, beautiful, original 4X game.
