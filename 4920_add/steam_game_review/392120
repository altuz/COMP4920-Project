There may not be much of a story, but for a twin-stick shooter, it's pretty fun!  It feels good and the zombies movement is just right!  They don't maul you too fast! lol   Here are some first thoughts without VR...\n\nPROS:\n\n+Can be played without VR.  Works great with KB & mouse or gamepad.\n\n+Unlimited ammo! You do have to reload, so don't get too bold!\n\n+Weapons pack a punch and mow through the hordes!\n\n+Weapons are everywhere to swap and try out.  If you don't like it, go back and grab your old weapon.\n\n+Ability to ask NPC's to join you and form an army.  You can give them weapons! If they need them...\n\n+You can kill NPC's that refuse to join you without your army of NPC's attacking you! They're so loyal... ;-)\n\n+You can cure the zombie infection on yourself and NPC's.\n\n+Has other enemies besides just zombies.  Some are fast and will maul you quick, so keep shooting!  You got unlimited ammo, but remember you do have to reload! \n\n+It has Survival Mode!!! That's a BIG plus for me!\n\n+Sound effects and music are great and fit the game well.\n\n+Randomly generated levels means you never play the same game twice!\n\n+It has your basic stamina system. You can't run forever, but it refills FAST!  Makes the game slightly more realistic.\n\n+Gameplay is pretty fun and seems very polished.  Has a good zombie survival feel to it.\n\n+Supports OS X and PS4 wireless controllers! Keyboard & mouse work just as well if not better.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-Survival Mode isn't that fun.  It's way different!  There aren't any weapon or item pickups other than meds for curing infection that I could find.  You start off with 4 NPC's and they run out of ammo and die fast!  I made the mistake of giving one of them my weapon and couldn't find another one for myself! lol\n\n-You walk really slow, but you can run for about 15 seconds, before having to rest for only a couple of seconds.\n\n-NPC's run out of ammo! This needs to be changed IMO.  NPC's need AI tweeking too.\n\n-Night brings almost total DARKNESS! It's when the zombies and other creeps are most active. I had problems seeing certain enemies because the flashlight isn't that good.  It needs to illuminate the area more.\n\n-Cartoony graphics.  They're kind of flat in appearance.  This is only a negative if you don't like cartoony graphics.  I like them!\n\n-Single player only, but states that MP is coming.  Feels like MP with all the NPC's you can amass! \n\n-Can't climb on objects like cars, boxes, etc.  No a big deal with unlimited ammo! ;-)\n\n-No roll or defensive moves other than run. It would be nice to roll out of the way.  At least you can strafe while shooting!\n\n\nI can't really think of any other negatives!  I like the game a lot so far!  No glitches, hiccups or crashes! :-)  I give it a 8/10 just for the sheer fun factor and army building feature alone! :-)  Oh, and TY for the unlimited ammo!  It makes the game so much more fun than some of the other twin-stick shooters!  It's fast, furious and it doesn't let up when night falls!  Fear the night! ;-)\n\nRuns silky smooth on my MacBook Pro:\n\nHardware Overview: \n\nModel Name:  MacBookPro 11,5 (Mid 2015)\nProcessor Name:  Intel Core i7\nProcessor Speed:  2.8 GHz\nNumber of Processors:  1\nTotal Number of Cores:  4\nL2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB\nL3 Cache:  6 MB\nMemory:  16 GB Type:  DDR3  Speed:  1600 MHz\nVideo Card:  AMD Radeon R9 M370X, VRAM 2048 MB\n\nOperating System: OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 (64 bit OS)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491725930, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491757267, "recommendationid": "31034993", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494260", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
