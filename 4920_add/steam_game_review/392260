I like it more on PC rather than my iPad.\n\nIt feels inspired by games like Bastion (map design & the way it draws on the screen), Fate by Wildtangent (the atmosphere & loot), with a very fast & simple turn based combat.\n\nPlays very well with Mouse & Keyboard such as Fate, or if you're not familiar with that, think of Torchlight--point, click, pickup loot & go.\n\nI really like this game, and will play it more often than others that cost way more than this title. \n\nI rate it 10/10: Highly Recommended!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506837993, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506837993, "recommendationid": "35365319", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507151489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 239, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 239, "steamid": "76561198009005678", "num_games_owned": 340}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I've seen many games claim to be Rogue like dungeon crawls and be just horrible.\n\nThis game is exactly what I would think a traditional Rogue like game would be.

Worth the price for the time it will take to play through the story mode but once that is done it is debatable as to whether you  will want to stick with this again. \n\nTactical element here as monsters have different attacks and ways of doing things and obviously forces you to try and find or pick the right strategy to deal with each situation. Fairly simple, good coffee break style game and a game you can dip in and out of. For the price it is recommended but is not a \"deep roguelike\" - could do with more stuff but definitely worth picking up if you like the genre.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506228065, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506228065, "recommendationid": "35170817", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507103354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 378, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 378, "steamid": "76561198013867802", "num_games_owned": 883}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Neat Rogue-lite with some light town building.
