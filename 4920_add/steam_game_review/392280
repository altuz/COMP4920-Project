Sure, there are plenty of absurdities in the writings of one of the best authors of all time, that one might find random, but they are grotesque and unsettling, they will make you feel insignificant, helpless and powerless against the weight of the system. They serve a purpose.\nHere everything is just random without any real purpose. What's the deal with the monkey-detective? Or the astronaut, that we never see again? Random things just happen and we're done with them for ever. The whole game seems completely amateur and lacks focus. You can't just pass that as Kafkaesque, it doesn't work that way.\n\nThe story has very little to do with Kafka, except that the protagonist of the story, named simply K. is involved in events that are beyond his own control and tries to find the way out of it, which is Kafkaesque, I must admit. There are some twists and turns, but overall, not too much of a story at all. Stretched over 4 chapters, the whole script probably took no more than 2 regular pages, including the dialog. The events don't connect to each other much. Random things just happen and nothing really makes any sense or has any purpose.\n\nThe characters are non existent, even the main protagonist has no personality whatsoever. I have hard time to say anything else about any of them, because there is nothing to say. There is a dog, fallowing K. for some reason.\n\nYou might think that this is a short game and a single person effort, so how much of a story and character development I should expect?\nBut short games, and even games that were made by a single person can be good or even great games: Milkmaid of the Milky Way is a great example, Gemini Rue is a single person effort, while not exactly short, Fran Bow was developed by a team of 2, I'm yet to play The Darkside Detective, but I've heard it's great. The thing is, I bought this game because I knew it's short, I love short games. If I have just one evening a month, that I can spend point-and-clicking, there is nothing better for me than a 2-4 hour game.\n\nSure, short, small team games might not have it all, maybe the story is not so interesting, perhaps puzzles are somewhat weak, but there must be something that makes them worthwhile. I could forgive a lot if there is at least one aspect in the game that stands strong. In fact, I wouldn't mind anything that's wrong with this game, if puzzles were half decent.\n\nBut the puzzles in this game are downright annoying! They have absolutely nothing to do with the game itself, they are just a very amateur way of dragging this game longer than it should have been. Of course, the number sliding puzzle has to be in there, how else are you going to show your lack of creativity? Here is an idea: instead of creating some real puzzles as obstacles to overcome, why not simply depict going somewhere as a board game that has nothing to do and doesn't tie in any way with the rest of the game?\n\nMost of these puzzles can be solved simply by clicking and dragging things around. There are no complex puzzles, all of them will have hints in the same screen that you're in. In fact, you're unable to walk back, so you're always on one screen until you progress. There are no inventory or items to make things more interesting. Sometimes you might not know exactly what you're supposed to be doing, but just click enough things around and you'll get there.\n\nOther times, I failed to find the logic behind the puzzles whatsoever. Sure, there were hints for most of them, but they still made no sense. There was a puzzle with a toy monkey, you drag the string, the monkey plays the drums. Notice the number on the hat and play the drums to represent that number. I get it, but in what way does that make any sense? Why would there be something when we played the correct sequence? It's just random and it really started to pissed me off. \n\nThe newspaper ad and train puzzles seemed like simple brute force puzzles to me. Perhaps I just wasn't looking hard enough, but it looked like there's all there is to them. The signature puzzle made no sense. Why would hitting X not print the X, but rather part of the letter K?! The first lock puzzle, made absolutely no sense as well, there was an obvious clue for the number, but there wasn't any clue for what those letters represent. And to think of it, why does the lock have the number that represents the combination printed on it?! It's just very very lazy.\n\nOther than great looks, this game has not much to offer. The story feels rushed and out of focus. The puzzles are just lazy, uncreative, unimaginative and sometimes felt plain annoying. There are no characters worth mentioning, the story is weak and the twist at the end is just lazy too.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506825377, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506825377, "recommendationid": "35361261", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499863", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 7}}
