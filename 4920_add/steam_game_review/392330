He will use his brigades realistically, and efficiently, striking when in seems right, and...depending on your foe...he may fight it out on one line 'If it takes all summer' (Grant said that) instead of an all out, continued attack. YOUR tactic will effect THEIR tactic...if youare skirmishing a lot, they will spread out their brigades to see how far your line may be spread based on you skirmishers..and they may use it as a ruse. The AI is extremely advanced..I hope to get Waterloo...as it is a battle I like, and I like the game enough to get it, Buut.....\n\n.....Recomendations- Multi select system...it is annoying to click each unit, then double click where you want them...you can use brigade/corps/division commanders to advance their men, but I had trouble getting this too work...:/ The game also crashed a bit, and remained open in the background (Likely for a quick start up...?) I recomend the game to be a bit cheaper as well...Finally, a battle I would like to see...The battle of Bunker Hill. This is an excellent series, and hope it continues to develop...\n\nWishing you Luck,\n                               -TWD", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504912999, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504912999, "recommendationid": "34825138", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499175", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1}}
