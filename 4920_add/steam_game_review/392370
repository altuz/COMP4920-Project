Meaning that there\u2019s \u201cno conclusion\u201d to this story yet.[/b]\n\nIt starts a bit slow to be honest. After a while you learn more about the characters and the story itself. It\u2019s a kinetic visual novel, in other words, there\u2019s no choices and you only read. I liked the concept, it was quite interesting even if it\u2019s somewhat cliche. The art style is simple, which is okay because the story is good.\n\nBGM was good too, sometimes kinda repetitive. My only complain is about the narration: mostly it\u2019s narrated from the MC\u2019s point of view, but it suddenly changes to another person. I got confused sometimes, but I noticed that changed a bit after 3 or 4 chapters, and it got easier to identify who\u2019s saying what. \n\n6/10, hopefully the developers will release the next parts on Steam as well!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1476232129, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1476232129, "recommendationid": "25990585", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534052", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1473251685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1486, "steamid": "76561198031899854", "num_games_owned": 35}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is the first part of a kinetic novel by the doujin group [url=http://www.migiha.net/top.html]Migiha[/url]. It was originally released in 2010, and they have continuations and other games by now as seen in their website. As a kinetic novel, it don't have choices (different from the sister genre visual novel).\n\nCharacter art and story were done by [url=https://twitter.com/Shori39639]Shori[/url] ([url=http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?id=14353]his pixiv[/url]).\n\nThe script (code side and timings for every line, screen, image, sound) was writed originally in NScripter engine by [url=https://twitter.com/JeffreyManson]Jeffrey Manson[/url]. While not open-sourced, royalty-free commercial use of NScripter is permitted and it's the same engine used by Tsukihime.\n\n\nAlmost all songs were composed by [url=https://twitter.com/tokibu]Tokibu[/url].\n\nAs it should be obvious by the fanart in Shori pixiv and Jeffrey's handle in twitter as a melty blood player, they are both typemoon fans, and Wish is strongly influenced by tsukihime in artstyle, tropes and engine used originally. But the writing style and story itself can't be taked as derivated work from typemoon at all.\n\nBacked by a [url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/305439676/change-localization-by-supporting-culture-select-w/description]Kickstarter[/url], Culture Select ported it to Unity engine, translated for both english and spanish and released it on Steam. While some things ended up slower (like the title screen menu), they have done a very nice job at translation and quality check. I didn't see a single typo from beggining to end. It's important to notice how crucial this change in engine is, as NScripter is only compatible with Windows.\n\nAs said before, art style of Shoori is strongly influenced by typemoon, is special Takeuchi older style. The background images beeing free sourced photos with filters to give a drawing/painting feel further reinforce the \"tsukihime-roots\" impression.\n\nBut the writing style is nothing like Kinoku Nasu. Intead of going for a more poetic and complex approach, the impression is that it overprioritize beeing direct, clean and consistent. The structure is not unlike \"to Heart\".\n\nSpecially in the first parts of the game, the scripting (timing of lines, images, sounds and effects likes screenshakes) in simply impecable, making it full obvious how much care there was for every single beat. As a consequence, the bigger parts (scenes, sequences, acts) flows very naturally.\n\nTokibu compostions (the majority beeing simple but beautifull piano songs in pentatonic) goes very well with both contemplative and action scenes.\n\nLast things to be said: this is the 1st part of the history, so don't expect it to be conclusive.
