It's written with taste and the dialogues don't let too much interrogation out of the way. Meaning, you don't end up questioning the conclusions of the characters ; it really feels like investigators talking. It make sense, and that helps a bunch to set the mood. As far as visual goes, it's not the most impressive pixel-art I have seen and the art direction is a bit shy in my opinion. But on the other hand it really is so polished and neatly done that it paints a good picture nonetheless. \nOh and the music is really good. Not overly original being a piano score for the most part, but so efficient for the atmosphere.\n\n\nTL;DR\nGood investigation adventure so far, and free for the first chapter.
