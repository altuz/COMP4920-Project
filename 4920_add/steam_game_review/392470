As a strategy game, however, it's just OK. While you can personally manage the civil development and battles, you can (and eventually have to) delegate these to the AI. The real challenge and fun comes from the historical quests you get playing as the major clans in the different scenarios, where you have to achieve various goals to emulate actual famous battles and other events within specific deadlines. Yes, you can play as some obscure clan and lead it to greatness, or even create your own clan, but then the game just becomes a strategy game, and in that respect, Shogun: Total War 2 is the superior game with the same setting but without the \"historical simulation\" element. Another issue is that this game is a port from Japan, and as such is a lot more expensive than similar games and has some minor translation issues that cause confusion.\n\nIn sum, if you're a hardcore Oda Nobunaga fan who wants to simulate Sengoku history, pony up the cash and get this game. If you're just looking for a fun, straightforward strategy game of trade, diplomacy and conquest, get the Shogun Total War games instead,", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498227310, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498227330, "recommendationid": "32682744", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663768", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493657385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 423, "steamid": "76561198062189304", "num_games_owned": 256}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is great if you like Japanese types of games where they foucus on illustration and presentation rather then graphics.

(remember, this is the 80s we're talking about!) My thought was....\"wow, that must be a great game to cost that much!!! \" Well after saving up with paper route money, I finally rode my bike to the store and bought it. My brother thought I was crazy.......but then we played it! \n\nWOW. Endless days playing this game. Even my brother was swayed. When the SNES and Nobunaga's Ambition II came out, it was a no brainer. Years later, I then left home and hadn't played it since.\n\nI then saw NA Sphere of Influence on steam and wondered. Will I love it again?? I put it on my wish list and waited for the Summer Sale and bought it!\n\nReview:\n\nThis game is outstanding. However, don't compare it to Shogun:TW. The setting is the same, but the gameplay isn't. This game is more akin to playing Crusader Kings with a dash of total war battle mini-game.\n\nThe beauty of this game is the ability to plan on the overmap with vassals and retainers exactly how you'll invade territory. You can set routes of march for each independent army, set which provinces will support the other, order vassals to provide support to specific units etc and then hit \"end turn\" and watch your plan unfold. If you need to adjust your plan; you pause, make changes and go again. It's very well done.  The graphics for the units on the overland map are just like the graphics used in the Japanese TV series AOI Tokugawa Sandai. Youtube it. You'll see. @ 5 Minutes, 39 Seconds and 8m 45s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGZn6CXxNSY#t=5m38s\n\nThough the game may seem daunting at first, it really is picked up rather quickly if you have a taste for grand strategy. You can micromanage every single castle, or designate provinces, assign regents and set the more tedious funtions of government to be delegated to your retainers. You can set a policy which is conservative, progressive or neutral. You can also set focus on Agriculture, Military or Crafts (commerce)\n\nThe game also has these intermissions with slide show animations about historical events that took place during the time, giving you, at least, a basic understanding of the situation in Japan at the time. It's great for the history minded, though are easily skipped if you prefer to.\n\nYou can create your own officers. Create your own clan. Form alliances. Absorb tribes, dominate vassals. Appeal to the Emperor for titles. It's ALL THERE.\n\nIf you love strategy and especially, if you love the history of Japan. This game is a no brainer.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get it. Play the admittedly, boring tutorial. Then play on easy for a bit to get the hang of it. Really, there is a lot to do, but the game will prompt you when things need to get done. Once you see how it is done, you delegate to your retainers. Once you figure that out, (which doesn't take long) it's really easy to start dreaming big about how you'll become Sei-i Taish\u014dgun!!!!!\n\nHeeeet Heeeet Hoooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498932407, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498933590, "recommendationid": "33094568", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515219", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507080932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 121, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 14143, "steamid": "76561198140956356", "num_games_owned": 37}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I love this game, I know its hard to tell by how many hours i put in it lol.

I'd dipped my toes into the EU world and I just never quite was able to dive in. And while on the surface this looks like one of those sorts of games, in truth it's somewhere in the middle. And I'm happy to say that it does this well. I particularly like how the story elements gave somewhat context to what was going on. The quests themselves are more meaningful than in the total war series as they strive to compel the game to be more historically accurate. Granted you can ignore them with no harm coming to you, but I did enjoy that bit. And it's quite frankly one of the reasons I'll definitely be playing the game again but as a different faction. \n\nMost importantly though, the AI was actually half decent even on normal. It was smart enough to form alliances against me and in one particular case had me bottled up for some time. My only complaint is that I wished more countries went on the offensive against me. But that might just be because I was on normal instead of hard.

If you like japanese history or this kind of game in general, then this game is not so bad.\n\nBUT....\n...it's a massive click-fest. You wanna upgrade your castle ?\n1. click on upgrade\n2. click on the castle you wanna upgrade\n3. click on the slot you wanna upgrade\n4. click on the upgrade you want\n5. click on the guy you want to do the job\n6. click on the confirmation \n... and you're getting kicked back to map, if you want to upgrade another slot on the same castle, you have to start from point 2 again. If you want to upgrade 4 slots in each of your 20 castles, you're clicking like made for the next 15mins+. Isn't much better for the rest of the game. You can automate at least some of that, but then you have to live with what the AI builds...which is usually crap. The AI built town ends up with 4ooo rice a year and a meager 2ooo soldiers....build it manually and you end up with 20ooo soldiers and still enough food.\n\n\nGoing to war..isn't overly enjoyable either. Click on the town, choose wether you wanna employ horses and or guns and done. You have 1 army. Armies can only move along roads...of course you canNOT built new ones. Tactics like comming outta the woods impossible. \nSo you send your army to fight, then watch numbers pop up above your army and the enemy until 1 army disappears. The only \"tactical option\" you have is attacking from 2 sides...assuming the enemy is on a crossroad and you can reach more then 1 road leading there.....\nPlaying the battles manually ain't any better. Every army is...1 army. All you can do is click your army and click where to go. Clicking on an enemy allows you to choose melle or ranged attack. Lastly you can use a skill (1 per officer in the army, 1 for horses, 1 for ranged), Those skills use a global resource that refills over time.\nChoosing formations, the direction to face, laying ambushes or any other kind of remotely tactical gameplay....is not existent. At least Romance of three Kingdoms 11 allowed you to build armies with spears,pikes,swords,bows or siege engines, each having strengths and weaknesses....\n\nThe \"historic gameplay\"...is probably among the worst i had to endure in ages. The idea is nice and all but\nYou start out as Oda, the historic quest tells you to invade the province to the south. After crushing the counter attack you decide to continue. 40 years (ingame) later you still haven't gotten any history quests...and the game doesn't tell you anything. You have to search the net for posts telling you to only take the first castle. Because in a decade an event will take that castle from you giving it to the original owner..who will become your ally in another decade...and needs to be wiped out in yet another decade.\nSo you spend years (hours of gameplay) doing NOTHING just to not break the future historic quests.....and you still don't get them thanks to the \"AI\". \nLike at some point an event allies you with Mino to the north...the next turn Mino marches a horde to attack the other Oda clan in your province. Problem is you are supposed to take that clan out in a historic quest a few years further. And you have absolutely no way of preventing them from getting murdered now. Your only choice is to hack/cheat/edit Mino, nerf-batting him to where he stops the attack. Then his neighbours start attacking him...and you need him for a historic quest as well...so you nerfbat his neighbours....then the neighbours neighbours....then.....\n1 hour later you have nerfbatted every single clan on the map to oblivion (except your own) just to ensure no future quest breaks....and you can do the same again in half a hour....\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498932068, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498932068, "recommendationid": "33094313", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488043", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498392480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 963, "steamid": "76561198007534331", "num_games_owned": 110}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "My first strategy game was Nobunaga's Ambition on the NES as a kid..
