It is one of the most original games I have seen, it is excellent value for money, it has been made with a huge amount of love and care, and it is extremely clever. \n\nThe trouble is it gets boring quickly. I am quite sure that I am exactly the right sort of person for this game. I like intricate puzzles, I like geometry and combinatorial maths and I am unusually patient. But I found I was doing most of the levels by trial error. The ones I hit upon quickly were unsatisfying and the ones that took a long time were frustrating. \n\nI still want to congratulate the developers. It really is a nice idea.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1483067899, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1483067899, "recommendationid": "28814417", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1490909458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 57, "steamid": "76561198033107016", "num_games_owned": 349}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1483058678, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1483058678, "recommendationid": "28810969", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477093", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507118956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 126, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 603, "steamid": "76561198084764020", "num_games_owned": 226}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Just two words: wonderful game.
