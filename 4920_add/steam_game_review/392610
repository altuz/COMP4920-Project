It's a great example of a few rules and conditions that multiply together to something really complex. I've been playing for 6 hours or so, unlocked 33% of the achievements, so still have a lot of playing to go. Pretty good value for \u00a36.99.\n\nI am getting to the levels where you can draw new membrane walls to make partitions and protect/isolate some of the pieces you're playing with, and each time you get a new type of 'piece' to play with it gives it more depth.\n\nThe game also introduces you to the mechanism of play very well - it doesn't teach you what to do, so much as put you in the right environments to learn what to do, before it throws the harder problems at you.\n\nI'm also playing on a touchscreen, which makes the whole thing quite tactile.\n\nSo if you're into thinking and problem solving, give it a try - if you get past four or five levels you'll be hooked into finishing it - while it gets more difficult as it goes on, it's always possible to solve.  :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459160763, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1459160763, "recommendationid": "22101892", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500135", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
