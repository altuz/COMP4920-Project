We could use some more Draft players so if you like Card Games jump on this! There are absolutly no micro-transactions and you get a steady feeling of progress. Even the campaign story is not bad at all. The automatic battles are not hampering the fun btw. You have enough to do without the tedious manual battles like in other Card Games. It is really not taking the fun away from this game!\n\nUpdate: I have soon ended the campaing and I think that this has a great replayability as you will get other cards on a new run. These cards also add up in your collection which lets you upgrade your cards to create even better decks for the league. I still think there are to few players in draft and that the league takes to long but I guess both will not change, now that the game did not impress a lot of people on steam.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445176488, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446124165, "recommendationid": "18549218", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511557", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452711288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1740, "steamid": "76561198006447433", "num_games_owned": 515}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An interesting collectable card game that reminds me of Ogre Battle in some ways.  You build a team of up to 5 cards and they automatically battle against the other team.  It's all about match ups, and there is no \"best combination\".  You're always tweaking your card set up depending on what you're up against.  When it comes to the multiplayer, there are no microtransactions, and it's not pay to win in anyway, although it's hard to do well in a league if you don't have a lot of cards.  You set up a team and it fights against other players.  You get cards by playing the campaign, and you can go through it multiple times.  I find that it's a game that is best enjoyed in small chunks, 5 - 10 minutes at a time.\n\nIf you go in not expecting too much, it really is a wonderful game and one month later, I find myself checking up on it just as much as I did when I purchased it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451826583, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451827181, "recommendationid": "20254478", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508148", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484498969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4181, "steamid": "76561198068461340", "num_games_owned": 35}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A wonderfully crafted card-based RPG, fans of old tabletop games like D&D, or Magic the Gathering will find much enjoyment in Lucadian Chronicles. Beginning the game as the green faction, you take the role of rebels attempting to defend their forest home against encoraching foes. As the chapters progress you'll eventually play as each of the different teams, white for air, red for fire, and blue for water. A black faction exists but they represent death and are the ultimate foe; they become so powerful that all of the other factions eventually put aside their differences to unite against them. \n\nThe storyline is good, if not a little bland but the game is definitely one that you'll complete multiple times for additional cards and coins: one of the most fun aspects is that with each new victory the game awards golden coins that may be used to 'purchase' booster packs of cards to add to your army. This allows you to have a truly customizable experience that will suit any play style. You may also play against online opponents in multiple ways, such as a four player match, or a competition of dozens of other live opponents from around the globe.\n\nA fun, competitive game with artwork this beautiful and music this enjoyable a rich experience is to be had in Lucadian Chronicles.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n+Complex and rewarding strategy game\n+Novel 'booster pack' mechanic is exciting\n+High replayability\n+Fantastic artwork and sound\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n+Story could have been a little longer\n+Option to play as the death faction needed", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1476473424, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1476473424, "recommendationid": "26034724", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504787", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506316803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 32460, "steamid": "76561198031699755", "num_games_owned": 65}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I'm 20 hours into the gameplay and enjoying it very much.  (The solo campaign demo, free, took about 5 or 6 hours and it was easier than the later stages.)  I normally play turn based strategy games like Civ 5, so this game has a much lighter and more casual feel, but it's still very intellectually engaging.   It's mostly a card game with a loose framework of a storyline and a fantasy campaign setting.  The gameplay where you will be spending 90-95% of your time is somewhere between tactical combat and puzzle solving.  I find myself saying things like \"Well, that didn't work, maybe I will try deploying my berserker opposite that elven archer, so he will lose some HP and start attacking more vigorously, because I need their ghouls to die before their skeletons so they don't keep getting hit point boosts...\"  and \"Dammit, the fire tribe engineer can't be placed next to the air-aligned ballista to repair it.\"   Also, \"I'm stuck on the campaign map, I just don't have enough 1-point cards to fill out a solid team after choosing my best vampire leader and the armor cracker and the druid.  Even after trying all the different spells I still can't bring down their healer fast enough.  So I guess it's time to go PVP to build up some more gold and buy more cards.\"   Some other reviewers have criticized the art; it's admittedly an odd mix of \"old masters\", anime, and classic dark fantasy art.
