It really feels like I'm going to have a great time.\n\nAnd then I start the game.\n\nAnd get hit from behind. Then from above. Then from below. Then from my right-side blind-spot. Then my left-side blind-spot. Sometimes there are a bunch of enemies in front of me which I'd love to shoot, but I quickly learn that if I take the time to line up the shots I'm going to be hit from all other directions. On a few rare occasions I can manage to get the enemies concentrated in a certain direction, and my flanks are safe, so it's time to open up a can of whoop-ass, but that's when the red moving screens appear and remind me that this game isn't about that.\n\nI beat the game on my first try on Easy, and I'm sure if I practice more I could beat the harder modes, but I'm just not having fun.\n\nBasically, the primary game-mechanic that the designers chose to focus the gameplay on is limited FOV combined with frequent teleports. It's far more important to just keep moving and grabbing power-ups than it is to do anything else. So if you enjoy a game where the challenge is to teleport, quickly glance around and take some shots, then quickly teleport again, then you'll probably enjoy this game.\n\nThe final boss battle is the only real time I thought, \"Yea, this is good.\" The rest of the time it was a random spinning spam-fest.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466885544, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1466885832, "recommendationid": "23803628", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515730", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462761295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561198152308100", "num_games_owned": 582}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The amount of fun i had in the 0.6 hours of playing this game is crazy!\n\nTeleport here shoot the baddies!\nTeleport there before the grid hits you!\nWatch out!

The player, presumably Jeeboman must fight off incoming hordes of enemies with an array of weapons.\n\nThe Good: This game is addictive. I've beaten it on easy but the other levels are challenging enough to make you want to play them again but not too challenging as to be a Rage Quit game. In addition, all of the weapons are ridiculously balanced.  You CAN use a single weapon throughout the game but I find it best to switch when necessary. The teleport mechanic is GREAT and simply works well. The pickup spawning system is really cool and adds survivability to the onslaught on oncoming enemies. The physics are great and some of the best / funniest on the market right now. One shot from a pistol can send enemies bouncing into oblivion at breakneck speeds.\n\nThe \u201cBad\u201d: I put bad in quotation marks because I don\u2019t really have any big problems with this game. However, a few details would make the game so much better. I would love to see more weapons to play around with and a bigger / more inclusive training area. In addition, the rocket tracking isn\u2019t always the best but is okay most of the time. The game modes or limited right now and would like to see another mode implemented soon. Finally, I would like it if the enemies didn't come from directly above you so I can still see them.\n\nSummary (TL;DR) Jeeboman is a fun little shooter that engages and keeps my attention well. For the price ($5 right now) it\u2019s one of the best value games on the market. Seriously, if it\u2019s still this cheap, pick up a copy and try for yourself.\n\nAll in All: Excellent 9/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466811370, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1466811638, "recommendationid": "23773165", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500114", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460412020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561197993106144", "num_games_owned": 157}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Great game!
