Clontrols sluggish and uncooperative. You can click 20 times on some items and they don't respond then a few seconds later something else responds you cliked minutes before. Would not click past first page of the tutorial.  Does not want to exit when you try to get out of any screen. It's $2.99 US. I've played better costing less. This game shows promise but until they fix the performance issues, I don't recommend it.  (64 bit system Way above minimum specs too )  The WORST $3 game on Steam.

At that it succeeds, never heard of the board game though. It was an impulse buy and with my little playing time i cant comment too much on it. But for what it tries to be, it does a decent job. Graphics are meh, User interface is meh aswell. But its enough for this type of game.\n\nAi seems challenging, but this game was made to be played against friends. Dont have them, so cant comment on that part of the game.\n\nThis game is ok to play while watching something. Its a calm game with no real time pressure.
