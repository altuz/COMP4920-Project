I love puzzle games but this one is more of an exercise of  trying to understand one persons vision of logic. I purchased this game with a handful of positive reviews dripping with love and excitement after playing for 20 minutes or so. The game is made up of a series of static environments which require you to \"assemble\" things to  advance to the next step. The controls are a bit clunky and there is no savegame feature aside from remembering a password which then takes you back to the beginning of that \"chapter\" making you repeat everything over again. Maybe this was done intentionally to make the game game appear longer than it it really is. I don't know.  Hey it is only 4 bucks but I don't see the same enthusiasim as the other buyers do.  Seems like it needs to be cleaned up a bit, but hey this is only my opinion.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443748245, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443748245, "recommendationid": "18283861", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506783", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1461353056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1153, "steamid": "76561198216959411", "num_games_owned": 12}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So I bought this game like over 6 months ago but I figured it's worth writing a review because I'm kinda dissapointed (I know the game is only $4 so my standards should be low as hell). I got this game in november, and I quickly got stuck at the digger-tower puzzle... tbh I just went to the community page looking for some help. So fast foward to February and quite a few other players had the same issue and the creator has put his input in on discussion, and told us he'd try to fix things soon. so now we're here, in May.. nothing fixed, and honestly I'm not surprised but if I pay for something and have an issue with it (and other people do too) I'd think something would occur to resolve it. Again it's not a big deal, it's jsut disappointing because this game really looks amazing and it has potential.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463029797, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463029797, "recommendationid": "22921960", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443557318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 105, "steamid": "76561197984890540", "num_games_owned": 48}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A bit tricky at times but nothing beats the feel of completing the hard ones and then get to laugh about the result.
