On closer inspection if fails every criteria.\n\nXbox360 pad was vibrating but inputs not detecting. The ball would sometimes clip through the paddle. The paddle would accelerate drastically after very slow motion for the initial second as if it was some exponential curve. The circular arena means that if your paddle is up your inputs can feel as if they are reversed if you are just twitch reacting because your paddle is upside down. The visual presentation tries to be clean and crisp and minimalistic. But it comes across as barebones, grating with way too much bright white and flat vibrant colors with no texturing for breakable tiles. The audio did not thrill me much either. Game loads slow and the new age quotes were pointless and not appropriate for an arcade title.
