[b]Boring Gameplay[/b]\nThe gameplay mostly consisted of driving a difficult to control truck around fairly empty highway. I never got a chance to try the other two gamemodes as I wasn't able to force myself to play that far.\n\n2. [b]Poor Options[/b]\nThere are a total of 5 different resolutions for this game, ranging from 640x480 to 1366x768. There is no 1080p or options for other aspect ratios. Other settings include a blanket texture quality option (Low Medium High) and shadow quality. Oh, and one last thing; [u]the only time you can change [b]any[/b] options is before the game has started[/u]. There are no in-game options at all.\n\n3. [b]Poor Controls[/b]\nIt might be better with a controller, but with a keyboard it seemed like the second I hit the arrow keys (Yes, there is no support for WASD) my truck would jerk in that direction. This coupled with the poor performance made it quite difficult to actually complete any levels", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439550634, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439550634, "recommendationid": "17533428", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560265", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1439552488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198038651167", "num_games_owned": 172}, "votes_funny": 15, "votes_up": 34, "comment_count": "6", "review": "game is boring, has no real simulation, more like scalextric for trucks.\n\nRefunded requested and issued!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439552644, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1439753320, "recommendationid": "17533801", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507804", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443820908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 545, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561198036196702", "num_games_owned": 2963}, "votes_funny": 18, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": "4", "review": "Please tell me this is a ported game from PS1...?", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443821021, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443821021, "recommendationid": "18297100", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508529", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502833316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 23, "steamid": "76561198113094231", "num_games_owned": 45}, "votes_funny": 9, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "review": "betwean  1 to 10\ngraghics 10\ncontrol vecicle 4\neasiest setting 2\nmenu 7\nscare in all 8\n\nThe stearing was dificult  there were no instructions how to play\nno", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440706701, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440706701, "recommendationid": "17743593", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489020", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
