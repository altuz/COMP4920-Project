Get Sid Meier's Pirate for a better sim. Get Zubmariner for better top down ship combat with quests\n\nReview: A Sirius game is extremely slow paced, you can fire your cannons at machine gun speeds, the world is oversaturated in bright lights that give this a fake cheap look. The world feels extremely uninteractive, only the occasional power up or hotspot shows up. Coupled with the slow movement this hurts interactivity quite a bit. Tutorial was slow and clunky. User interface was cluttered and unattractive and did not offer a good flow for your actions. Camera and ship controls did not feel fluid and well thought out. The writing for the story part was decent but faltered in a few places, especially in character depth where everyone is uni-dimensional with silly motivations. Which leads me to say that the protag is not terribly interesting. I am removing this title for library declutter.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500315558, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500315613, "recommendationid": "33613371", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 7}}
