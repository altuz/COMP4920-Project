While this game has some potential, there is a lot of room for improvement.\n\nPros: Story line is pretty decent. \n\nCons: Each time you explore an area, you use energy, and a large amount of it. You either have to wait several hours for it to replenish or spend money to buy more. The amount of time you are given to explore an area is only 1 minute. This is not enough time to find hidden objects, especially if the graphics aren't that great. If you are zoomed out of a picture, they graphics are nice, but when you zoom in to locate a hard to find object, the graphics become pixelated and somewhat distorted. Also, when you find a chest, you only have a very limited amount of time to solve a puzzle to open it. \n\nOverall: Game play time is limited and you almost feel rushed to complete puzzles and hidden object areas.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487533519, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487533519, "recommendationid": "30043040", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519740", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489624430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 263, "steamid": "76561198037782998", "num_games_owned": 36}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun game very interactive!

Some people may frown at the energy bar (to explore a location, the player spends \"energy\", which is refilled either by waiting or with buying it with $), but for me it works just alright. In a lunchbreak you turn on the Lost lands and click through 4-5 locations (up to 15 min), then you go on with your life. Same thing could happen in the evening- 15 more minutes of elf saving. This way the player doesn't get bored, even though the very nature of this genre is repetitive.\nThe game itself is quite high class. As you can see on the screenshots, the colors, the contrast and the object placing are very good. This means fun and not mindless pixel- hunting.\np.s.: there are also quite a few puzzles, too (9th and 12th screenshot, e.g.).
