The core gameplay remains the same, including the singleplayer, which is in fact better in every way, with better graphics, sound and what not. The thing that you actually will buy this game for though, the multiplayer, has already gone to  shit.. Hackers are rampant and players are few. There are also new camos and what not, and these would not have been so bad, but they're constantly present and being pushed on people who don't care about them, which is everybody who just wants to re-experience COD4. The multiplayer was  shit  from day one, because of the lack of legit players, because so few bought the game, due to the release bundle cost.\n\nEven then, Activision said they wouldn't release this game as a stand-alone, so I bought this along with Infinite Warfare, which I have not played at all, for 80 bucks, which was not worth it at all. Even now that you can buy it as a stand-alone for a much lower price, I would not recommend this game, unless you're purely into the singleplayer, or are lucky with avoiding hackers and connection issues in multiplayer, which I haven't been.\n\nHad the game been release as a stand-alone instead of being bundled with Infinite Warfare, which so many people now have bought unwillingly, and the multiplayer had been more faithful to the original, I would have recommended this game, but as it stands, this game is tarnished, and will probably never recover. Maybe buy it if it's on sale with a decent discount, just to relive the singleplayer and have a go at the multiplayer, but otherwise, don't bother.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504659411, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504659469, "recommendationid": "34767299", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555325", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1496528865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 121, "steamid": "76561198085166820", "num_games_owned": 70}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 27, "comment_count": "2", "review": "The original did a better job.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504703070, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504703070, "recommendationid": "34775151", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523638", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504575008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 110, "steamid": "76561198059885766", "num_games_owned": 171}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you are willing to look past the disgusting supply drop weapons, don't buy this on pc.
