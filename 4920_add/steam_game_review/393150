The previous installment was \"The Dreamatorium of Dr. Magnus.\n\n*HOPA - Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure.\n\n[h1][u]Game Visuals[/u][/h1]\n\nI want to mentioned that the visuals for this game is nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.\n\n[h1][u]Game Audio[/u][/h1]\n\nI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even if it's simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.\n\n[h1][u]Game Voice Overs[/u][/h1]\n\nNormally, I don't have any comments to say about voice overs in games. Since that they're generally decent. But it's a different story with this game. The voice overs in this game isn't so great. The voice actors/actress aren't interested in what they're suppose to be doing.\n\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\n\nThere are only four difficulty game modes to choose from: Regular, Advanced, Expert and Custom.\n\nDiary Notebook it has two sections. Game Objectives and Notes.\n\nThere is an option for locking the inventory in place to keep it stationary.\n\nThere are interactive items in the game. These items are marked with a symbol but sometime they require extra items before they can be interact with.\n\nThe interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates there are tasks that needs to be done at certain locations. It isn't given automatically at the start of the game.\n\nMagical Amulet it reveals certain events that had taken place before. It's like a memory residual.\n\nMulti Tool device that three different tools that can be for certain tasks. Tools: Knife, Screw Driver and Scissor.\n\nMost of the game's hidden object scenes consists of placing items back, fragments, shadow items with some or no interaction.\n\nMost of the game's puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nThere are collectible in the game. It is \"Eye of Horus\" they're scattered throughout the entire game to find. Twenty-two in total.\n\nThere are fifteen different achievements. But each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.\n\n[h1][u]Miscellaneous[/u][/h1]\n\nThere extra contents (concept art and wallpapers) for the game in the extra section.\n\nThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend. The replay value for this game is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/393150", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457969030, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500847355, "recommendationid": "21835815", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535558", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448717551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 213, "steamid": "76561198008683738", "num_games_owned": 447}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": "3", "review": "As Hidden Object games go, this one probably isn't worth the time.\n\nFor those not familiar with the genre, HO games tend to have a semi-decent story, and generally involve finding objects to unlock further progress into the story - either by applying items directly to what you see in the on-screen scene, or by combining with other objects to make it work properly, or create something.\n\nThis game, while it has some beautiful scenes and art, doesn't deliver quite as much as you might hope for from a Hidden Object game.\n\nFor starters, there aren't that many scenes that require some thorough searching. Part of the fun of a good HO game is having lots of big messy scenes for you to hunt for a list of random objects from. The few that do exist in the game are spread pretty thin.\n\nThe point-and-click aspect is on the tame side as well. For example, there's a statue that needs reassembling at the front of a tall building. The arms were lying on the ground outside, and were among the first items picked up in this segment of the game. Later you find the last piece, a hat of sorts, is inside the building. Upon putting the hat on the statue, the hand reveals a key... a key that could have been acquired without assembling the statue? Yeah, I don't get it either.\n\nI found the main character's voice acting to be sub-par too. It distracted me from the game, mostly in the form of my giggling and stifling laughter. She sounded like a total stoner, all slurred and dragging out her words... yet she was meant to be a private detective. Maybe she's both. It's plausible. Maybe.\n\nSo while you [i]could[/i] get this game, I'd advise against it, until it's heavily discounted. Compared to others in the genre there just isn't enough content. What content there is I found too similar to elements from other HO games.

Since the game includes trading cards, you may end up going and playing more to get all of your cards if you're one that collects (which I will be doing).\n\nOverall, not terrible and worth a play, but due to the short playtime I would suggest picking it up on sale.
