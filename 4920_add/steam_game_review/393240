I think the art is well done, and the music is great! Sometimes I get a little frustrated, because I didn't see some obsticle coming, but I wouldn't call the death cheap. Honestly, I think the only thing the game needs is a check point system! (Because I've died a few times way too close to the end of the levels and I'm very salty about that.)
