For anyone who enjoyed the PC release of Motorhead, this is not it. This is the PSX version. The screenshot previews of the game do not even do the shoddy graphics justice. It gave me a headache to even try to play this in fullscreen, and windowed mode is not much better. This game is also impossible to play with a keyboard, which is what I used to play the game back when it was originally released, and the controls cannot be modified. So please do your best to enjoy utilizing both WSAD and the NUM PAD not only to drive your vehicle, but to decrypt the main menu navigation, as the mouse does absolutely nothing.\n\nPlease do not waste your money on this game. There were no reviews for it when I purchased it, so I had no forewarning of how bad of a port it would be. You're better off finding the PC port elsewhere.
