If you don't like games without goals, this is not the one for you. Shu's Garden is one of those peaceful games with an enjoyable and colorful world. It's a game you can play to relax, relieve stress, and just forget about your day to day life. A game doesn't need an end and I think people forget that. In this game one must travel and encounter unique events on their own randomly. There is no goal, it's just a nice free roam. The game features gravity, allowing the player to jump to new planets. The music is enjoyable and doesn't annoy after a while.

It is really rather strange. The art is kinda cool and the music is sorta neat. But there are no instructions, guide lines or goals at all. I know thats really part of the point of the game, but there really isn't much to do in the game and it doesn't capture my attention at all. It's almost like they tried to do what Proteus did and make a kind of anti-game where there are no goals, no objectives, no story, no instructions, and nothing to do but look and listen. Proteus got away with this because there was a sence of wonder and mystery. It made you want to go explore and see the world. In this I couldn't find that element of wonder so I lost intrest very quickly.
