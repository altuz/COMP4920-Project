No remembering dozens of specific keybinds, no weird menu you use your scroll wheel for, no installing a bunch of mods or searching through countless servers to get an experience you enjoy. Simply open Squad, join a server, and instantly you are thrust into an intense open-world conflict in which you along with 8 squadmates can set your own objective in accordance with your team's strategy and attempt to win the game by any means necessary. \n\nBeing a squad member is fun, but the true fun of the game, at least for me, is being at the head of the action, and directing the rest of your body (your squadmates) on how to proceed. Being a squad leader in Squad is truly an incredible experience that no other game can truly match, not even ARMA. You've got eight people under you that will (usually) listen to your commands, and you've got four or five other squad leaders to communicate with so you can develop the best strategy.  There is no greater joy than leading your squad to victory, going into the next round, and having people wait for you to create a squad because you did so well. Squad Leaders can also set down Rally Points for their squadmates to have a temporary spawn point, set down FOBs to hold vital chokepoints or provide a permanent spawn, as well as other fortifications around FOBs. Squad Leaders truly control the flow of the game, and a good or bad Squad Leader can mean the difference between a victory or defeat in Squad.\n\nBut do not fret if leading is not your strong suit or your thing; every role in Squad has it's purpose. Obviously there is the important \"Squad Leader\" role, but the roles of Medic, Autorifleman (Machinegunner), Marksman, Anti-Tank, even Rifleman are all important and have their roles. Medics keep the war machine going, Autoriflemen provide a base of fire to cover their fellow squadmates, Marksman take out enemies from afar in accordance to the squad's objective, Anti-Tank take out those pesky and vital armored vehicles, Rifleman can set up barricades as well as act as the all-important point-men and primary attackers, all with the SL leading from the back (or on the frontlines.)\n\nIf a Squad is malfunctioning, deformed, or simply unable to work with each other, the game is simply not fun. The Squad Leader is vital to keep the squad pushing forward, but the Squad Leader cannot put down much of anything without squad members at his side. Communication and teamwork is VITAL in Squad, and without it the experience will not be enjoyable. However, whenever a Squad gets it right - they are communicating, helping each other, working together, listening to each other - the game is like none other. Luckliy, the game makes it easy to make sure Squads do have cohesion.\n\nThe only issue I have with this game is it's fierce optimization problem. Even at low settings I struggle to keep 60 frames on most maps, and I don't have a bad rig. That, along with some map glitches that involve going through the map and having to suicide to keep playing.\n\nAll in all, I have never played a multiplayer game more rewarding than Squad, and I'm excited to make this game my next primary experience and design a community around it. I would truly give this game a 10/10 if the game was optimized, bugs were fixed, and other quality of life issues were resolved. For now, I give the game a 7, but the devs are working hard on the game and I think it'll hit a solid 10/10 (meaning the game delivers 100% on its promise and is fun to play, easy-ish to run, and chock full of features) when the game is fully released.\n\nIf you are looking for a realistic first-person-shooter where communication and teamwork is required for success, look no further.

We were in this hamlet, defending against the Americans as the BTR that was our lifeline was blown to bits by an incoming mortar round. The squad leader shouts something about incoming as I prepare for a fight. I go downstairs, and Mortar rounds begin to fall all around us, sending schrapnel into any crevis it can find. Our medic was killed in the first volley of fire. I look and I see Cheese, as he says \"Hold me\". \n\nMortar rounds continue to explode all around us, my monitor shakes and my headphones are busted by the sheer power of the PTSD simulator that is being stuck in a mortar barrage with only 3 of your comrades in SQUAD. I hear rapid gunfire as I turn around and see my squad leader fall to the ground. The shelling stops. In a split second my MLG instinct took over, as the American soldier walked through the door I let a long burst rain upon him in fury. He sloops over, dead. \n\nI turn around not realizing what is going on as I hear a 50. BMG going off, and panic ensues. We are surrounded. I fire at another soldier who takes cover. I pull out my RPG.... Step out the doorway in which Cheese lies dead, aim it in an instant. And fire at the Humvee's gunner. Fire and smoke fills the air as a immense feeling of satisfaction overwhelms me. I did it. In that moment, I see a Machine gunner turn around, firing his weapon. I am filled with bullets.

It's a response to the incredible need for a game that helps capture the brutality of war in a way that helps give an appreciation for what fighting in a war really means.\n\nGranted, its very much a game, with health bars, revive mechanics. It is by no means a 'Realistic' depiction of war, but is instead an immersive depiction of it, allowing oneself to fully flow into the role of the unkown soldier, fighting alongside one's brothers.\n\nYou will run around in a gunfire with no idea where you're being shot from, while failing to understand what your squad leader is screaming over the sounds of mortar fire, while defending your last position from a full on assault. Hiding behind the mountain of sandbag barriers that you and your fellow squad teammates built, the laughs and cheery banter that you and your squadmates shared will fade into the distance, as the last remaining sandbags finally dissipate, and you are finally laid to rest. Only a moment later, the fighting fades and a list of players appears on your screen, where you discover that you held off the invasion just long enough to achieve victory. \n\nThis was one of my personal experiences, that having played a large number of first person shooters (mostly on console) I can absolutely say is completely unique to this game. It's not just about the mechanics and the graphics, its about the feel of the game, and every time I play this game I feel as if I'm bring thrown into another possible life that I could have lived, if only things went differently up until this point. \n\nI seriously applaud the game developers for creating an innovate, incredible game that helps to capture such a serious subject in a beautiful way, instead of trivializing and exploiting it as almost all other first person shooters do.\n\nBuy.
