I AM WRITING THIS TO NOTE MY OPINIONS ON BOTH GAMES AND ON MY OPINIONS OF HOW THEY ARE MOSTLY DIFFERENT***\n\nI play Rust and Hurtworld. If you invest time into both games, you will know they are different; although the concept and start both games are similar. I think you should try the game again once the next major update or alpha build comes out, and try it again. I think you will realise that hurtworld is more farfetched than Rust in some areas. Hurtworld is also for the more invested player than rust; it takes more time to make a base, get geared and in my opinion, maintain a base or compound. So if fast-paced gameplay and quick starts are your thing and your pc will handle it, Rust is nice. Rust also has very PvP orientated gameplay, while Hurtworld is more PvE. Skill in PvP will play a decent role in which game you like more. Rust also benefits clan/group play, as you will have advantages in both fights and raids, with more manpower. More people also means you will likely have people online protecting your base for longer periods of time, as one person may leave and another join, or vice versa. Base expansion and farming also benefits from this, and while clan/group play is also an advantage in Hurtworld, it seems to be less 'satisfying' in my opinion.\n\nSummary:\nRust is more fast-paced\nHurtworld requires more grinding.\nHurtworld is less taxing on your system\nHurtworld is still being updated, a beta build is available.\nRust is also being updated, but it is more finished than Hurtworld\nI dont think the gameplay after the start is very similar.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504862632, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506495882, "recommendationid": "34810731", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501375", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1473821703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 384, "steamid": "76561198040404353", "num_games_owned": 170}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Hurtworld more like hurt my wallet and make me throw myself into a bin", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506404179, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506404179, "recommendationid": "35216295", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501691", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506974391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8450, "steamid": "76561198152744249", "num_games_owned": 44}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "7", "review": "Man....Hurtworld such a good game so much promise ive had a good time but...i cant recommend it..heres why\n\nPROS\nPretty good community ive met so many awesome people!\nGood artstyle maybe not as good as Rust but still good\nFun for hours and hours and hours\nA decent bit of content\n\nCONS\nNot as much stuff to do in this then there is in Rust\nIts buggy as heck\nThe next update completely changes the game for the worse\nThe map is huge but you never know where you are\nThe developers havent released an update in 2 years that isnt bug fixes\nThere are like no players in non asian servers\n\nCONCLUSION\nGood game. cant recommend it\nRust would be a better deal $5 less and more content more players and probably a better experience.\n\nAnd no this is not a review saying that im a Rust fanboy. they are both good games they both have their ups and downs.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506645944, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506645944, "recommendationid": "35277824", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503108", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503679787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 198, "steamid": "76561198021801967", "num_games_owned": 80}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nope.
