When playing in co-op, you won't have time to dodge the projectiles most of the time, especially as the camera goes crazy when players are too far from each other.\n\nI wish Steam would let me have a neutral rating, though, as this game isn't for me, but I do recommend you try it out if you feel drawn to it. There's always the refund option.\nThanks!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500141172, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500145218, "recommendationid": "33565035", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508378", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504272119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561198075234627", "num_games_owned": 376}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The phrase \"A.S.S\" is mentioned in the game.
