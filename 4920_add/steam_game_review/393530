I mean a clicker game is pretty obvious. You click constantly to get \"points\" to level up. \nBut there are elements in this game that have NO instructions on how to use... or when they become available... or what they do...  or why they are even there. As a matter of fact there are [b]NO INSTRUCTIONS AT ALL!!!!![/b]\nOne tab \"ILLNESSES\" is (so far) permanently greyed out. NOT ONE PERSON in chat can even tell me anything about it.\nOh and GOOD LUCK finding ANYONE speaking english in chat anyway... seems to be ALL Russian!!!\nThere is an EQUIPMENT tab where you manage and craft clothes from parts you can get in the game for your character... great... so... HOW DO YOU GET THEM? From where? When???\nAlso there is a PVP element... fantastic... HOW ABOUT SOME INSTRUCTIONS instead of dumping you into a pvp with no idea what to do and getting annihilated because of a TOTAL lack of understanding of the objective!!!\n\"SINS AFTER AMNESIA\"... wtf??? I got ONE point in that... it appeared after i got slaughtered in my first pvp attempt. NO extra points after my second pvp attempt tho... so.... wtf is that all about???\n\nPLENTY OF PAY-TO-WIN opportunity... as expected in ANY \"free\" game. (even tho there is NO indication wtf the crystals are for or where you use them!!)\n\nOverall, a great concept but the developers have obviously ONLY considered the possibility of lining their pockets and havent given a flying F**k about instructions, a guide or even ANY explanation for anything in this game.\nThe only thing this game is good for IS wasting time. Set up a macro and let it do the clicking for you faster than you can. Level up your \"Minions\" when you can, but let the macro do the work. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS GAME OR THE DLC!!! \nApart from that... \n\n[u]DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS!!!!  and DEFINITLY NOT ANY MONEY!!!![/u]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487683139, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487683889, "recommendationid": "30078576", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505734", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504814964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 6530, "steamid": "76561198010163346", "num_games_owned": 1757}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Meh clicker, stupid pvp and very buggy, I usually have to reopen the game several time to have the window appearing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486923937, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486923937, "recommendationid": "29879523", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497127", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505512617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 8553, "steamid": "76561198161070934", "num_games_owned": 37}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Similar to Hero Clickers; I enjoy this as a casual, time passing, inactive game to play more than I would an active and consistently played game.
