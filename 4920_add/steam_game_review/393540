Remember that this is PS port of typical 90th racing  arcade game. Poor controls and plenty physics issues render this game unplayable by today means. You can skid and slide on walls and get stuck at very strange places, loose your speed immediately as you are out of the track. You can loose speed unpredictably with small hit at some obstacle, colliding with oponents is more or less predictable but the model in general is poor. The truck reverts slow while your opponents do it fast. Brakes seem to be useless as the truck keeps moving straight forward while you are braking despite you are steering. Pro tracks have couple of 90-degrees-sharp turns added and are mostly made 'pro' by virtually turning the light off and intorudicing weather effect (by the way lighting strikes are not bad at all). Yes, you have just heavy fog or pitch black night. Rember that this bird is of 90th? So your headlights will not make the environment lighter with any kind of smooth light distribution gradually fading, but you will have just a very limited line of sight. Opponents drive unpredictable, sometimes making stupid mistakes, sometimes the leading rival is just unstoppable. And the worst thing is that this game runs only when you are looged in at Steam! It never saves my chosen controls type. By the way the story is the same with other games from Console Classics. To make a long story short: there are not much reasons to buy it. I've bought it just because I want to play PS games as I've never owned one. I want pure old arcade experience and I clearly understand that there is nothing special to be expected by modern means. So for me it is OK. But before you buy it, think twice if it would be OK for you too.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1458585721, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1458585841, "recommendationid": "21968440", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499289", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452447474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561198197542579", "num_games_owned": 27}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this game SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457148725, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457148725, "recommendationid": "21632925", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475989", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
