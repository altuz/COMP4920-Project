The game does tell a complete story despite its brevity, and I enjoyed it, but it's very straightforward. The game sports 4 different environments and a small multi-stage puzzle in each. Puzzles are pretty easy, as there are very clear cues for each solution, so it's unlikely for players to get stuck.\n\nSoft, slow music creates a relaxing, thoughtful atmosphere. The game's graphics are highly stylized and remind me of the very early 3d era, when even the ground was made of distinct mono-colored polygons. I don't really like this particular style (I think it accentuates the imperfections of early 3d implementations in an unfavorable way), but it did not bother me much in this game, the graphics are serviceable.\n\nI played through the full game in an hour, so it's definitely a very short experience, but the price is completely adequate for that. If you're looking for a calm, relaxing, easy first-person adventure game that doesn't require a $1000 PC to run, give it a shot.\n\nEdit: Seeing that other reviewers reported some bugs and glitches, I should perhaps mention that I did not encounter a single one. I'm not sure if the issues were fixed in the meantime, or if I just got lucky, all I can say is that the experience was completely bug- and glitch-free for me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498970563, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498972166, "recommendationid": "33114672", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501841", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "total_reviews": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
