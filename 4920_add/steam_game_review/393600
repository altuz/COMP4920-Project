I like that the plot doesn't take itself seriously but still has character and momentum. Here's what it does well:\n[list]\n[*] aliens have unique styles and tactics. My favorites are the humanoid that splits in half as it's damaged and the spinning koosh ball death hamster things. The bosses are huge and menacing, kind of like Contra villains.\n[*] maps that build the alien station into fun and distinct regions (a la Castlevania/Metroid).\n[*] excellent art for a one-man shop. It's a combination of digitized hand-drawn and pixelated art. Some sprites are more polished than others, but the overall tone and feel is solid.\n[*] weapons with different use cases: regular and upgraded laser, regular and upgraded sword, and, by far my favorite, the grenade launcher. I think there are others that I haven't found yet.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Overall: Fun game and solid design. At first, I found it on the difficult side, but once I got into it, got sucked in. There's a lot to explore and find in here. Worth it for the price.[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442798903, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443013103, "recommendationid": "18126429", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527378", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443107124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 246, "steamid": "76561198004409850", "num_games_owned": 458}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a great metroidvania game.  It took a little over 3 hours to complete with everything explored.  Hidden coins scattered around were fun to collect.  Bosses were enjoyable to beat.  The map is a good size and easy to use.  A few teleporters are scattered around to prevent excessive backtracking.  Graphics and enemy AI are fairly simple, but that's really all you need for this type of game.  My only complaint is that I wish the map also showed various upgrades.
