If you don't think boss fights are fun (like me), you don't want to play the ending of this game. But there are many aspects in the game I like - for example, it's up to you how you tackle the levels: you can be sneaky, but you can also go on a rampage. A combination is wise, too. Each level is short enough to let you actually enjoy the lack of save/load - it gets intense this way, and challenging. ROOT focuses on this experience, and that's what makes it mostly cool experience.\n\nBut there are also many things I'd like to see changed - the boss fights are the best example. But also the fact that the levels all look quite the same. You can change the wall colors, which is a nice touch, but I wonder why the developers didn't adjust the colors for each level, to make them more distinct. (I also wonder about their choice of standard color. It's a bit ugly.) The controls felt awkward, at least at the beginning, and some keys seem to be superfluous. Enemies see you miles away, which makes sense, because you can shoot them at once, but especially with the small spiders it's awful to shoot them while they're only a pixel high.\n\nI'm also quite sad that there is a lot of wasted potential; ROOT has a lot of objects in the levels, but interaction with them is either meaningless \"flush the toilet\" or \"take and throw it\". There could have been more, like traps and bridges, etc. And then there are some scripted events, e.g. a creature climbs up a wall and escapes, and later is never mentioned again.

The biggest thing to remember is that ROOT is neither run 'n gun, or stealth. Rather it is a mixture of both, and you cannot succeed by doing just one or the other. The key in ROOT is to strategize your moves. Think, then act. Don't act, then think. That, and commit to your actions. If you make the choice to enter and clear a room, commit to that choice and don't half-ass it. Those are my tips for you.\n\nROOT is definitely a unique game. For one thing, the game takes place inside of a computer system as you, \"Edward Summerton\" (creative name, developers), attempt to hack your way in. Data and security software is manifested as objects and enemies.\n\nThere are three weapons in ROOT. A nightstick, which can be used to silently subdue enemies from behind. A pistol, which is accurate at all ranges but does low damage. And a shotgun, which is (obviously) best at close range but does high damage. Weapon handling is different from most shooters in that there is no recoil, reticle spread, or ironsights, and your shots are placed exactly where you put the cursor. This makes your ability to aim of absolute importance, as you can't simply panic-fire and count on spread to make some of your shots  hit the target.\n\nThis is a game that forces the player to tread softly if they want to survive. Nearly all of the enemies you will face are stronger than you and you must be on the alert, constantly scanning for threats. It is, however, not difficult to hide from these enemies if you memorize their patterns and know what to do. Most of the AIs are exceedingly stupid, and can be thwarted so long as you remain calm and take things slow.\n\nOverall, ROOT is a very fun game that I reccomend to anyone looking for a change of pace in an FPS game. Although bare in mind that it is a frustrating game; you will likely die... a lot. The end boss is especially difficult, but he can be beaten if you persevere. I definitely encourage you to give this one a try, especially if you are bored with the run-of-the-mill shooters, and want something different.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455757790, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1483406657, "recommendationid": "21286550", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468980267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 200, "steamid": "76561198012712253", "num_games_owned": 1737}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Neon stealth game, very stylized and fun.

No wonder you get so many \"12/10, my mum cried, would shag my dog again!!1\" crap reviews.\n\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n\nThat's what it's all about here, not the background-story, not the simplistic graphics, not the nice music. You're in some espionage situation and have to get deeper into the building, level by level. For this, reach the exit-elevator that is clearly identified by an ambient sound with a conveniently big radius. On the first floors, this is only a matter of getting there despite the guards, but later you need to find one or more generic credentials objects that allow you to proceed.\n\nYou can play the game stealthily or can go all out, but the latter is not recommended against guards since their bullets travel instantly. Bots, however, have slower shots, so you can make use of the evade-feature which causes an agile side-step, very useful. A shootout with guards is feasible, too, if you make use of cover and are lucky enough not to attract too many at once ...\n\nIf you die, you start over at the elevator. Since some levels are longer, this is a source of frustration, so one or two autosave-spots would have been nice.\n\nThe gameplay is minimalistic but somewhat fun and is carried by the wish to get deeper into the building, which I believe might lower the replay-value.\n\n\n\n[h1]WORLD DESIGN[/h1]\n\nThe levels are full of decorative objects, but they are all dead, there's no interaction. You can pick them up and throw them, and there's appropriate physics, but the lack of interactivity and everything in the same color makes it feel a bit \"empty\".\n\nFire extinguishers are red! But do they behave differently? Nope. They are just tossables, like everything else. No matter how many bullets you fire at them, they won't explode.\n\nThere are decorative vending machines that even spawn tossable cans, but the cans could as well be rocks. Toilets can be flushed. Wash basins can be \"used\". Paper towel dispensers also show some interaction. You can pick out toilet paper rolls from the stalls, which turns them into physical objects (e.g. you can shoot at them, making them fly around).\n\nYou can find radios from time to time (whose sound attenuation is ridiculously extreme). I was holding a radio when entering the lift to the next level, but when the loading was complete, my hands were empty. But you keep your weapons / ammo, same when you die.\n\nAnd OMG there are some traps in the levels ... xD You'll know.\n\n\n\n[h1]AVATAR SIMULATION[/h1]\n\nYou can walk and run, which is a toggle or only temporary, this can be defined in the options. Same for crouching. Running isn't really fast, it's relaxed jogging. Sadly, there's no sprint feature, so while traversing longer stretches, I felt a bit imprisoned.\n\nWalking diagonally makes you faster, which is a typical beginner mistake. Then again, Eidos Montreal made it, too, in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.\n\nYou can also jump and crouch. I wish there was also mantling, because there are a few situation where, if you had proper arms :P, you should be able to get to that place (e.g. in the vents).\n\nYou can peek to the left and right. This seems to be unconditionally safe.\n\nYou can't holster your weapon, not that it really matters.\n\nYour current weapon sways when you walk/run, but there's no option to make the camera sway. I miss that nowadays, seems to be a trend not to include it, probably because people are too inept to tune their setups optimally (\"Waaah, I couldn't play this game, it made me dizzy!\"), e.g. FOV still seems to be a book with seven seals even though it's all quite [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=763936460]simple[/url] really. Always with the lowest common denominator. :( Can a guy be accused of becoming somewhat elitist under these circumstances?\n\nYou start with 100 health, which decreases as you are attacked, and you die when it reaches 0. No health recharge, and no pickups that heal you. - Score one for realism.\n\n\n\n[h1]INPUT CONFIGURATION[/h1]\n\nThe use-key picks up objects, and then you can throw them (Left mouse button.) or drop them again (Right mouse button.), and it's really annoying that you can't use the use-key, too, to drop them.\n\nThe input keys can be changed (and by now, indeed the right shift key can be assigned, too, so I changed from a WASD-centric config to arrow keys; the keypad enter does not seem to be different from the main enter, but that's not fatal), but texts on screen are hard-coded, they do not reflect the current key configuration.\n\nWhen assigning the left mouse button (which you probably don't want to, because it's fine as the fire control), upon release of the button, the assign function will be called again immediately, so you have to move the mouse to the side of the controls before releasing the button.\n\nThe volume sliders are of course broken like in 99% of all other games. They'd need to raise the slider's value (assuming it's a float from 0 to 1) to the power of Euler's number (~2.7) before applying it to the sound, or the \"infinite\" power of zero will make it like it currently is, namely that the top 30% of the sliders do almost nothing, and the closer to 0 you get, the more powerful the sliders' effect. (The non-linearity of human hearing that people keep bringing up here is not relevant. That's people for ya. They don't know what they're talking about and feel free to repeat what they heard somewhere.)\n\n\n\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\n\nThe sound fx are functional and slightly avant-garde styled (e.g. the jump sound with its fast echo). Sadly, tossed objects don't make any impact sound. That would even feel wrong if tossing an object would [i]not[/i] lure guards to the point of impact.\n\nThe music is quite good really, albeit its style might be a wee bit too foreground-ish, but it's within limits. I think there are several music tracks, but they only play rarely. There's no \"They're on to you!\" music like in many other games, and I wouldn't call that a mistake. I wish those other games had an option to turn off this context-sensitivitiy, because it gives away information you otherwise wouldn't have. Hey, I recommend that when you re-play your favorite games, turn off their music for once and listen to something else, e.g. [url=https://somafm.com/dronezone/]SomaFM's Drone Zone[/url], which kinda goes with everything.\n\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\n\nWell, you're in a virtual world, so the bland schematics-like graphics make sense (but not the objects :P). Ultimately, it's about gameplay, so while the graphics are a bit [i]too[/i] abstract to me, they don't really stand in the way of the game being enjoyable.\n\nExcept the vents are extremely same-y, it all looks the same, the only orientation help are the paths they take, the occasional (rare) fan, and some environmental sounds (e.g. vicinity of exit-elevator). I hope they spice those up slightly later on.\n\nThe graphics options do what they should, e.g. the antialiasing works just as expected. Sadly, the bloom option is too strong, I hope they add some kind of slider or at least a weaker version. I ended up playing without it.\n\nThe FOV slider is THE FINGER (You know, the middle one.) to the whole industry! Know why? Because it goes straight up from 1\u00b0 to 179\u00b0! Yes, you heard that right. Plus it seems to be vertical FOV, in which case a wider screen would automatically give you a wider view, not that it would be important with this mother of all FOV sliders.\n\nThe engine or the maps could be optimized a bit better: It's all smooth most of the time, but I did notice some lower FPS dips sometimes. It's not my PC: DX:MD all ultra in FullHD minus MSAA and VolLight @60FPS. So a game with spartan graphics like this one should be all smooth all the time.

Why even put guns in the game?  You can't beat all the guys that swarm you.  \n\nI find myself constalty in stealth mode crouching.  This make the gameplay super slow, which is okay, but you should be able to run and hide if noticed, since trying to shoot it out is impossible.  I see lockers, but you cannot enter them to hide. Once you're spotted, you're dead!  Include a run feature please.\n\nI'll try again for sure, as I love stealth games, but I'll know now that this is \"strickly\" a stealth game, very slow paced and melee based.  You get punished (killed) for being seen and for shooting your gun.  At least that is how it seems so far.  I can't imagine even with a machinegun, mowing through the hordes of enemies that swarm you so fast.  You die quit!\n\nOn the possitive side, it is very well made graphically.  I does have a story and nice tutorial. It seems like they did a lot of work on it so far and I'm sure they will tweek it into a more action oriented game, since there \"are\" guns.  I really need to play some more.  It is slow paced though, so you need to be in that kind of mood. And of course there are much better stealth games out there, but I got it for $2, so I'm happy... Sorta...\n\nThe game runs silky smooth on my computer:\n\nHardware Overview: \n\nModel Name:  MacBookPro 11,5 (Mid 2015)\nProcessor Name:  Intel Core i7\nProcessor Speed:  2.8 GHz\nNumber of Processors:  1\nTotal Number of Cores:  4\nL2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB\nL3 Cache:  6 MB\nMemory:  16 GB Type:  DDR3  Speed:  1600 MHz\nVideo Card:  AMD Radeon R9 M370X, VRAM 2048 MB\n\nOperating System: OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 (64 bit OS)\n\nEdit: The developer has supplied a \"cheat\" code that enables 500 health.  I'll let you scan the forums for that password so I don't spoil the fun for everyone that doesn't want to use the cheat code.. :-)  It sure changes the gameplay!

I would say this game is worth the 10 dollars.\n\nThe music seems to be nothing much at first, but as you go through the game, things get intense really quick and the music gets bae.\n\nThe gameplay is an interesting fusion of stealth and MLG matrix dodging. You CAN sneak up and take out most enemies, but some, you have to kill in fair combat. One of the main mechanics is dodging. You can dodge to the left or right to dodge bullets (or even swords and scythes and hammers and shields and..... im going to stop.). This is your prime source of MLG bullet dodging.\n\nThe story is generic-ish. You play as Edward, a cyber hacker who is trying to bring down some corrupt computer system. Or something.\n\nThe main problem I have with this game is its shortness and its depth perception. Your character actually isn't even a model, just a rendered moving image.
