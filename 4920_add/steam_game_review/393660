Every game mode pops you on a rectangular layer of blocks that are then hit by red blocks from above that damage and deform the layer. You have two powers, one restores the layer and replenishes with time (or not, in hard mode) and another that I haven't figured out at all (slow motion, sort of). You get scored on how long you manage not to fall as the platform crumbles around you. That is all there is to this game - well, there's a beta builder where you make non-rectangular layers. Whoop-de-doo.\n\nIt's annoying me because it is one of those first person 3D platformers where you can't see your feet, yet would wish to land on cubes precisely.\n\nI see nothing here that makes me want to play this.\n\n[i]Note that there won't be any further updates [url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/?appids=393660&appgroupname=Streamline]as of January 11th[/url] since the devs had a hard drive crash and no backups.

To beat your friends score, every second of surviving here is vital!  Where do you step?  Do you risk jumping the crumbling blocks to get to the other side where it looks safer and were you might live another 30 seconds?\n\nThis game offers two modes: Platform and Dash.  Platform is a big square area that is crumbling as red blocks smash into it from above.  In platform, every second you survive adds another point.  Dash offers a narrow, long base that you run back and forth on always trying to grab the blue score balls that will increase your score.  In each mode, the left mouse button will do some repair to blocks as they are falling apart, but once they have formed a hole, it's too late.  Each mode also offers three difficulty levels to make sure you are always challenged.  Other then that, the objective is to simply score as many points before you fal to your death!\n\nMy score for this game based on my personal scoring system is an 81%  Watch the above provided video to see how I came up with my score if you are interested.  \n\nDefinite thumbs up especially for family get togethers and parties!  Certain to provide lots of laughs and draw interest as you play it!\n\nBONUS VIDEO!
