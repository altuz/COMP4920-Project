Gameplay and story failed to catch my attention within an hour.  It's hard to figure out what the game wants me to do when it comes to figuring out how to progress. It often felt more like sifting through 20 usless interactable objects until I'd find one that was useful, and with no way of really knowing which is useful... it feels like lot of trial and error rather than clever puzle solving. Being repeatadly stuck because I don't know what the game wants me to do next, isn't particularly fun, but frustrating. I'd say the game tries too hard to be non trivial, without having a core mechanic, which just results with gameplay being convoluted rather than challenging. VR interface and interactions being badly explained and generally clunky and feeling unreliable only excerbated this problem further. When it takes me 5 minutes to figure out how to open a door, and one time I die trying due to a time limit, it makes me wonder if this game was ever tested in VR by testers who have never played it in flatscreen before. Another thing that bothered me was that antialiasing in VR didn't work well at all. Regardless of which AA method and VR resolution combination I tried, game always had severe aliasing issues.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504653095, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504653095, "recommendationid": "34766147", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506185830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 34, "steamid": "76561198027851199", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "bags... if you dont have any xbox you cant start the game...\n\nJust stuck in start screen with some strange window... no as when xbox controller was connected.\n\nEven not plaing... had to refund...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506189938, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506189938, "recommendationid": "35160228", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494666", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 63, "total_reviews": 93, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 30}}
