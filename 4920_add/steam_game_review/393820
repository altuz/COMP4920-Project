With the sheer amount of garbage that is classsified under Early Access, saying a game is too early even for Early Access feels pretty damning and yet perfect for At The Mountains Of Madness. There's a lot of jumbled thoughts to put together, so let's break it down into points.\n\n-The actual performance is terrible, sitting at about 22 frames on average. However, when I loaded my game after dying in the middle of talking to an NPC, the game dropped to a stubborn, stable 5 frames for no discernible reason. Turning down the graphics had no effect on the frame rate either time, just made the game look even worse. Of course, this is something that could be fixed in Early Access via optimization, but it leaves the initial impression that the developers have no idea how to go about doing that.\n\n-The voice acting is worse than abysmal. Likely recorded by the devlopers and their friends, all of the spoken dialogue sounds like non-english speakers phonetically reading dialogue off a paper. This could be placeholder dialogue again, but based on the budget it seems unlikely that the developers will be able to replace it with different voice actors more familiar with english. Perhaps it would have been better to record it in the native language with subtitles?\n\n-The gameplay is pretty awful and bland so far. There's no explanation of the health, or what the white flashing that kills you is supposed to mean. I thought it was freezing to death, since you can collect firewood and start fires, but eating a can of beans made it stop so who knows. Once you collect the plot mandatory flashlight and walking stick and get into the main gameplay, you're dumped in a dark, hideous looking ice cave. You need to find a fossil (which was just floating in mid air) and a hammer to extract it (from the air I guess?). This seems like the majority of the entire game, going into increasingly larger caves to find these fossils. It looks like there's eventually combat, but I can't imagine it being much fun at these stuttering frame rates. \n\n-The developers themselves. While this isn't immediately tied to the quality of the game, with Early Access the developers become much more important for determing whether the game will be able to improve. These developers seem a bit over enthusiastic for what was apparently originally a school project, claiming above that they're confident they already have a solid game here. Furthermore, I was banned from the game's forum for pointing out that deleting threads (or creating a Trash section to dump them in) with criticism is a pitiful, cowardly tactic that is frequently employed by indie developers on Steam who can't face criticism of their pet project/money laundering scheme. That's one thing that immediately removes any positivity or leniency for a developer, and the same is true here.\n\n-It's not fun. Ultimately this is the big problem that it boils down to. There was never an enjoyable moment in what I played, never a time when I went \"Huh, that's neat.\" This felt a lot like many of the free Unreal Engine and Unity engine messes that I've tried, cobbled together from a pile of assets without any real design philosophy or concern for coherence. It's a real shame, because I'm always looking forward to a good game based on Lovecraft's works, rather than just inspired by them. But At The Mountains of Madness isn't one of them, and likely won't be for a year or more, or perhaps never. Save your money, wait for The Sinking City for a quality H.P. Lovecraft game. \n\nIt's bad, and it likely won't get better without being a mostly different game from what's here.

Save files won't load, movement controls for keyboard are slow and tank-like, and the flashlight you find barely lights up a wall let alone portions of a hallway.

I usually like to cut a game in EA some slack, but I was under the impression that this game was very early into its development. Apparently, it isn't, and the current state seems to be quite advanced in the view of the developers, and I just don't think that that is a fair assessment.\n\nHere are my issues:\n- The game performs horribly. I am aware that optimization doesn't usually happen until the very late stages of development, and it might improve the performance, but right now, it runs terribly on a system that can run many current or very recent triple A-titles (Division, Witcher 3, GTAV, Hitman etc.) at medium to high settings. Motion blur, horrible framerate. \n- The voice-acting is terrible, and if this is more than a placeholder, is a big minus, as atmosphere is so important in HPL-games IMO, and this ruins any immersion.\n- Load times\n- Invisible walls that kept me from climbing even slight inclines, which felt odd. \n- Floating objects. If you look at, say, a can of beans on a shipping box, it floats.\n- Weird textures... the tents look like some silvery river surface. I guess they're supposed to look wet and frozen, but it just looks like some weird T1000-thingy. Same for a hut close to the starting area, which looks like the ghost of a hut, very unfinished.\n- Lack of explanation for things\n- I am not sure, but I read that the later game will involve quite a lot of fighting, which to me, kills the immersion. Yes, there was a bit of action in MOM (the novella), but it should be only a small aspect, where story, setting and atmosphere should be the focus.\n- Weird animations\n- Save game bug...where saving won't work, and puts you back to the start when you try to load. According to the devs, this is only on the first map, but there are reports of it bugging out later too. \n\nI am sorry, but if this is considered close to being ready for release, it really deserves a downrating, especially at the current prize... I don't mind big problems in an EA game if I know it's the very early stages, but 18 EUR to get into EA for a game that has severe performance issues and other bugs just isn't ok.\n\nI will keep an eye on this, and hope it can get improved a lot, as in another half a year or year of changes to the performance, layout, voice acting, mechanics, UI etc. If it does perform better eventually, I might change my review, but right now, this just isn't worth the money they ask for, and if a game based on such an atmospheric story is turned into a shooter or combat-focused game, I, as a longtime-HPL-fan, will stay away for good.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459443988, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1459443988, "recommendationid": "22163531", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524622", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459011759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 41, "steamid": "76561198134811176", "num_games_owned": 173}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 25, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have not written a negative review before, so I dont want to sound like a dbag.

You better play in english to understand what this game is about.\nAnother point are the inviselbe walls you can't pass even if you see far lands behind it. And you search for anything you have to get to and don't know where it is and all you find are these damn walls.\nWhat I miss for better understanding is something like a journal where you find everything that you have to do and where you have to do it.\n\nBut again it is early access and the game is not as terible as you may think if you see the reviews.\nSo Team Clockwork: Keep on the good work. I really like the Idea and I hope you do something great with it.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469132424, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1469132424, "recommendationid": "24447762", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500294", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459085059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198132961162", "num_games_owned": 166}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "2", "review": "This is an Early Access game, I understand that, that's why I will give this a good review.
