This is a nice arcade style tennis game with lots of character customization and fun mini games. I haven\\'t tried the multiplayer yet but soon I will. The game wasn\\'t easy for me at first but it got interesting once I got the Hang of it. There is nothing much to say about graphics and there are no extra options for graphics other than changing the resolution.

It absolutely does not.\n\nI've played just about every popular tennis game. Mario Tennis, Top Spin, Virtua Tennis, Wii Sports are all good in their own way thanks to solid mechanics. Smoots World Cup Tennis's mechanics are awful: unresponsive controls, low shot variety, inconsistent ball speed and bounce, no spin, useless lobs, etc. Rallies end up looking very dumb.\n\nAlso, there's no mouse support, and the menus are needlessly difficult to navigate through with keyboard or controller. This is a PC exclusive by the way.\n\nWhat else... oh yeah, the characters all make the same high-pitched moan every time they hit the ball.
