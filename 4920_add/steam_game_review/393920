Unfortunately it was far from my expectations. Here is a list I compiled of all the flaws I encountered:\n[list]\n    [*] Not able to charge more than 1-1.5k$ profit on new car prices or nobody will buy your cars (imagine that for real life dealerships)\n    [*] The creators solve this problem by saying \"You need to find the sweetspot/price for a car to sell for\" which is like saying \"its a feature, not a bug\", you should at least be able to give your sales staff margins (%) so they can cut the price a bit if a customer thinks it's too expensive.\n    [*] Not being able to change the price for options you sell on a car (Satnav, Audio system, Winter package.. all seem to sell for 500-600$)\n    [*] During the day you can only watch what happens to your company but not interact (only accept trade-ins), you can't even pause or close the game/go to main menu\n    [*] There's no 'log', there should be a daily log with all your profit/income, expenses, parts used for repairs...\n    [*] As noted above, sometimes you don't notice you're out of parts at the beginning of the day and there's nothing you can do all day long but see people come & go with their cars without paying because you don't have the parts to repair their car\n    [*] The music is ever so repetitive (thank god you can turn it off.. AT THE MAIN MENU, for which you have to quit your current game)\n    [*] There are no graphic settings at all\n    [*] This is my opinion, but there should be an option to loan money from a bank or something similar because you HAVE to stock up on second hand cars because otherwise you will lose CSR but then you don't have enough money at the end of the day to buy your actual dealership cars & lose CSR that way because people can't buy your \"official\" cars\n    [*] No way to create advertisements/marketing to get back your CSR, that melts away like icecream on a warm summer's day\n    [*] You lose CSR too easy and gain it back too slow (sometimes at random if a customer doesnt even want to buy something, what's up with that?)\n    [*] The new/used bias doesnt seem to make any difference\n    [*] There should be a time indicator to show how far in the day you are progressed (simple clock or even a progress bar would be nice)\n    [*] Every customer always seems to want anything that's NOT in stock. Like if you sell 3 types of cars, 20x car A, 10x  B & 0 x C (you don't have car C in stock anymore), 500 people will come to your sales guys & complain there's no car C left & drain your CSR like it's a free snickers giveaway at a Walmart. And if you have car C the day after, fully stocked, nobody will want it.\n    [*] The same goes for second hand cars. Like once every 4 or 5 days one or two people will want to buy a second hand car but the one day you don't have any second hand cars on offer everything turns to hell and you will lose CSR so fast you can't even imagine because ofcourse at that exact day everyone needs a second hand car.\n    [*] The auction system is so god damn slow and unclear. Sometimes I didn't even notice that the opponent made a bid because the color & font stays the same. Maybe change it to green if you are the current highest bidder?\n    [*] Also if you buy a car at the auction and sell if for more than 250-300$ that you bought it for at the auction, people will go apeshit and not buy anything from you and again drain your CSR\n    [*] There should be a possibility to have multiple savegames, now you can only continue or fully reset & start over your game\n    [*] There should be more buildings & more variety. Every building is basicly exactly the same only a few pixels streched out. After you get to the last building the fun is gone in seconds because there's nothing left to do.\n    [*] In stead of clicking with static 50$ price increaments for car prices, there should be a slider & text box where you can fill in a custom amount because if you buy cars at the auction you sometimes get ridiculous prices like 4731$ which doesnt seem to bother the customers but it does look weird to me.\n    [*] Did I mention CSR is nearly impossible to keep at a decent enough level to keep making enough money?\n[/list]\n\nThese are just my observations after playing a little over an hour. \n\nTl;dr: This game has a really good concept but it turned out way worse than it could've been. If this was an alpha or early access I would be very excited for it's future, but selling this as a fully completed game is not fair to the buyer and not worth the money, even at the price of 4.99\u20ac\n\nMy advice is, until all the features that should have been included are included, to not buy the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445642892, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445720668, "recommendationid": "18647822", "language": "english", "votes_down": 29, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770565", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445734229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561198019781713", "num_games_owned": 120}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 63, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is first game I have every requested a refund on in steam.

Unfortunately, a great concept is completely squandered on this dreadfully boring and poorly designed game.  By about 30 minutes in, I had already figured out a \"sweet spot\" for pricing and stock levels.  From then on, it was \"set it and forget it\", with the only \"gameplay\" being tediously stocking cars and parts before the start of each day.\n\nPros:\nGraphics are not great, but sufficient for the genre\n\nCons:\n\nWhere to begin?  \n\n(1) The economic model behind this game is terrible, especially for used cars.  There is no differentiation for quality of used cars in the game (no mileage or condition differences), yet two cars of the same model  can sell for wildly different prices, seemingly at random.  Since there is no method for price discovery, you are left randomly guessing at what a price should be.  This led me to just ignore used cars all together because they could sit on your lot forever, even if you set the price for thousands less than the \"estimated\" value.  (You only need to keep one or two on your lot at a time to avoid consumer rating penalties in case someone looking for a used car comes by and sees that you have none.  Even then, I just set the price at the lowest amount possible and they would still sit on the lot for a long time.)  This is SO disappointing since used cars are such a big profit generator at a real dealership.\n\n(2) If you have a car that isn't selling, you cannot set the price lower than what you paid for it.  So if you paid too much (like at an auction), you will be stuck with the car for a very long time.  And since it is impossible to tell whether you paid too much for a car (see 1, above) this is pretty much guaranteed to happen to you at some point.  Why not let us take the loss and move the inventory?  Ever hear of a loss leader?\n\n(3) The trade-in mechanics are pointless.  The sale will happen whether you accept the trade-in or not (which is completely unrealistic).  There is no negotiation of the price; you just accept the arbitrary price offered or not.  And because it is impossible to know whether that price is a \"good\" price (see 1, above), it is almost always better to just pass on the trade-ins.  Negotiating and dealmaking on trade-ins should be a fun and compelling part of the game, but the way it is implemented makes trade-ins completely pointless.\n\n(4) There is no challenge or \"gameplay\" in the personnel management portion of the game.  Because of the way that the new-car economics work in this game, the amount of money you make on a sale depends more on the quality of your sales staff, sales manager, and finance manager than on the price you set for the car.  Each employee has a single skill number and a price.  Price has no relation to skill level, and is low enough to not matter.  And all you can do with your employees is hire or fire them.  There is no negotiating of salaries or commissions, no promoting, no training or increasing stats/perks/etc.  So gameplay devolves to, hire the highest \"rating\" available (no matter the cost) at any given point in the game, and fire the lowest \"rating\" to make room for someone with a higher rating.  BORING!\n\n(5) The \"service\" portion of the game seems to be there only to add a little more tedium to an otherwise tedious game.  All you do is hire service employees (the highest \"skill\" you can find) and make sure they have enough parts each day.   Yes, you much manually restock parts EVERY turn.  There is no way to set a standing order to restock each turn.\n\n(6) Typical features of this type of game are missing, such as advertising budgets, buying on credit, comparing statistics to your competitors, etc.  The game misses many obvious elements, and feels unfinished.  I might be excited about it if it was an Early Access game, but sadly this is supposed to pass for a finished product.\n\nI wanted to like this game, but frankly, it just is not any fun.  It isn't even worth it at the $5 price point.

For example, I was losing a lot of CSR because I didn't have a 'Cheapolla' or whatever it's called. I had just a bit over 18,000 dollars. Cheapollas cost 14,000 each. So, I could only one Cheapolla and start the day. When I started the day, customers came in, only asking for a Cheapolla. The first customer asked for a Cheapolla, and bought it. You would expect a lot more people to come in, and they did. All of them wanted a Cheapolla. As I explained, I only had one. So, I lost loads of CSR and got NO money because I had one Cheapolla and everyone else wanted one. It was an endless cycle of buying one car, losing that car, losing CSR and ending up with the same ammount of money as when I started the day. With this and a lot of other frustrating things, I have to give Auto Dealership Tycoon a 4/10. It has a few good things in it, but the other bad things drown those good things out.
