The local multiplayer is amazing and the characters are really original!\nI wish the game had more single player features, but playing by yourself can get really challenging on Tournament mode!\nThis game takes the best part of Mobas and put into an party game, just pull your enemies and finish them, that's it!\nLong story short, if you like a towerfall, toto temple, bomberman experience then get this game!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441297260, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441297260, "recommendationid": "17864255", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494332", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
