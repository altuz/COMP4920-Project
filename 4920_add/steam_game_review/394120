You wear a ridiculous costume, while there are two choices for male costumes one is super weird so everyone you meet is likey to wear the less ugly one, and eveyones faces look  the same, so the only way to tell each other apart is their hair colur or clothes colour. When this is out of early access it might be just bad, but for now don't get it, yu will never want to play it again.
