The VR environment is wonderfully bright and colorful, don't let the cartoony-style fool you, this game is immersive. The puzzles are fun and there are enough things to warrant the $9.99 USD.\n\nThe game most closely resembles [b]Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker[/b] in terms of the action being centered around a winding blocky mountain you have to traverse around. With the added VR it makes Water Bears VR entertaining and not invasive, a really good place to start with VR.\n\nThe puzzle difficulty is quite basic at first and then starts to ramp up with different pipe types and needing to mix colors together for certain Water Bears. \n\nThe biggest downfall of the game is its 3m x 3m room requirement. I didn't have enough room (about 2.6m x 2.8) and it still worked just fine so I'm not sure what the need for all that space is (you don't even use most of the edge space).\n\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Great aesthetics to experience in VR\n    [*]Fun puzzles akin to Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker\n    [*]Cute interactions with the Water Bears gives added VR depth.\n    [*]Great price point of $9.99 USD\n    [*]Perfect for demoing VR in a non-invasive and interactive way.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]3m x 3m room size requirement (I wable able to play with less)\n    [*]Lack of passive interaction with the enviroment.\n[/list]\n\n\nAll in all I'd say this is a must-have VR experience.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459971836, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1459971858, "recommendationid": "22274284", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505544", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465068418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 77, "steamid": "76561198024982850", "num_games_owned": 250}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "More fun than I thought and I like moving around the puzzle to solve it.

Obviously I had to test it out to make sure it was age appropriate and so that I could explain to her how to play in case she has problems. So just one puzzle, maybe two.\n\nYeah, an hour later of playing and I'm already making plans to finish out all the levels while she's at school so I don't lose my progress when I reset it for her.\n\nFor $10 this is a great little casual puzzler. Probably only 1.5 hours of play but it's a well-done product and is appropriate for younger children.\n\nUPDATE: One problerm with this children-themed game is that the virtual table that you play on is actually too high for most younger children to play on. Even my seven year old, who is tall for her age, has to stretch to reach some of the upper levels of the puzzles. This also puts her at a severe disadvantage because she doesn't have a very good vantage point to look at the puzzle from. There are some later levels where looking down on the puzzle is almost a necessity to get a good picture of how to solve it.
