It doesn't have an in-built music player, I played it by putting on some music using Itunes in the background, then starting up the game. I also tried this successfully with Spotify, so it will probably work with your preferred streaming service too. If you start the game up without some kind of \"audio output\", the game will give you a message which instructs you to \"play some music\".\n\nSound Shift has two modes; Arcade and visualiser. Arcade is a simple game where you shoot at moving white blocks with your ship at the bottom of the screen. Firing is automatic and hitting blocks generates credits of various values. Your ship also powers up over time and when full, it fires a larger bullet, emptying out your reserves. All the time, your music generates visuals on screen.\n\nThe second mode is a traditional music visualiser, generating patterns on screen to the beat of the music you play. You can change how it looks using the Function keys on your keyboard.\n\nThe credits you earn in the shooting game can be spent in the mods section to unlock changes to how the visualiser works.\n\nWhen you start up the game, it gives the impression that it can only be played using a gamepad but it does have keyboard support (WASD or Cursor keys, plus F1-F6). \n\nSound Shift is something to do whilst listening to your music but game-wise, Audiosurf or Beat Hazard are currently much more diverse and engrossing examples of this kind of game. I enjoyed listening to some good music while playing around with this.

I don't dislike it by any means, but if you're looking for a new and interesting game to play, I honestly wouldn't recommend it. This is the only game Matthew Brown has ever put out that I had to think about recommending. \n\nThe game is like a mixture of two other popular rhythm games, [b]Audiosurf[/b] and [b]Beat Hazard[/b]. Alone they are both great games to play as they take advantage and create unique experiences based entirely on the strucutre of the music you chose. [b]Sound Shift[/b] uses this concept itself and feels like a mixture of both of the forementioned games, but is less interesting in terms of it's execution. \n\nThere are two gameplay modes: Arcade, which is a simple shooter, and Dodge, similar to the dodge mode in [b]Audiosurf[/b]. Both modes can be fun in short bursts, but the feeling is more or less the same regardless of the music you chose to play along to, I guess my biggest gripe would be the lack of variation when it comes to the actual gameplay, it gets repetetive very quickly so there isn't much to go back to.\n\nOne positive factor though is that the visualisations and modifiers are excellent, it's really the most unique and interesting thing about [b]Sound Shift[/b] and would be great to have set-up for house parties and such. I'd see this as more of an [i]interactive visualizer[/i] than I would an actual [i]game[/i]. \n\nFor it's price, I'd say it's interesting enough to pick up and give it a try, but I just don't think there is enough gameplay here to recommend it to rhythm gamers.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443643990, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487688946, "recommendationid": "18267668", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523055", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449236158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 220, "playtime_forever": 261, "steamid": "76561198006541362", "num_games_owned": 2057}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Sounds Shift takes any song played by your system and uses it to estabilish the rhythm and speed of the whole game: you'll get two game modes where you either shoot at targets ( both static and moving) or have to dodge them while moving close enough to gather points.\nWhile sporting decent visuals and being fun in quick burts its gameplay is sadly too shallow to have any kind of staying power making Sound Shift a pretty bland and forgettable experience.\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\n\n-once you unlock a few visual mods (and the ability to mix them) the game will look quite pretty\n\n-being able to choose any song played on your system, regardless of source, gives you lots of freedom \n\n-gathering the points to unlock all visual and effect mods will take a few hours \n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n\n-very simple gameplay with little variation and basically no way to fail, it can get dull fast\n\n-no leaderboards, no high scores or any kind of purpose to gameplay except gathering points\n\n-doesn't work too well with low tempo songs as your fire rate is also tied to the music\n\n-the lack of mouse support was a big surprise for me, keyboard or controller work decent enough but lack the smoothness a mouse would have and this is something that the \"dodge\" mode sorely needs\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=568301008\n\nSound Shift isn't an horrible game at all, it's pretty decent actually and the first few songs'll be fun as you slowly gain points and unlock new visuals: but after an hour you'll realize there's basically no variance in what you're playing as there's just one flat path and only a few types of blocks coming your way.\n\nThe game is also infinite as it goes on and on until you quit, the fact it streams whatever your system is playing rather than single tracks means you can forget about online leaderboards or even just local high scores: after a bit I felt as if it simply lacked purpose and even more so once you've unlocked everything thus making gathered points useless.\n\nUltimately I can't recommend Sound Shift due to how bland the gameplay feels, there's simply much better rhythm based games out there: still it might be a decent purchase (especially at its 1$ sale price) for players looking for a simple game to play during a break or people wanting a very easy game to try and get into the genre.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449248328, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449248358, "recommendationid": "19480856", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523929", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459948467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 567, "steamid": "76561198043183198", "num_games_owned": 454}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Same level of origonality we have come to expect from Matthew Brown.\nAn unusual platform that shares only with games such as Audiosurf and Sentris, the base game is very well constructed however an improved tutorial and more gameplay mechanics could be possible future addings to prevent users stumbling upon \"what do i do now?\" or \"why am i doing this\" thoughts.\n\nThat said, as with all his other games the current price/content ratio is a good!\nMassive potential!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440603718, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440603718, "recommendationid": "17725457", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514476", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502892485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 298, "playtime_forever": 338, "steamid": "76561198014552816", "num_games_owned": 277}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "While this is fun for the first hour or so, The visuals become boring and everything from then on is a chore.

But to call it a game is a stretch.  Heres my breakdown.\n\nThe Good:\nLightweight. Despite being pretty to look at, it's not that intencive.  This is Unity at it's most streamlined, I think.\n\nUses external audio, so you can literally use anything.  Go for it.  Literally any website, format of audio/video, or anything like that is usable.\n\nThe Bad:\nMovement controls. What made Audiosurf so playable was the quick, mouse-based controls.  It made moving left to right easy, sharp, and accurate.  This is simply clunky in comparison.  Even with a gamepad, the analogs just don't feel \"good\".\n\nUses external audio.  While it can use anything, it's also not user friendly.  Being lightweight isn't an excuse to force the player to use another program to play music/media.\n\nThe Ugly:\nFiring controls.  Firing is music-based.  And the special secondary weapon is time-based.  Everything is automatic.  Which means theres no chance to actuallly use skill, because the only thing you can do is go left or right.  Sniping blocks or even destroying all of one block becomes a chore as you pray that this riff causes enough shots, and hoping that you don't \"run out\" when you have a strong on 10c blocks.\n\nZero consiquence for missing blocks.  This makes some sense as firing is automatic, random and skill-less, but theres literally no insentive to play this.  Just fire up a random playlist and let it play itself on repeat while you're at work and sleeping.  I bet you'd have all the upgrades in a few days or so.  Idle games can be fun, but this could be so much more...\n\nUses external audio.  Yes.  It's greatest flexibility is it's greatest weakness.  Being able to read off the audio output is a nice feature, but it shouldn't be the ONLY way to play.  It ruins immersion, and really makes it feel more like what it is; Not a game, but a semi-interactive visualizer.\n\nI'd recomend it simply because it is pretty, and makes music fun to watch... But as a game, it's kind of a flop.\n\nVisuals: 11/10\nGameplay: 1/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441432260, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441432260, "recommendationid": "17888280", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508662", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488278152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 939, "steamid": "76561198123247522", "num_games_owned": 100}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Sound Shift gets too much hate, it might not be the best game, but at full price, it's only three dollars, and it goes on sale often, I think a lot of people miss the point of the game, being that it's something to do absentmindedly while zoning out to your music.
