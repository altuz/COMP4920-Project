However, there is an engine bug that happened somewhere in 2016, and devs cannot fix it.\n\nThe game currently looks like this on launch : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1103393861\n\nQuoting the dev : \"Hey all, some bad news on this... looks like it's caused by the actual engine we are using (GameMaker) and we have no control over it... and getting them to address things like this is highly unlikely unless it affects all games made with it.\n\nI'd suggest getting a refund, or contact us at pixeljamgames@gmail.com and we'll gladly send you a key for one of our other games.
