There was a good number of players, half a year later and i was being matched with the same 20 odd players. The game its self is generaly fine, reasonably well designed maps, good story modes felt a bit repetative at times but thats what hapens when the objectives are either defend point, kill boss/grunts and break object. The characters, their skills, the leveling and gear systems. Not far of being perfect. \n\nTaking the characters and universe and flinging it into a game thats more PvE focused with PvP as a side thing, would be briliant. like borderlands but with with biger teams and PvP.\n\nI wouldnt say you should get Battleborn, unless it goes fully F2P, then you should atleast try it.\n\nI do like this game its got plenty of content as it goes for upgrades, characters and gear. But I was searching for a match of Bots and I strugled to find more than two players, searching for over half and hour.\n\nIm giving it a review, But only on the anbsolutely miniscule chance that Gearbox, reads it and atlest considers doing something more with the characters they created.\n\nThis game will be fully dead by the winter holiday. That is sad, but it was set to die from the begining. It was fun while it lasted and all. But unless you know a good hundred or more people to populate it.

Btw \"story mode\" doesn't exist it's just: this is the bad guy, because he woke up and felt like being the bad guy, and has destroyed every galaxy, and you want to stop him from destroying the last planets, that's it.....yes, really, also the sotory mode is jus a horde mode, these idio....good people wanted to make more a meme than a game, really, they put all efforts into building characters in a dumber way they did in the bordelands series with tiny tina, \nand we all know how much annoying she was (this game doesn't take itself seriously for more than 30 seconds, and trust me, it's terrible), it's overwelmed by the dumb thing characters say, graphics are a joke, besides not performing to well in addtion has garbage graphics, you'll probably experience epilepsy if you're sensitive to these things, just looking at the schreen is confusing, s it graphics and manages to not run well.\ni'm still really really really upset by how i expected something fun and exiting, instead i really got robbed, i said this more than once, but really buying this game is like getting robbed on purpose, and i'm and idio...just as much as the developers and the publisher of this game. but it's no problem, i'm sure may will settle the score when borderlands 3 comes out, i mean it will get low scores on purpose.....yes...that's what i'm talking about.... :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506885710, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506885710, "recommendationid": "35393656", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495465", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468341394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 308, "steamid": "76561198028514273", "num_games_owned": 712}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "The only comparison to Overwatch I deem even remotely applicable, is that Overwatch is an incredibly polished experience in both technical and visual terms.\n\nBattleborn manages to lose 100 frames when I look at a light funny.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504621066, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504621066, "recommendationid": "34757395", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494472", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506314981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1286, "steamid": "76561198071124188", "num_games_owned": 44}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "(This review is for the paid version of the game)\n\nAlot of the hate is unjustified as most of it doesn't even critique the gameplay and ingores the quality of the actual game and directs at something thats the players fault and not the devs (Player count). About the gameplay, it's a good game and has alot of abilities and characters and upgrades to choose from but is in desperate need of more gamemodes and a trading system (Perhaps even communtiy made servers). Some characters are more memorable than others, the commando is a direct parody of COD player stereotype, then you have ones you don't remember at all because of how bland they are. The practice or \"Training mode\" is pretty crappy as you're just fighting a predictable wave of minions that doesn't really challenge your tactical or prep skills. Speaking of prep, the upgrade system can be frustrating as you don't have the option to choose what upgrades you want on a character before a match, and have to manually choose them as you level up, when it would be more convenient to have a custom preset that the game will automatically follow and select the chosen upgrades from the preset as you level up. The game is good, but not great, i'd say it's worth 25 dollars, the game is mildly overpriced but nowhere near as bad as other sh\u0129t i've encountered, it's a shame people are bashing this game for something that's out of the devs control (Player count), but over here in the states the wait time isn't really bad or even subpar, i assume these people complaining about waiting times live in third world countries.
