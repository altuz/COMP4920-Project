It's got a goofy, entertaining story with some fun characters.  Some of the levels are actually hard to perfect, which adds to the challenge.  There is a hidden treasure to be found on every level, in addition to the mission/level objectives.  I thoroughly enjoyed this little gem, especially considering how inexpensive it was.
