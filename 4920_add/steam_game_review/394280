I mean [b]really[/b] bad. The art is okay (the image quality is so low that it kinda looks like crap, unfortunately), the VA is terrible and exaggerated, and the thing that bothered me the most\u2026 They used live action actors in the scenes. \n\nObviously they don\u2019t match with the background, and on the brief scenes that you can see them, the camera keeps focusing on their eyes as it seems it tries to show some expression but it shows us nothing but emptiness and maybe some fake tears. The ending was so bad, maybe the worst I\u2019ve seen in a HOG in a while. The final battle was disappointing, just like the extra chapter. \n\n3/10. The story made no sense, the dialogues were bad, the puzzles/HOs were too easy or plain annoying, etc. I don\u2019t recommend this game even on sale, maybe you can check it out if you get it in a bundle. Overall, don\u2019t waste your time playing this title.
