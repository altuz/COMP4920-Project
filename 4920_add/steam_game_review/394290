I've played a couple levels and probably 100 or so matches already, so I felt I would write an impressions review (mostly since there is a story of sorts, which I wont finish for a little while most likely, but when I do, I will amend this review as necessary).\n\nAnyway, this game isnt different in philosophy to Contraption Maker, Bad Rats, and so on, except that it is more enjoyable and definitely much more humorous. It does have a story as mentioned before. Basically you are an ex tennis champ who got hooked on an energy drink and it ruined your career and your life, so now, you are on a mission to free people from its evil influence, an influence that has spread like wildfire. How? Well, via your tennis skills of course. You will roll through themed levels (clowns, cops, etc...) using your service skills to try and knock out as many enemies as possible with as few balls as possible. There are obstacles that will destroy your ball, but others than will set off chain reactions that assist you in your endeavors.\n\n\n....and that is pretty much all there is to it, at least at the point I am at. \n\nbtw....if you idle the title screen to get as many points as possible there, you will get an achievement when you hit one million points, lol.\n\n\nAnyway, this is what I consider a great time waster. Just have a few minutes? This is the game for you. Have more time to spare. Ditto. In fact, while I doubt this will be most people's game du jour, it will definitely serve to fill those voids where you dont know what to play, dont have a lot of time to play, or generally are just bored but want to play something. \n\nActually a very easy recommendation for me.

When playing it however... The first thing that struck me was the annoying fake physics applied to the ball.  OK, whatever, the game was still playable and I could overlook it, so I played on and was reasonably entertained til the 7th of 8 worlds or so.\n\nAs you progress in the world and the difficulty increases, I noticed the game shifting and relying less and less on \"strategy\" and more and more on random chance and I was left with merely \"try throwing the ball this direction and see what happens\".  Which is partly brought on by the inconsistent physics applied in the game (falling objects, objects pushing other objects).  This \"Random Factor\" in the physics, as I call it, can be demonstrated by trying the same thing a couple times in a row, and seeing different results.  This becomes a bigger problem later on as you start relying on how objects simply fall, or how preset objects explode, etc.\n\n[h1]The PROs:[/h1]\n+ Very cool graphics\n+ Great artstyle\n+ I liked the over-the-top \"story\"\n+ Last ball trajectory shown so you can tweak it a bit\n+ A variety of baddies that behave differently\n+ A good number of levels\n\n[h1]The EH:[/h1]\n~ Music got very repetitive, very fast.\n~ Wonky physics with the tennis ball itself.\n\n[h1]The CONs:[/h1]\n[b]- Random Factor.[/b]  The same actions will produce similar but different results when \"physics\" gets applied.  Which gets annoying as in later levels you need things to fall on other objects or blow up which throws objects in a certain distance, or other people to fall into others, etc, etc.\n\n[b]- Inconsistent physics for objects in the game.[/b]\n\n[b]- Less and less strategy on later levels[/b], and simply more just throwing the ball all over til you see the effects and discover how a medal is done for that level.\n\n[h1]Overall:  It's a great looking game and I played it for a few hours, but ended up quitting due to needing to rely on inconsistent physics.  6 out of 10.[/h1]\n\n[i]Actual play time was approx 2.7 hrs.  The rest of the time was idling for cards and also being interrupted during play and was away from PC with game still running.
