Very difficult on the 'normal' settings (progress takes much, much, longer to due to stat decay). I can only imagine 'hard' is next to impossible.\n\nThat said, the visuals are pleasant, I loved the pop culture references and some of the humor made me chuckle. \n\nThis is basically a mobile style time wasting game with game breaking bugs there were never fixed with a more attractive package than a standard mobile game.\n\nNot recommended.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504720228, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504720228, "recommendationid": "34780164", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504368", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1250, "total_reviews": 1818, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 568}}
