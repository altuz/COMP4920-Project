The art in this game is other-worldly and trippy, and it's a blast to tear through the twisted alien armies that vary from Fluffy laser bunnies to alien ghosts to cylon-esque robots. \n\nBoss fights are the set pieces here, with each boss requiring a different strategy - and man are they all weird as hell (in a good way). There is decent replay-ability due to the timing and \"score\" you can achieve from taking the bosses down quickly or without taking too much damage. The different pets you can buy add depth to the way you can approach the games' challenges - just try to remember to save up the yellow \"currency\" in the beginning, so you can afford the more expensive and interesting pets. Some of them are downright hilarious - a flying cat that shoots and screeches?

I was hoping this game would work well on my computer, unfortunately it is awfully slow on my windows 10. Otherwise I felt potential of fun with the atmosphere and creepy look. I cannot judge it accurately since it does not work optimally on my system but I felt it might be fun to explore and see more of those ugly monsters and cool looking background designs. It's clearly not a high quality game in terms of feeling of the physic but there are ideas and cool creepy designs in my tastes.
