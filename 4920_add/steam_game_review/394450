The controls are fairly solid though limited. The gameplay is interesting but gets repetitive very quickly. I got through about Act 6/9 before I felt like I was done with the game. Usually 40k games do a great job with creating a compelling story with great characters. This title however did not, likely because it made more sense to use this format for a mobile game. Fun enough game to kill about 10 hours on imo, but I had other things I wanted to play more than I wanted to finish this title. Grab it on sale and enjoy it for what it is.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505878445, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505878445, "recommendationid": "35076888", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498408", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 138, "total_reviews": 230, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 92}}
