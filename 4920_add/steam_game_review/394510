I don\u2019t recall being slowed down by untouched snow drifts, nor being routinely boiled alive by the gushing magma that volcano worlds like to troll you with, but the actual planet-type itself escapes me. We were there to capture it, and while we certainly weren't attempting that feat on the hardest of the twelve mission difficulty settings available, it was up there in challenge. There were three of us; I\u2019m certain of that much. There were just the two of us at the start of the first mission, but a third jumped in mid-way through and, while we were nothing special, we were competent. We dragged each other through that first invasion with just a few hairy moments and a narrow escape when we finally completed all our objectives, suffering the most when forced to hold ground until a dropship arrived to evacuate us. But we dug in, weathered the last of the storm and then unashamedly ran like frightened girls toward the ship when it finally arrived. Two of us actually made it.\n\nMission one of three down, we ploughed on. Completing a full set of missions isn\u2019t obligatory, but you soldier on for the prize at the end, be it a fancy new weapon or a fat experience boost. This time, our war was waged against the bug army. There are three distinct enemy races in HellDivers, but the bugs are by far the best. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the robot or cyborg forces, both of which wield superior tech the giant insects don\u2019t possess. Robots teleport in and cyborgs drop from the sky, but bugs come at you from under the ground, burrowing in from anywhere. Should one of their scouts spot you, you\u2019re flooded with snapping claws, acid spit and near-unbreakable carapaces. One second you\u2019re alone with nothing but the swirling sands for company. The next you\u2019re, well... not. It doesn\u2019t take very long at all for a screen to fill with homicidal bugs.\n\nBut we were making good pace, confident enough to leave the beaten track to try to hunt down hidden specimens that are used to slowly upgrade you Diver\u2019s arsenal of weapons. We reactivated SAM sites and held off the herd that appeared to destroy it; we nuked insect nests and liberated strategically important sites. Our resource use was slim and slow, saving the big weapons for the eventual end when we called down that shuttle and the entire planet would turn up to try and stop us. But we were all good. Then the fourth character fell from orbit, and everything went to hell.\n\nThe new arrival was ten or so levels behind the current team\u2019s average, but that\u2019s usually okay; a decent team can often carry a rookie through harder planets that their default, unleveled equipment shouldn\u2019t allow them to endure. The three of us were battle hardened; our chosen pulse beam rifles, sub machine guns and shotguns all fully researched to their most powerful apex. Even if our new member did minimal damage, it\u2019s better than none at all, right? At worst, it would be a boon to have a new person ordering equipment from the ships in orbit above us. Even if they chipped in now and then with the odd ammo refill or a revive when one us fell, it would make for a better team. \n\nIn theory, anyway. Dear, sweet, elusive theory...\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/13523/pc/helldivers/review.html", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504969989, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504969989, "recommendationid": "34839646", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514453", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503216003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4439, "steamid": "76561198023323309", "num_games_owned": 148}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pew pew pew..hit teammates and resurrect them again..do that again for sure.\nNice game anyway", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504789272, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504789272, "recommendationid": "34793903", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506889", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507017264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 366, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 738, "steamid": "76561198005726016", "num_games_owned": 618}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Best (sadly non-licensed), Warhammer40K game made to date.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506593946, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506593946, "recommendationid": "35258814", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508250", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506479626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3634, "steamid": "76561198043922886", "num_games_owned": 106}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is so good! \nPlay alone or play locally with your friends\nKill some aliens.., or your friends. xD\nEither way, this is a must buy...\n\nso stop reading reviews and just get it already!!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505393148, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505393148, "recommendationid": "34947770", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496464", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502658171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4706, "steamid": "76561197987055299", "num_games_owned": 160}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "10/10 Get vaporized by a nuke one of your douchebag friends dropped today.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504589283, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504589283, "recommendationid": "34750232", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507149800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 828, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1970, "steamid": "76561198263992208", "num_games_owned": 8}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Such a great fun multiplayer game!

Game is still just as fun now to play.\n\nEssentially it does everything right. \n\n\n\nThe controls are tight and feel very fleshed out. Accommodating for every type of action a player can perform without being complicated. The game even having a system for pressing buttons in a code entering fashion to activate objectives and call in support, which feels very nice to use yet it doesn't feel obtuse or confusing at all.\n\nThe combat is relatively simple twin stick shooting, with a variety of enemy types and enemy abilities however once again remaining basic enough that it's easy to remember what each enemy can do without them losing their individuality. There's three different enemy factions, which also helps a lot for variety.\n\nThe gameplay itself is the games strongest point. The maps are totally randomized and are composed of very nondescript geography to the point where even after hundreds of hours it is rare to actually notice two maps that have the same features. The objectives are each unique, randomly generated and placed around the map, and are very understandable to complete. It just doesn't get boring, although the escort objective is obnoxious.\n\nThere is a variety of outfits, weapons, passive perks and equipment that players can choose from and gradually unlock. Which is the low point of the game is that there are certain things that are distinctly underpowered and have never been buffed, and thus they might as well not exist which makes the customization smaller then it could be.\n\n\n\nThe game does have a lot of purchasable content, and for twenty dollars for the base game it does feel like a lot of that content should have been in the game to begin with to flesh it out more. Especially with all the underpowered things in the vanilla game that aren't ever used. It still doesn't feel however like the game has less content then it should, and the main emphasis of play is just on shooting things anyways. The game has also recieved multiple free expansions and pieces of content so it's not like the developers were ransoming content away. The purchasable content has a few powerful weapons in it, but it isn't required to have them to be able to play effectively so players aren't majorly at a disadvantage if they don't buy it.\n\n\nAlthough the game does have a low playerbase by now, it's still no problem to find multiplayer so long as you turn off the region filter in the search filters; and there's really no problem with lag at all. The game is very social in its matchmaking system and so it really doesn't require many players to be ingame for there to be options for drop in cooperation.\n\nThe game is totally worth playing even if twin stick shooters, or even shooters, aren't your main thing. It's just that well designed, fun and replayable. And honestly, fourty dollars for the Deluxe addition with all the purchasable content is still worth the cash because of how replayable the game is.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507062642, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507062975, "recommendationid": "35456095", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505318527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6022, "steamid": "76561198118852472", "num_games_owned": 520}, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Before I played:\n\uff3c\uff3c \uff3f\n\u3000\u3000 \uff3c( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 <\u3000\u2312\u30fd\n\u3000\u3000\u3000/ \u3000 \u3078\uff3c\n\u3000\u3000 /\u3000\u3000/\u3000\uff3c\uff3c\n\u3000\u3000 \uff9a\u3000\u30ce\u3000\u3000 \u30fd_\u3064\n\u3000\u3000/\u3000/\n\u3000 /\u3000/|\n\u3000(\u3000(\u30fd\n\u3000|\u3000|\u3001\uff3c\n\u3000| \u4e3f \uff3c \u2312)\n\u3000| |\u3000\u3000) /\n`\u30ce )\u3000\u3000L\uff89\nAfter I played:\n\n\uff0f\uff8c\uff8c \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u30e0\uff40\u30fd\n/ \u30ce) \u3000 \uff09\u3000\u30fd\n/ \uff5c\u3000\u3000( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0\uff09\u30ce\u2312\uff08\u309d._,\u30ce\n/\u3000\uff89\u23127\u2312\u30fd\u30fc\u304f\u3000 \uff3c\u3000\uff0f\n\u4e36\uff3f \u30ce \uff61\u3000\u3000 \u30ce\uff64\u3000\uff61|/\n\u3000\u3000 `\u30fd `\u30fc-'_\u4eba`\u30fc\uff89\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u4e36 \uffe3 _\u4eba'\u5f61)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504722007, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504722007, "recommendationid": "34780634", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491972", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1475211806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 131, "playtime_forever": 549, "steamid": "76561197966463890", "num_games_owned": 695}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "One of the great co-op action games that is designed for it from the bottom up", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505686398, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505686398, "recommendationid": "35034283", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497332", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468040733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 165, "playtime_forever": 727, "steamid": "76561198017960033", "num_games_owned": 225}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "it's cool but repetitive", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506220440, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506220440, "recommendationid": "35168955", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495687", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2675, "total_reviews": 2967, "num_reviews": 13, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 292}}
