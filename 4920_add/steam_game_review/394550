What happened? I'll get the good out of the way, so what does Gunman Clive 2 do right? To start the soundtrack is as good if not better than the original, featuring more varied tracks. The controls are fair, though this might just be me adjusting to the steam controller, but I feel the original had tighter controls. Bosses are more interesting and the difficulty has increased overall with both Chieftain Bob and the Duck offering a mix-up to the regular gameplay all of the above is what I appreciate from this game. \n\nSo what do I feel Gunman Clive got wrong? The clear crisp sketch like visuals are now muddier than before, where previously colour was limited to enemies, various effects and the occasional bit of background scenery, now that everything is in colour I feel something has been lost in the transition. World and level design also feels off to me, devoid of originality. No longer does the stages feel concise but rather littered around the world for the sake of \"more diverse environments\". The stages suffer as a result, becoming both unoriginal and forgettable.\n\nI think the worst part is one of my major complaints about the original title still stands. Difficulty levels are meaningless, yes the difficulty of the game has increased but the choice of difficulty is pretty inconsequential, especially if you're going for the no damage run. \n\nI'll summarise for the sake of clarity, I don't think this is an inherently bad game, but as a sequel it has left me disappointed. If you do want to get this, I would urge you buy the 3DS version if you can as it is pretty much better than any other version of the game.
