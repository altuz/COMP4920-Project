close the game (nice...)\n-The playfield and aspect ratio feel like a Gameboy game, not NES, do not make the mistake of thinking it's NES. \n-The story is often copy/paste Engrish from classic games or a pale attempt at replicating it, often cringe worthy. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501044989, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501044989,

"as a mega man fan this game is very disappointing. mainly do to the small screen and lack of reaction time you have. you can beat the game but not without getting hit and with only 5 story levels and 4 extra levels its not to hard to do. \n\n(you can skip this paragraph) first off i have beaten every megaman but 10 and rockboard (mm1-9, rockman & fort for wonderswan [yes, it was different] all 5 gameboy ones, even the 3 tiger handheld ones, the import Saturn fps Super Adventure Rockman, the racer Battle & Chase, even still the 2 arcade fighters+marvel vs capcom, i even played mm soccer though i didn't beat it), every megaman x (yes both gameboycolor ones and Command Mission the rpg too), both legends+tron bonne, all 4  megaman zeros, both megaman zx's, i even put up with 2 or 3 of the network ones and yes both versions of each (until i came to terms with them being bad, though the wonderswan and gamecube ones played like a normal megaman with card attacks) so you can kinda say this is a review from a megaman/rockman fan. \n\nthe game is almost there but fails so hard in a few things. \n1)reaction times: do to the screen being shrunk down to the size of a gameboy screen when enemies come on screen you have little to no time to react to attacks. just look at the video at 20sec in. this is also an issue with fighting bosses in tiny rooms. i remember gameboy megamen having issues like this but only with a few enemies and no where as bad as this game (they also had blur if played on older gameboys and i think the first few still had transition issues).\n2)boss spam: bosses like to go into really cheap attack patterns when they hit 25%. some go where they can not be shot to drag out fights and when they do come down you'll be lucky to get 1-2 shots on them before they do it again or the last boss that has unavoidable attacks so you win do to nice rng and not because you learned the pattern.\n3)your attacks are pathetic: yes,yes gitgud but i'ed still like a move that would do more than 1 damage on bosses. yes there are charge move but they are very risky the girl is the only one that isn't a gamble if only it didn't also do 1 damage (beck the armor guys will normally gets you killed more on that later)\n4)becks dash moves: i have 3 issues with this 1)you take damage: playing X and the fact your white when you do the air dash it would make you think you're invincible. well your not. 2)there is no way to cancel charge moves (that i know of): well you could get hit but anyway once you charge this up your committed to a dash and you can't fire your gun. if you find out a normal shot would work better, well to bad. on bosses this can make the difference between a fast death or victory. 3)the ground dash does no damage: why have 2 kinds of dashes one doing damage and the other not. +1gripe)beck is shorter than the other 2 characters so his shots are lower. you'll notice this on the school level.\n5)there is no exit button: i had to hit esc and there is nothing telling me so on screen. i was also using a controller.\n6)enemies respawn: if their spawn point goes off screen when they are dead they come back. well with such a small screen this gets a tad annoying and it's not far off screen before they respawn either. \n\nok i beat it with all 3 characters it took me about 2 hours and all i can say is the 5 story missions are barley passable but 2 of the 4 extra level bosses have their AI ripped strait from mugen. cheap, unavoidable, and so unbalanced its not even fun but its like all the bosses in the game really. they need balanced and none telegraph attacks. its a cute game but is flawed so take this how you want it is only $5.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503277329,
