The game seems to be cobbled together without much care for the player's experience, and the result was that I was frustrated with gameplay, felt like I was fighting the game to play it, and felt like the game did not respect my time. (The ~7hours I've logged in it are only because I'm an unrelenting achievement whore.) This made it difficult to enjoy the game, and so I don't recommend Incarnation 1 -- though I am hoping the dev might tweak things for later chapters, and am eager to see where all this goes. \n\nA few examples of why I found Incarnation 1 a chore to play:\n\n1) Within the first ~10-15 mins of gameplay *after* the intro, you'll encounter a truly frenetic and bewildering sequence of load screens (!?) and short vignettes where there is little meaningful gameplay. [spoiler](I'm thinking especially of the first time you get into that weird little living elevator that lets you travel to different areas. You're forced through a vignette in which you have an interaction -with no options-- with a blind character. You never see that character ever again, and you pass through a few areas of the game you never see again. if this is foreshadowing for a later episode of the game, it comes at the expense of enjoying this chapter.)[/spoiler] It's exceptionally difficult to start feeling at home in the world of Karma when, right at the start, gameplay is constantly being interrupted.\n\n2) You've got an inventory that displays items you've collected. However, you have no ability select items from your inventory to do anything with them. You can look at them in your inventory, but you learn nothing new by looking at them, and clicking anything in the inventory is not in any way a direct route to interaction in the game. If you've got the right item in your inventory, then when you approach the place where it can be used, the game will just tell you to use the item. And you then use it without actually accessing the inventory at all. This turns the familiar presence of an inventory into a distraction with no relevance to gameplay, and sends mixed signals to the player about how they are supposed to accomplish anything in the game.\n\n3) Using Astral Sight appears to be just a gimmick for introducing (more) psychedelic art. There's very little going on in the spirit world that seems to matter for gameplay. Moreover, Astral Sight helps bring out some weird design decisions about the mechanics. Normally (without Astral Sight) you can pan around the whole screen and see what's going on far away from you. But Astral Sight only works for a small window around your character, so your world shrinks a bit when you use it (presumably the exact opposite of the experience it was supposed to provide of transcending a more mundane plane of existence or whatever). And yet, it's not quite so jarring, because...\n\n4) The world you can see (without Astral Sight) is decoupled from the world you can interact with, nearly all the time. You can always pan around a screen and see what's far away from you, but you've typically got no option to interact with anything until you walk right up to an object. [spoiler]The one exception is the forest, the one screen/area where suddenly, you can interact with objects at a distance. If you're like me, you discover this by being lost and bored and clicking anything you can. And most of what you can click at a distance is irrelevant. The whole experience is a bit hackneyed.[/spoiler] When you are close to objects, the game simply tells you how you interact with them. As a result, being able to look around the whole screen at any time is basically meaningless for gameplay, since you only get information about which parts of the world are relevant once you've walked up to them.\n\n5) Many of the hand-drawn animations become more irritating than charming, real quick. [spoiler]Especially in the forest and the leaf-maze.[/spoiler] The same animation plays every time you perform an action, and just eats up time: cute the first time, maddening the 30th time. Also anytime you are traveling to the left and click to interact with anything to your left, your character will pause, turn to the right, then turn back to the left and do what you wanted.
