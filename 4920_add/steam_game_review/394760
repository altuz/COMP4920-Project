You *always* be hearing something talking to you.\nPart of why I loved the first Dead Effect was that it was just me, a bunch of zombies, and guns.\nThis game lost that aspect, and it makes me very sad.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506709461, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506709461, "recommendationid": "35307621", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505532", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506885030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 367, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 2297, "steamid": "76561198186133689", "num_games_owned": 186}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Dead Effect 2 is a mix of zombies & soliders that are on a space ship. Experiments broke out yada yada you get the jist of it.\n\nYou the player get to pick three different type of characters. A heavey gunner, assault or light. Each character has their own names and specific start weapons. You later on can use any type of weapon that is in the game for your character as long your the right level. \n\nMissions- there 15 story mission & 5 Generic missions. You can gain weapons, money, gear & power ups during each mission. You have side quests you gain more money & better rewards. \n\nOther Missions - Biohazard mode, survival mode, lone wolf missions & Infestations offer more play time after you beat the story. The developer has also fixed the online requirement issue so now those who play solo can stay solo. The only issue I have is during survival missions, there are way to many crawlers.\n\nItems- you can get items as rewards or buy them. You can buy medkits, ammo pack ect ect. Hotkeys would have been nice since using items pauses the game.\n\nGear- gear is basically helmit, chest plate, legs armor & arm armor. These are what helps upgrades your health, stamina and special. Better the gear, better stats. Only issue is when you add a perk, you can't remove it.\n\nImplants- these are upgrades that help with movment speed, aim, stabalization & energy. Same as gear, the higher the better. Still can't remove a perk.\n\nEquip & Unequip- Weapons you get you can equip them to specific slots on your character. Primary weapons ( assault, shot guns, bows ect ect). Secondarys (pistols, mini shotguns & melee) are on your side. \n\nHacking- the hacking is very cool & fun to do but it would ne nice to have seen a few different ones other then the counting down and lock matching.\n\nRespawning- you can respawn if you die but doing so requires credits (money). You will pick up money during that mission, so its not hurrting your saved money unless you didn't pick up the full amount. If you don't want to lose any moeny then restarting the game is an option you can do.\n\nWeapon Upgrading- you can upgrade every weapon you aquire. You can upgrade the damage, accuacey, magazine, codex and reload. The issues I have with the upgrading is the percentage of the accuacey and reload. A 100% should be almost instant and anything beyond 100% is god like. Heck you accuecy being 150% it like shooting from the other side of the universe and still hitting your target or reloading speed being 120% happens so fast its like you never did it. I was alway told there is no 110% just 100%. Also when adding a codex upgrade, you can't remove it.\n\nWeapons- there are good weapons in the game but after a while its the same weapons just different colors and different stats. Heck I would pay DLC to have weapons from different games being in here. \n\nZombies- there are different verity of zombies. Some easy & some hard to kill. Its seems headshots are still almost 1 hit kill unless a blood spiter, acid spitter, armor zombies or a dog. Although when killing a TNT, Hungry or Spacer zombie, they will still throw their ability at you even if you quickly kill them.\n\nSoliders are tough to kill but do provide a challeneg. Soliders are more of a threat then the zombies so it's nice to encounter soliders lesser.\n\nTrophies- the game does have trophies you can try to get. I think 177 of them, not to sure.\n\n \nFor a $19.99 game you are getting more, its actually a steal at $19.99. It's VR version is the same but you don't have to worry about some upgrades and you get 2 extra weapon slots. The game does get a 8/10 from me. If you don't have this yet I recommend you go and buy this game right now. If the developer decides to make a Dead Effect 3, I will buy it 1,000%\n\nThat's the Pony review.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506146046, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506146046, "recommendationid": "35145070", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505482", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506806510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 86, "steamid": "76561197975715857", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Absolute bargain for the money.\n\nYes its a hash of Dead Space and Mass Effect, but also stands as  a game on its own, its a solid FPS with good game controls and good optimisation I have old hardware an AMD 1055T X6 and am old AMD 5770 GPU, and it runs with settings maxed out and at a smooth 40 fps. considering I've overclocked my old chip by a long way the game runs stable. \n\nI like the DOOM3 style of this game its like a DOOM3 addon in a way, Is it the same engine? I also like the tight and overfilled corridors, some people my find this cramped and a bit too much, but theres plenty to look at and plenty to avoid so not to get trapped when something is attacking you. I tend to use the walk backwards and strife method of shooting, if not run and gun.\n\n\n*to add this game does have cheesy characters and voice acting, but its all part off it. To me its like the wise cracks of Duke Nukem or John Dalton from Unreal 2 The Awakening. (I'm a veteran gamer). ...and this game is kind of old school with much better graphics and effects all nicely done.\n\n*The let down of thisa game is the skills menu system and the itinery, like when you press TAB for tasks and stuff.... its clumbsy and looks dull ( did that upgrade really upgrade ) instead of going into a menu a Crysis style middle mouse in game choice system would of been great.. but a hell of a lot more programing. \n\n\nAll in all a solid 8/10 for graphics, game play, gore, cheesyness, price and getting the controls right.\n\nAlso I like the art direction of this game the artistry and style of this game is superb in game but crappy in the menu's.
