Unfortunately these are the only attack options which are presented. There are two kinds of items which can be found: protective items like shields and helmets and melee weapons. All of them are frequently dropped by enemies or can alternatively be bought at the store between levels using in-game currency. Although there is a large amount of different items, they are all functionally the same and only differ in the amount in which they boost the offensive or defensive stat. Additionally the skill tree also only offers passive power ups, the result of which is, that the the first level and all of the following are mechanically the same with only a minor sense of progression.\n\nRelease Date: 2 Dec, 2015\n\nThe Gameplay\nYou may be wondering what about the kick attack? Well it does the same damage as punching, is slow to use and range is the same, not that it matters in this title. It could have been used for staggering an enemy or something of that nature but it is just an inferior attack that you'll likely never use in Office Battle. Defeating foes and completing missions grant you both money and experience which can be used to buy items and to level up your skill tree. In the main menu there is a store where you can purchase said weapons and gear to take into a mission. You can also sell whatever gear you picked up from missions for cash. Weapons do break down so the benefit of buying them is that they are in 100% condition as such will take longer for it to break in the middle of fighting. Protection for the head and shields wear down from taking damage so constantly replacing your gear is necessary if that is the way you built your character.\n\nLeveling up grants 1 skill point that allows you to upgrade one of the abilities in the skill tree such as regenerating health, better hand to hand and weapon usage increases to name a few. There is a skill for blocking which oddly enough cannot be activated, instead works like an RPG where it's pure chance if it activates. There are 4 types of missions. Survival where you must stay alive for a certain amount of time and Last Man Standing where you must defeat a certain amount of enemies. They feel pretty much the same to be quite honest. Office Capture is the one mode where you must move since you have to take control of three circles scatted on the map but once you are there it's back to being stationary and mashing the attack buttons so not a huge departure. Finally we have Big B missions that has you facing your old boss in a fight.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505542825, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505542825, "recommendationid": "34988975", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500200", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 143, "total_reviews": 208, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 65}}
