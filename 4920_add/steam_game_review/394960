So let's look at what we have here, thus far:  Nice graphics, great setting, fantastic atmosphere, perfectly acceptable voice acting, interesting AI (your partner actually tries door handles of their own volition!), no introduction, no context, incomplete sound design, and the occasional crash.  There's also not an awful lot of the actual GAME here, given the very short length of the presently playable content, and the menu page's assertion that the \"horror elements\" will be added in later.  Now for the \"faith\" part...\n \n   With Early Access games, and especially Early Access HORROR games, a certain amount of faith is required on the behalf of the consumer that the product they have paid a pretty penny for will eventually reach COMPLETION.  If you buy and play as many horror games as I do, you'll know this is a dodgy proposition at best; many are the times we have been let down thus far, not least of all due to the well-intentioned but somewhat questionable Steam Greenlight system (hell, Hitler himself had good intentions, and look how THAT turned out).  So it's up to adventurous (read: foolish) reviewers like myself to hazard a guess as to just how \"genuine\" the developers of a particular game-in-progress appear to be, and make a call from there as to whether anyone else should be silly enough to shell out good money for a game which may yet go the way of the Dodo.  My assessment of this product, on the small amount of evidence provided thus far?  Well, it's looking pretty hopeful.  \n \n   I sense LOVE, brothers and sisters.  I hope that by now I've learned to tell the sincere devs from the insincere ones, and Hallelujah, this may yet be one of the good'uns.  But only time will tell, right?  Heart = right place.  I think.  But please don't trust me on that, and unless you're as faithful as I, you may want to hold onto your hard-earned just a little bit longer.  Having said that, if you're interested in horror games, and the notion of one set in an old Nazi bunker with door-opening aesthetics which bring back vivid flashbacks of Outlast sounds good to you, you may at least wanna keep a close eye on this page.  I'm certainly excited to see the finished version of this game, should it ever get to that stage.  PolyDigital, don't let us down...\n \nVerdict: 6.5/10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441377362, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1441378039, "recommendationid": "17877490", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519290", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441342963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561198020293368", "num_games_owned": 203}, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": "7", "review": "It was pretty good but far to short to be called an early access anything.
