The pixel graphics are just beautiful and the levels are immersive. There are a lot of enemies to kill and as you progress trough the game it gets harder and harder. Sometimes you'll get frustrated and sometimes you'll rage-quit. \nIMO if you're the type of person that likes hardcore games and that would replay a level over and over because of how difficult it is, than this game is for you.\n\nWARNING - achievement hunters you'll have a very hard time, like really hard, seriously.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506450285, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506450285, "recommendationid": "35227407", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505353890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 123, "steamid": "76561197970406584", "num_games_owned": 607}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm honestly not sure whether to recommend Deadbolt or not, so let's line things up and have a look at what we've got.\n\nFirstly, the presentation is AAA. Graphics, music, sound design, writing, all of it, pretty much 10/10 in every single case. The only exceptions are one or two levels where flashing lights and similar obscure what's actually going on which is... again, not optimal.\n\nSecondly, the controls are largely smooth, simple and easy to handle(on some occasions, however, when two interactables are very close to each other, the game can get confused and that can get you killed). By and large if you come out at the bottom of a situation, it was because you hestitated or planned poorly.\n\nThird, though... we've got the level design, which is where things come apart a bit. Despite the game's insistence that there are multiple ways to deal with the various levels, it honestly doesn't feel that way. Rather, a few levels have multiple approaches, but most of them feel like they have one optimal approach, and if you manage to win while deviating from that, it's because you got lucky or exploited AI flaws.\n\nSometimes it's okay, though, because the optimal approach is easy enough to spot, and it's a matter of figuring out the execution. But in a few cases it's like playing a Roberta Williams adventure game where you're trying to figure out the moon logic that the devs employed.\n\nIt's also particularly aggravating in situations where the first 50% of a level is easy caketown that you end up redoing over and over because there's one really miserable difficulty bump right at the mid point.\n\nUltimately what makes me verge on giving this a recommendation rather than not, is the price. If it had cost ANY more, it would've been a clear no. Really feels like the game needed a few more cycles of testing and opinions from testers before release.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505385872, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505385872, "recommendationid": "34946092", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 910, "total_reviews": 951, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_negative": 41}}
