Let me explain why.\n\nHere's what I enjoyed about Gothic 3:\n\n- Freedom of going wherever you want, whenever you want. No quest markers - if they say you \"Far north\", you just go north and think \"Am I far enough? Where's that damn white ripper?\" Also, freedom of doing whatever you want - you can kill an NPC that's needed for some quest, and that will be only your fault\n- Freedom of character development. There are intuitive str/dex/int paths, but you can grab any perks you want\n- Soundtrack, it's just majestic\n- The liberation system. You can liberate towns!\n\nHere's what I can't categorize as good or bad:\n\n- Graphics are okay-ish. Beautiful landscapes, but plastic faces of characters, plastic weapons and armor.\n- There's nothing special about the story\n- The loot system is made in such way that in the beginning you only get crappy things, but the more chests you open, the better your loot\n\nHere's what spoils the fun:\n\n- Bugs. A huge lot of bugs\n- Voice acting is poor and emotionless\n- Almost no armor diversity. Both rebel and orc armors have the same model with a little different colors\n- Melee combat. It goes in two possible ways - either you stunlock the enemy and kill them, or you get stunlocked and killed. Especially dangerous against groups of enemies\n\nIn comparison with Gothic 2:\n\nI can't really explain why, but G2 seemed way more cozy. Characters in G2 had pesonalities, there was way more depth to the whole world, even melee combat was more fun than here. \n\nA couple of advices:\n\nFinish Gothic 1 and 2 before you play Gothic 3. Find and install the community patches for G3 that will spare you a big deal of bugs. Use alternative balancing if you want, but I played without it. You can use a bow to kill enemies from a safe spot since they can't jump, or kite them, or pick them one by one to stunlock and kill with melee. \n\nThis game is a step back from G2, but it isn't as bad as most of the people think."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506629256, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35271034", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198008466592", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1507172150, "num_games_owned": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1889, "playtime_forever": 11342}, "timestamp_updated": 1506629256, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is every bit as good as the trailer is bad."}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504837822, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503270", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34806533", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197994665129", "num_reviews": 49, "last_played": 1504837680, "num_games_owned": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2579}, "timestamp_updated": 1504837822, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The creative side of the development was really well done.
