I played this game from start to end countless times (been playing it since it was released) and every single time I play this game, I manage to find something new.. be it a small scroll to an overpowered weapon that is hidden behind a statue. This game DOES NOT hold your hand and at the beggining the game lets you know that you are weak and cant handle the dangers.. Slowly but surely you become more and more powerfull and instead of dying because you decided to pick up a mushroom that a wolf was guarding, you kill a dragon with 2 spells. This game is a legend, and once you play this game, all other RPGs will look.. not impressive. I recommend to play Gothic 1 before Gothic 2 just to get all the emotions when you meet your old pals from the colony.\n\nCharacters here are remembered be it good or bad, the npc are alive and go about their buisness (working durining the day, and relax at night). Unforgatble world with a very emercive gameplay.\n\nWhen you start you are not this hero that saved the world.. you are a nobody, and everybody will remind you that. You have to plan out your character, scavage all you can find, count up your learning points and gold.. untill you become strong.\n\nTo sum this game up: amazing game. I dont know what else to say about this. Sometimes gets buggy though, but thats why you have Marvin mode lol.."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505488474, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502652", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34974365", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198066479746", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1505488095, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1505488474, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of the best (if not the best) RPGs i have ever played. Back in time G1, G2 were games that i was waiting for, RPGs with complex world and good combat, where if you're very careful and patient (sometimes with help of some gliches :D ), you can beat any enemy even on low level. (almost) Every time I died in this game I knew it was coz i screwed up and not because of some glitch or overpowered enemy that will hit you no matter what you do.\n\n+ Great story.\n+ Fighting system. But of course if you played some recent RPGs like thisone (Witcher, Skyrim...), you might find melee combat a bit complicated.\n+ Characters and quests.\n+ Game is not easy, like most RPGs (i played Skyrim recently and i could just run around the world and wasnt scared at all, since almost nothing could kill me easily. In Gothics, I just went few steps away from castle and got myself fighting group of giant rats that killed me in few seconds).\n\n- game doesnt look so good now, but its from 2002 so...\n- sometimes buggy, but nothing that can seriously damage your game experience. Some bugs even make this game better.\n- Inventory is quite messy (but better than in first Gothic)."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506274217, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497966", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35186555", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075444211", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506275719, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "playtime_forever": 18}, "timestamp_updated": 1506274217, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game and Gothic 1 as well doesnt even run on Windows 10 without a load of community patches and mods.
