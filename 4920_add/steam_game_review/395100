I'm about half way through after 3 hours of play time so it isn't a super long game, but there is a level score that promotes mastery which will keep you busy for hours after completion I'm sure. It's under $8 (two Starbucks coffees) and is a super fun game, buy it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1476534007, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1476534007, "recommendationid": "26047819", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501360", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464046958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561198053953735", "num_games_owned": 139}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm not sure exactly what it is but something about this game is extremely fun.
