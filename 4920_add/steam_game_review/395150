There are many other games that will give you more for your investment. \n\nThat aside, the technical issues are just too plentiful for what is presented to us to be enjoable. \n\n1: The A.I. only has two modes; Potato, and wall-hack. It's a 50 / 50 shot that when you come around a corner a guard will already be shooting at your, or staring at you, oblivious to your existence.\n\n2: The aim down sights is terribly off. The further away from someone you are, the lower you have to aim. Once you get about half a room away (20 or so yards / meters) you have to aim at their belt to get a headshot.\n\n**update** So, the issue isn't as drastic currently, but it's still very off. The current bullets are hitscan instead of raycast, but the hitscan sensor detects AFTER the kick of the gun, instead of before, causing bullets to jump, and causing aim down sights to be off increasingly more as you get further from the enemy.\n\n3: Enemy health seems to be based off their alert status. What would normally take one or two bullets, once an enemy sees you / is attacking you, could take half a clip. I believe this has more to do with the animations. **tentatively seems to be fixed**\n\n4: The animations, or the ones that work, are just broken. Don't believe me? Try picking up a dead guy. The first five seconds of the gameplay where you cycle through crouch, prone, crouch, and standing is just a mess.\n\n5: Picking up dead guys just doesn't work. Out of the 50 test runs I did attempting to pick up a dead body from all different angles, I was successful once. I was then treated to a ballet of terrible animation as the guys ragdol flailed into my shoulder.\n\n6: Picking up stuff / interacting with stuff works about 30% of the time. You have to have a very specific angle to interact with almost everything, and even then it almost never works. You have to reload after every failed attempt to be able to interact with the monitor to set your difficulty. \n\n7: Sound. Literally everything about it.\n\nAll in all, as stated before, this game has some serious potential, but this itteration just feels like a hastily assembled pre-alpha. Neither the stealth, or the first person shooter aspects of this work to any sufficient degree to merit looking at this. Hopefully when the game is ported over to the Unreal Engine 4 most of these issues will be fixes, but as it stands, follow the project, but don't quite put your money on it yet.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450058882, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1459713202, "recommendationid": "19687298", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621017", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440351526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198006071565", "num_games_owned": 164}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 91, "comment_count": "3", "review": "The game isn't much more than a technical demo/proof of concept - but that's perfectly fine and it's fun for what it is.

The level design looks nice, but that's about all I can say positive about this \"game\".\n\nThe character models look like they took a serious turn for the worse.  The AI, when it isn't ice skating around the map is awful (\"adaptive AI...lol what a joke).  ALL of the collision is terrible.  I can't even finish the 1st VR mission (which should take a couple of minutes) because the AI teleports itself around the map with no clear line if sight.  The movement is atrocious. The menu system is garbage (can't even set it to my native resolution), sound sometimes works.  There really is literally nothing here that makes it worth any amount of money, let alone $10.\n\nHere's what this game is: a bunch of art students think they can make a game on their own.  The game they want to make needs mechanics, but there is no programmer in sight.  I make games on UE4 as a hobby and this is simply laughable.  It is evident whoever is doing the game design and coding has no clue as to what they are doing.\n\nNote to the \"developers\": YOU ARE CHARGING MONEY FOR THIS.  This is NOT a game, hell it is not even an remotely an alpha.  Who ever decided to put this on Green Light needs to find a new job.  Let me make this clear... YOU ARE CHARGING MONEY FOR THIS.
