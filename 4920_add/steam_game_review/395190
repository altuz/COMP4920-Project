As a huge LOTR nerd, I did not miss the theme as much as I thought I would - the quality of the game transcends the theme. This adaptation takes the already-minimal fiddily-ness of the the board game and removes the need to manage them yourself. For the card management and interactions between different character abilities, this is especially handy.\n\nAnd it has cross-platform online multiplayer! Always a huge plus.\n\nBuy this game, and then message me for a game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500342806, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500342806, "recommendationid": "33620409", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
