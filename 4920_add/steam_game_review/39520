Reminds me of Patrician series except in this one you have a fairly developped character creation and the buildings can be entered and somewhat visited Walking Simulator Style. It is moody and immersive, with plenty of shadows, medieval music and soft texturing however it drags out the efficiency of management some.  The game seemed to get dropped frames and get choppy especially when scrolling screen. The game is disorienting if you jump right in it and has somewhat of a learning curve. Would probably prioritize many newer a game to try to find a better example of this genre rather than invest time and effort in this for someone who did not play it back in the day."}]}
