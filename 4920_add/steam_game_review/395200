Def. has some clunkiness to it, but that can be part of the charm...\nGame has glitches all over the place (getting stuck in walls trying to regain my body happens a lot) and some of the traps make no sense (why do simple bars knock me over?). The levels that use a 'spotlight' in level design are frustrating as I can't see where I'm going and it just strains my eyes. \n\nOverall, I did enjoy the game, it was short and entertaining for the 5 or so hours I got out of it (including playing the 'ben' levels). I did not feel the want or need to seek out missed canned food as by the time I finished most levels, I was just glad they were over. Also, some of the bonus levels def. did not have the thought put into them like the main levels. The ben levels also suffer from this (like the spotlight maze level...zzzzzzzz). \n\nI would recommend picking this up when it's on sale. Would love to see some other character models as well :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504201945, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504201945, "recommendationid": "34639760", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502632555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 374, "steamid": "76561198162446505", "num_games_owned": 31}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I do not recomend! at first it was fine then shadowing came along and blocked half my screen up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504408822, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504408822, "recommendationid": "34701235", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492082", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503596902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 128, "steamid": "76561198126747386", "num_games_owned": 45}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "i raged so hard i almost broke my headphones\nand almost lost my voice", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503331533, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503331533, "recommendationid": "34397932", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490073", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501525910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 230, "steamid": "76561198116188011", "num_games_owned": 743}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "you will be happier after uninstalling the game and much more if you didn't pay for it\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501603904, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501603904, "recommendationid": "33952190", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483812", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501015119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561198057068149", "num_games_owned": 87}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So I saw one of my favorite streamers playing this, and it looks like a lot of fun.\nBut I can't play for more than a few minutes before the game crashes and shits the bed.\nI'm going to get my money back for this one.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501015302, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501015302, "recommendationid": "33794617", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484884", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501354852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 333, "steamid": "76561197998362518", "num_games_owned": 2357}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game shouldn`t be called Ben and Ed, but Rocky, because the controls \nfloat like a Butterfly and many of the Leveldesign-Choices sting like a Bee.\n\nOr maybe it should be called Trolling Game, since that has to be the\nReason for the Dev`s to make this Game.
