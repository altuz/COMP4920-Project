This wouldn't be a huge issue, if it wasn't so linear, which makes it very frustrating to play it without a walkthrough. And even with one, it is surprisingly tedious as hell!\n\nThe fatman concept could be somewhat interesting, but can't save the whole thing, because the writing is absolutely dreadful (easily some of the worst I've ever seen in a commercial game). There's nothing wrong with the extremely poor voice-acting, because this was absolutely a pretty small amateur project, but you just can't excuse the fact that pretty much all \"jokes\" fall flat and that nothing being said is remotely clever or interesting.\n\nTo put it into a nutshell, just play instead the games it took its inspiration from. It'll be much more rewarding.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492360037, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492360037, "recommendationid": "31181905", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504206", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 4}}
