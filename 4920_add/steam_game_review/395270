If you've played those games, you know what you're in for with this game. Of his walking puzzle narratives, this is probably the prettiest looking one, particularly the opening stage set inside a forest. \n\nUnlike the \"Moon\" saga, A Wolf in Autumn focuses strongly on metaphor. That's not to say the \"Moon\" saga didn't have metaphors in it - it does - but there is a distinct difference between what happens in the Moon saga and this game. I won't say anything more. \n\nI still recommend this game, but of his walking puzzle narratives that cost money, this was probably my least favorite; I think it may have less to do with the story of this game and more to do with the fact that I want more of the \"Moon\" saga storyline. I absolutely love those two games (Moon Sliver; Music Man), and would always love Szymanski doing more stories that are connected to that world. \n\nOn its own merit, A Wolf in Autumn is a good $2 game and still gives food for thought. I think it is less complicated than the Moon saga, which may be a good start for gamers who would like to see a little more of what Szymanski is about if they liked Fingerbones.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501917121, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501917121, "recommendationid": "34032261", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502413", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503673384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 60, "steamid": "76561198121927012", "num_games_owned": 913}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is a pretty unique 1 hour sitting game filled with scary, creepy, and disturbing things.
