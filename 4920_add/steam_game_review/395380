I would consider it a puzzle platformer. You die after one hit, the clue is,  only hazards and enemies kill you. Jumping down a cliff or out of the windows results in the classic labyrinth experience as every border is connected to the level you are playing in. This means that if you go over the border at the right side you appear left, this works with falling, jumping and enemies.\n\nIt has a simple story about creation of life, you were made on the sixth day and got the task to collect all the colored crystals to return color to the world. Progress is achieved through buying the next level with your crystals, as you need every crystal to complete a level its a totally fair system. You just have to figure out how to get every crystal without dying as dying resets the level and what you gathered in it.\n\nThe music is something experimental, slightly reminding me of Corpse Part during a few parts. There is an option to turn the music off, if you dont like it. Upon death you hear a specific phrase that matches the story.\n\nAbout the difficulty, I started at easy and will check out the other difficulty levels later. But so far its relaxing (on easy) and sometimes you have to think shortly to get every crystal.\n\nI brought it because it looks interesting and I wanted to support the small developer.\nFor the asking price its a nice puzzle platformer which I for sure will complete. =)\n\nEDIT: The other reviews mention how the game doesnt start.

The reason why the recommendation is negative is mainly because objectively \"bad\" and \"buggy\", on launch there was an issue where the exe was linked improperly, but such issue has been patched out nicely fast too, to be honest. With little polishing, I would imagine that I would very gladly change the \"not recommended\" tag, if I feel that the game gets polished slightly around the corners.\n\nAs for the game itself, I find the game good in design, but bad in the quality of execution. The latter I will cover first:\n\nAs said, runing the game may be rather finnique, but not impossible, and the game is riddeled with bugs: The player character does not have an idle sprite facing left, the options are not options but a help screen (as in you can't change anything), the music does not stay off when it's turned off, but rather stops or starts by toggling the music on and off (because of wich I also noticed that screenshots from the game are not fullscreen, but cropped to top left corner). Also the jump is bound to W, Arrow up and Space, but as there are three keys for jusmping (no options = no rebinding), the space is the only key that works on these \"Jump boosters\". This is partially even game breaking, as every once and a while these boosters are set up as a form of obstacle, but can be circumvented by jumping normally by NOT using space as a jump key. And to add insult to injury, the moving platforms (that are of plenty) do not move (except downwards) while you're on them.\n\nThat all said, the hitboxes are consistent, the screenwarping is surprisingly fresh mechanic (in terms of game design) for something that has been around since joust at last, and while the movement does not have any momentum, the controls are tight enough. Added that with nicely casual puzzle levels, and simple mechanics that don't need a tutorial, the game is surprisingly good in design. It feels as if it was made in Games Factory (The predecessor of Multimedia Fusion), but with more care that most put in their god awful unity games.\n\n[EDIT]: Few oversights I forgot to mention; While the levels are properly designed, sometimes there is a situation where an enemy is positioned next to the level start so that it kills the unexpecting player rather surprisingly, and the shooting patterns that there are seem to be random which, in terms of game design, makes playing te game unneccessarily inconsistent, and adds random deaths especially as the shooting entities does not have any tell of when they're shooting.\n\n[EDIT2]: Updated a bug that was fixed, but left description of it for \"archival reasons\". +1 for developer for acting fast on fixing issues on that.\n\nTL;DR: If you're reading this because you want easy and simple working game, you shouldn't get the game, but if you know what you're getting in to, go ahead.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440449806, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440453174, "recommendationid": "17699640", "language": "english", "votes_down": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505587", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498680107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 453, "steamid": "76561197994936296", "num_games_owned": 604}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a bit of a mixed bag.
