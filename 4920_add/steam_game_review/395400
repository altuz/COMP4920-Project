Oh and take this maid she wants some.\"\n\n\n- after  killing the first bandit that is a weakling  with 5 hp ( heroes have 70 hp and two shot him. I bet he hoped he had used a BOW )...then they run in  to two more bandits.\n\nrandom cadet guy and maid \"oh no we can't beat two bandits we must surrender and get trapped in cell\"\n\n\n.. that's where I signed out from this bullshit. The npc's actually SAY all that, wording is different of course, I took some ragetistic liberties of impression.\n\n\nCons : Everything exept the world map, and perhaps music when it does play.\n\nPros: world map is nice, the map drawer is the  reason I am not asking for a refund, I hope they use my 5 euroes to buy him more coffee.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441492426, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441493249, "recommendationid": "17902056", "language": "english", "votes_down": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567610", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453367630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 705, "steamid": "76561198099549439", "num_games_owned": 108}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 32, "comment_count": "1", "review": "PROS: It was on sale?\n\nCONS: I still had to pay for it...\n\nSeriously:\n\nThe story makes little sense.\n\nThe characters make even less sense.\n\nThere is way too much dialogue that mentions things from the real world (as jokes) but takes away from the game rather than adding to it.\n\nThe 'pathing' is annoying at best with some stairs being unusable for no apparent reason, the ability to skip large  sections of maps because you can just walk out of bounds, walls that you can walk into just because the is an object placed there, a bridge that can only be taken in one direction (again, no apparent reason) and a world map that suffers some of the previous problems.\n\nAnd their constant misuse of the word then when they really meant than (every freakin' time!).\n\n\nThis game is not worth buying.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441597830, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441597830, "recommendationid": "17922596", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534995", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464154602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 386, "steamid": "76561198011832829", "num_games_owned": 561}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I checked the earlier reviews, and the pathing and terrain issues have been talked about quite a bit. The way you can walk into some walls, walk out of bounds in many areas, that weird one-way bridge. Not to mention there are a number of rooms(usually off to the side) that you might miss altogether if you're not paying careful attention, and the occasional doorway that throws up a message(in Portuguese? Spanish?) when you try to enter it. It's just weird and makes everything feel incomplete, like whoever made this was in a big hurry.\n\nSo I'll add something new that I didn't see mentioned yet -- the broken \"sick girl\" quest. Pretty early in the game(maybe 2 to 4 hours in, depending on how fast you play), there's a side quest that's triggered by talking to a man who appears after you investigate a \"rat infestation\" in the sewers that ends up revealing a poisoning attempt. You'll see him on your way to the palace to talk to the Queen. He directs you to a house in the same district as the sewer entrance, and you'll find a bed-ridden girl with a doctor and another person(her mother?). They say it's terminal, and send you to get the priest to give her last rites. If you haven't talked to the Queen, you can't enter that area of town yet. So you talk to the Queen. Now you can enter the area, but . . . the priest isn't in the church! So you continue with the next story quest, come back, and go back to the church.\n\nThe priest is now there! As are a couple of his assistants. None of them do anything when you talk to them. No mention of the dying little girl. Nothing.\nThe man who started this entire quest is still giving his spiel about how he hopes the little girl will make it.\nIf you visit her house, the little girl is walking around just fine! She's talking about how she feels kinda sick, but she's not bedridden or anything.\nThe doctor is back at his place a couple houses east of your character's house.\n. . . congratulations, because you talked to an NPC when he appeared instead of psychically knowing that you should wait(I assume) until after certain other events, the quest is broken!\n\nI also have another complaint. Compared to the pathing/terrain issues and at least 1 broken quest early on, it might seem minor, but . . . the game is slow! Walking is slow, with no dash feature available. You can't disable battle animations, and they are really slow too. Screen transitions are annoyingly slow(and annoyingly common), which there's no excuse for in a game that's just a step or 2 above SNES quality in terms of graphics and sound. I've played a number of RPGMaker games, so I know that RPGMaker has tools to deal with most(if not all) of these.

The dialogue has no spark, the story telling is boring and game is extremely slow- paced. There is no dash button to use as in other games. Some of  the side quest do not activate, some do not show up in the mission log and some are still shown even after they have been done. Very frustrating. Glitches very noticable are the fact you can walk through walls, over buildings etc and this becomes very annoying to say the least. Considering that this is a very old game, it would have been nice for the Dev to make sure it was free of all bugs. Also the ending says that there will be a continuation but that has never happened.
