And the screenshots showed the game as at least a pleasant one to look at. But once you get in, the game has a very basic \"Unity\" look. All music used is just roalty free tracks by Kevin MacLeod, which sounds so excruciatingly mediocre, at least to me. All voices are just basic voice synths that are easily recognised, because the same ones are used all over the internet. Coupled with the moment in the game, where you're supposed to be seeing a planet in the distance. But because the Unity's skybox is so small, it just looks like a big ball, floating just outside the window. All that makes the game feel incredibly lazily and effortlessly made. I understand that this game was made by just one person, and maybe he put more effort into the story. But I personally just couldn't stand everything else. Even with an 80% discount, I feel cheated giving any money for a game like this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500369016, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500369016, "recommendationid": "33625872", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508343", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499808804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 206, "steamid": "76561197993647588", "num_games_owned": 190}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An exploration type game that sees you as an investigator raking through an empty mining ship to try and work out what happened to the crew. It looks pretty nice and the atmosphere of the abandoned ship is palpable but that's about all the game gets right sadly. The puzzles are barely worthy of the name (find keycard in one room and put it in the keycard slot elsewhere) and are only made at all difficult by the darkness of certain sections of the game making pickups hard to find. It would still be, and sort of was, a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours if not for a load of amateur mistakes increasing the general frustration of the experience. To wit:\n[list]\n[*] The voice acting of your companion AI is just a blatant text-to-speech transcript which sounds terrible. The other AI in the game is given a genuine human voice so this is an odd choice.\n[*] There are no save points at all so you need to either completely finish a chapter or you're starting it again. They're short enough once you work out what you need to do but if you miss something you can be hunting around for a while. Also, there are a couple of instant death sections so you end up genuinely scared of dying purely because it means redoing a load of stuff.\n[*] Any option changes (e.g. inverting Y) are thrown away whenever you die or start a new chapter which is fucking stupid. This is made worse by the fact that you can do everything in the game with a control pad except enter/leave the pause menu. Grrr.\n[*] The controls are never mentioned or explained. In the case of jump, use, etc that's not a massive problem but there's a run button hidden on one of the bumpers and some of the platformy bits absolutely required that to work. I spent no small amount of time repeatedly trying a jump because I could get really close so I thought it doable and just finicky. Only eventually did I stumble across the run button and then battered that whole section in my next attempt. There's even a Steam review with someone complaining about being stuck because they can't make a jump, which would be amusing if it wasn't so unnecessary.[/list]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499950036, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499950036, "recommendationid": "33502500", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503461", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 8}}
