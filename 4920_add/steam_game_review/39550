I really do. Spellforce one was a work of art (played it to death on my non-steam copy) and I want to like part two as well. So what are the gripes about this particular game? In no particular order:\n\n- The gameplay is just a bit meh. Especially the add-on is quite poor in its priorities, and pathfinding is tremendously stupid.\n- Characterization of the world is meh. The clans get an interesting character in the Iron Lord, but all in all all the groups fail to leave any lasting impression and fail to inspire any empathy. The characters are quite wooden as well.\n- The sidequests feel unrewarding. You sometimes get a cool item, but generally there is no warning what kind of item you'll get and generally you'll not have the right build to use it on your main, and that's the character that'll get high enough level to use the item. Where are the cool quest to build something interesting, or find the parts of a cool bit of gear in an interesting way? (Once again, the clans do this least bad.)\nThe builds are generally just a bit too boring. Hybrid characters are kinda weak, a full combat main gets boring due to a lack of mana to properly use all your combat tricks, and mages lack interesting choices in spells. Credit where credit is due: mental magic works better there then in part one of the series.\n\nAll in all, I found myself disappointed at all turns. Can't recommend picking this up."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503773364, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502239", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34511846", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "5", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031013976", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1507078766, "num_games_owned": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "playtime_forever": 331}, "timestamp_updated": 1503773364, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Do not buy if using windows 10.

For all you gamers out there classified as young going on thirty like me who grew up playing Age of empires and Warcraft II you should definitely take the time to pick it up. Not unlike Warcraft III with a dumbed down RTS side and expanded RPG system. If you understand anything of what I just said then what you're imagining this game as is most likely exactly what it is. While being a combination of my two favorite genre's, the only real negative is that it doesn't do anything exceptional gameplay wise so extended play sessions can become boring to the point whatever HGTV show your wife/girlfriend is watching starts to win your attention(sigh). A few months ago the graphical features would have been a potential negative, but with the release of the anniversary edition this has totally been rectified with full 1080p and graphics that are shockingly good relative to the vanilla and all things considered.  Bottom line, the anniversary edition is worth every bit of $15, if you can get it on sale then by all means, but if you enjoy RTS' and or RPG's then like me when you play it you'll be pleasantly surprised and wonder why you hadn't heard of it prior.."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503029220, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491404", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34320506", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198323778423", "num_reviews": 39, "last_played": 1502654345, "num_games_owned": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2635}, "timestamp_updated": 1503029241, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1]Fourth four hours into the Game and I have seen so far only half of what SpellForce 2 \u2013 Shadow Wars does offer while at the same time not even once touched SpellForce 2 \u2013 Dragon Storm which is too included with the SpellForce 2 - Anniversary Edition yet at all.[/h1]\n\nThis is one of those old school games that your friends probably talk about when they talk about Games they want to finish some day when they retire or win in the lottery or something equal to it and afterwards have enough time to dig into it.\n\nIf this wouldn`t be already my second try to play through the Game (I got it back then when it still was printed on a disk and was protected by [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarForce]StarForce[/url] the first time) I would probably be complete blown up by the sheer size of the Game.\n\nThis Game is not only huge if it comes to it's feature list but too if it comes to the Gameplay Length and nothing of it seem to be stretched or phoney done to make the Game longer then it actually is.\n\nIt`s almost like back in 2006 someone tried to create an Offline Roleplaying Action Game with some RTS (Real Time Strategy) Parts and went full bonkers if it comes to the among of Story & Side Quests that sometimes keep you busy for hours if you let it happen while you travel through the Game before you finish it and afterwards ask yourself how they manage it to don`t make it boring at all.\n\n[h1]This is one of those Games that doesn't seem to end at all and each time you visit a new Island those seem to expand in a way where you sometimes get almost overwhelmed..[/h1]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=970703078\n\nI won`t even try to waste your time with talking about how decent the story is since compared to any other me knowing Game out there that at least cover up one of the two genre SpellForce 2 \u2013 Shadow Wars have seem to have delivered long before Blizzard put the Genre with StarCraft II to the next level and showed how to create a decent storyline in an RTS after Command & Conquer had left everyone for years struggling.\n\nWhile this is said I have to make sure to mention too that the RTS Part in SpellForce 2 \u2013 Shadow is not very demanding at all and if you have digged yourself through every RTS Game out there that you might not get the most out of the Game if you mainly buy it for this part of the Game.\n\nSpellForce 2 \u2013 Shadow does cover up the basic gameplay mechanics that were back in 2006 on the RTS market by then already well known without moving the genre to the next level. Also some of the Roleplaying Action Game Parts do too kick into the RTS I wouldn`t call it hard to master at all.\n\nSo in the end SpellForce 2 \u2013 Shadow does offer a pretty decent RTS that does come at the same time with a pretty decent Roleplaying Action Game too. Not bad at all in my eyes.\n\n[h1]I know this sound awesome and you probably by now want to go straight to the Steam Store and buy the Game but let me tell you now what`s still wrong with the Game after all those years...[/h1]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=970701806\n\nThere are still a handful of Bugs/Glitches in the Game that will make you from time to time wonder why those still weren't fixed at all. Crashes straight to the Desktop, Glitches where the Map didn't show up as it should be, Quest that I had to repeat since a Trigger clearly were not triggered on the Map and therefor i had to repeat a Mission.\n\nMake sure you save your Game. A lot. I would even go as far as to say that you should save your current Game on a different slot every 30. Minutes and work with three different Slots so you loose in the worst case around half an hour of Gameplay.\n\nTo make it worse i had similar issues with the Game over eleven years ago too so it seems that since then nobody took the time to fix those Bugs/Glitches at all. This is probably one of the biggest issues I had with the Game and that kinda is one of the reasons that does prevent me from saying that the Game is a must-buy and played at least once in your lifetime Video Game.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=970701013\n\nI had really a hard time to don`t rate this Game with just a very strong Thumbs Up but some of the issues i had encountered through my current playthrough made me kinda hold back my fanboy praising of the Game in the end and I can`t really repeat myself enough if it comes to the saving part in the Game. Save your Game a lot on a regular base in the Game or otherwise you will regret it as much as i did since you will encounter crashes during moments where it will hunt you in your dreams if you won't do it and you will loose a lot of time by that.\n\nBesides that issue that is a huge pain in the ass I can't recommend this Game enough if you are looking for a Video Game that is half Action Roleplay and half RTS Game with a very long and very decent Story. Therefor in the end I'm still giving out a..\n\n[i][b]Thumbs Up[/b][/i]\n\nThat\u00b4s it.

It is still great, just like when I bought it when it first came out...Spellforce 2 not so much.  2.5 hrs in I die, because I missed stopping a skeleton sending a warning and have to start the mission from scratch.  They should have continued with the rune warrior concept, this new way of progressing just isn't as rich.  I'm not a fan and I'm not going to sink another hour into this game.  I have my doubts for spellforce 3 unless they dust off the original and use that concept.   I do like the progression system better in spellforce 2, but combat I found not engaging and too difficult to really use abilities effectively.   Would not recommend."}]}
