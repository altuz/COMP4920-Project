It felt short but that's perhaps due to the ability to continue forever on your highest stage completed after losing all of your lives. If they took that out it would be just like Contra or Super C for Nintendo.\n\nIt is my favorite game as a child. So glad someone thought about remaking an updated graphics version for the modern age.\n\nIf they made DLC for this to double the game length with new bosses, levels, aliens - I would definitely buy it.
