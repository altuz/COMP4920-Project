As it is, the game is a pretty fun goldberg machine type puzzle game thing. But it is also a very lazy port from mobile. It's pretty much the exact same game as mobile but you are paying double for it. There's no optimization for the swap to mouse and keyboard so everything feels a bit clunky since they were meant for touch and drag. \n\nOptions: almost non-existent, you can reset the game and turn music on and off. Sound effects stay on no matter what and you have to use the windows shortcut to get it out of fullscreen which is annoying.\n\nThe game itself: Standard, not really a new concept. It works fairly well for the most part and is really adorable. Puzzles start off simple and as you progress more stuff gets thrown into the mix and makes things more complicated. \"Multiplayer\" is useless. It's not so much multiplayer as a level creator and sharing levels. The issue is it lacks an actual workshop, the only way to play other people's levels is to add them into your in-game friends making the level creator worthless if you don't have friends playing this on their pcs or phones. \n\nConclusions: I like the game honestly but get it on mobile, or at least try it on mobile because you get the first 14 levels for free. I don't really feel like paying double for a lazy port on pc is worth it at all.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444152808, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444155970, "recommendationid": "18357272", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508550", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501838190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4626, "steamid": "76561198001242704", "num_games_owned": 532}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a nice puzzle game, very charming (graphics and musics).

Good job devs, here :)\n\nIt's a port from a tablet, and it shows in the chapter selection (but once in the game there\u2019s no other mouse problem). There's no option either... it's not really a problem, but it's still sad.\n\nBe warned that the physics engine is a bit random for some reasons. I don't know why, but it's a fact that playing the same puzzle again, doing exactly the same things as before, may have a butterfly effect : there's a little thing that is not exactly like before, and the differences then just goes bigger and bigger. Well... the positive thing is that the game was made with this particularity in mind, and therefore solutions DON'T ask you to place an object at exactly a specific pixel.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game, fun, and addictive, especially for children of course.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449093427, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449093427, "recommendationid": "19446722", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500630", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449676727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 217, "steamid": "76561198119978955", "num_games_owned": 1077}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Cute little alternative to Contraption Maker. \n\nThis game I would recommend for kids of preschool age.\nAnimations and graphics are lowely and puzzles are pretty straight and simple.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449810005, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449810005, "recommendationid": "19625100", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496607", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
