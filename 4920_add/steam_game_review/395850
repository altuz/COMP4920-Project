Do you know how bad I want to be a bear? It's way better than being a human. Bears don't pay rent, bears take what they want, and leave no prisoners. There's only one thing in life to fear, and that's bears... but bears can't be afraid of bears, cause THEY ARE BEARS. \n\nThis game is visual stunning, I imagine, I don't know how bear eyes work, so I'm assuming this game is 1000% accurate in terms of bear optics. The gameplay is just how you'd want it. \n\nSmack a duck, eat a duck.\nSmack a rabbit, eat a rabbit.\nSmack a wolf, die horribly.\nClassic.\n\nAll in all, I give Bear Simulator a 1/1 because bears don't know how to count, but if they could, they'd give this game the best score possible.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505792339, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505792339, "recommendationid": "35057316", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501893", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 121, "total_reviews": 144, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 23}}
