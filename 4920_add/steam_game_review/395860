The genre doesn't allow for a great deal of variety, and most of them usually play like the developer has made a Waldo puzzle more difficult for the sake of it. As such I would never willingly go out of my way to buy and play one. I'm still not sure how this game found its way into my library, but I'm glad it did.\n\nThis game isn't as difficult as other Hidden Object games and has a far superior storyline to match it, which might just keep you going when you've been staring for 5 minutes and just can't find that last stamp part. Pretty visually impressive too, and the kind of addicting where you finish the game and realise you've spent hours beating the game in a single sitting.\n\nHighly recommended.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506256629, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506256629, "recommendationid": "35179706", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 29, "total_reviews": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
