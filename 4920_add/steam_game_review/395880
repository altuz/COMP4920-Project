If you want to stare out in nothingness and enjoy the horizon, this does what it promises. As far as watching videos, it'd be nice if you could link to Netflix, or at the very least watch your own video files. But having a way to watch YouTube in VR is nice if you're okay paying $5 for it.\n\nThe app isn't bad in that it gives you what it says it will and does it admirably.

Certainly the best Youtube app I ever experience.  You got a HUGE screen size in front of you and you can be seated or standing up if you prefer.  You can reset your position.  The quality of the videos is impressive.  The navigation of the menus is ABSOLUTELY without a doubt my favorite things about the app, utilizing the controller's inputs to its best.  The laser pointer makes thing easy.  The back button, scrolling and a simple button to make the UI disappeared....everything about the app seems to be designed and giving a great deal of thought.  If i design my own Youtube app, I envisioned that I would have done the same thing with the UI.  It's very intuitive to use and very friendly.  Now, I love the little cabin...it sets a tone for relaxation. The fire and the ambient noise is pretty cool.  The texture quality of the cabin and the objects look very realistic.  I absolutely have no negative to say about this app.\n\nI hope they add more environments in the future though.  Maybe a beach setting with people walking by? Birds flying? Beautiful girls?  A living room environment?  A theater environment?  Also, I would like to request to be able to watch Netflix on it.  Youtube and Netflix is all I need...and maybe your own personal videos from the PC.
