It was the most fun I had after a really long time my friends in a semi arcadish game. This totally reminds me of the arcade game tank. Lovely visuals & animations. totally fun with more players online! I would totally recommend this game!! This only issue i thought were the points mentioned below.\n1) It would be nice if you could tell be the right click was a switch weapon button and I had to fire with my primary button. (It took me a while to figure it out).\n2) I want to PLAY this game more... But if therea re no friends i cant play it. =( ... If you could add a challenge mode or something I can play and improve my skills when my friends are not around will be excellent!!\nIf these 2 are addressed I would be super happy and give you 10/10!!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494928540, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1494928540, "recommendationid": "31784139", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499633", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504508373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4499, "steamid": "76561198279942876", "num_games_owned": 29}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1]Worth Playing[/h1]\n\nI have played this from closed Beta till now and the game has improved.
