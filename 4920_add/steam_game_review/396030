I honestly could not see how they could improve on the 3D experience. The depth and scaling of the scenes really make it pop, and it gives a quite beautiful landscape (think James Cameron Avatar fluorescent night scene type coloring and style). I received almost 0 ill effects from this game (an 8 hours session in half life 2 gives me a pretty bad headache). The game is fun and you can kill time in it pretty quickly without even realizing.  It\u2019s also nice that they allow you to control yourself with both your headset and a keyboard, as they give completely different experiences.\n\nHowever, the game definitely needs some tweaking in a few areas.\n#1 The random generators can be completely unfair. I once made a perfect run on a track in hard mode, and still lost 30 seconds. Kind of ruins the fun of a game when you are constantly put in unwinnable scenarios.\n#2 Starting in hard mode, you get a bowling ball type obstacle. This obstacle can also make the game completely unfair. For example, you\u2019re coming up on a 5-protein chain, but have the bowling balls before it. They are not likely to make it through to the red walls. I cannot find a sure way to hit the balls to guarantee at least 1 will get through.\n#3 Sometimes the vertical climbs can be just a bit too steep, and the red walls come up so quickly, there is literally no time to make a guaranteed dodge, leaving it up to luck.\n\nAlthough, I\u2019m sure these problems can be fixed without having to make any large changes to the codebase, so I expect the authors will be able to get this right some point soon (\u201cA Story About My Uncle\u201d being a great example of early-access developers listening to the fans on gameplay tweaking :-) ).
