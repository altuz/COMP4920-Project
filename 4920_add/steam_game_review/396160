Although it screams potential, this game is obviously unfinished and abandoned by its developer.\n\n[h1][i]Secret of Magia[/i], an unfinished product[/h1]\n\nI mean it when I say [i]Secret of Magia[/i] shows a lot of potential. It seems like a great [b]basis[/b] for a solid old-school RPG, if only someone would have finished it\u2026\n\nTo clarify, some examples of unfinished aspects of this game:\n\n[list]\n[*] There's no story. At the start of the game, you get three lines of dialogue informing you that you need to get your hands on four 'elements'. When you do, you get a message reading 'Well done' and you're returned to the main menu. That's all the story [i]Secret of Magia[/i] contains, really.\n\n[*] There's a magic system but the game only contains two magic spells. And although the enemies scale with your level, both magic spells [b]don't scale[/b] so they quickly become useless.\n\n[*] You need to choose a class for your character but are offered no information whatsoever on the pros and cons of each class. I looked it up. Turns out your class determines how much HP versus MP you receive when leveling up. Makes sense, but like I said the magic system is as good as absent, making MP-focused classes a bad choice. The only other thing your class determines is which weapons you can use. Fair enough, but the best weapons in the game can be wielded by any class, so that kind of beats the purpose of the classes altogether then.\n\n[*] NPCs refer to 'your party' and there are options in the game's menus that clearly hint to a party, but you never get a companion or a party. You'll play the whole game with one single character until the end.\n\n[*] There are some shops in the starting town, where you can buy basic gear, but there are no more shops after that. So money becomes obsolete soon after the starting town.\n\n[*] The game has a crafting system but it's clearly unfinished. You can craft some decent starting gear and that's it. You can also brew potions but it's much easier to buy them in the starting town and like I said, money is worthless anyway. Crafting gear or brewing potions makes you level up a skill connected to those activities, but there is no advantage to gaining levels in those skills. You don't get to make better equipment or anything, it's just an unfinished feature.\n\n[*] In the beginning of the game, there's a tutorial teaching you about 'the lantern', but the lantern isn't used anymore after that point. They also teach you about a grappling hook to cross chasms and such, but it's almost never used again after that.\n\n[*] In the game's menu, there are literally options that don't work as those options were never implemented, for example a 'pocket watch'. \n\n[*] You come across several locations that were clearly supposed to be involved in a quest as you find elaborate instructions on how to use the equipment there, but there never is any use for them.\n[/list]\n\nOn top of that, there are plenty of scripting bugs in the game, especially walls and such that aren't marked as 'impassable' so you can just walk through solid objects like that. In one case you enter an inn in one town and when you leave, you find yourself at the inn in another town!\n\n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n\n[i]Secret of Magia[/i] has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.\n\nThe 5 Steam Achievements seem to be thrown in for good measure (well, to get the label 'Steam Achievements', more likely). Example: the first 'quest' you get is to enter the town well. The first achievement is called 'Into the well' and has the following description: \"You found the well where you discover your powers\". But the achievement is granted only when you select 'No' when prompted 'Do you want to enter the well?'. \n\nThe rest of the achievements consist of trivial 'tasks'. The two most laughable are 'sleep at an inn' and 'get healed at a church', especially because they don't work at the first inn and the first church you encounter. This makes you think the achievements are bugged and not bother with them anymore, unless you read a guide that tells you otherwise.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502047608, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502109963, "recommendationid": "34067080", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544027", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500215137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561198216338543", "num_games_owned": 211}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Poorly executed game :/ \n\nYou just do a bunch of quests and a few boss fights.
