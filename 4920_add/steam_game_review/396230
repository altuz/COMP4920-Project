It feels far to abstract and pulp sci-fi for my liking. The terms he uses, the world building he has done... it just dosnt work for me. I loved the hero rise series 'a lot', but this new project by Zach is just... well its disappointing.\n\nStory wise its no inspiring at all, and the romance's are simply handed to you, you dont earn them. Far to many muti page narrative dumps, with few choices in between. The whole thing feels padded... with little progress being made. It dosnt feel like anything special happens because my character is one thing or another... at least nothing substantial.\n\nThe mechanics for this project are more complex then hero rise, but I don't feel thats a good thing in this case. The stats are presented more as a puzzle for achievement's then as a representation of character development.\n\nThe fact this project was designed specificity to run in series has greatly detracted from the quality as it doesn't feel like a complete story has been told... just the beginning. There is no clear beginning, middle, or end... just a beginning, middle, and to be continued. There was no clean or clear cut achievement the main character accomplished to make a conclusion to this first 'chapter'. It just seemed like \"Well that seem a good place to stop, time to work one book two.\".\n\nMaybe I'm judging this project to harshly based on Zach's past work, but this one has left me disappointed and uninspired. In fact I ended up only lightly skimming and speeding through the final chapter since I had lost so much interest in the choices I was presented. It just didn't feel satisfying.\n\nTake my opinion with a gain of salt though... this story just wasn't my 'thing'. That doesn't mean it won't be yours.

The Mysterious Alien Being is shown as transgender for no reason at all, with all the pronouns (Hir, Ze etc.) when NOTHING indicates its gender or lack thereof (based off a single short encounter)! We get to know that the main protagonist had \"freedom to experience their sexuality without restricting gender roles\", that's very profound I think, but boring to mention. I'm to play a game, not entertain in gender studies, thank you. The number of remarks about gender is staggering and off-putting. That's too heavy handed.\n\nPlot... revolves around biggest cliches in SciFi ever. Defend your world from aliens, ok. Standard, but sensible. Go to a planet that holds a mysterious mortal combat tournament between Good and Evil where contestants are from all the galaxy. Now, this is cliche, contrived and childish. There was an old He-Man episode with a similar plot, and it was done better. This is the laziest SF cliche of them all, that allows you to show many alien species and interactions between them without all that pesky world building. Including a map of the planet Versus at one point was a mistake, since the locations made me cringe - single castle, single forest, single range of mountains, single love lake in a shape of a heart... I've read Polish communist children books with better maps than that when I was 8. Either make a good map or no map at all. \n\nWe have flashbacks within flashbacks, game mechanics many times rammed in our face, and later, a wonderful option of buying a cheating DLC, forced on us during the actual game in a dialog. Hint: things like that ruin the immersion a bit. Had I wanted to by the DLC I would, now please gently let me play the game I've already bought.\n\nI've enjoyed Choice of the Deathless, Hero of Kendrickstone, Choice of Robots and other games from the same studio.  They had good plot or interesting scenery or great character development and often all of those. This one has gender studies instead, and a silly map suited for a children fairy tale, not a SciFi story. And I enjoy GOOD children fairy tales, mind you, but don't you think profound mentions of \"sexual experiences not restricted by gender roles\" doesn't fit that? Must I tell the author such basics of storytelling, keeping a consistent tone?\n\nTl;dr; Weak and uninspired, avoid.

As others have pointed out, the worldbuilding seemed hamfisted and awkward, the delivery of the made-up words like \"blerg\" and \"furking\" was anything but seamless (sadly, this problem never improved) and there were tons and tons of exposition drops about stuff that, to be quite frank, I simply didn't care about.  \n\nWith those complaints being noted, however, I did find myself enjoying this a lot more during the second half.  The characters began to grow on me, the writer doing a pretty good job fleshing them out in the end, and I actually enjoyed the political intrigue (despite the narrative hammering in exactly what sort of effects your decisions will have).  The writing also seemed to improve as the story went on, though I may have just gotten used to it.  I only wish the worldbuilding could have been more interesting; to improve as the characters did over time -- though, there were some cool aspects of it that caught my interest near the end.  I'm hopeful the writer will follow up on those and build upon them in future installments.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy myself with this, but take my \"recommendation\" with a grain of salt.

The game's premise included stealing powers and invading thoughts, but in practice that felt lackluster. There were very few powers to absorb and they didn't feel like I'd gained anything when I did it. In fact it led to 'memorywalking' which led me on a story within a story, rather than the one I bought. A story within a story I had a hard time caring for because it was told as a dream rather than your action. In a dream I wasn't a person crafting or even participating in a story. I felt like someone viewing someone else's story. In fact even the story outside of the dream felt that way, being tugged along by other characters. Your character didn't feel like he gained anything from his power to absorb, he starts with the power to shoot lazers of all things. He is an alien, and that made it harder for me to like him, especially when him and everyone else because his writing involved so many new words and lingo and ideals that I didn't really connect with. The choices in the game didn't feel like they mattered; even my characters body and gender and even my name felt ignored. I believe my character was called Princy more often than the name I gave him and by my characters in game pet as that. The pet is something I didn't get to choose anything about, and in the middle of the game i was prompted to pay a dollar for DLC so it could give me hints.

I found the story to be engaging with the world explained well when the story deemed it necessary. Some of the complaints I have seen mentioned the lack of explanations but I will say that none of the information is actually lacking but provided over the course of the story and in amounts that add to the story and not needlessly side-track you with overinformation. Long story short, the story approaches a lot of topics, one of the biggest being self-understanding and reflection (at least in my perspective) and while I don't want to touch on the others because spoilers, I want to say that it does so in a very open but not obtrusive manner. Some consider it a bit too pushy on certain topics but, again, I think it makes sense within both the story itself as well as the day and age we live in.\nAs for the \"made up\" words, I found them to actually add to the story. The vast majority made sense and most of them added to the descriptions of their various owners. Also, they are almost all names and some being adjectives. They were worked very well into the story and descriptions and I never found myself confused by any of it. My one objection to the wording are the blergs. They're meant to susbstitute the words we'd normally use to describe frustration or anger (think damn or the more colorful companion). I found them way overused and at times distracting, especially since they didn't flow very well into my own reading process.\nThe choices seemed much more significant than in the author's previous titles (namely Heroes Rise: The Prodigy). They have the feeling of importance and impact and each one give off a sense of uniquenss. The story seems to be much more affected by these choices and some of the choices I found to be quite hard to make.\nThe romances seem much better integrated and seem to flow very well from character to character. There have been complaints that they seemed to be handed down but I disagree. Think of it this way. You meet someone of the gender (or whatever) you're interested in who happens to be good looking. You might think that you might want something more than just a friend and might ask that person out. Conversely you could not. That's how I feel the interest works in a sense. Either you're interested in more than just knowing the person (when you meet that person) or you're not and you could be friendly, indifferent or outright hostile. I think it works well within a more carnal, lusty type of deal, at least at the beginning. There are a couple of points that I found forced, but I'd rather not go into those for the sake of spoilers. At the same time they made sense to me due to the circumstances and natures of the characters (or at least to-that-point know nature of the characters)\nThe last thing some complaints have touched on was the seeming needless gender fluidity. While I find the pronouns for the gender-neutral...gender?...a bit distracting, they're the same as the ones seen in Heroes Rise and again they actually make sense, if they are a bit hard to get adjusted to at first. Some compliants have suggested that the entire issue is over-long and forced but I think in a story that is quite vocal toward self-understanding and reflection, the way this is presented might make one ponder their own beliefs about such things. There is a lot of pondering that could result from this story, especially as it touches on many great topics (in my opinion of course).\nOverall, it's a great interactive novel that I would very readily recommend. Great story, great characters and a very good setting as well as very interesting topics and execution.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440456424, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440456424, "recommendationid": "17700938", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503838", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468739339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1437, "steamid": "76561197972029352", "num_games_owned": 552}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is one of the most ineptly written things I have ever read.

It starts with a cold opening filled with nonsense terms and jargon, then proceeds into a flashback having told you nothing about the story, world or characters.\n\nThe game is littered with invented words and terminology that are closer to a child\u2019s attempts to pronounce words they misheard, than they are to phrases a living culture would develop. Cluttered with pseudo-English as if changing a vowel would adequately express how alien and new these things and concepts are meant to be. This problem is then exacerbated by the authors insistence on using the relatively unknown gender neutral pronouns Ze / Hir, incorrectly I might add seeing as their used in reference to a characters physical sex as well their completely unknown (as in our characters merely assume this) gender.\n\nIt then proceeds to brush off the magnitude of an alien landscape with our characters (who early on express their desire to see the world beyond their narrow horizons, having never before travelled the stars) strolling into alien buildings, habitats and situations as if they were down at the market buying vegetables. Should we not be amazed at this, and there by proxy, we the reader/player feel some sense of imaginative thrill?\n\nBut the crowning achievement on this monolith of unpleasantness is the unfolding character interactions. For you see, I had the Gall, the Nerve to try to play as a morally honest character who was also rebellious! The scandal, every time I picked an option that was deemed \"honest\" (by the author flagging that as the \"honest\" choice) I was immediately informed by the game that I was doing it wrong. For you see I the player am a mere spectator, how dare I try to impose my narrative on the writers scenario.\n\nThe reason for this was that as a morally honest character, I was opposed to the blatantly evil feudal lords set up as the early adversary. I selected a character goal of disbanding this corrupt organisation, picturing my character as a being who held all lives as equal and worthy. But this goal (the game later informed me) required me to support certain characters, and believe in subterfuge and dishonesty. \n\nWhich was why my character was chastised by the game (not a character, a meta-narrative construct) for daring to challenge another character who was attempting to trick someone who trusted them, into dying for them. A character literally described as a God, was trying to trick their loyal subjects into fighting a pointless battle they couldn't win, by lying to them. What was a morally upstanding character like mine to do?\n\nTo then rub salt in the wound, as the game continued to tell me how I was playing it wrong (Hah!), all my characters subsequent dialogue with those involved in my goal of bringing down the ridiculously villainous bad-guys, was phrased with my undying obeisance as I decried my foolishness for deciding that I wished to be a Morally upstanding \"Rebel\".", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451506203, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451506808, "recommendationid": "20125931", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473106", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1440610823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1141, "steamid": "76561198068186337", "num_games_owned": 88}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This was a fantastic game.

I especially enjoyed all the power options in the game, and way they would work together. \n\nThe only think I'm upset about is that it ended-come on! I need more closure than that! Actually I want more content. Yes it gave me a lot of great content, but the story is so addictive I desperately need more. \n\nCan't wait for the next book/episode/game whatever you want to call it. Definitely buy this game!\n\nSide note, I never got the Worning bird DLC, even though they offered it here, and in game, because I felt it unnecessary. It's more fun in my opinion to figure it out on your own, without the game telling you in advance which choice is best for your stats.
