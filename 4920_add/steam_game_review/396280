Note, that those are most likely written by veterans like myself, but without taking into consideration the viewpoint of a new player. \n\n[b]I put the summary in the beginning:[/b]\nYes, this is a dated game. Yes, the code is far from perfect. Yes, the population has declined over the years. BUT! The game's visuals aged quite well, easy to get used to it and some of the environments are really well crafted to look appealing even with dated graphics. The game has an extreme amount of content in it. Even by staying F2P (\"froob\" by ingame jargon) you can spend years with it. Not mandatory though, you can play this game both casually and hardcore. You decide. Microtransactions are not pay to win. There is a relatively small, but active population.\nIn short: despite it's shortcomings AO is still the best MMORPG ever in my opion. And I have tried a few.\nGOLDEN TIP: FIND AN ORGANIZATION QUICKLY! (AO's jargon for Guild) Ask around in public chat channels (such as \"OOC\") and you will find an organization in no time.\n\nOK here come the details:\n\n[h1]Setting:[/h1]\nAO is literally the world's first scifi MMORPG. It has a unique world that combines elements from Shadowrun (main influence), Dune and others. But it also contains many unique, sometimes humorous, sometimes quirky and sometimes outright weird aspects. The game's world is totally lovable and one of the reasons it still has an active playerbase. Fun fact: women seem to like the game world too. I have seen more women in this game (proportionally) than in any other online game.\nAO also has a well crafted story, which is not forced upon you if you are not into it. But if you are, there are tons of lore available, and even a novel (\"Prophet without honor\")\nThere are many seasonal events, which are now part of the game's traditions and add a lot of fun.\n\n[h1]Social vs Solo:[/h1]\nMost things in this game can be solo'ed. In fact, some of the greatest achievements are when someone is able to solo something that normally would require multiple players. You can solo almost all the way to endgame. But it is much more fun and easier to do it with other people. The game factilitates social interactions and fomations of communities and the existing communities are mostly very welcoming. I have created a couple of long-lasting real life friendships as have many other players in this game.\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\nI won't lie: the game has aged graphics. Probably one of the least pretty MMOs that you can find on the market. But it is very easy to get used to it. The environments are well crafted, especially the Shadowlands. NOTE: there is a \"new engine\" game client, which is not shipped with Steam, but you can download it from the AO website. It makes the game a lot prettier, but it is still in Beta and there are a couple of bugs in it (nothing game-breaking, I play on the new client for instance)\n\n[h1]Game mechanics:[/h1]\nIt is quite similar to other online RPGs, but a lot more complex. It is mostly stat-based. The learning curve is huge, but not steep. The game will go easy on you in the beginning and you will learn it gradually. This complexity is one of the biggest appeals of this game. Equipping your character the best possible way is very challenging, but at the same time very rewarding. For instance when your low level character is able to whack high level monsters. In most cases you can adjust the difficulty of the game to your character by choosing appropriately leveled missions, or killing the appropriate level monsters in the open world.\nHaving said that, the game has a massive open world, but also contains many instanced (somtimes even randomly generated) areas. The are unique open world bosses, open world raids, instanced raids, PVP-PVM mix raids and many others\nProfessions (the game's equivalent of character classes) are wildly different and unique in their own way. BUT most items are not class locked, and there is a big room for experimentation. You are not really forced a certain path like in other games, say in SWTOR where if you are a smuggler you must use blasters. In AO blasters would be the recommended choice, but it can happen that someone comes up with a creative setup that outperforms the recommended one. The variety options are immense.\n\nPVP in this game is the \"smartest\" pvp I have seen in any game. It takes a lot of skill and game knowledge to be at the top, but the entry level is not that scary.\n\nI reiterate though: you do not need to be knowledgeable to get started. It will come both naturally, and the community will answer your questions. Your organization members will lend their deep game knowledge to you and will help you along the way to stand on your own feet, if you need it.\n\n[h1]Microtransactions:[/h1]\nCompletely optional. Most players get by without ever spending money on microtransactions. On the other hand it's a good way to support the developers. \n\n[h1]Membership:[/h1]\nAround 50% of the content is tied to a subscription plan. It is farily affordable, but more expensive than pretty much any other MMO on the market. Bummer, a dated business model. As a F2P player, you will have access to \"Rubi-Ka\", the main world of the game. Subscription players gain access to the \"Shadowlands\" which presents an alternative progression (ie. you can level both in Rubi-Ka and the Shadowlands) which is arguably faster in the Shadowlands. You will get acces to more endgame content too. More powerful items etc. You can choose to play the full game from day one, or remain a free player as long as you want. Many of the subscription players today started out as F2P players, and there are some players who still play F2P accounts after so many years.\n\n[h1]Complaints, negative reviews, vitriolic statements from veterans:[/h1]\nAO runs on minimal support from it's developer company. This makes the game somewhat riddled with problems. You will hear a lot about exploiters, broken economy, inflation etc. None of them are exactly true, though none of them are false either. Very rarely it happens that a small group of exploiters pop up. Since AO does not have constant supervision, these are not addressed promptly. Still the holes are plugged and the \"outbreak\" itself does not have much effect on the game anyway (not even close to what many veterans would tell you - they usually see this problem being a lot larger than it really is). Also, despite what anyone says, the economy is not (that) broken. It will not affect your gameplay much anyway. It will not prevent you from having fun or getting what you need on your character.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]:\nAO is a big, complex, lovable game. Nowhere near perfect, but its pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. A must try. Stick to it.

Sure, there is a subscribtion that give access to new content and powerful equipment and sure there is an ingame shop, but the free content is really large (2/3 of the game) and the shop is half cosmetic, half shortcuts for rerolls. The game was created before the f2p scheme existed and as a result you get a full game.\n\nNow the part that will give you trouble. [b]This game is from 2001[/b]. The graphics are outdated at best, butt-ugly at worst. We also learnt to make better games in the last decade and you'll realize that your character move and plays like crap. Servers easily desync, visibility and hit distances are always wrong and you can forget about concepts such as 'skillshots'. It's a primitive 'tab and auto attack' game.\n\nAlso it is important to understand the game's mindset from another age. It is complex and there is no quest chain that will guide you to level max here, you get to explore, hunt instead and more importantly, get social. Talking to other players is vital. Ask them questions, ask for help and augmentations and you'll have the time of your life. Even if you solo, it is worthwhile to listen to the OOC channel and occasionally chat in there.\n\nEither way, this game is 13 years of my life well wasted.\n\nPS: Neutral 4 life", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487962640, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487962640, "recommendationid": "30147915", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548630", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488102615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "steamid": "76561197963781498", "num_games_owned": 87}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 87, "comment_count": "14", "review": "When you really want to be positive, but you can't.\n\nYes, I am one of mentioned old timers that might have something negative to say. Only that I have a lot of negative to say, that's not to say there aren't anything positive to find with Anarchy Online.\n\nCons:\n\nYes, AO did get a new rendering engine. But you're not gonna see it unless you download it manually. Then you need to find the community fixes as it crashes rather often. Instead enjoy this 16 year old rendering engine set to 1024x768 fullscreen instead.\n\nExploits, and lots of exploits. GMI (auction house), PvP, leveling, duping, NODROP transfers, ability boosting, dmg exploits. Yes, AO has them all. In its heyday AO was less prone to extended damage from exploits. More developers and money allowed for swift fix and ban of exploiters. \nThese days AO barely has 1 developer, severe exploits can go on for weeks before they are fixed.\n\nInput multiplexing, yes AO allows for input multiplexing. You can use 3rd party software to control multiple accounts. People have their merry band of 6 accounts and farm PvM content and sell loot rights, PvP or anything else under the sun.\n\nOpen world PvP, I noticed that was one of the selling points mentioned in the AO on steam email FunCom sent me. Well yes, we do have open world PvP. Yes, you can defend and attack land. It is fun, a lot of fun! But developers have refused to look at level ranges, meaning that your lvl 165 can be smashed by someone 205-207. The difference in comparable power is off the charts. Oh and yeah that 205 can have endgame 220 heals as backup. Sounds fun right?\nLevel ranges is just one aspect, I mentioned input multiplexing above. Its super fun when your Organization has 4 people online at an akward timezone to defend vs 1-2 guys running 12 toons killing your towers.\n\nSoon(tm), we hear that a lot from the developers. Updated engine was to be released soon, it took years. Profession balance soon, still not anywhere near complete. The list goes on.\n\nPvM, with the recent years total focus on 6-man instanced raids, it seems that the benefit of being in a clan (Org) is gone. Many large Orgs died and the playerbase is fractured. Why be with 23 people when you and your buddy can dual log and do all the content and sell lootrights? AO used to be a very social thing, I think a lot of that is gone now.\n\nPvP, well there is none. Not really, not anymore. Exploiters and multiplexers rule openworld PvP. Sure you can do duels (fun) or battlestation (sometimes fun), but the mayhem such a name as Anarchy Online implies is long gone.\n\nLeveling, oh so you bought the game? Expansions and all? Looking forward to go shoot stuff with strangers? Just don't it's not going to happen. Leveling in AO (as a paid player) mostly revolves around sitting on your ass from level 7 to 205+. Endgame tanks will pocket tank mobs, an NT will AoE nuke said mobs from safety and you profit.\nAs a veteran I use this, because when I make my 5th tl5 PvP twink, I just want to get to level 150 asap and twink. For new paid players though, well I hope you like doing daily solo missions and running around alone. Endgame 220 players have their 160 alts on follow, or sit on a designated rock while they kill monsters. So yeah..\nFroobs might have more fun, if there is a healthy community.\n\nLack of new content/updates. AO has 1 deeveloper, sometimes. Sure for someone completely new to the game the amount of content is huge! For veterans it is rather meh, you might hear a lot of negativity regarding that.\n\nPros:\n\nExtremely complex character development, you are for the most part free to do whatever you want as a player. It might end up being horribly bad, but you are allowed to use daggers on your soldier if you please.\n\nFor new players there is extreme amounts of content, I mean really really much to do.\n\n\nI would have put more here, but they are hampered by the issues I listed above.\nI truely love AO, but I can not recommend a game that has developers/marketing so far into space.

Let's have a look at the important parts that've changed:\n\n[list]\n[*]There is a new starting area that explains [i]everything[/i] much better, and gives new characters items every new character actually wants to have.\n[*]There's a new central hub (ICC) that has practically everything.\n[*]Neutral-aligned automated stores received an overhaul, making them the most convenient stores available.\n[*]There is a new Engine that actually uses your graphics card. It's not perfect yet, but functions well enough for most situations.\n[*]The game has daily missions (at least two per day) on an 18 hour clock that means solo-levelling is viable. This is good because,\n[*]there is only one server now. AO is still a game with niche appeal.\n[*]The in-game auction house is simple and easy to use - but is for paying customers only.\n[*]A lot of the unnecessary grinding/camping from the early-years has been removed or side-stepped by providing alternate avenues for advancement or the items have been superceded with easier-to-obtain new stuff.\n[*]Battlestation teams are no-longer divided across faction lines. Pick a side, red or blue.\n[*]End-game raids are all instanced now (except those that were designed to be PvP).\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Appeal of Anarchy Online[/h1]\n\nWhat is the appeal of Anarchy Online? There seem to be two types of players: those that have terrible computers and can't run any other online game, and those that appreciate the unique challenges that Anarchy Online provides.\n\nFor the uninitiated, picture this: There exist dungeons that are level-capped. Those dungeons have unique loot, and to get that loot you either need to be in a competent team or very over-geared for your level. Some of that loot can be traded, meaning you might want to sell it in the economy, other times it's not tradable, but [b]could[/b] be equipped on a much lower-level character.\n\n[b]Here's the key part:[/b] You have the option to [i]stop[/i] (or start) levelling up at any time. Therefore, you can spend as much time as you like improving your level-locked character with improved items.\n\nBecoming over-geared (\"twinking\") is a long, involved and extremely rewarding process. Items you obtain at endgame could just as easily go into making your level-capped character more powerful, or you might just need a much higher level character to be able to craft those items. You're soon in a position where you have characters at breakpoints such as 25, 60, 100, 110, 150 and 200. They're all feeding resources to each other, either items or credits made from the market.\nNot just that, but there are level-locks to the PvP battlestations too. Excelling in PvP allows you to sell your rewards for further profit.\n\nThe difference between a character in normal levelling gear and one that you have spent hours or days working on can be absolutely incredible. And it's all completely optional. If you have a reliable friend, they can take care of a different level range and purpose than you, and both can benefit.\n\nSo the appeal of Anarchy Online is, quite simply, [b]depth[/b]. There's more to it than can be covered in a review, but that is the key point.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487839389, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487839389, "recommendationid": "30115014", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524257", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488133769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 11, "steamid": "76561198046047379", "num_games_owned": 92}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 66, "comment_count": "19", "review": "The game is only worth playing with a sub fee. As a non sub this game is unbearable. The free stuff is sub par in every way, forces you to gimp your character (required skills to equip items) and you will most likely never find anyone to play with. When you sub once you will never have access to your account if not subbed.\n\nThe veterans have this game in a stranglehold. No changes, no new ideas  nothing will be done that could potentially piss of the vets thus stagnation has set in (for the last 10 years). Vets even act as customer support,\n\nThe economy is in ruins. There hasn't been a server reset...ever. Over the years there have been so many exploits that creds are ultimately useless and you will need billions and billions for a decent item. \nDid i mention that you can only use the \"auction house\" as a sub? Well actually doesn't matter because the items you would want to buy are only available to subs as well.\n\nProgression in this game is grind based. Go to one area grind to level x, continue to next area to grind to level y and so on until the game becomes so difficult that you will just sit on one spot in a party while a max level char is leveling for you.\nYou will need some crucial quests wich cannot be completed alone and if you are new to the game there is no chance in hell you will ever progress without help. There are dailies in the game but they can only be completed every 18hours.\n\nThis game is 16 years old with 5 people max. working on......sry maintaining it. It still costs the full sub fee of 17,95Euro despite technology having advanced to a degree that maintenance of a 3GB game must be dirt cheap. This is bascally them scamming the players.\n\nDon't get me wrong i think this is one of the b\u00eatter games but Funcom has just abandoned it.

Been playing this game for over 10 years on and off, I've tried all the mmorpgs out there and I always come back to AO.\n\nA one sentence review: A complex MMORPG with no hand holding, skill based PVP and 2001 graphics.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- Awful graphics, the game was launched in 2001 and not much has been improved graphics wise. Sure a while back Funcom launched a beta engine(client) that you can download from AO website but it's quite unstable.\n\n- Animations are so bad its not even funny, not improved on the 'new' engine either.\n\n- Lots of visual bugs.\n\nIf you want a game that looks great AO is not it.\n\nThe good:\n\n- AO is one of the most complex MMORPGs around, 14 classes that really are different and not just slight variations of the same thing.\n\n- The learning curve is not great but it's rewarding.\n\n- PvP is skills based and it's all about coming up with a smart setup, no standard end-game setups here. It's all about being creative and mix it up.\n\n- Classes are balanced-ish and every class has a nemesis (a class that wrecks you!).\n\n- Twinking(over-gearing), now this is a thing unique to AO. In other games its all about max lvl pvp but not here. In most games you;ll have equipment requirements like : Level from xx. In AO it's all about stats and pushing them the the limits, you can have a level 1 with the same equipment you would seen on a level 20-30. It's a hard sometimes insane process as you try to squeeze every extra ability point out of your eqipment but so rewarding .. in PvP! . There are twinks at almost every level as they are needed to attack/defend organization(guild) land zones and each zone has a different level range. You can stop leveling at any level you want and make the most bad a$$ pvp character there to dominated everyone \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488288659, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488288659, "recommendationid": "30240121", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520876", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504273371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4273, "steamid": "76561198012606318", "num_games_owned": 178}, "votes_funny": 27, "votes_up": 43, "comment_count": "5", "review": "Used to be so that you hit lvl 20 and your friends tell you to go lvl in ToTW and then you go there and whack some legos n shiz and after a while someone in bling bling grid armor comes in with 30+ mobs and the last boss of the instance on their tail and gets you and your teammates killed.

I think I still had 28.8k internet, and had to put \u00a31 for every hour I paid into a piggybank, to pay for the internet. My computer was so crappy, I had to run around in the old starting zones with my camera pointed straight down, and just tab+attack enemies nearby. It probably took me a week before I left the \"Backyard\" starting area, because I was scared to leave its safety. When I finally left, my computer just DIED.\n\nFast forward a bit, till I got a new computer, and could finally look around in Tir (clan starting city). Wow! Just wow! All these people are playing together with me?! This was my very first MMO, and the thought of all these characters also being people blew my mind. People were standing around on street corners, chatting, or trying to jump up to higher places so they could perch and look cool. I found some people to team up with, and we did a \"mission\". Let me tell you though, getting missions to work was difficult! One person had to roll a mission, get a key to the door, then buy a key duplicator and copy the entrence key for everyone in the team! Eventually, \"Team missions\" were patched in though, and boy were they great! There were multiple floors in the missions now, with a boss with loot at the end!\n\nI played an Adventurer. Because I thought \"Yeah, I want to explore!\". Exploring in AO is amazing. There's always something to find, even if it's not loot, but interesting places, DANGEROUS places! I remember running west out of Tir with a friend (the friend who had asked me to get AO), because he wanted to show me somewhere we could hunt. A little down the ways, he stopped, and said he had to \"get his bearings\". I was completely immersed! We finally got to our destination, and it was a huge crater in the middle of the desert, filled with plantlife and animals (that we murdered).\n\nRoleplaying. I first tried this in AO. There was something about it that tickled my fancy. I found myself a roleplaying oroganization (guild), called \"Sea of Change\". We were extreme rebels. We roleplayed missions where we were sabotaging the evil corporation Omni-Tek's progress, and we would not back down! I loved it. I loved roleplaying, and I was hooked. I played AO for years, simply because of its roleplaying community. The ability to walk into The Happy Rebel, Reets Retreat or the Rompa Bar, and there would be people everywhere, sitting in the booths, standing at the bar. If you wanted to find roleplay, you would find it there, or in the parks. If anyone was \"roleplay walking\" anywhere, you could walk up and strike up a conversation. The game became second, roleplay was king.\n\nThese are things that I've missed in AO. Running out somewhere to find places to hunt for experience with friends. Now it's all about grinding the most xp rich places or missions, and doing dailies. The \"outside\" world seems empty and unused, aside from the huge player cities that are a blister on the landscape and completely unimmersive. The roleplay is barely there anymore. The community I had loved has mostly gone away. There's a sliver there, clinging on and doing their best to stay active, but it's not the same.\n\nMaybe getting AO on Steam will help, maybe it'll fill the bars and streets up again. I can only hope.\n\nAO is a complicated beast. Nothing will come to you easy. You have to raise your own skills, and you can do it right, or you can do it wrong. The game used to tote that you can play anyway you want. My adventurer? I used a two-handed polearm. It was wrong. It got me to level 15-25, but then I couldn't kill anything anymore. A friend told me, \"What? No. Don't you see that adventurers are supposed to use two swords or two pistols?\" My mind was blown. Don't get me wrong though, you can still play the way you want, but you won't be optimal..\n\nIn the base, free game, there's 200 levels. I have no idea how long it would take you to get to that level now, but with casual play, and mostly roleplaying, I believe it took me two years. You can probably do it in a couple of months, if you do things right. Every level, you get some skillpoints to set up the way you want, either in tech, combat skills, base abilities, or tradeskills. It's all up to you, really.\n\nThere's A LOT of classes, or professions as they're called, in AO. Adventurer, Soldier, Engineer, Meta-Phycisist, Trader, Bureaucrat, Martial Artist, Enforcer, Fixer, Agent, Doctor and Nano Technician. The expansion, Shadowlands (SL), added two more, the Shade and Keeper. Every class is so diverse. You most likely will find something for you. You have the archetypes: Doctor (Healer), Enforcer (Tank), Nano Technician (Mage), but there's so much more.\n\nI have never found another game with this kinds of creative and diverse classes. I love the adventurer for his/her cool dual pistols (or swords, if that's your thing). I love the Trader for his shotgun and ability to drain his enemies to make himself and the team stronger. I love the bureaucrat for his android pet and his ability to calm and charm nearly anything.\n\nThere are four \"races\", or breeds as they're called. The human \"Solitus\", which is the average type of breed. The Atrox, a genderless (unless you have some cabbage?) strong brute. The fragile but intelligent Nanomage. And the slender, agile Opifex. Every breed can play any profession for either side of the conflict. It's all up to you how you want to mix and match. Want to play a nanomage enforcer? With strong nano programs (spells) but generally weak physique? Up to you. Want to play an atrox nano technician? Bad nano programs but lots of health? Go ahead, it's a challenge!\n\nI used to love this game. I want to love this game again. I wish it all the best. I love the memories I have from it. It might look like mud, run a little bad, be complex af, and not friendly to new players, it might take you an hour just to go through the HUD, but it's worth it.\n\nYou should play this game, and make some memories for yourself.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487844351, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487844351, "recommendationid": "30116051", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513504", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487926448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198026967461", "num_games_owned": 32}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Veteran of Sci-fi MMOs, AO has survived its editor's (many) mistakes & being extensed/patched pretty frequently.

There are no devs currently working on it, the exploits are well known and widely used for a long time without any fixes. The ingame economy has increased in value about 15 fold in the past year due to the dupes (AO's version of the WoW token called GRACE that gives 30days gametime for ingame currency was 300mil credits a few months ago now it's 4bil, the max credits can you hold on a single character is 1bil). Exploiters can become godmode to 1shot any player and be unkillable even by 50 endgame players at once. They can solo all endgame content meant for large raid groups. Recently the auction house was even hacked so it removed everything you were wearing for anyone that tried to use it. The game is a mess while Funcom does nothing to help the community there.\n\nIt's a shame really since the game really does have good gameplay and indepth skill system, the small legit community is also really great. But it's completely been ruined due to a lack of interest from the developer, now it's run by the exploiters.

It is a  well aged relic from past from the times when players were far more hardcore and games far more time consuming. Main Strengths of this lovely game is unique gameworld. This game resembles me from Diku-MUDS which were a sort of predecessors of modern MMORPGS in 90\u2019s. \nIt is pretty obvious that AO has had enormous impact to development of other more modern themepark MMO's.\n\nThe game is pretty time consuming when compared to newer MMO's, in a good and bad sense. \n\nEven the graphics seem outdated the atmosphere in AO is great. Music is captivating. Most of the professions are very unique like crat, trader, fixer or MP. AO is one of the few games where I feel to be in a another dimension when I play it. \nCharacter speed can be increased with skill and it is thus relative. This is a great feature. I hate MMOs where you move around slowly. \n\nHowever, It is a shame that AO was neglected so many years by it\u2019s developer.  \nI have played Conan and TSW and while I like both games they are not as good as AO. \n\nWhile current lead dev is doing great job, I feel it is too late. AO would need massive improvements to be able compete with big titles. I doubt it will ever happen even with potential funds coming from STEAM playerbase.  Just imagine what AO would be if it were developed like EVE Online (2003) by CCP?\n\nTSW mechanics and gearing system is one of the best FUNCOM have created. I think that they should take TSW gearing system and adapt it to AO. This would greatly improve this game. Of course it would make some old vets unhappy. Current system where you need to use twinking gear to wield good weapons and armor is just too outdated, unbalanced and time consuming for younger players. \n\nOverall, if you really want to explore the past of MMORPG history and you are not afraid from grindy content you should give a try and experience this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487927539, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487927702, "recommendationid": "30136984", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502604", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498851112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561197962071648", "num_games_owned": 108}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have played this game for years and hope to continue playing it for many more to come, so anything I say will be more than a little partial.
