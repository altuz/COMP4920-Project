I must recommend it, because the chances taken by the developer are more courageous and the questions raised by the game more profound than in most games you'll play.\n\nHowever, it is not a \"fun\" game to play. The game is very unnerving, with character designs seemingly crafted specifically to make the player uncomfortable. The player is put in awful situations, and must spend a bit too much time scrolling horizontally through the games' environments (a gameplay-related complaint).\n\nThe game is loosely based off of a serial killer in history, Albert Fish. There are many references to his story throughout the game. However, I am not sure I would necessarily recommend that the player seek out his story prior to playing. It seems important that the player attempt to empathize with the protagonist, and prior knowledge could hinder this. I didn't know anything about Albert Fish prior to playing, just FYI.\n\nI think that this is a very important game. Simply because it is possible for an individual to escape a terrible upbringing unscathed, does that mean that we should not pay attention to the other 90% of people who emerge broken? In our society, we spend so much time focusing on those who escape. Do we ever get a fully human exploration of those who don't? It's likely that this game will upset some, and I'm sure it already has, but it truly is a work of art.
