I chatted a bit with one of the devs online and wfound out this was not a straight port but a rework.  For 10 bucks, I figured what the heck.  I am very happy I gave it a shot.\n\nWhat it has:  A very well done UI, quite easy to understand and friendly.  Nice graphics.  When I started in the tutorial I was reminded of the classic Panzer/Allied General games.  The tutorials are very well done and teach you everything you need to know to play well.  \n\nA ton of content comes with the game.  Over 9 separate campaigns, each with multiple missions.  3 levels of AI make the challenge customizable for all player levels.  If you are a wargames expert and want a human opponent, there is a 2 player hotseat mode with 10+ scenarios as well.\n\nThe game play is fast, clean and easy to understand.  Your units can move and attack (think soldiers and tanks firing on the move) wuth a reduction in their combat effectivness.  Cover and terrain are very important for protection and line of sight as the map is shrouded (fog of war).\n\nOverall impressions:  I really like this game!  I started it up and when I looked up, 2 hours had gone by and I was still having a great time.  One of the first games in a long time that I was disappointed when life interferred and I had to stop playing.\n\nDo yourself a favor, get this gem of a game.  I know the devs are working on a American Civil War game as well and I am really looking forward to that one as well.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457002649, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457002649, "recommendationid": "21600133", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545287", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464290468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3604, "steamid": "76561198081080270", "num_games_owned": 195}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nice little game.
