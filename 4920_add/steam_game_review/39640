Find a copy of Archimedean Dynasty instead.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, I bought it because I have very fond memories of playing archimedean dynasty back in the 90s. Unfortunately this game just really isn't any good. The controls are irritating, the missions include huge chunks of sailing slowly through the sea before the mission actually starts, and if you lose you have to go through the dull sailing section all over again. This might be alright if the challenging/difficult sections of the game were actually fun or interesting, but they aren't.\n\nTo top it all off these boring activites are tied together with a dull story, terrible dialogue and rubbish interface."}]}
