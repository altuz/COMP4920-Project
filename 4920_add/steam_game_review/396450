THe sound effects seem okay, but that \"battle start\" sound is so loud and horrible.\n\nThere needs to be more explanation of what's going on, because there isn't really anything telling you what's going on.\n\nThe A.I. is pretty easy to defeat, I didn't make it very far though beacuse I couldn't find a single key.\n\nI had a bit of fun playing it though, here's a video below if you want to check it out.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/b4axolW8PBs\n\nIn the end though, it really really needs some patching, added features or help options, better AI, menu music and a couple other things.\n\nI'd say not recommended in it's current state. After a patch or two, it could be decent :)\n\nP.S. That art style is hilarious, I do love the art style. hehe :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444206211, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444206419, "recommendationid": "18365761", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511440", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444189243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 40, "steamid": "76561197991921123", "num_games_owned": 2909}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fun game that leaves you to decide where to go and how many risks to take. You enter a rather large map that has numerous small buildings in it. You choose where to go and what ones to enter. Once you go in, enemies will spawn and attack you, killing them causes them to drop coins, health potions or keys. On the map there will be locked chests and building that you can explore so long as you have a key to unlock them. You can clear all or none of the buildings before battling the boss. These guys will drop items to enhance your skills including armors and weapons. Once dead a portal will open to take you to the next area.\n\nI think this is a competent and very well priced little game that deserves a look, It can be compared to Ziggurat only in that its a rouge-lite FPS and that you are a mage. otherwise its quite different.
