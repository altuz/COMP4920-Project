I think I got this free at some point. Like it was free on steam or something or was on sale for a buck. Couldn't have been happier with the purchase.

I say to them they're doing it wrong. I don't know how to tell them to do it right but I know that how they're doing it is apparently wrong because I don't have this issue at any point in the game.
