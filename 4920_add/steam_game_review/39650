Unfortunately, the impressive level of detail and the interesting gameplay options at your disposal take a backseat to the technical issues and repetitive micromanagement. The games doesn't really work as it was intended to. You can sleep, but there is absolutely no need to. I can send my characters to work, and leave them for a week if I wanted... There are other aspects of the game that seem broken as well..\n\nThis is a type of that that makes me question why steam reviews should have a SO-SO or careful recommendation button. I'm in the middle."}]}
