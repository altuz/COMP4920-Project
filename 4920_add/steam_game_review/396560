It puts you in the battle!   If you play this game, and talk crap on it, your a complete moron.   No game has ever given me: rug burn, sore muscles, sore joints, and straight up heart pounding, out of breath experience as Front Defense.   What a great example of what VR can really become!   This is the game that really makes the beginning of VR become evident of what a venture into what virtual reality can really do.  Right now today, this has got to be the best VR experience in a game I have ever seen!   Difficult, yes!   Thats what war is, life or death!   Wave shooter?  Yes, but not like the others,   This is BAD ASS.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505782574, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505782574, "recommendationid": "35055661", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 19, "total_reviews": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
