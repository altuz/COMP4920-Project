When your ship blows up, you can get back to base and start another one, but this process takes like 3-5 seconds.

This being said you have to turn your ship around to go after what you were planning on grabbing. This doesn't break the game for me, and this is more of a pet peive than anythings else, but it is something i will get over and turn into a \"skill\" rather then an annoyance.\n\nNot a con, but Newtonian Physics.\n\nShooting into one asteroid, and your ship flys back into another. BOOM!\n\n\n\n\nIf i could add one thing, with the resources you are getting, why not use that to add minor station upgrades onto it to increase the survivability, so like a small rail cannon that fires once every 6-10 seconds at 1 asteroid flying at it. \n\nOver all worth the cost, if you have friends locally this game would be amazing with them as well.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445020680, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445020680, "recommendationid": "18508087", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512871", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447462115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 12, "steamid": "76561198004405723", "num_games_owned": 241}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Well, first of all I really think you should remove the Co-op Tag as it is wrong, this is local Co-Op only.

The more ores you pick up, the slower your ship propels until it's emptied at the portal. The more powerful the gun, the stronger the kickback (so be careful...you're not invincible!). It took a while to get used to the ship's motion, kind of like flying drunk, but once you get used to it it's awesome! The game features all balance each other nicely :) \n-It's fun to figure out the different weapons classes and how they best work (e.g. the mines have a longer radius of investication than the turrets so they are best placed inside the portal for max protection)\n-GREAT MUSIC! \n-The difficulty doesn't ramp up too quickly so you have time to adjust. That being said, I still struggle to survive longer than 5 minutes....\n-$4.50 gives you hours of entertainment! \n\nCONS (or dirty, dirty tricks):\n-When droids follow your astronaut into the portal when you're trying to regenerate, you're dead (unless you have some auto-defense weapons to save you). Such an anti-climatic way to die! \n-WTF is up with the nukes? I hear the alarm system and instantly panic\n-If you get hit by a sniper,  your astronaut get blasted so far off the screen that flying back to the portal with your limited oxygen supply is nearly impossible in the one-player mode.
