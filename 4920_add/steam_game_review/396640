Difficult, but not insanely hard. Balanced amazingly, and with an amazing sound track to boot. Although it currently has a crazy amount of content, they are coming out with a new chapter for the game in a year or two. There are a couple things that are difficult to understand or use in the game, such as the controls and/or swords. However, once you learn how to use these things, the game becomes fun and possible.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500057145, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500057145, "recommendationid": "33541837", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506175702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 25330, "steamid": "76561198040946044", "num_games_owned": 68}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game contains so much content for a seemingly linear platformer.\n\nLet me start by saying this game is very challenging, between getting a comfortable feel for the game's really unique platform mechanics (such as using a thrown item to give extra jump height), and the mysterious creatures and events that you will encounter on your way to the top.\n\nHowever, if you want a game that will drive your sense of discovery, and has the right difficulty curve to match your ever-growing skills, this game is a steal. It doesn't take long to get familiar with the controls, and they'll improve over time if you just explore what is possible from other players who have videos. I've been playing a lot of the bonus game modes that you unlock by simply playing the main game, and it's remarkable how much there is to explore in the main story, and with all the things you unlock from playing the main story.\n\nLong story short, the music is great and original, the mechanics are unique and fun once you discover all the items that can be found, and you will get your money's worth. I've made 20 hours of playtime account for 1 dollar spent on this game when writing this, and the return on investment will only continue to grow since reading this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500940209, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500940209, "recommendationid": "33775942", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498536", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 126, "total_reviews": 139, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 13}}
