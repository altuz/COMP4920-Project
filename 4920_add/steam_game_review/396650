A game that ended too soon. I do not want to write in professional paragraphs so I will do the old positives and negatives then conclusion thing. I am already doing enough writing in my real life.\n\nPros:\n+ Pretty good story\n+ Characters are overall good\n+ Dating Sim was kind of the best part for me\n+ Shou is best bro.\n+ Timed decisions are really cool, even though they are technically quicktime events I thought they were a nice feature for a visual novel.\n+ Mechs, what's not to love.\n+ MC has my physical traits. That's a personal pro for me.\n+ Dialogue was fine.\n+ I like the soundtrack.\n+ Amazing artwork.\n+ YUUNA IS BEST GIRL! FIGHT ME!!!!!!!1!111!!11!!\n\nCons:\n- Visual Novel gameplay can be a big turn off to some people.\n- Voice acting is so-so but tolerable.\n- While mechs are great, I thought the fights sucked.\n- The game makes references to real life movies and TV shows, but boy oh boy the GEAR puns made me cringe!\n- No route for Mei\n- Every other girl felt stereotyped and cliche.\n- The games ending felt empty and unfinished and it looked as if they were gonna go deeper into the story but it just had to end it in kind of a dumb way (The reason for the game's abrupt ending was because the devs said that they ran out of funds for the original ending and length of the game. But still, the ending kinda sucked).\n- I wanted to spend more time with her....\n- When will we meet again.... Yuuna?\n\nConclusion:\nI almost wanted to not recommend ACE Academy for it's ending and price. But because of how immersed I was within the game, I recommend getting it..... when it is on sale. I liked ACE Academy and I hope we will get a sequel some day (for Yuuna). On a side note, the devs do have a patreon so you can support them over there.\n\nMaybe someday Yuuna... we'll meet again.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504941599, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507165985, "recommendationid": "34831014", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505970", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505633473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 985, "steamid": "76561198301034784", "num_games_owned": 30}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great VN, Finished first playthrough, a very well put together VN that had me attached to the story emotionally. Had feels I didn't know existed. I wish that the end was a bit more further into the story, but I have hopes up there will be a sequel. I do hate that the first run I managed to end up failing o get on a route, but on to the first route from here. One thing I don'tget is how you get the same rank for 2 different choices? Thanks for a great game.\n\nUpdate 2: Loved the Valerie route. I couldn't stop laughing at her showdown with Nikki. Still felt sad towards the end, But still a Glorious game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505201460, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505277809, "recommendationid": "34896556", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503168958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 69, "steamid": "76561198254670484", "num_games_owned": 169}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "oh no pass the Petesa tony\n", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1504838425, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504838425, "recommendationid": "34806616", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 542, "total_reviews": 559, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_negative": 17}}
