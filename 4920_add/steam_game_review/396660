While I enjoyed it, I've seen some reviews here absolutely gushing with praise and I can't quite understand them. It's a good game. Is it incredible? No, not really. The story is good though nothing particularly amazing and it desperately needs a sequel to tie up some loose ends and to resolve the cliffhanger ending. \n\nMost of the reviews compare Tahira to The Banner Saga and for good reason, since the combat is nearly identical with only a handful of small differences. Graphically, it is almost disintguishable from the Banner Saga during combat and if you told me they were part of the same series, just covering different locations or something along those lines I'd believe you. Where the Banner Saga let you choose between targeting the opponent's health or guard, Tahira forces you to work through the guard stat before you can whittle down the health and dispatch the enemy. You only have three different classes to work with (four if you count Tahira, herself, being unique to the other characters you use) with a serious lack of ranged options. In terms of story and choices, Tahira comes up a bit short. There are only a couple of choices you can make (as of the writing of this review I can only clearly remember one though I'm 95% certain that there was another one) and they don't really make any difference. Where the Banner Saga prompted you with choices that had real ramifications for the story and the combat, Tahira is more like reading a novella with combat segments after each chapter.\n\nWhile this may all sound a bit negative, Tahira really is a good, enjoyable game. However, I would only suggest that you temper your expectations a bit. It is rather short and the ending comes up rather abruptly with a fairly large cliffhanger. The combat is good though nothing groundbreaking and some of the later battles can get a bit dull as Tahira's response to up the difficulty is to just throw more and more enemies at you as oppose to having different objectives to accomplish. The music and artwork are both very good and the Middle Eastern inspired setting is a fun and refreshing viewpoint that we don't see in enough games and could certainly do with some more of. \n\nIf you enjoyed the Banner Saga, you'll enjoy Tahira. They are, like I said, shockingly similar. It is not, however, perfect and it's similarity to the Banner Saga works against it. I feel bad constantly lining the two games up and pointing out this or that but they really are that similar. However, in the end, I have to give Tahira: Echoes of the Astral Empire the thumbs up.  Pick it up, especially if it's on sale, you'll probably enjoy it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503591070, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503591070, "recommendationid": "34462873", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514479", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 31, "total_reviews": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
