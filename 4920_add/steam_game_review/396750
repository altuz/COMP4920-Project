The two major issues I had in Early Access are still around in the release versions. It's a big letdown.\n\n--> Using a controller (Xbox One via USB cable) does not feel natural at all for space combat. It's very \"jerky\" and movement is not fluid at all. It's almost like on/off movement with no sense of ship momentum. Let go of the stick and the ship just stops, even rebounds a bit. Zero momentum bleed which would be intuitive cause... physics.Having to hold down the throttle also seems a bit counterintuitive as well. It's a spaceship, not a space car. Even my car has cruise control.\n\n-> The HUD is pretty but not as useful as it could be. Seems like they spent more time making this cool for VR than honestly useful. Things are indicated using tiny highlights that often blend into the screen. There's no map. Clones and AI helpers but no maps! Who needs teh maps or to know what's around. Just fly around like a complete asshat til you encounter things that are going to obliterate you. I guess clones and new ships are way cheaper than maps in the future.\n\n--> Things have small cursors, no ability to target that asshat that's shooting at me or nearest. It's really helpful to spin around til you find the guy shooting at you so that you can then finally click the \"lock\" button and hope there's not something else at some \"distance I don't care about while getting shot at\" that gets locked instead. \n\n--> For some reason, the weapon wheels that show up have inverted item selection which is just... puzzling. Push up on the stick and it selects the bottom item in the wheel.  Basically push opposite of what you want to select it.\n\nThe movement and targeting killed it for me. Is it roguelike and you did these two crippling things to extend playtime? For a space combat roguelike... the control for said combat kinda sucks.\n\nI can only recommend this at a deep discount if you're looking to enjoy the combat aspect. Maybe you can enjoy this with a keyboard and mouse, but for me this screams big screen TV  (VR headset even) and surround sound with a controller and to see the controller feel so jerky coupled with the pretty yet functionally useless UI makes this game a solid pass.\n\nGo play or watch videos of combat in Wing Commander, X Wing, Xwing vs Tie Fighter or any other old as sh*t sapce dogfighter and you'll get a sense of fluid motion and useful controls. I just don't see them here.
