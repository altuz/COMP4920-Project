So there's your typical 'point and click adventure game'-style gameplay where you collect items and use them on objects in the game world in order to advance. And then there's a lot of puzzle-solving, including the genre's typical 'hidden objects puzzles' (HOP) that show you a scene cluttered with objects and require you to spot specific items in that scene.\n \nI've played a few HOGs and when it comes to HOPs, [i]Dracula's Legacy[/i] gets the worst score yet in my book, for three reasons:\n[list]\n[*] You're only shown a list of four objects at a time. When you find one of these objects, it's replaced with another object to look for. Nothing happens if you click on an object that's not on the list yet but will appear on it later on.\n[*] Every object in the HOPs is huge so searching isn't really necessary, just [b]glancing[/b] is enough to see what you're looking for. I'm not saying the objects should be so minute that the HOPs become a matter of pixel hunting, not at all, but good HOGs have shown there's a golden mean.\n[*] There are hardly any [b]extra[/b] items added to the HOPs. Almost all of the items you see are objects that will need to be crossed off the list while solving the HOP.\n[/list]\nTogether, this means the HOPs are ridiculously easy. You look at the very short list, pick one item from the list, look up a bit and immediately spot the item, click on it and repeat. There's no challenge whatsoever.\n \nThe same goes for the other puzzles in [i]Dracula's Legacy[/i], actually: they are way too easy and offer no challenge whatsoever, with the exception of two puzzles. Those two puzzles use rotating discs as their puzzle mechanism, where rotating one piece of the puzzle into place means you move another part of the puzzle, too, so completing the puzzle relies mostly on trial and error instead of thinking it through. The other puzzles are so easy they mostly boil down to 'just drag these items to the position they clearly belong in'.\n \nAs in most HOGs, interactable objects light up. In [i]Dracula's Legacy[/i], objects keep lighting up as interactable even when you're finished with them. This gets annoying after a while. Playing the game on Expert Mode may fix this in the sense that interactable objects may not light up at all, but I don't know for sure.\n \nSpeaking of annoying, on several occasions I tried an action that didn't work, only to find out later that it is in fact the action required to advance. It seems you can only perform certain actions when the game is ready for it, meaning after you've performed a different but completely unrelated action somewhere else. \n \nOne last thing that influences gameplay in a bad way is that the game's English is rather bad. Sometimes you're not sure what the game wants you to look for because it's described inaccurately. Or you encounter strange things like an item that's labeled 'pike' but gets labeled 'spear' when placed into your inventory. Or what to think about mistakes that clearly point to lazy writing, for example: [i]\"The flashlight batteries are have no charge''[/i]. Lastly, the bad English sometimes results in laughable statements like [i]\"It's not worth bothering him\"[/i] when you click on a monster that's looking for you and would rip off your head if it spots you, so they clearly meant to say something like \"I shouldn't attract its attention\".\n \n[h1]Story[/h1]\n \nYou play a young woman who's accompanied by her fianc\u00e9 when they encounter a monster. In the chase that follows, you fall down a hole into an underground dungeon. So you'll need to find your way out, find out what happened to your fianc\u00e9 and try not to run into the monster again, if at all possible.\n \nAs the title reveals, [i]Dracula's Legacy[/i]'s has to do with vampires, which you'll encounter about half a minute into the game. So you'll need to kill some vampires and get your fianc\u00e9 out of their clutches. And that's all the story there is to [i]Dracula's Legacy[/i].\n \nMind you, the game hints to a lot more going on with the main character (even more than she herself seems to realize), but it never goes deeper into that. There are several encounters that create interesting questions, but the story never comes back to any of those questions it created. At the very end of the game, they introduce an event that seems to finally be the point when some of the earlier questions may get an answer, but the game just ends. So the story is incohesive and clearly unfinished, sometimes throwing new elements at you but never once running with any of those elements to actually tell the story behind it. It's a bit sad and it ultimately leads to a completely unsatisfying experience.\n \n[h1]Graphics and sound[/h1]\n \n[i]Dracula's Legacy[/i]'s static graphics look beautiful but overall they're too colourful. With less saturation the graphics would have looked a lot more realistic and would have fitted the dark theme of the game much better.\n \nThe characters don't look very impressive, reminiscent of how characters looked in late 1990s to early 2000s games. Character animations are mostly just plain bad.\n \nThe music is atmospheric. The sound effects are sharp. So the audio is of very good quality\u2026 except for the voices. The voice acting is mediocre and the voices are way too quiet. You can adjust the volume for the music and for the sound effects, but not for the voices.\n \n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n \n[i]Dracula's Legacy[/i] has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.\n \nOf the 16 Steam Achievements, 10 are story-related and unmissable. The remaining 6 achievements are awarded for various optional tasks like completing the game on Expert Mode, not skipping puzzles, and so on.\n \nAchievements are bugged but not in the sense that they don't work:\n[list]\n[*] Achievements only pop when you exit the game. So you don't get the usual immediate feedback that lets you know you got it right. After you exit the game the achievements you triggered during the play session pop up in rapid succession and only then are they shown on your achievements page.\n[*] Achievements are awarded even though they shouldn't be: I skipped a puzzle and played the game on Casual Mode, so that should have cost me two achievements, but after finishing the game I still received all the achievements.\n[/list]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503583610, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503583610, "recommendationid": "34460551", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517788", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504519416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 35, "steamid": "76561198051697374", "num_games_owned": 186}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "What a piece of crap.
