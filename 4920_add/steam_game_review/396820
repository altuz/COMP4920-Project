Its clearly compiled for the windows envirsonment but you can clearly see references to the memory card.\nThe start screen just has full screen mode, resolutions (sort of) and music.\nYou can only quit the game by pressing escape. The main menu has no quit button.\n\nIts also worth noting this game is compatible with xbox conrollers, PS1 controllers (via special hardware ports) and it has it's own PS3 dual Shock 3 controller driver.  No 3rd party driver needed.\n\nOne last note,\nMy fraps didn't want to play along so I can't see any actual frame rate but it seems to be at 60.  If I'm not mistaken that is the orginal frame rate if you had the NTCS version of the game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1440793294, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1440793406, "recommendationid": "17759890", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512654", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468097086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 84, "steamid": "76561197977948878", "num_games_owned": 1811}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "PS1 version with a weak sauce emulator.
