It's a heartfelt slice of American historical fiction, and shows the cruelty of war for all involved, but particularly for Native Americans. \n\nPros:\n- Great writing\n- Use of Shawnee language, culture, and folklore\n- Emotionally charged ending\n- Decent artwork\n- A fair amount of humor\n\nCons:\n- Too short (3 hours)\n\nI definitely recommend it. It teaches the reader a little about the Shawnee people and elicits a sad realization of just how cruel white men were to Native Americans in those times.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500783925, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500783925, "recommendationid": "33735939", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497275", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486980376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 188, "steamid": "76561198117124319", "num_games_owned": 579}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1] Over The Hills And Far Away\t[/h1]\nA short visual novel that should be included in your history class. \n\nPlaying as William Aubrey, a deserting soldier on the run; you hide in the barn for the harsh weather & execution order for deserting. \nHowever you find you're not alone, stuck with a Shawnee girl -May, who has too much backbone; you soon find yourself pulling out all your hair in frustration. \n\nThis novel beautifuly displays the clash of cultures, and the awkward interaction between a harsh soldier & a young cunning girl.\n\n[h1] Thumbs Up\t[/h1]\nThe story is good, not totaly original - But far from clich\u00e9. \nHaven't seen a VN about the war in 1812 (or about war in general), Indians or their culture - However it heavily depends on an emotional build-up to the climax, which might not work for you. \n\nThe graphic is beautiful - the backgrounds are truly well-made and a lot of details was put into every scene. Especially the facial expressions.\n\nThe music is a beautiful orchestrial masterpiece by Yuang Chen. I still listen to the soundtrack once in a while.\n\nI found the text well-written. \nNow since May is a child, and Aubrey is not the most talkative person, the dialoque is rather simple, however that only shows their difference in persona, culture and objectives. \nAubrey's lack of energy for dealing with May, and his self-pitying will make you laugh, hate and relate. \n\n[h1] Thumbs Down\t[/h1]\nVery short - 2-3 hours depending on your reading. \n\nIt could include more history of May's background & culture. However Aubrey doesn't know much about it, and May doesn't tell much, so it'd feel out of place, if there were too much.  \nCould be a DLC or extra feature for us who got interested. \n\nSome people miss branching paths.\n- It would be nice with a longer story or alternative endings. [spoiler] Then we can cry more.\t[/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Closing Comments\t[/h1]\nA VN set in original settings, a little short but enjoyable all the way through. \nHowever like books; it's highly individual how you perceive the story, characters and philosophical aspects. \nOr if you want to re-read the story even while knowing the ending. \n\nThe story has some similarities to Planetarian - the Reverie of a Little Planet-\nRecommendable if you liked this clash between a soldier and a girl. \nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/316720/planetarian_the_reverie_of_a_little_planet/", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499817195, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499817303, "recommendationid": "33467966", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505560", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504549517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 190, "steamid": "76561198079417398", "num_games_owned": 176}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Good story, great art, awesome music.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504549421, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504549421, "recommendationid": "34740958", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495183", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500136971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 187, "steamid": "76561197982293787", "num_games_owned": 1063}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a kinetic novel, so if you're expecting any gameplay or choice, look elsewhere. However, if you're willing to experience what is essentially a slideshow comic with a soundtrack, I can recommend this one. The art is very well done, though I wish there were more of it. There are 2 characters that really deserved having their own portraits since they're in more than one scene, but unfortunetly they just get text. A couple scenes reuse assets over again too much, and would have benefitted from some new art.

I want to emphasize that this is NOT a game per se, but rather a visual novel, a kind of illustrated story that progresses at the reader's pace.  Since it is a kinetic novel, I don't want to give spoilers in this review, but what I can say is that this novel is set during the War of 1812 in the Old Northwest, the region now comprising Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.  The precise timeframe is not long after the Battle of the Thames, the battle that destroyed the British army in the western territories and secured the American hold on the original West of the country, laying the foundations for the full Westward expansion of the American people after the way.  It will be of interest to those who like history but don't know much about the history of the Old Northwest.  I think that it will be well-liked by anyone who likes carefully research and well-plotted historical fiction.

Including native American language deserves some credit,\n\nNegatives: Having grown up reading Bernard Cornwall's Sharpe novels, and naturally associating the song 'Over the Hills and Far Away' with young British Tommys far from home, I was very disappointed that the protagonist has spent much of his life on the American frontier, losing the potential story of a stranger in a strange land. The story up to the conclusion wasn't the most original and left me emotionally cold, though I suppose the finale would've been spoilt if it hadn't got me a little.
