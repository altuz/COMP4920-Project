As a sequel to ASA: a space adventure, it is a classic Myst-like or Rhem-like in terms of gameplay, but it is way much more difficult. \nClues are not directly apparent and require some very good observation skills and intuition (you need to figure out if something you see is a clue or simply just part of the surrounding world). Puzzles are very diverse as in the previous opus ASA, but are more difficult. Curiosity and perseverance are a requirement. But even then, it will still be sometimes necessary to take a look into the walkthrough...\n\nI quite enjoyed the wide diversity offered by the exploration in the game. While exploring 6 beautiful worlds in completely different environments, you will be able to use different modes of teleportation, experience time travel, pilot a submarine robot while dodging some prehistoric creature, explore the inside of some beautiful painting\u2026\n\nI really had a lot of fun solving the puzzles. In fact, I became so engrossed in trying to solve them, that I completely lost track of the storyline and forgot about reading the database\u2026 After spending hours grinding my teeth on the puzzles, I realized that the storyline videos were kind of messed up since I had moved back and forth between worlds when I was stuck. Since I had not followed at all the storyline, I decided to start over, and this time, exploring each world one at a time (which I recommend), watching and reading everything.\n\n\nAbout the storyline, the game starts with a video that was, I have to admit, kind of confusing on the first view. Watching it again later while knowing more about the game world helped.\n\nThe story takes place in a parallel world of our solar system.\nYou play as an astronaut who is equipped with a (super-) suit that can be controlled by a (very knowledgeable) AI named MAIDEN. A database storing all informations about the storyline and the game world, as well as a system producing blue energy (some new energy discovered after the events that occured in ASA) are integrated in the suit. This blue matter system can be used to create a shield to protect you, increase your strength, or simply emit blue energy particles to interact with objects made of dark matter. It can be recharged using blue matter wells located a bit everywhere or by playing some minigames (one located in your database and one that is found later in one of the worlds).\n\nAs part of an exploration team of planet Catyph and its moons, you travel and land by yourself on the 6th moon of Catyph where an alien construction with a huge black cube has been sighted. Approching the cube, you accidently activate a mine field surrounding it. Protected by the shield of your suit, you find yourself projected towards the cube which then teleports both of you on the 5th moon of Catyph, Tytaah, using a technology, you learned later, called the Kunci. There, you discover more alien constructions and start to investigate. After fixing a teleporter, you will be tasked to collect black dices in order to save your own planet Terra. To do this, you will have to explore the 6 differents continents (worlds) of Tytaah. \n\n\nThe storyline is very rich with a lot of details, but might be somewhat technically too complex for some people. \nBut contrary to ASA where we had to use a lot of the astronaut diary content to solve puzzles, the disappointing part here was that most of the reading content is useless to play the game. I think only three puzzles use some little information from the database. So I would say that the database is mostly destined to people who like reading and are curious to learn more about the black cube series world.\n\nTo continue the comparison to ASA, Catyph offers better graphics and a greatly improved AI. In ASA, the AI made me feel like a small kid. In Catyph, it made me feel like a scientist, telling me all kind of scientific informations about the environment. I found that kind of cool.\n\nI would recommend playing the previous opus ASA first. Puzzles are mostly easier and it starts as a good introduction to the black cube serie and helps understand Catyph storyline better as it refers a lot to facts and characters previously introduced in ASA. \n\n\nIn all, I found that Catyph was an amazing game, all the more impressive as it was achieved by only one person. There are sadly so few challenging puzzle games nowadays that it really was a pleasure to play this game.\n\nSo big thanks to the developper to have brought us such a wonderful game. I am looking forward to the next opus!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502033665, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502138947, "recommendationid": "34062586", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501699", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
