With races playing out across a wide variety of sci-fi settings, it manages to make them look pretty convincing. Though you can spot some less-than-incredible textures if you stop and scrutinise every rock or building, in motion everything looks glorious. Wheels kick up dust or snow where applicable, missiles create very satisfying fireballs and damaged cars leave a spectacularly excessive trail of flame in their wake. The car designs of course take their basis from Rollcage, with wheels taller than the body. A lot of effort has gone into making them look more believable, with most wheels actually floating off the axle - a blue glow implying some magnetic trickery going on.\n\n\n[h1]How does it sound?[/h1]\n\nIn keeping with the aim of replicating the feel of classic racers, the soundtrack is primarily made up of drum 'n' bass from contemporary artists, and it works extremely well. There's a good variety of pieces, though they're randomly selected at the start of a race - meaning they're not specifically designed for or matched to any particular ingame track or environment. Regardless, it's good listening and fits the game perfectly. Sound effects are a mixed bag. On the whole everything works, some effects are excellent - you really feel it when an assassin missile impacts for example. However, a lot of sounds - including important things like some of the cars' engines - are placeholder thanks to the game's early access nature. One car's engine is often barely audible, while the recently-added inbuilt boost sounds somewhat pathetic when activated. There are some really nice touches though, such as echo effects when passing through cave areas.\n\n\n[h1]How does it play?[/h1]\n\nAs a whole, Grip can feel quite sluggish at times. A conscious decision has been made to give the cars the feeling of a lot of weight, which is fair enough. Unfortunately that means acceleration can be painfully slow and turning tends to have a lot of understeer, leading to frustration when the car just doesn't make the turn. This is in stark contrast to its spiritual predecessor, in which the vehicles felt almost weightless. Once you come to terms with Grip's handling, though, it's not bad at all - although classic arcade-style drifting isn't really an option thanks to the understeery model, there's plenty of room for skill in taking optimal lines. The game's big gimmick, the ability to drive on walls and ceilings, works a treat, with transitions being perfectly smooth and tracks making creative use of it. The 'launch' ability allows cars to jump quite a height, and opens up even more possibilities for shenanigans - though I feel it runs the risk of being too much of an extraneous gimmick. Although the vast majority of the time the game behaves very well, there is an unfortunate and long-standing bug which can cause cars to suddenly stop or bounce violently for seemingly no reason. Hopefully this gets squashed, as it is common enough to be frustrating.\n\nThe 'combat' part of the combat racer moniker comes with the wide - and still widening - array of powerups at racers' disposal. Appearing as green holograms at predetermined points on the track, pickups will grant one of many weapons and tools for either making someone else's life miserable or making your own more comfortable. Missile hits will blast cars clean off the track, while the 'Ram Raider' generates a repulsive field around your car, pushing adversaries away. The chaos that can ensue when a pack of cars is vying for position is remarkable. There is some limited interplay between powerups - the 'Raptor' machinegun can be used to destroy mines while a barrier shield can protect racers from attacks from behind. Planned for the future is destructible scenery, with the first steps towards that goal being already present on one of the tracks.\n\nTrack variety is already quite good, with ten ingame spread across the four environments. There are a couple of arenas to support the deathmatch game mode and a large number of 'carkour' maps that rigorously test your control of the cars. As stated earlier, good use is made of the cars' ability to drive on any surface, especially in tracks created later in development.\n\nThere are currently eight cars available across three manufacturers, each with their own visual style and performance specialties. The 'Terra' manufacturer has a bulky, armoured appearance and its cars tend to be good all-rounders. 'Cygon' looks very futuristic and features very polarised cars - they harbour the slowest and most controllable car in the game alongside the fastest and least controllable. 'Vintek' take cues from classic cars, the old rollcage games and a bit of scrapyard chic with surprisingly good agility. Cars are categorised into three groups - the agile, quick-off-the-mark 'speedsters', the balanced 'all rounders' and the fast, tough but unwieldy 'tanks'. Car balance is currently fairly good, with certain cars being favoured over others depending on the track but few situations where a choice would be completely incapable of winning.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer?[/h1]\n\nSplitscreen functionality has been present for a long time and works well, but requires two controllers to work. It will not work with just a keyboard, or a keyboard and a controller at present. Online multiplayer was added recently and is very fun if you can find a race, but has been plagued with crashes, bugs and disconnects. The most recent patch addressed this to a large degree but multiplayer is still very unreliable by most accounts. Numbers online are generally very low, and it's probably best to try and organise races via the game's Discord channel which has a fair few active users.\n\n\n[h1]Closing thoughts[/h1]\n\nGRIP is already very, very playable. Despite being in early access with all the rough edges and issues that entails it's presented very professionally with active and receptive developers who have a lot of dedication for the game. Although there are still a lot of technical issues - some severe - in many parts of the game (most cripplingly, multiplayer) I am confident that they will be solved in the future. As it is now, racing in singleplayer works perfectly fine and multiplayer is very good fun - if it behaves itself. Though I will recommend the game, be warned that there are many frustrating issues still to be fixed that might not go away for some time.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505174469, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505175663, "recommendationid": "34892320", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523675", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505189247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 291, "steamid": "76561198274537149", "num_games_owned": 26}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "At first, I was a little hesitant, because I'm sure we all know how a lot of  revamps turn out these days, but I was far from disappointed with GRIP. So far, this is turning out to be exactly like the older Rollcage games. Having played both Rollcage and Rollcage Stage II, GRIP is almost like the late threquel to the series. Yes, it's still a work in progress, and seeing other reviews, lots of people apparently fail to realize that, but it IS getting better. Another thing people complain about is the steering. Well, if you played the above mentioned rollcage games, you'd soon find out that the steering was never easy to begin with, but you gotta practice. There's this wonderful thing called drifting, and it's highly involved in the rollcage series, a lot more so in this one. The old ones, well, of course physics aren't gonna be as good. That's 90's tech right there, but you'd soon find out, especially with the faster vehicles, that you have to drift quite often. All of that aside, I give this game a 5/5, and I'm very much looking forward to what the developer has in store next.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505174052, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505174052, "recommendationid": "34892265", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505411", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506604951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 225, "steamid": "76561197998125061", "num_games_owned": 94}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great game, nice graphics, very fast and hard to master. fun arcader. still needs alot added though, feels alittle bare bones still, not many tracks and cars. there no tournament part to the game which it really needs.
