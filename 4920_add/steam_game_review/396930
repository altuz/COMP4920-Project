Detailed crates sit next to stretched roof top images.  Sharp edged plants are drawn in with mostly blurry soft trees.  The screenshots and video look good in low resolutions but even something as low as Standard Defintion easily shows how inconsitent the imagery is.  Push anything higher than High Definition and the Tidal Affair starts looking pretty bad.\n\nThere are compression artifacts and bad alpha blending on some of the textures that are disturbingly amateur.  Some objects layering appears to be incorrect with the bottoms of tree trunks appearing on top of folliage that should be infront.\n\nThe levels are large but sparesly populated.  The puzzles consit mostly of running back and forth through the silly make-work mazes rather than being cerebrally challenging.  There is button pushing, so much button pushing.\n\nThe combat is strange with Manisha sometimes being a bullet sponge and sometimes just keeling over and dying.  The health bar is largely pointelss as individual map roaming enemies do little damage but the elite guards swamp and kill her easilly.  The umbrella - which she pulls out of her leg - seems to do several times more damage than any bullets.\n\nThere are many instant environmental deaths.  The comic falls onto beach sand or water just beneath her feet, exploding into beef gibs when pricked by a spike.  And.  Well there are many environmental deaths just nor many variations.\n\nThe stealth is also a bit hit-and-miss.  There have been occasions where Manisha has been crouched but still spotted when she really shouldn't have been.  Not that it usually matters: being detected doesn't carry much penalty, except when the elite commando squads decide to investigate.  \n\nThe mind control portion of the game is not quite right.  The tedious approach of suiciding single guards is far safer than trying to setup scenarios where the 'best' guard can take the others down.  Don't get swamped, give Manisha space to run away and there's no real challenge.\n\nLastly the animations are slidy and stilted.  Achievments are given despite failing those achievements.   The menus and interface are... bad.  And the cut scenes and dialogue are even worse.\n\nIt's a pity, but there's not much going for Tidal Affair.  If you want a  mind controlling stealth game then play Abe's Oddesy instead.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463692231, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463739781, "recommendationid": "23087895", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514849", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1487804238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 51, "steamid": "76561198081177902", "num_games_owned": 179}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Has this game a great concept? Oh yeah! Was it executed well? No!\nthe concept off puppetering combined with stealth is awesome! but...\n\nthe player lacks freedom. You need to kill your puppet or you will get chased by some overpowered new soldiers that are able to always find you unless you run away. You will get chased and there is nothing you can do about it. You can't kill the enemy stealthly cause the instakill is way too unreliable. And if you play it as a full stealth game the game lost it's purpose. The stealth system is too plain and you get an instant loss if you need to run from those overpowered soldiers that spawn when the alarm is triggerd cause you can't run past all those soldiers you let live.\n\nsince the stealthsystem is plain and simply doesn't work well with the current way puppetering functions the game lost it's purpose and i would not recommend it", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487847797, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487847797, "recommendationid": "30116759", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522070", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464508952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 509, "steamid": "76561198011942380", "num_games_owned": 933}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "2", "review": "This review should be considered as neutral. I don't want to write negative review, but I can't make it positive also.\n\nThe main plus of this game (and what sold it to me) was graphic style. I love it. It's interesting and uncommon. Stealth tag also have some influence, but don't rush if (like me) it's enough for you to spend some bucks on small discount. Game have 2 major minuses - bad gameplay design and controls.\n\nThe whole 8 hours I have played it I have suffered from controls. Main gameplay feature require you to control enemies and their guns, but you almost can't point cursor where you want because it's jumping like crazy all over the place. And it's for joystick. Mouse and keyboard are not setup completely by default and even if you will use mouse it's even more horrible than joypad. Too bad that I asked about this on forums only at the end. Because (from developers response) it occurs that game have problem with mouse and joystick enabled together. And if you will use only K+B it's working perfectly as I wanted. Keep this in mind. This game is muuuch more enjoyable with fluent controls.\n\nSecond - gameplay design. It's just... plain, old (90th), some times stupid. I hope in next game they will have less timing puzzles with spikes, mines and other devices that looks like something completely out of place. Like unlimited flying rockets that block your path and you need to duck to pass them. It's just stupid. Enemies always know where you are if alarm is ringing. And the best strategy is run back until countdown ends. Or check the second steam screenshot with rolling ball. Seems like logic didn't made it alive from this level.\n\nSome times you can't tell where floor met the hole and you character will dive into the unknown. Sometimes you will guess what you need to do next. It's not often, but annoying. Also it seems like they didn't found a way to make more variety to 'control' mechanics. Just add a little more 'patches' (ingame name) variety and more puzzles with them and game will fill much better.\n\nSo it's up to you. If you are still reading and still want to play - give it a try. You might find something to entertain you for an evening or two. Or check the demo (from search, they didn't linked it on game page).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464805945, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1464805994, "recommendationid": "23331580", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509746", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1469151150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 214, "steamid": "76561198057557525", "num_games_owned": 221}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you're worried about this being a visual novel because of the title, worry not. \n\nIt's a stealth adventure where you can sneak around mind-controlling people. Atmospheric, with lush jungle environments, feels like you're moving through a painting. Painted isometric games are extremely far and few between these days, so snap this up if you're a fan. The visual style is eyecatching and evocative. I was rather surprised to learn that the game itself was created in only ten months, as there's a tonne of content in it. Levels are easy at first but rapidly evolve in complexity to require careful planning and skilled puppeteering.\n\nI'm not a fan of stealth games in general, but it was compelling enough that I found myself staying up well past midnight to get to the next level... and the next...
