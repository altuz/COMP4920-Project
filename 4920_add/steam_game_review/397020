I just need to get into it a little more. I seem to be having some issues with the FPS I try everything possible to fix this. I might just need some help on it. My system is more than good enough to run this game so I dont know what the issue is. I have a video posted below so you can see first hand some of the gameplay. Sorry for the FPS like I said I could not figure out how to fix it. \n\nAlso when I was trying to do the next level it woud not go past the loading screen for at least 3 mins I would wait a few weeks on this game. But I do seeing it being a good game so I am about 70/30 right now.\n\nUpdate: The game keeps crashing on me so I would wait for a few weeks till this has been fixed.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-pXmqaH1BM", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445541733, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1445611818, "recommendationid": "18629389", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489091", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
