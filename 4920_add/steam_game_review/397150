The world generation has several cool different biomes and you can fly to other planets to check them out. The art looks amazing so far. Unfortuantly the lighting in this game is really bad currently and takes it down a few notches and the fog effects can be a little much. \n\nI am running this game on a gtx 1080 and getting pretty solid 75 fps at 3440 by 1440 and find it runs very well.\n\nSome cons --->\n\n-Story mode could use a way point with compass to keep things moving. \n-Game keeps crashing when I try to use a key card on a door in story mode. \n-The lighting is pretty crap not at all like trailer in my experience (tried changing settings)\n-No survival mode yet", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504920441, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504922524, "recommendationid": "34826644", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 64, "total_reviews": 91, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 27}}
