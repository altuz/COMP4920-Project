Ok it's heavy on text and light on graphics, but the accuracy of the data and attention to detail are enough to suck you into the game and I find it most satisfying playing a full 24 hour scenario in real time (as long as you have something to do while you wait). The tutorials are easy to follow and fun to play on their own. The only thing I would like to see improved is the inclusion of some kind of graphical or photographic representation of the different ships and planes added to the database. I found myself Googling all of the units on my iPad as I played, just to give my imagination a bit more information to play with.

After reading many comments about it I was expecting a massive learning curve but that just isnt the case.\n\nAdmittedly I am used to playing complex flight sims like Tornado and EF2000, not to mention games like ARMA3, Silent Hunter and Paradox's strategy games. But this game seems to me to be rather intuitive. I was surprised for example to find out you cannot manually deploy the towed array on the subs. But when I thought about it I realised that well you dont have to lower the landing gear on the planes or manually taxi them so why have to carry out the sub routine operations? \n\nWhen that clicked I realised that this game is not about micormanagement. Its about knowing how to use your assets, and having them ready when they are needed, and in the right place at the right time, and whether they are employed in stealth or in active detecting mode. Yes you have to know about how to use them to their best advantage - employing BVR weapons high up to get the range, having attack aircraft low down to mask their approach etc. That is all modelled in the game. But its not about determining how the units perform thier missions in detail, that stuff is left to the AI.\n\nOnce all that clicked I realised this is actually a very easy game to play once you know your way around the panels, but a difficult one to master. \n\nAnd its a lot more fun that I was expecting too.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488236873, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489006035, "recommendationid": "30229772", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553376", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492499431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4841, "steamid": "76561198131875548", "num_games_owned": 53}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 31, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I played \"Harpoon\" from when it was new until long after it had disappeared then re-appeared on the web. This game is infinitely closer to the reality of the periods it is set in. The ranges and models of the various machines are excellent and it is obvious a lot of time was spent on getting them correct. A lot of the information in the various fact sheets does not have images or stories and bare facts are a little disappointing. The quantity of items is breathtaking but I would still like to see more images and stories.\n\n The creators of this version have gone to great lengths to improve the complexity and control. I missed some of the aspects of the old games. The ability to apply air patrols into geometric selections around the ships and airfields and so on made it easier to set up a fleet action. Those patrols were then invisible until they were forced into action which saved some clutter on the screen. The current game has various ways to set up patrols that allow a lot more control but begin to become tedious and adds that clutter I was talking of\n\nIt may be that the years of playing Harpoon spoiled my appreciation of this game but I am finding difficult to get the same enjoyment from it. It is recommended by me for those people who need to get their minds off many hours of life and bury themselves in complex but not always satidfying tasks. It is borderline to being an excellent game.

After playing extensivly I and enjoying it I feel an update is required. The biggest factor for me is the price. The full game at almost \u00a370 is a joke but this is C:NI somewhat cheaper and I got it on sale.\n   The missions for NI are great, they are well scripted and require thought and planning to succeed. For this alone the pice I paid was worth it. Replayability is limited because of the games lack of AI. The missions attempt to funnel you into specific directions where the limited AI be set up. Going around often turns a finley balenced situation into an easy win. The problem is once you have played a mission you know what the designer expects you to do. \n    The fiddlyness of the controls is something you get used to and the poor resolution of the map at close in zooms is ugly but not a deal breaker. The poor AI on both sides is something that is greatly mittigated by manualy controling every asset. This however leads to the absolute worst fault the game has to offer. Manualy controling a large fleet with a huge air wing is a grind but if you dont the following will happen;\n\n-Aircraft will decide to return to bace or refule in air when extreamly close to intercepting dangerouse incomming enemy despite the refueling aircraft being extreamly far away.\n-Aircraft will follow enemy back to thire airfield and promptly get shot down by SAM, if you set them to stick to a patrol area they will ignore enemy that are very close just outside of the patrol area.\n-Aircraft will run out of fuel as the AI cant always figure out when to return to a home ship that has changed course or speed.\n-Support aircraft dont attempt to run from incomming enemy.\n\nDespite this and many more issues I do like this game and want to love it. I can recomend NI especial on sale but the devs have got alot to do before I or anyone elce should think about the full game.
