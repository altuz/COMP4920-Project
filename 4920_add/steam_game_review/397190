BUT, it's just impossible to play in any meaningful way.  \n\nFor example, My superior, general-led yari samurai charged an ashigaru unit in the flank, then they are described as DISADVANTAGED ?  They lost more casualties - how can a unit charged in flank even fight back to any extent, let alone kill more men ?\n\nMy unit of ashigharu was in a villaage, gets fired on by arqubuses which inflict 50 - yes 50 - casualties (despite the cover), the unit falls back and is then charged frontally by the same matchlock-armed unit and beaten.  Really, against formed spear-armed troops ?\n\nThe computer's cavalry units seem capable of charging anything and beating it - spear-armed troops, no problem !  They will then follow up any routing units by conveniently charging other units behind.  My pursuers seem to invariably stop, or be turned by the computer to face in some useless direction.\n\nI had 2 computer units virtually surrounded by about 6 of mine, and they just kept fighting, turn after turn.\n\nOh, and the computer always makes sure that it inflicted 40% casualties on you by the end of turn 20, so that you lose.\n(And this is only on difficulty setting 2.)\n\nThe Japanese setting also makes it impossible to mass troops for an attack.  Your CinC can't move, his command has to stay within command range, so they have to be left behind when you set out after the enemy.  Straight away you are 20% of your army down, compared with the computer.\n\nI have been playing wargames for 50 years.  I really wish that this was better,  It could be a good game - but it's not!\nVery disappointed.  8o(", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498388960, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498388960, "recommendationid": "32767213", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528096", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503962023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 624, "steamid": "76561198042210567", "num_games_owned": 135}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": 0, "review": "not worth the money. the rng is terrible- your elite cav fall into disorder charging a peasant mob whereas the computer cav will break your samurai spear wall. you'll shoot arrows and guns at peasants for 3 turns and they will be fine while your elite cav will become disordered after getting hit by one shot. it's not fun. i know it doesn't always go down like this, but it will seem like it does because you'll remember the bad more than the average. \n\nthe historical battles require luck or trial and error to win. not fun. i won one the other day. it looked like it was going bad and then the rng swung in my favor and i won a couple key melees to eek out a victory. i try again this evening and it goes terribly. i tried again and did essentially the same thing and almost won. this just isn't fun. maybe if you're interested in the history of the battles it would be fun, i don't know.\n\n all the campaigns seem the same. there are like 12 if you have the dlc an idiot like me bought before playing. they all seem the same, but the your first campaign will be fun because unlike historical battles, you deploy your army. you can buy troops for your armies and choose where and when to fight. winning, if you play these games, can be expected if you plan well. it's fun, but like i said, they all seems the same.\n\noh, and then there is the koreans and the chinese. they have mostly missile troops so battles are about as fun as chasing down horse archers that continually rout and rally. just finishing tutorial 3 was a huge chore and that was a tutorial- think of how bad a real battle is. whether you are the one doing the hearding or praying for the rally as your horses approach the board edge, you're equally frustrated. here the rng kills it again. and chasing down skirmishers by charging every turn is terribly boring too.\n\ni'm an experienced wargamer- i play GG's war in the east and lots of games like this. i play games like this on the tabletop with miniatures. this has none of the charm pike and shot had. leave this kusoge alone\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491928191, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491928191, "recommendationid": "31081137", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527821", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498578196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 32, "steamid": "76561197979856889", "num_games_owned": 216}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this game is less skill and  tactics based and more personal luck based", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498578237, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498578237, "recommendationid": "32859722", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488070", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493743589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 2000, "steamid": "76561198006756264", "num_games_owned": 205}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's great, \nIt's great, \nIt's great.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492581843, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492581867, "recommendationid": "31231747", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482833", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 24, "total_reviews": 33, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 9}}
