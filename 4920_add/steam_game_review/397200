You might find the serial killer scary, but he just has loud music play and if he's behind you he'll kill you without you ever seeing him because he runs so fast. Which brings me to another thing - you won't be able to outrun him if he ever catches a glimpse of you. So you have to avoid someone completely - without ever knowing where he is in the first place.\n\nThere is little detail to fill this huge maze-like map, and if you're not planning your exact route you can find yourself lost and running in circles. Most of your gametime will include looking for batteries for your flashlight that runs out way too fast, and dying repeatedly to the naked man with the axe that can somehow walk around this building in complete darkness with no problem.\n\nBut one thing to keep in mind is this game was put together by a bunch of students, so if you feel like I'm being a little harsh, by all means try the game out. I personally cannot recommend the game because it was not fun for me to play. It doesn't make you want to complete the game - especially since if you happen to step into the wrong hallway, you die and start over. There is no progression.\n\nEDIT: Here's my gameplay. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6p001SIpy4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441054608, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441403088, "recommendationid": "17818745", "language": "english", "votes_down": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583745", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448181273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 290, "steamid": "76561198124265672", "num_games_owned": 93}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game has some positives and negatives just like other games. \n\nPositives: \nIt's a well made game\nThe idea is cool\nCreepy\n\nNegatives:\nThe hands at the beginning. \nSometimes he kills you right away, but sometimes he takes you to the execution room where, after a long wait, he kills you.\nI'm not sure if it's even possible to get away from him with sprinting.\nThe tesseract is a cool idea, but is annoying.

What starts off as intially fun soon takes a turn for the worse with the constant restarting, recollecting and rethinking of your current strategy (the constant reviewing of the rubbery hands is enough to cause borderline paranoia in itself).  The map itself is vague and difficult to understand even though it says \"Cell\" on it (where you start off).  Batteries are one of the most important items needed in the game but at times seem to be far and few apart (one time I opened the lockers at the beginning near the cell and it rendered not even a single battery!) Bursting lightbulbs and pipes add a good touch to the psychological experience and jump scares (even after almost 9 hours of gameplay it still causes this scenario with me).  The concept of having stamina attached to sprinting was not well thought up as this is the only means to escape walter (which I did once by dumb luck!)  \n\nA few things that could've fixed this game a bit is the following:\n\n1. Allow the players to save the game 1 time anywhere (then after this if they die make them start over completely).\n2. Allow for the use of environmental aspects (objects or items which could slow walter down)\n3. Dont make gamers sit through that extended scene at the end (where you're strapped in the chair waiting for him to kill you off as sometime it takes more than 10-15 seconds for him to show up). I found this to be constantly annoying and I could've already been making my way back through the game.  \n\nIn the end, my verdict 3/10 at best\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453324711, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1453324711, "recommendationid": "20649440", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499987", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489079325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 67, "steamid": "76561198260468866", "num_games_owned": 12}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "game is shit, map looks like shit and a naked man that chases u, also looks like shit!!!! 5$, this game should be free\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464425960, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1464425960, "recommendationid": "23248823", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497115", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443315985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21, "steamid": "76561198252051324", "num_games_owned": 19}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Poo as fuck", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443316071, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443316071, "recommendationid": "18212503", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487661", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1441054072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 41, "steamid": "76561198014522138", "num_games_owned": 577}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This game has a cool idea, its effectively a rogue-like horror game where the enemy (enemies?
