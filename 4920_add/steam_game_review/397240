It starts off as a Rayman clone but after awhile it starts to get interesting and throws in creative new gameplay elements. Some stages are so unexpected in their imagination. The game has some unpolished elements and a few bugs and glitches. But it hasn't crashed and nothing has broken the game. I'll admin that I could never finish a Rayman game because they're just too difficult for me. Troubles Land might be too easy because I'm getting 3-star stage completions. It doesn't require collecting every jewel. It's a lighter challenge, but I think that's okay. I've completed 3 of the 5 worlds at the time of this review and I think I already got my $10 worth. At this point I'm excited and pleased with the game.
