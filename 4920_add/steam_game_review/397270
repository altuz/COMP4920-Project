(Then what's explored in the story, you might ask? Well, see below for story.)\n\n[b]Story:[/b] (Spoiler Alert? Nah, I don't think so.)\nEverything begins with that Nosy girl chasing that Class Skipper girl every day.\n[spoiler]Day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day...[/spoiler]\nAnd all of a sudden...BOOOO! they got into a relationship!

I can't say too much about the art style, which depends heavily on personal preferences, but I can tell you the CGs are SUPER DUPER REPETITIVE. \n[b][u]Music:[/u][/b] Didn't leave me an impression. So, whatever.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nI really don't get some of the Japanese Animes and their fans now...\nWhy would people even like this sort of made-up BS...\nWell...If you just wanna watch two girls doing those guilty pleasure things, [spoiler]I have to admit that's my initial intention, but the worst game experience ever COMPLETELY deprives you of the guilty pleasure of watching Yuri.[/spoiler]you can give it a try, though.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503716277, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503716697, "recommendationid": "34495040", "language": "english", "votes_down": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480654", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 234, "total_reviews": 253, "num_reviews": 8, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 19}}
