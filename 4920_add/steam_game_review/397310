I bought a copy as a gift for my wife so we could play together. She gave it a shot, then asked my why I pick such masochistic games.The game is pretty, but it's not fun.\n\nThe gameplay is horse shit. The enemies are fast moving tanks, meaning gameplay is literally just running around hoping something eventually will die. If you stop moving, that something quickly becomes you. And since every shot here counts, be aware that only about 1/3rd will land on their target. The other 2/3rds will fly off into the ether because there is nothing to help you line up the shot in this 3rd person shooter.\n\nIf this game were a blind date, it would lure you in with it's charm then underperform in the sack. You would make up a number to give it the morning after, then take the walk of shame.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504999481, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504999529, "recommendationid": "34849014", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506288", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 25, "total_reviews": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 8}}
