I recommend this game if you don't see multiplayer as your kind of style, but like me and most of the community, it would be nice to have an built-in multiplayer option. I understand why they can't do it as you need servers and all that, but atleast make it available for people to make dedicated vanilla servers. Because right now, everyone needs a mod to connect to a server, and even then, you cant shoot anyone down, you can still pause the game (???) and you can collide into another player and do no damage. For people who like to mess with friends in multiplayer, this isin't the game for you, BUT it still is a good game, and eventually I hope they add multiplayer.
