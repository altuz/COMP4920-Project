I've played this game on and off for over 2 decades now, really happy it's come to Steam.  The atmosphere, the music, the balance between running an economy and tactical castle-seige combat is so good that it's still a lot of fun even after all this time.  The AI pathing in combat is a little wonky compared to more modern games but it's good enough that it shouldn't make much of a difference.
