But there are other details that makes the game very boring to play.\n\nThe characters have no diversity.\nThe captain moves ship.\nThe scientist researches cards.\nThe cook makes the recipes and burns useless cards.\nThe engeener fix stuff.\nAnd they don't do anything else.\n\nIt's advertised as a coop game but it's more fun to play on your own because characters are so simple that you can handle them all with no trouble.\n\nI'd really like if this game had characters with more diverse functions OR make them able to fill eachother's role. Some rebalance of the luck and overall progress of the whole game would also be appreciated.\n\nIf this was reworked into a board game with the following features I'd probably buy it.

It is an intense game that can be played casually. It saves your progress after every turn so it is fun to eat dinner and unwind to after work. Like most strategy games, it takes some time to get in the groove and you die a lot. Then, you start to get in a pattern and it becomes addicting. I like the art style and graphics, sounds are OK and easily adjusted, and the game itself typically freezes and dies and has to be restarted nearly once per game- it's pretty simple to restart so it's only a minor annoyance.

The RNG is unforgiving, even on easy mode. Each character's turn suffers a new RNG event and these events can build up into cataclysmic affairs should you and your coworkers receive a series of bad hands. I think it would be better if all four characters' turns were counted as a single round with just one RNG event, as that would be easier to bounce back from. Otherwise, offering the option to adjust the level of RNG events in the game would be a welcome addition to the menu.

This resulted in improper readings on shields, crisis countdowns and more. It was a nightmare! We are still determined to complete a match, but are still facing the same desync issues. \n\nI have only had one match where the desync did not occur. \n\nOverall, the game is loads of fun and worth a shot if you only plan on playing single player. Things are pretty unstable and I would not recommend this to anyone looking to play this with friends (which is the reason why I purchased this game).\n\nWill update my review once this major bug is fixed.\n\nUPDATE: Now each player is getting a DIFFERENT crisis on their screen due to the sync bug.
