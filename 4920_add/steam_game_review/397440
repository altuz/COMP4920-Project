You get to travel to different locations and buy this on special as the price it is at normal rate is quite steep and will take a few hours to 5 hours depending on how long it takes to solve puzzles and if you use hint button. I liked the music and graphics and you will be surprised who is behind everything sort of like in the Scooby Doo cartoon and a nice game to play with children.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464580911, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1464580911, "recommendationid": "23284983", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453553910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 344, "playtime_forever": 129, "steamid": "76561197970078168", "num_games_owned": 844}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Average hidden-object game.\nStory is so-so.\nSome original puzzles.\nOverall, it bored me.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453553961, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1453553961, "recommendationid": "20700184", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493656", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498595997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 242, "steamid": "76561198194774666", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A MUST TO OWN...AWSOME", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498671199, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498671199, "recommendationid": "32947786", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
