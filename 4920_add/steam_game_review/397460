Definitely worth it. If I had a nickel for every time I've packed my laptop to a house party JUST FOR THIS GAME, I'd have enough money to buy the trilogy. You just need your laptop and an internet connection to start it up. Listen, the game uses your phone as the controller, which means literally every single person you ask to play with you immediately have a frame of reference for how it works. That's priceless. No teaching controls, no explaining mechanics, just \"look at the TV, go to that site, enter the code.\" I don't care if you have an Android, iPhone, or cheap knockoff iPad; if you have an internet browser, you can play this game. The games offer the prompt, then your phone's browser lets you submit your response. Super easy. I've seen socially reserved people suddenly become the funniest f***er at the party, not because they're social butterflies, but because they were witty with their lies on Fibbage. \n\nPLUS, the games are presented in such a way that it can behave like either Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. It's good to play with kids, college students, or adults and still have a good time. The prompts are never inappropriate, but you're responses can definitely be. Players can adapt the game to suit your own friend bubble's sense of humor and it's brilliantly handled. There's also a secondary prize in most games (the best ones at least) based on who had the most liked responses, which people can pick after the answer has been revealed.\n\nThis one comes with 5 games and all of the best ones have an 8 player cap. Each game takes about 10-15 minutes to play, but they have TONS of questions and prompts, so you'll almost never hit one you've seen before and it's pretty easy to corral people to try it out because of the play time. Each game has an announcer that briefly explains the game and the rules, while also presenting the prompts. They're sorta funny; they get some laughs for being super cheesy. You won't want to turn it off for being annoying, at least. They're a little self aware, honestly. Fibbage 2, and Quiplash XL are THE games you need, though. \n\nFibbage 2 is one of the games you're buying this for. It's like the original, but it just feels more well made and tightly focused. It's a trivia game at it's heart, but the questions are less \"fact heavy\" and much more obscure/funny. Sometimes someone will know the answer, but most of the time you're guessing. After everyone has sent in a guess (or the time limit goes off), the game presents a list of options to pick from, which are composed of everyone's responses mixed in with the answer. If someone pick your guess, you get points. If you pick the right answer, you get a lot of points. That means you can win for being convincing with your answer, rather than actually knowing it. Really, really fun game.\n\nEarwax is pretty good, but I've noticed it's a love-it-or-hate-it type of game. Basically, every round a new person will select a prompt from a provided list on their phone. Then, the announcer gives everyone that prompt and each player is given a list of sound byte titles to pick from. You have to select two sound bytes to play sequentially, then the person who picked the prompt will pick whoever the winner is. For example, if the prompt was \"What really happened at Roswell...\", you might want to pick \"Man saying 'Hello!'\" and \"Laser noises.\" You can either be funny or try to be accurate, it depends on who is picking the answers.\n\nBidiots is like Pictionary, except everyone has to \"bid\" on everyone's drawings. It's honestly a little confusing, but it's not terrible. You're given a prompt and have to make a drawing for it using your touchscreen, but you're also given a list of drawings you need to buy, which are really the other players' prompts. The drawings are put up for bidding and you have to pick out the right drawings based on your list of things to buy. You can also outbid other people just to spite them. If you want a Pictionary type game, though, buy Jackbox Party Pack 1 to get Drawful. or just buy the standalone Drawful 2.\n\nQuiplash XL is the second game you're buying this for. At the start of the game, everyone gets two prompts that they have to make up a response for. Prompts could be like \"A sitcom where two pairs of twins marry each other\" or \"Titanic 2: _______\". The catch is that one other player has your same prompt, and everyone is going to vote on the best response of the two. You get points based on the number of votes you get. Sounds simple, but that's why it's so good. It's probably the most approachable Jackbox game. \n\nBomb Corp. is a more team-oriented game. One player is presented with a series of wires and a time limit, while the others are given a manual for how to defuse the bomb. Not a lot to say other than you really need to be on your toes to win this one.\n\nSeriously, though. Get this. It's a great game to break out at a party or just with a small group of friends and super easy to set up.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506054219, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506054219, "recommendationid": "35119988", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501868", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 289, "total_reviews": 308, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 19}}
