The overworld is coverd in snow and almost every location has a cold palette. It's depressing. Even when you get the airship, the music is a melancholic violin arrangement. The story and the gameplay are OK. Not great, not terrible, just OK. Although the story could certainly be a little better presented.\n\nThe ending however, is as disappointing as it could be. It simply... stops. In a cliffhanger. When you think \"oh cool! [b]Now[/b] the final boss is coming\", the game gives you the finger, plays the same music it uses in the opening sequence, scrolls some boring text, and the goes to the credits.\n\nWhat a waste of an opportunity.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503880880, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504388962, "recommendationid": "34542257", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454965733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 320, "steamid": "76561198062102374", "num_games_owned": 52}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Shitt", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500021572, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500021572, "recommendationid": "33531427", "language": "english", "votes_down": 36, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423601", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 90, "total_reviews": 121, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 31}}
