However this game is a simplistic space shooter and bullet hell. You fly through dark space and only your shots can light it up. Black bubbles everwhere. Then appear the bosses in a row. Like rotating red and yellow bullet spreading twisters, rotating lasers or bubble spaceworms. One is changing gravity so that all background bubbles come from one side. Tho the game is flat 2D and the powerups are not very useful or there isn't even a decent tutorial the game makes fun for a short while. If you get hit your dot shrinks down to a minimum dot. A nice game mechanic. Achievements just count from normal difficulty up to nightmare. Local coop included, steam leaderboards and a techno loop soundtrack.

There isn't very much to say about this game but let's talk about it anyway. You're a ball of light who shoots other balls of various colors. Your character and your bullets produce light allowing you to see through the darkness. The more damage you take the less light you produce making it harder to survive. You get get an attack that recharges over a short cooldown and you pickup powerups which can also be used to assist you. You fight bosses and your objective is to make it as far as you can without losing. That's pretty much all there is to say about Shmadow.\n\nThe Good\n[list]\n[*]One of the easiest achievement hunts you'll ever see.\n[*]You can play through the entire game and refund it if you don't enjoy it due to the game being so short.\n[*]You don't need a controller to do well (I got every achievement using keyboard and mouse).\n[*]Due to trading cards existing you'll make a large portion of what you spent on the game (if you bought it on sale) back from selling them.\n[*]Very short soundtrack although it's a very fitting song that doesn't get annoying.\n[*]Regardless of how much playtime you get it's still only 2 USD.\n[*]Several difficulties/modes.\n[*]Really cool bosses.\n[/list]\n\nThe Bad\n[list]\n[*]Super short playtime (15 ish minutes if you're playing normally and 30-90 minutes if you're achievement hunting depending on how good you are at Shmadow). One playthrough of the game is enough for a player to see every boss along with the majority of the content.\n[*]I like the graphics although I cannot deny that there was very little effort put into them.\n[*]There's no tutorial although there's a controls section on the main menu.\n[*]You have to use the powerup to know what it does (they have no titles, just icons) and for a game this short I doubt you want to memorize all of them.\n[/list]\n\nIf you're poor (and I mean very poor) this game isn't a good choice for you considering the lack of playtime you'll get out of it.
