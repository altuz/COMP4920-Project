I really dig the locomotion, the effect at time is quite surprising and had my friends and I losing our shit with laughter as we attempted to glide through the twisting tunnels... I would say on those stages - or anytime you move the player without warning! - a) give them a warning! and b) put a disc or platform underneath the avatar! As is I'm gliding around and it's quite unnatural but fun/cool, but my brain is so confused... I think just adding something under the avatar to 'ride' during the motion would really help a ton.\n\nOtherwise, really well done! Love the aesthetics, the iron/metroid vide is really great. Love the enemies 'character' such as slapping their butts, etc... and as others have mentioned, really great deal with such a good price. Ive got games that are in the 20 buck range that aren't half as good/fun as this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499825487, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499825487, "recommendationid": "33469752", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500911799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 124, "steamid": "76561198063942102", "num_games_owned": 185}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very solid game..  It's a wave shooter, but there's more.  locomotion takes you through the level.  I was getting a bit of a metroid vibe but it's more like pong with levels than metroid. \n\nShooting is a bit like pong because the balls bounce around and you can hit enemies on the rebound.\n\nFinished the game.
