Except the controls are terrible (and never explained, you have to figure them out), there are no options to change settings/key bindings/etc, and there is no multiplayer. Not to say it isn't entertaining: the challenge of battling the game's poor controls to try and get a good time is kinda fun. If you think $2 is worth an hour or so in a cheap racing game doing time trials, go for it.

It's got some definite flaws, but it's also clearly a labor of love. It's also got an oddness about it that I'm not sure what the origin is.\n\nThe whole game feels like it was designed as homebrew for the GBA until very late in its development. From the windowed resolution that doesn't quite seem to be 16:9, to the low-res textures and skybox, to the ripped-straight-from-F-ZERO:MaximumVelocity camera angle and mostly-flat tracks, to the super-low-rez menu and UI elements. Sure, a lot of this might be a stylistic choice, but I'm pretty sure everything in this game outside of the render output resolution and track polycount would have been more than possible on the GBA.\n\nEven all that aside, it's a very flat game. GBA racers (such as the aforementioned F-Zero: Maximum Velocity) were frequently steeped in depth. They often had interesting physics, lots of customization, a multitude of tracks, and were portable. Nulldrifters has 16 tracks, the most 'workable' physics I've seen in a racer in a long time, and I'm pretty sure the eight ships (of which four ar locked) are all functionally identical.\n\nThat said, it's not a bad little game. It's got decent music, with one or two standout tracks, and most of the maps are decent. Though there are four that are designed to piss you off with blind corners leading into narrow sections with no walls, so there's that. If this game was GBA homebrew, it would be pretty impressive. But as a PC release, it's pretty underwhelming.\n\nIt's probably not worth $2 USD, but for the $0.50 I got it for, I had a decently fun time. Pick it up on sale if you're looking for something a little different, just don't expect a lot of depth.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1474478211, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1474478211, "recommendationid": "25622446", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504234", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452215911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 27, "steamid": "76561198044856885", "num_games_owned": 99}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "50/50 review. The game is awesome, no questions, hands down awesome. It looks awesome and the levels are well done, the music is great and it has a sweet feel over all. I definitely recomend it for the price.\n\nHowever, this game needs a darn MENU! I get that its only $2 but do we really have to play it in a little box on the screen? I want to be emersed in the game play, I want to adjust the resolution and graphics and volume and the CONTROLLER setup. Why on earth doesn't this support controllers? If they added a menue where we could adjust things, and if they added a freeplay mode (instead of a 3 lap time trial) it would be perfect. I would have paied $5 happily if they just made those changes. The thing is the levels are quite hard to master, you move very fast and if you want to win without crashing into every single wall you really need to practice (like everything in life) but its difficult when you can't freely drive the tracs. I want to sit and drive the same track over and over and over again, beating my own times without having to reset the level every three laps.\n\nIts seriously an excelent game but I'm finding it hard to play more than a handfull of races with so much missing", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452216888, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452216888, "recommendationid": "20387632", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504461", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456721737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561198137430302", "num_games_owned": 33}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "weres the refunds", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459122618, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1459122618, "recommendationid": "22095343", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488259", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
