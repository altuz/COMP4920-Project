After reading the past year discussion thread of this when it was named \"Faceless: Evil is Behind You\", there was a lot of positive posts. The video alone was a no-brainer, as we have seen nothing but a flood of asset flips disguised as VR games lately.\n\nPutting the whole \"No VR\" debacle aside (it did, just press ALT-ENTER to cycle to VR), it just gets really bad.\n\nIn VR mode, it becomes a great example of do not shoehorn a 2D game into VR. It's your typical WSAD/mouse Doom 2 style movement. On 2D monitor you see a heavy emphasis of forced Motion Blur when the mouse moves around. It's absolutely disgusting in VR.\n\nAs seen in the video, it also has a heavy emphasis on lense flair, that translates into VR as 3d popout dots that are blinding. There is also a lot of texture pop where just random wall textures strobe back and forth between eyes.\n\nTo top this off, a GTX 980 ti suffers from severe frame rate issues. I don't know if its just not optimized or what. But between the jitter and motion blur it's a miserable experience that cannot be played more than 5 minutes.\n\nOk... So this past week I have remained optimistic about it tho. He did mention there would be a \"few bug patches\" and additional graphic options available on the 21st (that didn't happen).\n\nStill optimistic, but the one thing that keeps me very weary is the absolute lack of communication. At least the asset flippers communicate with people buying into their project. But this guy has a track record of not communicating with clients even while freelancing.\n\nJust a few of the forum comments regarding him:\n[quote]https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?91982-Looking-for-experienced-C-programmer&p=455466&viewfull=1#post455466\n\nhttps://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/horror-game-starter-kit[/quote]\n\nFurthermore, even in the discussion thread of this project before Greenlight he RARELY was involved in comments:\n[quote]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/comments/442462032[/quote]\n\n[h1]Suggestion: Do Not Buy. Possibly revisit it into the future. But Do Not Buy, its unplayable. Even on 2D its windowed mode and doesn't look anything like the video.[/h1]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466532594, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1466532594, "recommendationid": "23689909", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545516", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1466327003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18, "steamid": "76561197977123780", "num_games_owned": 90}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "First VR Only then Nothing .
