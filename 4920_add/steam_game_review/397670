Small levels that rotate on themselves to use less assets. Camera transitions are brutal and disorienting. Lots and lots of death traps where the window to jump is a milisecond. Game obviously tried to screw with you on purpose as part of its humor. I am not amused. Sound design is insanity inducing. Your character clips inside obstacles, freezes and a blood drip animation is played out whenever you fail a jump, which feels lazy and incompetent", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494854934, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505094252, "recommendationid": "31768549", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 5}}
