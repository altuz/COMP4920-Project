I'm fine that the game's entirely in Japanese. That's what we non-\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e speakers have Google Translate for. What pisses me off is that even in 2017, we're plagued with games using the Shift-JIS character mapping. You'd think by now that Japanese people would switch over to UTF-8. But no. They're on Shift-JIS still and because of that we using non-Japanese locales with Windows can't even see button or dynamic text.\n\nHey, Valve, how about a new rule for publishing games: The game looks like it's supposed to on every combination of game language and OS locale.
