I would like to see the concept pushed forward so I hate to ding this program too much, but I have to. Here is the deal. The Visuals are poor. Low quality textures, low poly trees, sprite grass and bushes, lots of clipping, the ground itself is just a painted sheet, the water looks all wonky, colors are too bright and cartoonish.  Sit on the floor and as you teleport about you will rarely be placed on the ground. You will either be in it or floating above it. Teleporting itself is so terrible I had to close by eyes tightly to avoid getting slapped in the eyeballs with a blinding flash of light. If you don't care for the 'guided' part of the meditation you will do better to simply get Steam Destinations and find a place you would like to sit. Vesper peak or some of the other Valve workshop postcard locations also all look much better than this program. Or try The Blu, just sit on the ground in the deep ocean instead of poking about or chasing fish. I am sorry, but it is so frustrating to see this implemented so poorly because I know that tools like Cryengine Sandbox can make better visuals right out of the box. It is early access so I won't ask for my money back and I wish them well, but I doubt I will bother firing up the program again any time soon.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492084806, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1492085306, "recommendationid": "31114967", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535539", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498708015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561197994006875", "num_games_owned": 82}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Just bought it and right off it is not woring. Can't even enter the VR part at all. It is like it does not see the vive. I tested my other VR games and they are working just fine.  All hardwair is up to date.
