It felt very pointless at the end because of this but I enjoyed some of the characters and scenarios. \n\n*edit*  Remind me if this game gets an update, I really want to like this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500647147, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500647278, "recommendationid": "33697749", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 70, "total_reviews": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 14}}
