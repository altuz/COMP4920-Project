I was unable to find a configuration that made it accurately score performance.\n\nThe first configuration I tried was to use Logitech wired USB microphone that I had used for Rock Band and put the sound output through my LED TV in game mode.  This produced seemingly sort of ok results, but I decided to test the setup.  I chose some songs with decent range in pitch and just made a constant tone into the microphone.  It scored me pretty well and showed my pitch going up, down, and all over the place.  The variation was despite me just producing a monotone sound.  When I tried singing along, the feedback is often very delayed such that it is hard to use the feedback.  The feedback for singing along and for just producing a completely monotone sound were hard to even distinguish visually.  I'm not a great singer, but I'm not nearly as bad as a monotone sound.\n\nThe second configuration I tried was to use a wireless headset.  I used a Logitech G930 headset which is a wireless headset which is designed to keep latency down.  My theory was maybe the scoring would be better if I removed the sound from the TV getting to the microphone.  The scoring was much, much better in this configuration.  I could see the effect of changing my pitch on the scoring, although it was still very delayed.  The feedback was very hard to do anything with though.  All I could really get out of it was on pitch, off pitch, or so far off it didn't recognize it as an attempt.  It at least didn't score a monotone sound highly.  The feedback was still very delayed a lot of the time.  The feedback seemed to be several words behind a fair amount of the time.  I found the feedback to be almost, but not quite useless.  This was a small improvement over the first configuration.  Another killer problem in this mode is that there is basically no feedback from the microphone to the speakers.  It is really hard to sing when you can't hear yourself (at least for me).  I also tried a variation of this where I had 1 ear pad off on the headset so I could hear myself.  This was the best configuration for me as I could hear the music in 1 ear and hear myself in the other.  It is sad that the game reduced me to this level to try to save it.  Even with this, the feedback wasn't good enough to make me ever want to play the game again.  I feel like I get better feedback just by listening to myself as I sing along to things.\n\nBeyond failing at its primary function of providing feedback on your singing, the game has a bunch of other limitations.  I don't consider these other limitations to be game killers, but they do make the game feel like an alpha release.  The only imnput to the game is keyboard and it only uses 7 keys (4 arrows, enter, space, escape).  This is a very clunky interface for a PC.  It does map extremely well to a steam controller however, so once I set up the input mapping and used the controller it was pretty good.  There are very few options or controls inside the game.  You can switch which microphone you are using in the game, but sound output is controlled by Windows.  I also didn't see any volume controls inside the game.  At one point I had my headset USB dongle plugged in with the headset off and the USB mic plugged in.  This made the game switch to the duet display even though the headset was turned off and I was playing in what would normally be the single player mode.  It didn't seem to let me select how many players I wanted just assuming that number of players = number of mics.  The controls in the game are basically limited to select song, quit, and select from a few different game modes which are pretty similar.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463195732, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463195732, "recommendationid": "22967834", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479795", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459936869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 7, "steamid": "76561198115775534", "num_games_owned": 273}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "That cool we need more music", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459936899, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1459936899, "recommendationid": "22266331", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498035", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478295081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561198034242773", "num_games_owned": 79}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Frankly, I'm disappointed.

I so wanted this to be good. People shoot down singing games all the time for various reasons but I'm assuming the main one is they hate fun. But I am a fun guy. So I like them.\n\nI do not like this.\n\nThe song selection is fine, a little poppy but it's to be expected. That's what's OK about this game. Now onto the negatives. (tl;dr at bottom)\n\n- [b][u]Inconsistant and sporadic mic support.[/u][/b] It really is a lottery which mic will work even adequately with this game. \u00a3120 Logitec G35 mic? Awful. Cheap webcam mic? Not great but better. But perhaps this is an issue with expensive headsets and noise-cancelling so I'll excuse it. The mics that seem to work best (though not to an acceptable level) are Singstar USB mics. Which brings me to my next 2 issues;\n\n- [b][u]The devs don't know their own game.[/u][/b] On the support thread they said Singstar mics aren't compatible with this game. To which numerous people have replied that Singstar mics are fine. Like I said, they're the lesser of many evils. Not too much of an issue but doesn't instill me with confidence.\n\n- [b][u]The game doesn't handle low octaves well.[/u][/b] Ok so you've got your mics up and running and you're ready to start. Oh one more thing. Are you male with a normal male singing register? Oh you are? GG, find another game. The beauty of Singstar is you can change octave and the game rolls with it no bother. SIng in a lower octave than the singer on the track, sing in a higher one, it's not an issue. With Let's Sing, with the same mics it is a different story. Despite singing at the same volume as when you sing higher notes, be forced into a pitch too low and the game just won't pick it up. Perhaps this means I'm not the game's target audience, I don't know. But considering the game's music is mostly comprised of female vocalists and male tenors like Sam Smith and James Blunt I guess I'm shit out of luck anyway. Now for the most bizzarre problem;\n\n- [b][u]The music videos appear UPSIDE-DOWN.[/u][/b] That's right. Not even the whole screen. It can't be an issue my end as the interface appears the correct way up through the song. The lyrics, the bars to hit, all fine. But every single music video has been flipped upside-down. I know I'm not the only one with this issue as I have seen others post their screenshots on the Community Hub.\n\n- [b][u]Price.[/u][/b] I really hate it when people moan about game prices. You choose to pay it or you don't, that's your call as the consumer. What I'M referring to when I say price is it's priced at \u00a318.99 without the introductory discount. If you're going to charge serious game prices, make sure you're serious about your game. This is just a broken mess.\n\nSo in conclusion.....\n\n[b]tl;dr: Devs have released a buggy game that they don't know anything about. Avoid, especially if you're male. If not avoid it anyway, it's not good at all.[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453920781, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1453920781, "recommendationid": "20790819", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507697", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454234226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 9, "steamid": "76561197975471797", "num_games_owned": 2273}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Its Broken on some Computers, the Videos arent playing.
