Now I am glad to find that game on steam. \n\nHonestly I think steam is not the best platform for crowd funding games, since most players expect to get a playable game even though it is tagged \"Early Access\". \n\nTo make it clear for everyone: This game is in development and far from a playable title. But I reccommend everyone who is interested by this extraordinaire gameplay idea, please support the development by spending a ridiculus amount of 3,99\u20ac and watch the game grow to maturity - the more supporters, the better.\n\nAnd I am not in any way connected with the developers, except I want that game to be developed.\n\nAt the current stage I cannot rate the game itself, so I will rate the gameplay idea and also the nice retro scifi look.\n\nI also want to give my feedback to the developers regarding the mouse/keyboard controls. Please have a look at other titles how they do the mouse and keyboard controls and improve it to match widely accepted standards.\n\nTL;DR: \nGameplay 10/10 (similar like \"Life is Strange\" but with multiple protagonists to choose from)\nLook 10/10 (similar like \"Alien Isolation\" in terms of retro scifi)\nControls 5/10 (a bit clunky in relation to other 3rd person game controls)\nContent 5/10 (still in development)\nPrice 10/10 (ridiculously cheap)\n\nMy Score: 8/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499922920, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499922920, "recommendationid": "33495705", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495146", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
