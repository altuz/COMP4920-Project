That said...\n\nA lot of people who see this game do not understand what this man has done for the indie community. He is an inspiration and a visionary who takes his time and creates tutorial classes and I guarantee a lot of indie developers would not have released their games had it not been for him. Anyone who has seen his work on Youtube, C Sharp Accent Tutorials need to buy this game and support what he is doing. I'm glad people like him are in this world. You're an inspiration to me and I will have a game coming out soon because of your support.\n\nNow, as for the game. It's initial humor is pretty hilarious and a creative loading screen. I'm not a fan of twin stick shooters, as I said, but the controls are solid and amooth and I actually found it fairly enloyable. Coming from me, that's saying something. Aiming is not too terrible. With twin stick shooters it's always a little terrible but It beats the hell out of HellDivers controls-wise, pardon the pun. Glad you guys put co-op in there. That's a plus.\n\nThat said, one thing other games like this do is have permanent upgrades. That would be a nice touch. I can't see a health-bar and I die pretty quickly. User-error I'm sure but that's something. The load times were pretty bad for me at first but once I turned the graphics and anti-aliasing down and off respectively, it speed it up. I don't feel it should do that but you know. I'll live. \n\nAll and all, it's a good game and I hope he continues to do what he does.

I know this is a early access but i cant even play the game! The controller constantly shoots by itself and even if it does work (rare) if me and my gf die she gets autorevived and cant move. Just walks in place and restarting the mission does nothing i have to back all the way out to get the game running again but then most likely i cant use the controls.
