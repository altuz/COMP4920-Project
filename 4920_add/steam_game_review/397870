Every space has about a dozen pre-determined buildings that you can place, which will generate gold or mana or let you create more powerful units.\n\nTo slow you down, after conquering a territory you will need to garrison a large army there for a few turns or there will be a revolt.... losing you the territory and spawning a large neutral army.  On balance, it is easier to conquer slowly and not deal with the rebels.\n\nAnd that is the whole thing.  The art isn't great but it isn't terrible.  The sound effects work.  I liked the music, but that will be to taste.  The UI is a little rough, and the game was clearly done in flash, including getting flash memory errors and the like while playing.\n\nMore maps, more armies, and more of a reason to play the different factions differently is what this game needs to go to the next level.  I found the same strategy worked no matter which army I picked, and the differences in the stats faction to faction were too minor to create unique playstyles.  At which point choosing the armies is mostly a reskin.  Once you figure out how to slowly roll forward on any map with any faction.... well there is not much more to the game.\n\nI beat it twice in 5 hours, including once on the hardest difficulty.  There are no achievements, and not much replay value beyond that.  All that being said, I did enjoy the 5 hours I spent with it.  Be aware that what you are getting is 4x light.  The 5 hours I played were fun, and I would like to see an expansion or sequel that did more.\n\n7/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1474758045, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1474758113, "recommendationid": "25680613", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522109", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442949744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2045, "steamid": "76561198002622902", "num_games_owned": 193}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Take some Defender of the Crown, a splash of Total War and a bit of Masters of Magic and you get this game.

It's pretty amusing. It kept me entertained for 4.5 hours. It's decent if you're looking to buy this for under $5.00 USD. It's certainly not worth much more. It's a slight bit outdated.\n\nStarting off, you make a selection of 3 possible races, 4 magical paths, 3 map choices, any start location desired, and a lot of buildings to choose from. \n\nEach unit has an upkeep. You either build toward military or economy. Early game I focused on defensive builds, spammed range units. Mid game, focus economy and magic. Late game, military and rush the enemy.\n\nWant to break the game and win a lot? Just get archers or wizards. Upgrade them for better range. They can win against all melee units in total disregard of being outnumbered 2 to 1. They will suffer against cavalries. The AI will run past your frontline to hit your archers and wizards first. Simply sit your own cavalry or melee units next to your flanks and counter-attack the enemy or defend the middle of the map as your range units chip away at the enemy. \n\nThe rebellions will become so hazardous that even the AI struggles to keep the peace. I simply just held key choke points, controlled a large chunk of land at a time, and just blitz'd the life out of the enemy. You don't need to control every single area to win the game. Sack the enemy, and vacate the area. When that stack is weakened from blitz tactics, split them into single units and attack every surrounding territory, some of which will be empty if AI owned. Guerilla and Blitz tactics combined makes winning easy.\n\nRemember children... No matter what strategy game you play...
