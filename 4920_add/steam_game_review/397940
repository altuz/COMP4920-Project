It kept enough of my attention to say it was a good effort but I do not think it a very recommendable experience. The game funnels your decision making really hard and interactivity is mostly an illusion. Content is short.\n\nThe game ends abruptly at the beginning of the mental health/Time Warp arc leaving most of the game's potential squandered. Has quality assurance issues in the form of typos. Grammar and narrative is quirky but thats part of the charm as far as im concerned. Balancing the needs system is an interesting way to try to bring a stake so as to break the passive narrative style of this genre but this streamlines your choices so much that  it funnels the consequences narrowly and really just offers a diverging branch path by the end but I would have to replay to make sure. I could live with the sprites as is but they would have to be at least consistent as some have a beavis and butthead mspaint feel to it while others seem to have a clipart look (the boss).
