He never returned from his second expedition. But you, you decide to find what happened. And guess what? You're stranded too... and with a traitor in the crew...\n\nThe plot is simple though I found the story short. The hours I've spent reflect the guide I've made about objects. But still, if the plot was beginning well, you have some holes: what happened to the captain? How come the mechanic was taken by the evil spirit if he was a prisonner?\n\nThe puzzles, if for some, are easy, for others, are quite a challenge. I had to skip some because it was a pain in the ass to try to catch the fish or you need to know the moon phases or you don't have real indication about how to solve that. The HO scenes were normal, though some items are difficult to spot, as they can be confused as part of another (got the case with a German grenade, where the handle was the same as a tool).\n\nThe official achievements can be done quickly. Nothing is rewarding you in the end for defeating evil, fishing for the Inuit, etc... But than you have hidden ones: 1 per relic or beyond object (object disappearing and reappearin)... Not every scene has them and sometimes, a beyond object and a relic can be in the same one.\n\nThe graphics are alright, but the characters are filmed actors. I would say that it's maybe weird to see them like that in a drawn scene. While it's maybe a nice intention, I didn't find that so... well-executed. The actors are correct, it's not that but how it was integrated....  during these scenes, I had pixels around....\n\nThe little nice add is to find coins to buy the pingoo a pool, a tv, a basket-ball. It's making me smile and while it's not very developed, it's still a little feature that is appreciated.\n\nThe soundtrack is alright too.\n\nSo, while I'm feeling perhaps mixed for this game, I'll still recommend to grab it with a nice discount. It's enjoyable, with \"easy\" achievements for those who loves 100%.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447508098, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447508098, "recommendationid": "19071314", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529807", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1472051833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 289, "steamid": "76561198027424772", "num_games_owned": 517}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1][u]Game Information[/u][/h1]\n\nMystery Expedition: Prisoners of Ice , is a HOPA* game, developed by Lazy Turtle Games and published by Tri Synergy Inc.\n\n*HOPA - Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure.\n\n[h1][u]Game Visuals[/u][/h1]\n\nThey're somewhat dated but still overall good. The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.\n\n[h1][u]Game Audio[/u][/h1]\n\nI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even if it's simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.\n\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\n\nThere are only two difficulty game modes to choose from: Easy, Expert and Adventure (Custom.)\n\nNotebook has three sections: Cutscenes, Notes and Map.\n\nThe inventory panel has the option of locking in place to make it stationary.\n\nAll of the game's hidden object scenes consists of traditional word lists with some or no interaction.\n\nMost of the game's puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nThere is a unique feature in the game. Igloo with a pet penguin. Collecting coins that are found throughout the game. Coins are used to buy certain items for the penguin but they don't come cheap. Relics are displayed on the icy shelf behind the penguin.\n\nThere are ten different relic collectibles to find throughout the game.\n\nThere are eighteen different beyond object (morphing) to find throughout the game as well.\n\nThere twenty-eight different achievements to earn from playing the game. Only three achievements are tied to hidden object scenes, puzzles and completing the game. The remainder of the achievements are tied to finding all of the changing and relic items in the game.\n\n[h1][u]Miscellaneous[/u][/h1]\n\nFinal thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend. The replay value for this game is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/397960", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477068611, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500841934, "recommendationid": "26148255", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525244", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482260034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 228, "steamid": "76561198054291418", "num_games_owned": 159}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I liked the game until the last part where the jigsaw puzzles were suddenly no longer an option, and the ending was really abrupt and didn't solve anything.
