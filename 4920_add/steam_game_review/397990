Sweet!!!\n\n[i]Woof Blaster[/i] is an arcade-style shooter where you play as a dog that clears the screen of smiley faces (a few reminding me of Homestar Runner, who I have enormous joy in obliterating for personal reasons).  The quest is simple, gather the triangles of power to obtain the sphere of destiny..........okay fine!  It's a pizza.  Happy?...\n\nYou have a variety of powerups, transformation powers, and bullet types to increase your survival along with health powerups, which can all be bought with in-game pounds.  (You know...the European Dollar sign that looks like an L instead of an S?)  There's also a cheat code you can use to make the game MUCH easier, but it requires a controller's assistance to do so.\n\nAs you complete a stage, you'll be faced with a boss.   Bosses include The Grinch, Plus Sign, Fat Turtle Gator, Trucker Moldorm (from The Legend of Zelda), and a few others.  Each has a unique playstyle and become increasingly difficult with each passing level.\n\nFor the price of Free, you're getting a nice game.  My only complaint is that the hitsounds come directly from [i]Megaman/Rockman[/i] without being credited.  Woof Blaster is a bit challenging, but it's something that I'm certain that most gamers won't find much difficulty in completing this particular title.  After completing this game, you may find that the replayability is rather low.  Please keep that in mind.\n\n6/10  Another dog game for another dog day.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486873105, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486873105, "recommendationid": "29864040", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519048", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1491853549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 568, "steamid": "76561198334772511", "num_games_owned": 82}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this game had a lot of replay value for me and you get to collect pizza\njust remember to change jump to the up button", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486745970, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486745970, "recommendationid": "29827919", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445203399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 130, "steamid": "76561197986219204", "num_games_owned": 511}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is ballin' out of control", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445036629, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445036629, "recommendationid": "18513149", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491370", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1448174058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 43, "steamid": "76561198106775983", "num_games_owned": 225}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "3", "review": "You dont get to play the game that much, everything is easy until you get to the first boss, in which its pretty difficult, and each boss gets way harder and harder, and if you die, you have to restart from the very beginning stage (yes that means haveing to fight the first boss and everything) trust me it is a waste of money in my opinion if you buy it then you will know what i mean, but dont buy it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450000383, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1450000383, "recommendationid": "19671101", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487338", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489651629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 29, "steamid": "76561198059955122", "num_games_owned": 122}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Challenging (more to hard).\nI love it.\nI play it when I need some challenge or too prove that I'm not useless.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487155764, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487155764, "recommendationid": "29939156", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1488446314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 231, "playtime_forever": 85, "steamid": "76561198054387451", "num_games_owned": 672}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Heart-breaking life story of a Woof with Laser beams, fighting against : Blocks, Cats & EVEN [spoiler] more blocks!!!
