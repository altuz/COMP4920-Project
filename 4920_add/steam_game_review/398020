Let alone the fact that the tutorial is actually a manual and the first mission throws you in the deep end, while your high on drugs, without a floatation device and screams \"Swim boy, swim\" at you while your being pelted with orbital based death (rocks fall and YOU die)\n\nBut then it all starts to make sense and little by little you progress through the map:\n\nYou make it the base without being squashed (pro tip, those items on the ground at the start CAN be picked up and used)\nYou knock out some turrets and blow a hole in the wall (F8 is your friend here)\nYou figure out most of the controls and manage to complete your objective (one way or another, it's amazing what a liberal application of C4 can solve)\nYou make it to mission 2\nYou crash the APC\nYou get owned by everything in sight\nYou try again\nAnd again\nAnd again\nYou finally have everything down that you need to know and become a lean mean killing machine.\nYou feel like a total badass.\nYou get cocky\nSomething new comes along and kicks your ass sending you back to the menu crying like a b***h\n\nSo yeah, be prepared to stare at the menu screen a lot while playing this, your going to become quite good friends :)\n\nRight then onto the rest of the game, the graphics are meh. Which for the most part is not an issue although the Marines could do with a serious touchup to make them actually look like space marines and not brown haired clones.\n\nThe sound is ok, motion tracker is nice and sounds similar to the one from Aliens while the guns are your generic [Insert gun firing sound here] affair.\n\nUI. Very unfriendly and until you tame it will attempt to bite your hands at every chance.\n\nGameplay... I'm not gonna sugarcoat this, it has a LOT of backtracking, you go to colony building 'X', fight through alien hoard,  pick up survivors, run like frak back to the APC, depending on how many survivors there were (APC has limited room) go to another building and repeat or go back to the space port to drop them off for evac. This game has as much backtracking as Metroid.\n\nAI. Does the job, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nAtmosphere. Captures the feel of Aliens perfectly. Hell, the only way it could be more Aliens is if a modder came along and redid all the Marines to look like Colonial Marines and the APC and Dropship to look like the ones from the movies (hint, hint modders) \nMotion tracker sounds great (even though it picks up your marines and APC which gets anoying)\nYou can weld doors shut (or cut them open/blow them off their hinges)\nC4 is fun and has a nice countdown effect.\nWeather effects and lighting help raise the tension and make it feel like LV426 from Aliens.\nThe monsters (Aliens) are fast and can come out of nowhere very quickly if your not careful.\n\nOverall I recommend this game for its pricetag. It's not the best game ever, it's not the worst. It is a better Aliens game than a certain other game made by a much larger professional gaming studio i know of *cough* Box Gear *cough*\nand while as I (and others) have said, this game is HARD and very unforgiving (so be prepared for frustration) it does have its moments where the Awesome dial gets turned up to 11. So if your looking for the best Aliens Colonial Marine simulator in well.... forever, then this might just be for you. \n\nP.S This game has been named wrong, it should have been called Marine Commander simulator 2015, seriously, it's that hard.\n\np.p.s, Ignore the hours played... Steam dun goofed and hasn't regestered them for some reason.... might be because I was offline at the time and the game crashed :(\n\np.p.p.s Seriously, any good modders out there who want a great Aliens game, were waiting for you. I'd do it myself but I shudder to think of the horror I might release upon an unsuspecting public.\n\nEDIT: Turns out it's even easier to mod than I thought, 10 minutes of google fu will net you a modified dropship and APC that you can edit into the game with just paint.net to bring home the Aliens feel (warning can cause some graphic issues)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450267026, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1450283101, "recommendationid": "19728176", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558739", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1479537164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 274, "steamid": "76561198032673216", "num_games_owned": 309}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "review": "a very unique game i wish this type of genre was more prevalent.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488782793, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488782793, "recommendationid": "30351613", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519989", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459919464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 50, "steamid": "76561198268222814", "num_games_owned": 39}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 25, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This game is way too hard to be fun.

The 2nd mission is a ton of fun just getting past the first is a chore though and the tutorial is a desert of information.  Also, there are stability issues, I haven't had many but they are annoying.  There are a lot of bugs that need to be worked out (particularly getting scientists to stay in the police station, game crashes).  The command UI is ARMA2 complicated but once you've worked with it you can get things done fairly fast.  The screen effects are pretty annoying (wish they had an option to turn them off);  and for the meteorites, there is a method to avoiding them consistently.  In fact I almost never get unless I forget that they aren't just for ambiance.\n\nThat being said, the premise is really cool;  it's like AVP2 but what if the main compound wasn't overrun before you got there.  There are also a lot of cool little mechanics like your squad have limited ammo, but can resupply at the APC (but if the APC stock runs dry your done).  Most of the games worth comes from the 50,000 ways you can approach the 2nd mission and survival.  \n\nOverall, the game needs more polish and more content wouldn't hurt;  it is however a ton of fun.\n\n\nEDITIFIED:\n\nso....came back after a few updates to rediscover the world of LV----------.  Turns out, the dude that made the game has (seemingly?) fixed most of the crashes.  Also (applause) I finally got the freaking high velocity rounds (due to correction of the spiral out of control problems).  This has been AWESOME.  The basic assault rifle is now significantly more useful than a can of pepper spray in a hermetically sealed closet, and by that I mean it now bitch slaps aliens with a mighty foam pimp hand, golden chalice not included.  \n\nHOWEVER,\n\nand lest ye weak of heart and those of you lacking in dedication were feeling particularly blessed by the gods of alien slaughter, the game is still hard.  It's supposed to be hard.  Sometimes games are made with the specific intention of being hard.  So if you can't handle the non-consensual, alien induced rectal orifice expansion and subsequent brutal violation that you shall surely suffer (and many, many, many a time), then don't buy it; understand however, that you are probably a being with a genetic predisposition towards being quadruped with a caudal appendage, having a tendency to howl at the moon, and mayhap popping out puppies.

I would pick it but to even it out....I'll put a yes to it.\n\nSo I got the game, here's my opinion.\n\n[h1]First opinions[/h1]\n\nThis game reminds me of running with rifles and colonial marines, a lot and I do like the concept of a colonial marines, squad based top down shooter with a non-cannon story to it. From looking at it I find it to be okay with some features.\n\nBut from looking at the review scores and the reviews I kind of hesitated in buying it and I asked the community if it would be a good idea or not, saddly I only got one response but it was an honest response that this game seemed more of an early access deal than a full blown game. It has its quirks of perma death that I can live with but it gets annoying to constantly die and get set back to the start.\n\nI did eventually buy the game on sale (\u20ac5.99) and I did enjoy it a good bit.\n\n[h1] Gameplay[/h1]\n\nWhen I played this I had no idea what I was doing and luckily there was a tutorial.\nThe tutorial was not good or bad but it did gave the information but for some people, they don't like reading and would rather skip to the action.\n\nAll weapons and vehicles metioned below are in mission two.\n\nGun-play is what you'd expect from a top down shooter with good weapons which includes a mini-gun, flamethrower and grenade launcher etc.\n\nThrow-able objects are there such as the frag grenades and the ones used in the grenade launcher as well as land mines, proximity and pressure.\n\nYou do have air support, it's the dropship.\nArmed with an HE auto cannon and missile launcher, it does save your ass a lot if you use it correctly.\n\nSquad mechanics are simple but not too simple as you can direct your squad individually or as a whole to move to one place or to follow you.\n\nYou also have an APC.\nIt's armed with an auto-turret with 10000 rounds I think and a good bit of armour till it explodes.\nIt does show damage depending on its durability which is quite nice too see but might have contributed to the FPS drops here and there.\n\nDo note that the marines CAN repair the APC IF it's damaged enough, below 10,000 or when it's smoking on fire.\n\nThe enemies are aliens with princesses instead of queens and regular drones and some have blood on their claws.\n\nThe AI is, meh to say the best and the least. Not that good but it's passable.\nAn interesting thing I found about it, is that if you get captured (that can happen) the marines will charge to your position to save you and unest you. All the marines. They may or may not leave the APC.\n\nThey also move away from grenades that you may accidentally throw at them.\n\n[h1] The missions[/h1]\nThe missions are tough enough with perma-death as a thing. It's too much trial and error but you get the hang of it soon after but it will take time.\n\nMission 1:\n\nYou're going to a base where meteors are falling down all around you. Complete and objective the objectives and evac. Long but it's an odd start to a game but it's straight into the mission, no briefs other than the one you get when you select the mission and \n\nMission 2:\n\nYou're in a city, you gotta do some tasks, and the aliens are there to kill you and capture colonists.\nYour job is to evac as many civilians as possible trapped in certain locations. This is the part where you get to command marines and it's with the APC as well. The aliens keep coming and\nyou have LIMITED ammo, I repeat, LIMITED ammo. The marines take ammo from the APC and the amount there is the amount of magazines they can use. They only take their specified ammo type so they ain't taking any of your fancy big guns.\n\nSurvival mode:\n\nExactly what it means.\n\nThat's all I'll say to prevent as much spoilers.\n\n[h1] Final say [/h1]\n\nSo would I recommend it?\nAt its current state. It's okay but not that okay. It lacks content of extra missions and is tedious to get past the first mission but it's neither the best or the worst. It's just good if you like a challenge.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457634275, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1477863226, "recommendationid": "21751725", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501534", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482789680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 102, "steamid": "76561198135971322", "num_games_owned": 381}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I thought this was going to be a fun little game to help pass the time.

You turn using the mouse and move with the WASD keys. The W key always makes your character go forward in whatever direction he is facing. It would have been better if they programmed the direction keys for north, south, east, and west. That would have been so much more simple. \n-The game is difficult, but when you die you respawn at the very beginning of the level, which is extremely annoying. Add to that the first part of part 1 is a lot of walking and avoiding meteors so when you die you have to do all that walking again. \n-There is no way to indicate which weapon you currently have equipped. The graphics are something akin to 8bit so it is really hard to tell what weapon you have in hand except to lose some ammo in a test fire.\nThere are so many other good games out there for as low a cost as this one and they have none of the flaws I mentioned so far. \n\nI cannot recommend this game in it's current state.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1482749210, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1482727318, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1482727318, "recommendationid": "28658796", "developer_response": "The movement controls can be changed in options movement tab.\nCurrently equipped weapon can be seen in lower left corner of the screen.", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508529", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501074912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 938, "steamid": "76561197979977620", "num_games_owned": 405}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "review": "So first off..
