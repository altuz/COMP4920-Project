What was I expecting? Graphics caught my eye, and while most people would probably be completely turned off by them, I thought the screenshots had a weird amateurish MSPainty charm to them, so I was like \"the person who made it doesn't appear to be a great artist, but they still seem to be dedicated to their game, so maybe it makes up in other aspects and might be pretty fun\".\n\nSomebody else called it \"poor man's Ys\", and on first glance it seems like a good comparison. You go from town to town, each town requires you to complete dungeons to move the plot further, until eventually you go to the next one. In dungeons, you move your character across the screen eliminating your enemies, whom you have to defeat to progress to the next screen. Dungeons are very short, at least up to the point I played; they are usually 3, maybe 5 screens long at most, not counting the boss. This makes it feel more like a beat 'em up or some other action based game than RPG, but hey, Ys [i]is[/i] action based after all, so it's all good as long as the combat system is well made. Too bad it isn't, because most enemies move completely erratically trying to ram into you, and the ones firing projectiles are pretty unpredictable too. This brings me to another point, which is the schizophrenic difficulty: I played on normal mode and I never managed to die in this game, so it's not like I think the game is difficult, but it feels weird to go through the first dungeons with no effort whatsoever, then get to a part where I burned through large part of my supply of healing potions, then for it to get easy again.\n\nI also have some other, minor technical complaints, such as the game allowing you to discard your potions to the point where you can carry negative number of them, very slow screen transitions in towns (maybe it's related to the 30FPS limit, and they would have been bearable if they lasted half the time), dialogues not allowing you to skip to the next line faster (useful feature in itself, it's there so you don't accidentally skip something important, but here it's annoying if you're not a very slow reader), or clunky UI.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=755528143\n\nLast, but not least, is the plot. From what I have seen so far, it's so full of clich\u00e9s that I could probably give a relatively accurate guess as to how the story progresses further. There's a guy who finds a book which somehow takes him to another world called Venux which is under attack by demons, it happens there's a prophecy that somebody will defeat the demons, some girl helps him... Characters are really uninteresting and I really can't even give a damn what happens to them, I'm already starting to forget their names even. By the way, the most memorable scene in this game is when Yuri, the girl co-protagonist, is done with interrogating a baddy; when asked where he is, she responds \"oh, he commited suicide ^\u203f^\" with expression you can see in the logo in store page. The most glaring issue is the writing. It is incredibly obvious that whoever wrote the dialogues is not a native speaker, and the whole clunkiness of the story is not helped by poor grammar and typos.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=755791023\n\nI cannot recommend it, even with very low base price. It does seem that the dev works on fixing the game and uploads patches relatively frequently, but I have no idea how much they'd have to do to make the game good. I hope they find someone to proofread the script for them, at least.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1472820483, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1472822429, "recommendationid": "25303880", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514436", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467149071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 33, "steamid": "76561198143996219", "num_games_owned": 61}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is... alright. It's way too straightforward, you slash your enemy until you win, thats it, the combat is alright overall. The story on the other hand, i couldn't care less about it, the story is dull and boring, all i care about is the gameplay. the segments where you actually get to do something are quite short, like i said 'you slash your enemy until you win'. Grapices are awful, the character models for dialouge look good, but aside from the the sprites look pretty bad, i know grapices aren't everything, but come on this looks sub-par. In short, it's basically a poor man's version of Ys.\n\nEDIT: I feel like i didn't go hard enough. This game is pretty bad, there's still some things that are awful about the game. Most of the times the game is way too easy, then suddenly it throws some bullshit at you and actually kills you, making you actually have to be careful in this game. I need to better describe the in-game sprites, some of them aren't bad, but a lot of them are udder garbage. The sprites for the dialouge aren't bad, but with the girl with the eye patch (I forgot her name) sometimes she's wearing it, something she's not, what's up with that? The story, like i said is boring and i didn't care much about it, so nothing much to about that other than it's complete garbage. In conclusion, this isn't a poor man's version of Ys, is something else and it's awful.\n\nYou would to be very desperate to play indie games if you buy this.
