The tutorial is over an hour long, and still does not cover some important aspects of simple things that would be helpful in completing the first few missions you recieve.  \n\nAnd the missions.  The space-based stations offer you missions that you cannot accept because you are not on a planet.  (huh?)  Some require you to go fly to a sector to retrieve and item somewhere in that sector, have fun finding said item.  Trying to figure out how the game's mechanics want you to perform each type of mission is a good source of frustration and just was not fun for me.\n\nI'm a fan of the X series of games, so I can deal with figuring things out on my own.  But when I feel like a colorblind person trying to solve a Rubiks Cube, it might be actually a bit much.\n\nThis game seems to be meant to appeal to a very niche audience, perhaps I'm not in that group.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504961992, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504961992, "recommendationid": "34836875", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526094", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505131079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1248, "steamid": "76561198052971534", "num_games_owned": 49}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this is the second Evoncron game I bnought, mainly to see how its changed sicne the last one. The graphics arent the best and the details on ships and stations arent either, but one man makes it, if he had a team working with him we could complain more. I was told this is his idea of a great space sim..fine...I applaud anyone who works to see their dreams come true. So basically its a one man Indy title and he adds somethign every few years and brings out another one. Not too abd actually. Not what I was looking for but for fighter pilots of middle age or so its OK, young people tend to want to rush through things, you cant do that here, its a nice even and slow progression game, so if thats your style go for it. High Speed flights and fights arent here verything takes a little time...you know...like Reality.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504629554, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504629554, "recommendationid": "34760134", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496975", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504249675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 142, "steamid": "76561198031161981", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "To the vast majority I would not recommend.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507090346, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507090346, "recommendationid": "35462586", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501813", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 144, "total_reviews": 174, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 30}}
