The sense of being completely inside this bizarre world as you float downward is oddly disturbing and relaxing at the same time. I also wonder if being able to look around in a more realistic fashion helps your survival. During most of the game you are looking downward (I recommend sitting on the floor), but some parts almost require you to see monsters coming at you from the side. Glancing around is way easier with your head than with a mouse.\n\nUpon successfully completing the game I'd only died 31 times, and the highest number of deaths I had on any of the nine levels was 7. I had to go back and intentionally die to get the achievements for 25 deaths on a level and 50 deaths total. For reference I played on \"nightmarish\" (the middle) difficulty level. I skipped trying to do a permadeath play-through.\n\nThere is no action to be had here. Simply avoid hitting or being hit by [b][i]anything[/i][/b]. I didn't experience any VR sickness but then you really don't move other than slowly sinking downward and slightly shifting the direction of your fall with your trackpads.  \n\n[b]Rating: 7.5/10\nCool, short and fun. Challenging without being too frustrating. Reminded me of what happens to a morsel of left-over food you toss over the side of a boat. But you're the morsel.[/b]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507086962, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507088523, "recommendationid": "35461782", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506306", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507001187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_forever": 30, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 846}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Best ad for Life Call yet!  \n\nRate 6/10 -  Would fall and can't get up again for $1.69 sale price!\n\nHere's a video of my gameplay:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQlpDiXPZHQ\n\nSerious, short review:  [spoiler] You're falling through a Euclidean (fancy word for geometry) nightmare of epic proportions.  This gameplay is not for everyone.  See all the negative reviews.  But I enjoyed it on nightmare difficulty.  It was very atmospheric and it was less about getting to the end of the journey and more about enjoying the fall.  Played on Oculus Rift with Xbox Controller ... my touch controllers didn't seem to work .. you have to stare at the moon to get the game started.  Just relax and enjoy the view.
