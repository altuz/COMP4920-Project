Get dumped in stripped down vault corridors shelves and microscopes and fire extinguishers, grab batteries for flashlight and key. Open vault door. Go down corridor full of desks, spools floating text, and blue containers, get key, get batteries, go through vault door. More floating text. Again with the keyhunt and the battery, vault door. Floating text. Floating text. Sort of a jumpscare. Game decides you are too good at finding keys so tells you to find another way out. Find screwdriver and hammer on one of the shelves. Open last door. More bad russian voice acting about how everything is better but dreams are bad and scary. The end. 20 mins of gameplay, left the game running while I went for supper.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496375659, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505088406, "recommendationid": "32121036", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503123", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 3, "review_score_desc": "Negative", "total_negative": 18}}
