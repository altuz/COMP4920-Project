The software starts and I can read the lesson text, but none of the videos, sounds, or interactive content work at all. Attempting to use this content results in a very non-descript \"script error\" message. It's something reported elsewhere (including the Steam forum) yet there is no entry for it in eMedia's tech support datebase, and no clear fix. But let's be honest... such basic content like playable videos should not be a problem with a professional piece of software, should it?\n\nSubmitted a support ticket but will likely just refund this and try something else.

I tested several different features... everything works great. I was surprised by the 2 negative reviews, so I had to check it out. Just like the emedia Bass and emedia Guitar.... this is a great educational program. I definitely wasn't disapponted. But just like everything else... you have to practice, practice, practice.
