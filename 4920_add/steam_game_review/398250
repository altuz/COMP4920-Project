Now, pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n+ Currency system is the best I have seen in a very long time. Enemies drop the in game currency (gems) when killed, they drop like 4-5 in my experience, which is very little since each planet as on average around 2-3 enemies and items cost upwards of 40 gems, if you are only getting money from killing, you won't be able to buy everything. Likely not even if you kill every enemy in the level. You can instead refine ore into gems, BUT, now you have to choose. Some useful thing, or money. Usually fuel or max energy increase or health or a 30 second powerup. All of which are worth taking.\n\n+ The random occurences in each level are very fun (think curses in Binding of Isaac, but implemented better) I have seen solar flares, which are bright flashes of light which (I think) damage you if you are on a side of the planet exposed to the sun (I never took chances) Not only do solar flares look beautiful, but they take advantage of the core concept of the game (planetoid roguelike). The others are cool as well, and I wish there were more, but none are nearly as memorable as the solar flare.\n\n+ Fuel. The fuel system is one of my favorite elements of the game. Most of the time, you have to choose between fuel and health. The two most important stats. You can dig up the Bright red ore and choose between one exra max health and one extra fuel. If you run out of fuel you have to sacrifice life for being so careless. It is something that is always on my mind, as I like it to be full, yet (excluding each levels starting planet) you can never arrive on a planet with max fuel.\n\nCons:\n\n- Energy. I feel like the Energy recharge delay could do with a decrease. I don't think the recharge RATE needs increasing. There is items for that. But the default delay is too much, and makes fighting a less fluid experience.\n\n- Characters. I have not unlocked all of the characters, but I never use the ones I have unlocked. The dodge roll is simply too much better than the other characters dodges. My suggestion is that every character have a dodge roll, and a special ability. Like the 180 degree teleport. Maybe make the explode yourself backward could launch UP a similar height to jumping, and damage things around the liftoff point.\n\n- Difficulty. The difficulty curve is a little wonky. The first level I can often get through with full health, but the second level I often die on, and the third level I often die in certain parts, while other parts are easy. A more steady curve would benefit the game. Sadly I can't give suggestions on difficulty, it's too hard to guage an average difficulty.\n\nConclusion: \n\nThis is a game that has some amazing gameplay mechanics, like the fuel system and the currency, but not only are they good, but they are implemented well. The games bosses aren't too creative, but their movesets are hinted at on similar enemies throughout the level. The game has some fundemental flaws, but none severe enough to make me angry, just sometimes disappointed.\n\nOverall score: 9/10\n\ntldr: Good game, screw every other character than the starting one.\n\nEDIT: I have just unlocked the last currently implemented character, and the rule does still apply, but it is actually quite fun to play.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1472149162, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1478060041, "recommendationid": "25137162", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505195", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1470181367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 632, "steamid": "76561198039158227", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is fun.

I didn't want to share the controller with anyone else there, but then I found out it was available to purchase on Steam! I got it and have been recommending it to my friends, too.\n\nThis game is an old school style of pixel art, which is well designed, colorful, and fun. The sound design is also fun, with appropriate space noises, creatures, music, everything. The entire art aspects alone should be a reason to invest time in the game.\nThe flow of the game and controls are a bit confusing at first, but then you get into it and the controls become second nature. The way the game forces you to choose how to manage resources and to strategize is clever and has you constantly thinking about what decision you'll make. And the difficulty of a roguelike is definitely present in this. You are certain to die a few times (or several times in my case) before you begin to figure out how things work. For example, learning enemy patterns through each playthrough helps you to make it further and further in the game. And the further you progress, you notice different environmental hazards, such as flytraps and acid pits, and then more extreme, galaxy spanning hazards, like solar flares and ion bursts. Equipment gathered is helpful for different situations, and the more gathered, the better. They can be used in conjunction to increase survivability and effectiveness against enemies. I get excited each time I find a different piece I can add to make my character more deadly.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes space themed shooters, pixelated artwork, and arcade style action with roguelike difficulty.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446875820, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1446875820, "recommendationid": "18923562", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1494173910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 352, "steamid": "76561198000138626", "num_games_owned": 243}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A tremendously fun, charming, and delightfully challenging rogue-like indie game!

It even shows you a map of the galaxy you're currently in, which is different each time you play.\nFighting whilst circling around planets is great fun and also makes gameplay interesting when you get abilities that are affected by the size of the planet you're on. Moonstrider has an interesting system for navigating levels; You have to use 1 fuel to jump between planets, and since you generally only collect 2 fuel at a time you have to plan out your jumps if you want to thoroughly explore a system.\n\nI really like that there is a secret area you can get to, although I have yet to find out what lies in wait if you complete said areas. They add this sense of mystery that I don't get from a lot of games.\nThe game even has 6 unlockable characters, and they all have a good balance of pros and cons, and some of them have very unique gameplay. When I first played the melee character, Nadia, I thought they were far too difficult to use, but after getting some practice runs in I learned how to use their crazy bomb-and-dodge-jump and they became my favorite character. I love Nadia's risky, in-your-face, high DPS style.\nThe boss battles are a lot of fun as well, and they even have expert mode variations if you encounter the same boss later in the game.\n\nOverall, it's a very polished game with an impressive amount of content to explore and excellent replayability.
