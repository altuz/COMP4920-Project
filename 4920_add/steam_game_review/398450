My feeling  when I finished it was thank god it is over  It was ok but it almost felt like I was watching some armature  cartoon   and I had to rethread the  film to see what happens next However. The game is very glitchy  you have to wait to click till you figure out  how  to click it .  I don't want to kill the developers ambition to make more games. But this thing was created in 2013   And the developers  last post was Sept 27 2015. I strongly suspect that the game developer who just made this  one game is no longer around  Has gone on to other things So there is no ambition here to kill .   so given that unfortunately this will be the one free game I am going to recommend not to download.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485748351, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485748393, "recommendationid": "29578515", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491703", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486245561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198192872979", "num_games_owned": 26}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Well that was interesting, the voice acting was funny but this game is too much, too much for seb to handle so I wouldn't recommend it for Seb.

I thought the voice acting was great in that \"cheesy\" kind of way. I really wished the game was longer. And considering that this was free, there is absolutely no reason to not give it a try. As for the puzzles, they're relatively self-explanatory. I don't recall being stumped by anything, and I'm kind of an idiot, so if that's your concern you should be fine. If for whatever reason you DO get stumped, there are great community guides to help you along. Try this out. The file size is small and, even if you hate point and click adventures, I think the charm of the characters will win you over. \n\nThis is not a \"so bad it's good\" game.
