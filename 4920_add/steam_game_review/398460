The level design is challenging enough that you can easily fail a number of times if you try to rush (and in some areas, move too slowly). The game does not have a timer, so taking your time is important as it will allow you to strategize your next move. Paying attention to your surroundings (even the areas you cannot see) are important. Many times focusing on one thing makes you lose focus and result on many deaths. The boss fights I've encountered are well thought out and will challenge your patience, reflexes and force you to strategize. However, you'll will feel a sense of completion upon . \n\nThe various languages options available are nice.
