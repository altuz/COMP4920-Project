I'm a fan of similar games, such as the Peggle series.  However, there's absolutely nothing new here.  It's almost like they took Peggle, reskinned it, and hung the blocks by strings.  That's the gist of it.  You shoot a ball, hoping to eliminate all of the pink blocks before you run out of shots.  Same as Peggle, except that Peggle had nice twists to the gameplay, whereas 20 some levels in, there's nothing new to keep my interest.  The game also has a few game mechanics that are rather irritating.  First, some of the blocks will reset if you hit them twice.  That wouldn't be a problem, except that you have no clue which ones those are.  Also, appearently progressing in the game is dependant on a star system.  So after truding through 80 levels, just to finish the game, you are rewarded with a message that says you have to go back, and redo levels to get more stars.  Hard to do, when in order to get all 3 stars, you have to break every brick in a level WITHOUT your special weapons.  In some stages this is damn near impossible.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451952420, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1453685828, "recommendationid": "20308932", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521535", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484925784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 200, "steamid": "76561198065483048", "num_games_owned": 142}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A stripped down version of Peggle.  There is NO high scores for levels.  So its literally \"get the stars\" and move on.  Instead of special characters- you get special items.  And guess what? The special items make it so you cant get perfect stars on the level.  To get these items- you literally have to grind through levels over and over. That would be fine- if the gameplay didnt get boring.  Plus there is no indicator of what the special items do! So you have to waste your money at least once on each item to find out what it is.\n\nAnother big complaint- the game seems a bit glitchy at times. There is the moments when you clear every peg for a level- but the game tells you that you didn't. The level will end- but you wont have perfect stars even though you should.\n\nGame maker hasnt been active at all on the forums, or when I emailed about a few things.  That's kind of stupid- considering the game hasnt been out too long.  So it honestly seems like shovelware/abandonware.   \n\n If the game maker updates the game or actually responds to some stuff, I'll update the review accordingly.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452197792, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452197970, "recommendationid": "20382205", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511656", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446858811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 43, "steamid": "76561198007448028", "num_games_owned": 126}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Ghost Cleaner is a light-hearted casual puzzle game that offers a refreshing twist on the pointy-shooty brick-breaker.

There are no display options. In this day and age all games should have a full screen option.Yes even at launch. Lets get this thing updated so i can give you a better review and recommend it!! So no for now until we get that update!! \"UPDATE\" Yay!! The Devs have quickly fixed the fullscreen issue in just one day!! Now you can enjoy the game the way it was meant to be played!! Its a very cool physics game and i love the paranormal theme. Also has a very cool soundtrack and cool cartoon cut scenes. It was released just a little after Halloween but still puts you in the mood for the season!! I love how the game brings you along slowly with some easy levels then starts to turn on the difficulty!! I hope the devs continue to support this project because this game just screams for some future DLC'S!! If you like physics games like i do please give \"GHOST CLEANER\" a try and enjoy it like iam!! :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446855474, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446913766, "recommendationid": "18919563", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500147", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1478611137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1151, "steamid": "76561198045053724", "num_games_owned": 531}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "lots of different levels, there's a lot of strategy , it's worth while for all the family.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1474042042, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1474042042, "recommendationid": "25529680", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496689", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477901681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 382, "steamid": "76561198329987790", "num_games_owned": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Interesting!
