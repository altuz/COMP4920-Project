Includes great graphics, soundtrack and the stories themselves are great. \n\nAlso being collector's editions you get the bonus chapters and wallpapers as well. They both are older games but the graphics hold up incredibly well for wide screen PC's and have no bugs that I've encountered.\n\nThe game Ice Rose includes a strategy guide but no fast travel map however the other game Frozen Beauty does have a travel map and location hints as well as a cute pet you can purchase by finding coins throughout game play!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444846492, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444918372, "recommendationid": "18473724", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533844", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1467545947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 352, "playtime_forever": 383, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "num_games_owned": 2214}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "While Living Legends is a series in itself, Ice Rose and Frozen Beauty are both tied together, the latter being the sequel of the former. Right now, none of them are available on Steam as a stand-alone.\n\nBefore buying this collection, be aware of a frustrating bug of \"screen resolution wrong or something like that\". It prevented me to play it on Windows 8.1. Luckily, it's working fine with Windows 7.\n\nLet's dive into them.\n\n[b]Living Legends: Ice Rose[/b]\n\nYour husband Edward is gone to a remote village called Rosemount. Haunted by a nightmare and not having news of him, you decide to go there, only to find that everyone was frozen by the Ice Queen. Edward is under her spell and you don't have a choice to play his knight in armor...\n\nTrust me, since the Disney movie Frozen, I couldn't get out of my headthe song, translated in French, in my head all the time - Lib\u00e9r\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9, d\u00e9livre\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9 - argh... Anyway, this is basically a plot with an evil Ice Queen, wanting to freeze everyone. While she's still a prisoner, an event managed to free some of her powers. The ending is quite abrupt, however, as it's a collector's edition, you have the bonus chapter that will conclude the first part of the story.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's still the same usual good old \"find items, use them, clear hidden objects scenes and solve puzzles\". Everything is quite easy, apart for some puzzles that I hate because too confusing for my brain. The hidden objects scenes are really easy and even the hidden items in these scenes are easy to find. What I'm just missing is an interactive map. Or I missed it or there is none and I was really pesting against doing back and forth and take the wrong direction.\n\nThe graphics are quite good, even if I find Edward's design a little weird. The Ice Queen is quite recognizable, however, we never see her as whole, you just see her face. As for the soundtrack, it's just a shame that it's only present indoors (not outside, you have only the wind blowing) and in puzzles and hidden objects scenes. It was quite enjoyable, so, yeah, it's kinda sad. Another thing that I found very sad is the lack of voice acting. I don't mind a game without it, however, weirdly enough, here, I feel like it was missing something.\n\nAs it's a collector's edition, you will find a bonus chapter, wallpapers, screensavers, music, concept arts, the cutscenes, the minigames and the hidden objects scenes. It's really nice to have them.\n\nIn other words, Living Legends: Ice Rose is a good game, a little too long for my taste, suited for everyone. However, if you're fed up with Lib\u00e9r\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9, D\u00e9livr\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9e (or the main song for Frozen), you should expect to have that music in your head each time the Ice Queen will appear. It's quite annoying but hey, I can't blame a game that was released BEFORE the movie.\n\n[b]Living Legends: Frozen Beauty[/b]\n\nYour sister has been designed as the Queen's successor. However, given the fact that your mother disappeared when you were younger, she's pleading you to join her in her new royal life. Only one test is required to show her worth but is it good to be true?\n\nThe real question is how this game can be the sequel to Ice Rose, as announced in this one? Well, while there is ice and snow everywhere, which can be an indication of a similar weather, you have to follow the story to understand that there is a character common to both games. The story is also involving Snow White and the research of eternal beauty. The story is well-written, even if in the end, again, our nemesis is escaping, while letting the heroin alive and in peace. I wonder if the third game in the series is concluding it or not (because for now, four Living Legends have been released).\n\nThe gameplay is still the same as the previous game: items to find, to use, solve puzzles, clear hidden objects scenes, with hidden objects in them (in other words, you have visible objects and others that required an action). There is also a second type of scenes: the shaped list. And a new feature is also there: the interactive map! Finally, you can go to a scene to another without loosing yourself around.\n\nHowever, while the graphics are still good, everything is still based on the previous game. Besides, even the soundtrack is the same as in Ice Rose. Nothing new is appearing there and it's quite a disappointement.\n\nAs it's a collector's edition, you will find a bonus chapter, wallpapers, screensavers, music, concept arts, the cutscenes, the minigames and the hidden objects scenes. It's really nice to have them.\n\nI don't know if it's related to the fact stated just above but in this one, you have ingame achievements and a little squirel as friend. You can find money in the game and use it to improve the little guy's house. It's a nice little feature to see.\n\nIn the end, you get a good casual game, with mysteries, easy hidden objects scenes and puzzles, with an improvement called an interactive map but with a negative point in terms of reuse of soundtrack instead of trying to mix the tracks or to find new ones.\n\n[b]CONCLUSION[/b]\n\nBuy the bundle, it's worthy of your money, and good news, both stories are tied together, so, you don't have to worry about a missing entry (not like when Artifex Mundi is publishing games from another developers or Big Fish Games releasing their games in the wrong order).
