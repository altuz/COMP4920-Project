Never thought I'd be so frustrated with the controls of a HOG, but my mouse would bounce around the screen without warning and you have to play with the custom cursor or the hidden object scenes don't work properly. Story was weak (even though the one I played was supposed to be the best of the lot, based on other reviews) and the art direction was pretty bad. Takes place in the 1920's but frequently had anachronisms in characters' appearences and technology that completely ruined immersion. Voice acting was awful, but to be fair, I find HOG rarely have voice acting that goes above \"passable\" anyway. Dogged by the usual logic errors of HOG (Why can't I use the can of bug spray on this bug problem? Because the game wants me to use it on a different bug problem that I haven't even run into yet!), which I find to be a mark of a lazily made HOG. Game play was par, maybe a notch or two below, but with nothing else in the game picking up the slack, I wouldn't recommend it, even on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492238217, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492238217, "recommendationid": "31150255", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504637", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
