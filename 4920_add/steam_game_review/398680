So testing it was changing me from the F2P Lost Lands/Clover Tales or other hidden objects games (and Killing Floor 2 that keeps crashing on me since another update of theirs).\n\nDo you know anagrams and Scrabble? Well, it's kinda a mix of them. You're given a list of letters and it's up to you to make the maximum words. The default mode isn't allowing you for 7 or 8 letters, so, go to the options and activate it, so that you will be able to make some achievements.\n\nYou can see the number of words available and they're revealed to you on the upper part of the screen. However, in order to access a new puzzle and keep your previous score, you need to reach the 100% bar. Also, you need to reach a certain level before unlocking the hint option.\n\nBut the best is that you change language. I could play in French, though I switched back to English. I'm maybe lacking words but at least, I'm not being frustrated. Let me explain: the game doesn't allow for words existing in French with accents. And trust me, there are a lot like that, that you can make but as the dictionnary included doesn't allow you to put them, you're frustrated.\n\nIt's the same for English. Where Letter Quest: Grim's Journey allows you a lot of words, Ace of Words is restricting. However, I'm surprise sometimes: some words are really weird and probably derives from scientific langages. Too bad, you don't have any little definition with it.\n\nAnyway, Ace of Words is really a good game to exercise your vocabulary if you're not an English speaker for example. It's a real good moment to pass with it. Perhaps the price is high for that kind of game but yeah, if you can buy it during a sale or when it's bundled, go for it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1474286569, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1474286569, "recommendationid": "25586183", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523990", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1449993387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1992, "steamid": "76561198044918687", "num_games_owned": 941}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "How I described this game to my brothers:\n[b]I WANTED TO PLAY A STRESS FREE CASUAL GAME AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.\nCAPS LOCK RAGE.[/b]\n\nAnd why the rage?

It is nearly impossible to logic your way into completing the puzzle and to figure out which words you're missing.\n4) I had to quit several times when I was unable to type any letters or click them to enter a new word.\n5) There is no way to save your progress (as far as I can tell).\n\nUnfortunately there are no good alternatives to this game on Steam, but if you're feeling an urge to play this, don't pay the $5 or play it for free online.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463533739, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1463533739, "recommendationid": "23047374", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508783", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1495594000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 185, "playtime_forever": 622, "steamid": "76561198208078171", "num_games_owned": 255}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Update as of 11/16:\n\nDev isn't really responding to any of the concerns in the discussions and its been over a month since an update, which I can't tell what it did to be quite honest.
