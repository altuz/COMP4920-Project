It is very, very rewarding. \n\nThis is probably one of the best PC games I've played... ever. The dungeons remind me of old school, top down Zelda games. This is creativity and design at its finest. The only complaint I have is that character movement is clunky and isn't all that intuitive. But it makes sense given the game is designed so that you keep your hands in qwerty position 95% of the time (besides in menu).

That's not a criticism, that's just a fact. The game starts easily enough, but each new level builds on all that came before, and all too soon you'll find yourself trying to switch modes during a melee.\n\nThat aside, the lyrical and fresh qualities of this game are engaging and I can't recommend it enough for originality, playabiliity, empathy, and challenge.

I happen to be a fast typer so the game was even more enjoyable for me because it was allowing me to use that strength to my benefit.  At first I wondered how difficult it could be just typing to kill enemies and such but they do some interesting things with speed of creatures as well as the difficulty of some of the words.\n\nThe controls are a little bit tough because they introduce you to using E, F, I, and J as this keeps your hands in a typing stance, but it takes a little getting used to.  Also, sometimes I find myself locking my character in typing mode when hitting space so be aware of whether or not you are in typing mode already before hitting space.\n\nThe world is beautiful and I love the overlay of the narration both vocally and visually within the gameworld.  The graphics are really unique and the way the world opens up as you go is really cool.  I also like the abilities that you are able to attain as you progress.\n\nI just also played my first arena which was very cool but also a little tiring.  I thought I had actually done very well as I played the arena for what felt like 10 minutes, however my score only got me into about 2300th place!  I imagine the others have higher skills but still it must take a lot to place well in those arenas.\n\nOverall, the game is very fun and I am just over an hour in. I really enjoy a new feel to a game and this gives you that. I imagine you would not like this game if you are not a good typist but this will help you become better so it is still worth playing.

It's gorgeous, it runs butter-smooth (at least on my end,) it's fun and challenging and I thoroughly enjoyed the sense of discoery I felt throughout my playime.\n\nBut, I'm getting ahead of myself here.\n\nThe story of Epistory centers on a girl who rides upon the back of a fox, as she travels through a world fragmented and attempts to piece together what has befallen both herself, and the place she calls home. If that sounds very sterotypically RPG-ish, then I do a disservice to the storytelling -- all is told in lines of prose, bits and pieces coming together as the world literally unfolds around you, and the whole thing is fully voiced. The narration may grate on you, but I personally enjoyed discovering the story this game had to tell. It gave the journey through this world a sense of purpose, and it was very hard to put down as a result.\n\nEpistory is... a little hard to define, as far as the genre goes. I originally described it to a friend as \"Okami meets Bastion\", and while I still stand by that, it is a bit of a weird way to describe a game in which every action is initiated by typing it out. The game's most interesting mechanic is that actions are spelled out for you -- literally! You have to type a word to perform an action -- Poplar to remove a dead tree, or perhaps Rose to bloom some flowers. Sirocco to blow the winds, Glaciate to freeze the waters, Cremate to burn away some brambles... if you do not enjoy typing, you will not enjoy this game -- but don't knock it until you try it. It's ridiculously fun to solve puzzles (there are many puzzles) and alter the world with the words you type, and combat is challenging and fun all at once.\n\nIf this game doesn't up your typing speed I will be surprised, because there were moments when I was quite literally typing for my life. It was great. Each of your abilities has a different effect whne typed, and some enemies can only be harmed by a certain ability -- which is helpfully indicated by the color of the words above their head. (Colorblind players, I apologize in advance. If I may make one suggestion to the devs, it is perhaps putting a small symbol of the required element somewhere near the word or on the body of an insect to acommodate the people who want to play but cannot do so due to difficulties with the color-coding. Alternatively, an alt-color mode for colorblind people could help remedy the problem!) Death is instantaneous if something touches you, but I never had too much problem with that, and there is no real loss if it happens. Just try again!\n\nIf there is any one complaint I have about Epistory, it's that the controls came straight out of hell. It's not a deal-breaker, but WASD for diagonal movement and EFJI for moving in straight lines makes for painful sliding ice puzzles. But it's not a bother once you get used to it, and I spent most of the time just holding a pair of W/A/S/D to hit a straight lined instead. It is a pitfall of games with an isometric view, but it is a small one when the game is this good. Plus, there are mods for changing the controls -- and if it's a bonus, this game supports every kind of keyboard setup I have ever seen. Rejoice, Dvorak, Colemak, Bepo, and all the rest of the configurations out there -- you have been accomodated, too!\n\nIn all, Epistory is a gorgeous treat of a game with beautiful papercraft-esque graphics and really solid sound design, with engaging gameplay that features everything from inventive combat to puzzle-solving to exploring for hidden treasures and collection items, with an interesting world and captivating story and enough fun and challenge to keep you playing for hours -- and I personally feel that the price is bang-on for how much I got out of this game. It's worth retail, and I don't say that often! It's a real gem of a title, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Epistory was a wonderful experience, and I hope someone else comes to enjoy it through this review as well.\n\nThank you for reading!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507129786, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507129786, "recommendationid": "35473585", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500005", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505317419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 568, "steamid": "76561198215133289", "num_games_owned": 245}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Enjoyed it very much. \n\nThe mechanics is unique and interesting.
