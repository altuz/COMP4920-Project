Its a simple game about a man who defies death and becomes respawn man, a man who uses his own corpses to his advantage. But not all is as it appears when respawning infinitely means a life of pain and eternal suffering.\n\nThis game has a neat little story with a little hilarity and rhyme. It has easy controls and a red shirted fool, who is just abusing his time. Some of the later levels get hard, and it makes you want to break the shards. But any mistake, no matter how late, is always your fault in this grind.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who really wants to take a trip back to old 32 bit gaming and enjoy the catchy music and smooth difficulty curve level designs. Good job SolidPlasma.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451549363, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451549363, "recommendationid": "20141946", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500148", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451608190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 23, "steamid": "76561198072298835", "num_games_owned": 318}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I enjoyed playing this game even thought it may be short i do see and endless possibility this game could have especially with the level editor.

There are three sets of levels (?): Dawn, Day and Dusk, respectively. In each level, a new game mechanic is introduced, for example: trampolines, fans that push you around, poisons and MUCH more. also the lives change in each level.\nThe in-game music is around 2-3 minutes and loops when finished.\nThe most fun part is that there is a level editor! And you can submit your levels to the steam workshop, but it's very hard to learn and the instructions are not clear.\nBut im my opinion, 5$ price is too much for a game this short, but it's still worth every penny.\nCan't wait to see more updates and level for this game.\nI give this game a very good 8.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450712709, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454173745, "recommendationid": "19825557", "language": "english", "votes_down": 39, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449661", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506265599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 144, "steamid": "76561198205406013", "num_games_owned": 41}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "this is a fun game, that does make you scratch your head sometimes. \" i give this game a kevin spacey/10 \"", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1471217366, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1471217366, "recommendationid": "24922920", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483456598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 62, "steamid": "76561198005160344", "num_games_owned": 213}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm afraid I cannot recommend this game, even at a highly discounted price. The game plays ok, but it is just not interesting or complex enough to merit attention as a puzzle platformer.\n\nHere are my main gripes:\n-Platforming: The basic platforming mechanics of the game are not fun. Movement/jumping is functional, but it is sluggish and just doesn't feel good. I was also annoyed by ocassional cheap deaths when trying to jump over raised spikes--the hitboxes felt too large. \n\n-Level Design/Puzzles:The level designs/puzzles are mostly lacking in challenge or complexity. Oftentimes, you can immediately see what you need to do to finish a level. There is very little sense of satisfaction in completing a level--very few \"aha!\" moments. \n\n-The \"Zombie Mode\" Mechanic: A new mechanic is added late in the game, but it unfortunately makes the level design issues even more pronounced. The zombie mechanic often forces you to wait for long stretches of time before you can complete the next step of a puzzle. This kills any sense of momentum, since you may know exactly what you need to do, but must wait to do it. This zombie mechanic is especially annoying on the last level of the main game, which is extremely tedious (rather than complex).\n\n-Steam Workshop: While it is great that the game includes a level editor and Steam Workshop support, the implementation is cumbersome. I had to go to the forums to figure out how to load and play levels I'd subscribed to.
