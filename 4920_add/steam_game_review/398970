First, this isn't a MMO. According to their own player count ingame, there has been a max of 15 unique players online today, of which the highest concurrent number I've seen in the 3 hours I've been playing is 3 with me included. Infact, in the top 50 players list, only 20 of them are above level 1. That's saying something when it took 3 hours for me to get to level 7 while idling at least 1 hour away. It's not a Massive Multiplayer Online game, but just a regular Multiplayer Online game. Second thing I want to say is that this is very similar to mobile games like Clash of Clans. If you've enjoyed that, you'll more than likely enjoy this game. \n\nNow, onto my review. This is a full-on browser game. When you install the game on Steam and launch it, a launcher comes up with options to run their chess game, or Fasaria World Online. Clicking on FWO launches Internet Explorer and the website itself. \n\nI have a quick list of grievances with this game that I first want to air out.\n\nWhen you first play the game, you start off with 10K money, food, and iron. These are the resources in this game that you must acquire. The only problem with this system is that gathering resources is way too simple. In the three hours I've been playing, I've probably gained over 15M of each resource and used/sold most of them. First off, you can hire workers to generate a steady source of income every tick/month/15 minutes but that isn't needed because you make a lot more money by grinding on mobs. Like a million in less than a minute. \n\nSecond, the engineering lab. If you're trying to understand why a health pack requires compressors, generators, and micro parts, well you're not alone there. Everything in the engineering lab requires those three sub resources for some strange reason. Be it the health pack, energy pack, strength upgrade, defense upgrade, health upgrade, or even energy upgrade, all of them require differing amounts of generators, compressors, and micro parts to my utter bewilderment.\n\nThe third grievance of mine is with the Assembly Factory. In the AF, you create factories to produce generators, micro parts, and compressors. Sound good? Well, not exactly. Even if you have two of each factories, you're only allowed to collect from one factory each tick. It's as if you paid a restaurant for three meals but they only allowed you to pick one meal every fifteen minute. Utterly frustrating and it feels as if the game is trying to hard to be a grind fest. \n\nNow a few good things that I do like about this game.\n\nFirst, the combat is very simple to pick up on. In fact, this reminds me of Adventure Quest, except without all the animation. Is it the best combat out there? Of course not, but it's damn well good enough considering you can also play it on mobile browsers according to the devs. \n\nSecond, I have to say that the community(although the playerbase is quite lacking) is very nice and helpful. I'd had more than a dozen questions about this game and the veteran players patiently answered all of them. \n\nLast, it has a very high potential to be addicting. This is one of those games where you check back every 15 minutes to upgrade your base, add more troops to your army and create new factories in the Assembly Factory while collecting all your idle resources. The fact that you can log into your steam account directly on your phone's browser also adds to the fact that you can play it anywhere and at anytime. \n\nUltimately, I'm giving this game a thumbs up. A lot of the problems I think this game has is more or less a balancing issue with resources. Otherwise, it's a pretty fun game though lacking in the graphics department.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444882771, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1444882771, "recommendationid": "18479593", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536588", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447226290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561198039399209", "num_games_owned": 118}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "review": "At first, I was very confused.
