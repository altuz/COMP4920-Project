I love how the character of Vinty evolves in this sequel, and the art so well done! I didn't click on many of the videos but I do enjoy games such as this that work in ways to learn about locations subtly so it doesn't break the immersion. 10/10 for achievement hunters as well. \n\nIt made me smile and that's a lovely thing for a game to do.  :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500365190, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500365190, "recommendationid": "33624930", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504769", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 55, "total_reviews": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 5}}
