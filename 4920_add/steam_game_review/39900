The game feels very uneven, like made by an amateur. The tutorial is too long and too intrusive, you never really get to play and test what it tells you. The tutorial doesn't switch off automatically, you have to go to the settings. Even on the easy level you get very quickly killed, and after that the game is just over -- no savegame, no checkpoint, nothing. Each time you start from the very beginning, not even your player name is remembered. And after dying, the default option is not -- as one would expect -- to start a new game, no: the default is to visit the game's website. The end effect is that one has to make a lot of effort just in order to actually get into the game -- let alone enjoy it.
