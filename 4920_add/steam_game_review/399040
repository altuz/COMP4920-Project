Probably not.  Would I pay the asking price ($8.99)?  Absolutely not.\n\nWe're all pretty familiar with the way that solitaire works.  The rules for this one -- you have to choose cards that are sequential, not necessarily alternating between red and black suits.  The sequence can move up or down -- for example, when you have a \"four\" exposed you can either play a three or a five on it.\n\nYou get bonus points for the number of cards you can play in sequence.  You also achieve bonus points for various combinations and permutations.\n\nFor me -- there are so many free versions of solitaire out there that this one isn't necessary.  Yes, there is an overarching plot -- you are a group of fantasy adventurers journeying through the dangerous countryside, fighting orcs and dragons as you go.  But truly the requirements from advancing one level to another are pretty arbitrary.  And anyone who plays solitaire knows that your ultimate success is largely based on luck.\n\nGames based on luck, for me, begin to feel tedious.  Grinding is an unpleasant label you might apply to it.  Listen, I've had my fill of grinding after playing WoW for seven years.  The title \"The Insane\" was enough to convience me that I was wasting my life on sh*t that didn't matter.\n\nSo I get pissed off at games that essentially become grinding episodes.  The graphics are cool, the sound is passable, and the game enjoyable enough.  It's just that I think that there are plenty of free versions out there that makes me conclude that this one isn't worth spending money on.\n\nAs always, readers should view what I write seen through the lens of the casual gamer -- that is, someone who has limited time due to family, a career, and soul-crushing student loan debt.\n\nSave yourself $9.
