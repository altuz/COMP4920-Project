As a fledgling dragon, you will be born into an unknown world - and directly experience the wonders and threats that you discover. As you grow and gain strength and power in this 2D Adventure Platform game, the decisions and choices you make will change the lives of the people left in your wake.\n\n[u]Release Date: 11 Dec, 2015[/u]\n\n[h1]The Gameplay [/h1]\nAs a platformer, it does a pretty decent job. The controls feel tight, though it could have stood to be a bit longer, and it could use a bit more enemy variety. There are only a couple bosses, and the difficulty ramps up considerably for the final encounter.\n\nAll in All [u]Dragon's Wake[/u] is a really nice Game!\n\n8/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep[/i]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503483465, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503483465, "recommendationid": "34434603", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512455", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503702827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 33, "steamid": "76561198084270343", "num_games_owned": 104}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "In it's current state, [spoiler] it is impossible to save the other dragon at the end fight.[/spoiler] I've tried everything I can think of, but you're ally dosnt open the gate in time.
