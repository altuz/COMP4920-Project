I really did. I loved the original Opposing Force. I was hoping to see Adrian Shephard's story continued in a new and interesting way. The problem with this mod lies there -- it claims to be a sequel to Opposing Force, but offers nothing in that department. The most hint we get of the player even being Adrian Shephard all lies in the beginning and the random flashbacks that happen through the game. Other than that, it is just a new Half-Life 2 map pack. The original Opposing Force introduced new weapons, new enemies, and a new fully developed story line which was entertaining to play and interesting to see progress in. Here what you have is pretty much just a mappack for HL2. Mind you, this is great on its own. Some of the maps look BEAUTIFUL and push the Source engine to its limit. However, I think attaching 'sequel to Opposing Force' and selling it for $10 is a bad move. The developer trying to pull it together all on his lonesome is a bad idea for a liscensed game being published as a full sequel. $10! That's the price of the original Half-Life. I would excuse this if the game offered new enemies, or hell, even revisited old ones from Opposing Force. I would love to see Shephard wake up armed with nothing but his HECU armor and his combat knife/wrench, and fight his way through the combine. I truly would. But here what we have is a map pack which falls flat in what it aims to do. However, I don't want this entire review to be negative, and I would like to give the developer a list of things he could do to make the game better:\n\n-Fix Adrian's hands model. C'mon man, this is just the HEV suit but grey! Hire a modeller or hell, learn blender yourself and make a new mesh to rig up. It would make the game so much more immersive and believable.\n-Add new weapons! Right now this is the main contributor to the 'this is hl2 with different levels' trope going around. When Shephard returns to Xen, he could find a dead HL1 guard and pick up his iconic Desert Eagle from him. He could find a wrench in a toolbox in one of the prison cells. Anything! Hell, it'd even be acceptable if you re-incorporated some of the HL2 Beta weapons. It would be lovely to be playing as Shephard and get to use the Combine Sniper.\n-New NPCs! Add some new enemies for the player to face instead of Combine bullet-sponges. You could show that the Combine have been keeping Race X specimen in captivity and have an amazing fight sequence where Shephard has to escape before they tear the place up. Something like that would be a good callback for Op4 fans and would add a new element to the game. Instead we are fighting the same factions the entire game; Combine and Antlions.\n-Different environments! Every area in this game looks generic and has nothing new to it, they all look like they're part of HL2's ending and no new areas are really explored. What about a Ravenholm-type area? It would be sweet as hell to be playing as an HECU marine mowing down zombies with the M249. How about we see Shephard charging the streets and sweeping down combine like nothing? This would be a genuinely fun and memorable experience for players. \n\nOverall, I think this game falls flat because it claims to be a sequel (hell, it's twice the price of) Opposing Force but doesn't offer anything you can't already get from a free mod. There's no real new assets model wise, the enemies are the same. I wish the best for the Developer and his mod and I hope to see this game grow.\n\n5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505038363, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505038363, "recommendationid": "34858208", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520288", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506305042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 111, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 200, "steamid": "76561198092210965", "num_games_owned": 76}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Is this mod terrible? No, not at all. Is it fantastic? Not really.\n\nI appreciate the effort that must have gone into this, and it is definitely quite pretty to look at with the enhanced lighting effects. Gamplay-wise, a few moments may leave you wondering exactly what to do, and depending on how long it takes you to figure it out they may be downright frustrating (specifically the room with the galaxy map and the swarm of Combine that enters).\n\nThe story takes a bit of a curve -- about half-way through I'm no longer entirely sure what's going on anymore, where Shephard is, what his goal is, etc. Why am I on a space station if I was sent to Nova Prospekt to help Freeman? Why am I destroying the reactor core of said space station? Is this important to Combine teleport tech? By destroying this station am I permanently crippling Combine efforts to perfect localized teleports and still helping Freeman in some way? I have no idea.\n\nThe flashback sequences were slightly odd, and depending on how you view it, out of place. Some folks may be turned off by the lack of any unique weapons, especially considering the game this is an unofficial sequel to; you just get the stock HL2 weapons without the gimmicky Gravity Gun. \n\nBeyond nitpicks, confusion over the story, and issues with difficulty in a couple areas that probably just boil down to me being an idiot, I would recommend this mod. That being said, wait for a sale to pick it up. It's fun, but not worth $10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506307382, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506307382, "recommendationid": "35195037", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500359", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506216672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 307, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 307, "steamid": "76561198144492616", "num_games_owned": 65}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "review": "There seems to be a lot of back and forth over whether this game is good or not. Plenty of people have already reviewed this game, but I might as well make a newer review as things might have changed, and the developer has announced plans for updating Prospekt. So I'm going to make a very basic argument, less of a review, for those of you who may be on the fence about buying this game as I was.\n\nIf you're a casual player who just wants to enjoy some Half Life, but are by no means a completionist, this game is skippable, if you so choose. It is of my opinion that Prospekt is for those of us who are fascinated by the world of Half Life, and want to see it explored by as many angles as possible. That IS what was so great about Opposing Force and Blue Shift, at least, in my opinion.\n\nWith that being said, I will say don't go into this game expecting something as plot heavy as Half Life 2. It reminds me more of the first Half Life, where the majority of the game is wandering around hitting buttons and killing enemies who crowd the halls. This isn't a bad thing, as HL1 was great, but you should really enter this game with a neutral mindset. If you go in expecting the wrong thing, you're bound to be disappointed no matter the quality of the game.\n\nSome people have reported glitches, and while I experianced a minor glitch and a single game crash, it was by no means game breaking. The only glitch I experianced was the \"missing texture underwater\" glitch, and it is easy to fix. (Simply right click the game, open the properties, navigate to local files, and click verify integrity of game cache.) So if you're concerned about the game being unplayable, do not worry, it is.\n\nAnother concern I've seen a lot of is the AI of the Combine. Simply put, while I found they were less intelligent than in HL2, it wasn't hard to put up with for me. I understand if it annoys others much more, but I personally am not very bothered. They still pose a challenge, in my opinion.\n\nSo to conclude, I feel as though many reviewers are being too harsh on Prospekt. It should not be held to HL2's standards, as it was not made by the HL time, rather one person. You can label it as a fan game, and compare it to other fan games such as Minerva, but I really do think if you're a fan of Half Life (and especially if you're a fan of Adrian Shephard, like me) then you should give this game a try. However, I will admit $10 is a bit pricey, but I got it on sale for a little over $4 and I suggest you do the same. Otherwise, I'd say to enjoy the game and take it with a grain of salt.

I believe it was a good thought, but they might have gotten a bit overboard with the colours. On the other hand, the lighting was perfect for me, everything was giving of its own light and even in the dark rooms you could still make out walls and objects, much like in real life (once your eyes had adjusted to the dark.) Another thing to point out was the textures took a leap in the contrast, shine, and general look of them. I believe that leap was one in the correct direction.\n\nOverall, the graphics in this game were amazing, even though the colour was a bit overboard it still fit in with the look of everything.
