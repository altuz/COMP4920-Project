You play in a static 2D scene as dozens of zombies pour in at you from both sides of the screen. You can move back and forth, have a high and low attack, and... well, that's about it. No jumping, no special moves, just chop high and chop low. There's about 6 or 7 enemies including crawling zombies, zombie children, and... flying frigging dogs (yes you heard that right). Later on in the game, it throws in a few top down 3D levels, which are the only tolerable levels in the game as far as gameplay. Unfortunately, they are very short.\n\nGraphics\n--------------------\nGreat if you like comic book style cut scenes, 2D backdrops, and characters with very little animation. Don't expect anything grand. And don't expect any material to wank off too. If you can wank off to badly drawn girls with blood covered cleavage, then you are a \"special\" person indeed. No, even boobs couldn't save this game...\n\nStory\n--------------------\nWell... there really isn't any. You're looking for BBQ sauce in a zombie apocalypse, so... yeah...\n\nGameplay\n--------------------\nMonotonous, repetetive, boring, you get the picture... The controls are godawful in 2D. There is an obvious lag between pressing a button and the character executing the action, and sometimes I would hit the button and nothing would happen. You also can do only one thing/button at a time; attack, move, turn. IE, you can't move and attack at the same time, which is really annoying when you have a dozen enemies flying at you from both directions. You can't remap the buttons, which is not a big deal because you only use about 4. Another REALLY annoying thing was that when a zombie gets right on top of you, they seem to become invulnerable, as you just can't seem to hit them, so they just sit there draining your health while you flail your cleaver at them hitting nothing. About 20 levels of 2D frustration...\n\nRedeeming Qualities\n---------------------------\nIt's short... At the time of this review I had 2.7 hours into the game and 100%ed it. Normally, this would not be a redeeming quality, but in this case I was thankful it was over fast.\n\n3D levels. If these had been a lot longer and a bit more polished, and had there been more of them, it would have been great. I would have even preferred that the whole game been like this with none of the 2D levels. I'll not buy another 2D game from this developer, but if they came out with a top down 3D shooter or something, I would consider checking it out.\n\nThe Final Word\n----------------------------------\nI wanted to quit this game early on, but I decided recently that I would try to 100% every game I played. So, at about level 16, I threw it into \"too easy\" mode, and slogged my way through to the end. It was one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in awhile. I've been gaming for over 20 years, and I'm sorry to say this is one of the worst I've ever played. You remember Pong for the Atari 2600? I think I had more fun playing Pong by myself with both joysticks than I did playing this game...\n\n:smiles:", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499995740, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499997463, "recommendationid": "33525749", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520221", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501412089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 34, "steamid": "76561198310030278", "num_games_owned": 127}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I may have posted this prematurely but I think that at a certain point I just had to stop playing.
