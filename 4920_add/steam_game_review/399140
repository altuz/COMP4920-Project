Yes puzzle.\n\nThis game hearkens back to the days of C64 games like Jumpman, Lode Runner, \n\nVery hard, but completely fair.  I don't even get upset when I die and have to restart the map run again because I often see different routes as I push my way through and try to figure out the best way.\n\nWhat I find when I play is that I always feel that victory is just in sight if I adapt my skill or play a little.  As a result Straima pushes me to be a better gamer.\n\nI love this game so much but it is super-intense and I can only take it in short bursts.\n\nMy biggest criticism, not really a criticism just a reality is that due to the pixel nature of the graphics and perhaps my age, I find it very hard to play on screens that aren't right in front of my face.  I can't play this on my 50\" TV with my Steam Link because I can't see anything.  Sitting in front of my PC monitor, no problem.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495381383, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495381383, "recommendationid": "31885392", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517336", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 17, "total_reviews": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
