However, most of my criticisims come from the fact that this was ported to Steam.\n\nIt just doesn't make any sense. There's nothing really notable about Actua Golf 3. It was perfectly fine being the mostly unknown budget PS1 game that it was, so why did it need to be put on Steam? There are far better golf games out there (most of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series comes to mind) that best this game in almost every way.\n\nIt's not even a good porting job, they've literally just dumped an ISO of the game into a PS1 emulator, prettied the loader up a bit, slapped a $5 price tag on it (or 99c price tag if you managed to get it during the Steam sales like I did) and called it a day. Being the PS1 game that it is, it looks and sounds pretty damn drab in comparison to pretty much any other golf game on Steam or on other systems from the last 15 years.\n\nOnly really recommended if you grew up with it and want to reexperience it again for some reason, and even that's a stretch. I don't think I could think of any other reason why you'd want this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451127332, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451127332, "recommendationid": "19958395", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506832", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460497920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561198262987629", "num_games_owned": 27}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This Game would be great if you could just use a mouse.  but if you don't mind using the keybord or have a controller might work well for you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460495051, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460495051, "recommendationid": "22383410", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502071", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1483318406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561198035956158", "num_games_owned": 415}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Don't bother.
