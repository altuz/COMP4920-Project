The art style is very nice and mixed with the music and gameplay you could be playing this on a megadrive or snes. \n\nIf you want a blast from the past this is worth a look.\n\nAnd you can this on Android too might give that one a download as it would be so suited to handhelds", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1441698915, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441470905, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1441728721, "recommendationid": "17896492", "developer_response": "The initial version of the game had a bug if playing with an analog gamepad controller, I just made an update and this should now be fixed !
