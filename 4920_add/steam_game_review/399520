Comedy Quest is a video game about the life of a young aspiring comedian. You set out on a journey to become a stand up comedian and perform in front of crowds, you guide your character through creating comedy routines for him to perform in front of his audiences as he travels from city to city performing and growing as a professional comic. Comedy Quest is a 2017 favorite among game critics, pushing next-gen hardware to the limits with DirectX 9 compatibility, 8x nearest neighbor and 8x antialiasing graphic filters, 32-bit high definition textures (4k texture pack available via DLC). But all of this is nothing if your computer doesn't have a lot of memory, as Comedy Quest chews through a massive 20mb of RAM, and don't forget that a 60Hz monitor isn't usable as the game has a 40Hz FPS cap unless you play via a CRT, which then, and only then can you boost the FPS up to 85Hz, that's only if your computer has the horsepower to run this monster of a video game. The one downside of Comedy Quest is that it requires having a gtx 1070 as the minimum spec for the graphics card\n\n9.5/10 for excellent gameplay and high budget production value", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485509145, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485675445, "recommendationid": "29517597", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485290067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 450, "playtime_forever": 5, "steamid": "76561198025543872", "num_games_owned": 398}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485290073, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485290073, "recommendationid": "29469921", "language": "english", "votes_down": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481449", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1486000077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 118, "steamid": "76561198244272114", "num_games_owned": 16}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "omg this game is so amazing there needs to be a sequal", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486000146, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1486000146, "recommendationid": "29639982", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
