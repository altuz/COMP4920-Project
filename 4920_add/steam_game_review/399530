The first type have puzzles that are so easy that a lobotomized gibbon could do them.  The next type are the ones that have puzzles so confusing, undefined, and/or difficult that you end up going to the hospital after putting your fist throught the wall (and when you return just go on you tube and find a solution).  The third is a haphazzard combination of the two making you wonder if the lobotomized gibbon is now developing games.  The fourth are the gems.\n\nThese are the games that are difficult enough that you ALMOST have to go on you tube for a solution but still solvable so that when you perservere you feell like you've accomplished something.  Joyfully, this is one of them.\n\nAs of this writing, I have finished all of the puzzles.  Several took quite a few whacks at it to slowly eliminate incorrect pathways.  And each time I would solve a difficult one, it truly felt like I conquered something!!\n\nThe premise is simple.  You need 1 complete rotation of all of the spheres on the screen.  The catch?  They are on multiple pathways (sometimes multiple speeds) and they cannot touch each other.  No special effects.  No open world.  No gimmicks.  Just your brain vs a game!!!!!\n\nAnd if the game isn't great enough on it's own merit, the developer actually supports the game!!!!  Having been burned a couple times on this one (as we all have) it was refreshing for this developer to fix all 3 issues on sepereate occasions that were impeding the game/achievements.  And I will always support developers that care about the gamers that play their games.  (and for those of you that are achievement hunters, how does 161 achievements grab you!!!!!)\n\nThis is now one of my favorite straight puzzlers I have ever played.  To the developers, cheers!

All spheres have to complete one full cycle to complete a level. The simple mechanics works to build increasingly challenging dynamic puzzles.\n\n[h1]Stilling magic[/h1]\n\nThe puzzles start really simple: shapes are just two circles to place spheres on. Ported from a mobile game, you get three stars (\"a perfect level\") if no spheres are destroyed during a level. It's worth noting that the game is really generous with achievements, serving one for each 3-starred level.\n\nAs you get further, the puzzles get more complicated. For instance, you might need to place two spheres on a each shape. Not all shapes are circles either: there are also rectangles, triangles and ellipses, often mingled up together.\n\nMoving shapes are usually the trickiest ones. Additionally, there are (sometimes moving) spiky walls that destroy spheres on contact. Sometimes a time restraint is imposed through the spheres being destroyed automatically after a set number of cycles, but this was never a problem for me.\n\nA trick is that you can also press on a single sphere to make it stay still, for instance to avoid collision or fine-tune its pace. In case of moving shapes this will also stop the shape from moving. However, if there are several spheres on a single shape, it will only stop one of the spheres from moving so you have to be careful.\n\n[h1]Schroedinger's spheres[/h1]\n\n[i]Hyspherical 2[/i] is not without frustration. While part of the puzzles is creating perfect cycles, you also have to make sure the spheres do not get too close to each other.\n\nFor whatever reason, the spheres might make several happy cycles together but if they have been close together, they might rather randomly just collide with each other despite their previously peaceful cycles. To me in these cases it usually does not look plausible that they could have hit each other. An example is in order:\n\nTake for instance two spheres, moving along a perfect circle very close to each other at a steady pace. It's theoretically impossible for them to hit each other, right? But in [i]Hyspherical 2[/i] it does happen, probably because of numerical imprecision in the collision detection. It's frustrating when you are just about to complete a level and then this ruins it.\n\nThen again the levels are usually rather short. One try lasts from a few seconds to a minute so not a lot of time is lost due to a failure.\n\nAnother issue occurs with moving shapes and to a lesser extent with fast moving spheres: it can be tricky to hit them with the cursor, especially since you need precision to avoid collisions. The spawn spots, i.e. the buttons that create spheres, are small so the issue is worse with moving shapes. Fortunately these levels are rare.\n\nThough I played it with mouse, one could use a touchscreen device. I wouldn't know whether this is difficult on those as well.\n\n[h1]Conclusions[/h1]\n\nWhile I encountered a couple of bugs along the way, the developers have been kind enough to fix them as they have been reported, albeit at a slower pace than preferred. It took several weeks to fix the bug with the last achievement but everything seems to be working correctly now.\n\nI completed the game 3-starring every level in about 9 hours but I think the completion time would vary a lot between players and their pattern recognition and hands & eye coordination skills. On mobile the base game is free-to-play with ads and in-app purchases of some kind, so the current price on Steam seems good to me, given that there are no ads or other remnants from mobile to be seen.
