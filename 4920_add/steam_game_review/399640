What's really nice about this is how well balanced and equally important these two parts are. Knowing where to go, what to spend your money on, what abilities to upgrade first and which of the 5 available gods you devote yourself to is equally as important as being able to land your abilities and dodge projectiles.\n\nI've seen people compare this game's combat to MOBAs and I can kinda see why. Your character has stats that are fairly standard for this genre like movement speed, attack speed/damage, ability power and cooldown reduction. You also have 4 abilities that are on a short cooldown and a weapon (that would correspond to your auto-attack although you do have to mash the attack key in order to keep attacking).\n\nYou can either build the character yourself, picking the race, weapon and all the abilities if you wanna go for some fancy synergies or you can let the game give you a randomized character to play with. What kinda bothers me is that when you make a custom character, you only get half of \"Spirit\" which is the currency that unlocks new races, abilities and weapons so the custom runs kinda feel like a waste of your time in this regard.\n\nWhat I also love about the game is how ridiculously overpowered you can get and how this is not really dependent on your luck (well...at least not entirely). You see, there is no single overpowered item that will catapult your run to greatness like Brimstone or Polyphemus in Isaac. In Flamebreak, if you want to get powerful, you need to make good decisions consistently and plan ahead.\n\nLast but not least, the game also has 3 versions of daily runs with separate leaderboards, which I find kinda questionable because very few people play these in the first place but I play them all every day regardless.\n\nOverall I would totally recommend Flamebreak to anyone who's been itching for a new rogue-lite game since even though it does borrow some heavy inspiration from other titles, it is very well polished and executed.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499464901, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499464954, "recommendationid": "33355613", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509770", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500371920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1992, "steamid": "76561197981755894", "num_games_owned": 359}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Simple looking rogue-lite which holds a lot more depth than you'd expect.
