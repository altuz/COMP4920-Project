There was that Mark Serrels Kotaku article comparing two sides of the Australian indie coin: Hacknet and Expand. Both developers revered each others games even if they never saw eye to eye on matters. I bought Hacknet at launch and disliked it intensely. But Expand was visually striking with an interesting base gameplay mechanic: it sounded like a game that I'd be way into. Maybe that should've been a sign. I purchased Expand and in one sitting completed it, feeling wholly unsatisfied with the experience.\n\nWhile there's an interesting aesthetically-tied gameplay idea at the core of Expand, it feels as if it--excuse the pun--never actually gets expanded upon. It's quite short with a very limited set of light action-puzzle mechanics that oscillate between serviceable uses of the circular mechanic to simply frustrating timing-based puzzles. None of the sets of puzzles and their associated mechanics really feel cohesive or justified in the context of the game's world and feel quite arbitrary. It's never hard enough to be considered challenging or 'masocore', nor is it engaging enough to be enjoyable as an easy going game about exploring this very tightly constructed and authored psuedo-labyrinth.\n\nThe game consists of four main levels, your spokes from the main hub world. These levels each have some loosely connected mechanic that ties the stage together. It never feels like you're exploring a labyrinth or maze, it's incredibly straightforward with very little deviation from the critical path. It's always obvious where you need to go, though that's not necessarily a negative. Once all four are complete you [spoiler]go through a kind of gauntlet, each one of these previous elements after one another[/spoiler]. Then the game's over. [spoiler]You escape your confines, but not in any interesting or meaningful way.[/spoiler] I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it just never felt like anything particularly special like I was lead to believe. One somewhat novel mechanic wrung dry over two hours.\n\nI understand that the description calls Expand \"meditative\" but there's a clear progression and roadblocks that have to be overcome. That adjective is certainly up to the player themselves, it can be a meditative experience if you want. The game's structure seems counter to these goals. I'll go into a figurative trance in games like Flywrench or Mini Metro, but I didn't feel that same draw in Expand.\n\nVisually, Expand is perfectly okay. It's initially enticing with its extreme contrasts, but I think it lacks some kind of... edge? Despite being full of 90 degree angles I think it looks 'soft' in a way that puts me off the more I play it. It has a definite style but it feels tame. It's hard to describe but I think there's more that could be done visually. I never felt a sense of space or continuity, just a series of screens. Adventure for the 2600, an ancestor of sorts, evoked a sense of place more than I felt Expand did.\n\nCirca Infinity, another 2015 release, attempts a similar sort of visual style: black and white, circle-based. Even some of the mechanics appear similar. I find it quite a bit more successful in its execution.\n\nThe score to Expand is certainly my favourite part. Chris Larkin's compositions are fantastic and you do get a sense of growth and expansion, of progression which I did enjoy. I'd like to say the evolution of the felt seamless, but there were some very noticeable transitions when entering the next level. It's a very minor thing but very detrimental to the feel of the experience.\n\nOne very minor thing I loathed: the options menu being in world. It's an idea that sounds great in concept but is just awful to use. Getting around the 'menu' system is a pain, even when you understand it. It's not immersive.\n\nI think what it comes down to is that Expand feels like a flash game from the mid-late '00s that you'd find on Kongregate or the like. It feels hollow. Expand is a fleeting experience comprised of mechanics that aren't especially interesting or memorable There's no message or tale to be gleaned, not really much to be interpreted. I saw Expand being hailed as an under-appreciated Australian indie gem, but after finishing Expand it feels more like a starved community grasping at straws, trying to get recognised on a global scale.\n\nI wanted to like Expand! It feels like a 'me' game through and through. I didn't.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451210571, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1451782480, "recommendationid": "19990988", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530298", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445771648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 250, "steamid": "76561197985082775", "num_games_owned": 3042}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "2", "review": "As a boy, I always loved mazes, and today one of my favorite things about video games is the ease with which they can impossibly manipulate space.  So you can imagine what a dream-come-true Expand represents for me as it continuously draws and redraws its maze, repurposing the same canvas over and over again.  It appeals directly to the child at the core of me with its beautifully animated clockwork machinations.\n\nThe effect is immediately enchanting, but what really surprised me was how dramatic and affecting this experience can be at length.  Whether the maze seems to be guiding or daunting you, the flowing rearrangements of its space paired with a dynamically developing musical score create something rather cinematic in style as melancholy piano gradually builds into uplifting chords over encouraging percussion, each step in its evolution magically timed to your actions and progress, eventually reaching a crescendo to accompany a climax of level design.\n\nExpand has been described as a slower Super Hexagon.  That comparison may seem helpful on a superficial level, but it fails to meaningfully communicate (or appreciate) the nature of either game.  Expand is not an arcade game.  It's not a puzzle game.  It's an action-adventure game\u2014like a platformer, essentially, although obviously from a different mechanical perspective since it's top-down, gravity isn't a factor, and there are no actions to perform aside from moving with the analog stick.  It presents a series of hand-crafted micro-levels, and you simply navigate their hazardous patterns.  What makes it so special, however, is the relationship between these \"levels.\"\n\nWhen you watch its trailer, you might get the impression that Expand consists of a series of discrete stages, but it's not structured that way at all.  While the game is divided into labeled sections like \"Elude\" and \"Control\" whose mechanisms pleasingly fit within the themes that those names suggest, every bit of the level design itself unfolds smoothly as the circular labyrinth transforms itself around you.  The continuous experience created by these seamless changes in the long run captures my imagination so completely and so elegantly that I find this aspect of Expand invaluable and sufficient grounds for recommendation on its own, entirely regardless of its merits as a game.\n\nYet those merits, too, are strong.  The entire game takes place around a circular core\u2014such that lateral movement is actually rotational\u2014and its scenarios explore the action-puzzle ramifications of this concept.  For example, an early \"room\" sees geometry constantly push out from the center in a ripple.  To stay ahead of it, you need to move around the circle while remaining as close to the center as possible because it maximizes your rotational speed; if you drift away to the outside of the circle, you will have more ground to cover, fall behind, and get squashed.  Later situations add the wrinkle of maze design unfolding as you move closer to the core, as though your perspective were changing with distance.  The environment responds to your movement in many other ways, as well; my favorite \"device\" is when paths open up or close off as you repeatedly revolve around the circle's center.  It makes you feel like the brilliant pick inside an incredibly complicated lock.\n\nJust about all of the action in Expand is quickly intuitive, and the whole game moves along at an even pace, aided by generous checkpointing and unobtrusive retries upon failure.  It's challenging to the point of being engaging, but it's not a hard game.  There are no limited lives or other penalties for failure, so even the most difficult patterns can be practiced repeatedly\u2014although you generally can't brute force your way through because each trial is long enough to test for proper understanding.  Overall, Expand is satisfying to complete; but it's not about the challenge\u2014there are no achievements here\u2014it's about the experience, which is remarkably emotional given its abstraction.\n\nExpand is a short game, unlikely to last more than two hours for most players, but that length is just right for it to fully explore its premise.  Once it's over, it sticks with you.  There's just nothing else out there like it, and, as memorable as it is, I'm sure I'll indulge in regular replays.  I never realized how badly I was missing something like this, but now that I have played it I can't imagine my library without it.  If you have even a vague interest\u2014if Expand even remotely seems like the sort of thing you might enjoy\u2014I definitely recommend it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445779852, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446176778, "recommendationid": "18677265", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516594", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444921327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 196, "steamid": "76561198079735086", "num_games_owned": 396}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Simple and Beautiful..
