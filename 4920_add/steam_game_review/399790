In all honesty, I regret not listening to the reviews. The game is obviously a huge rip off of Naruto, from the characterization, to the set up of the world and the history, to the entire plot. There was nothing about this game that was original. The only reason I played as long as I did was because I wanted to see how far the creator of this game went with Naruto's original story in this game. In the beginning, I played them game laughing at the \"similarities\" but, after awhile, the humor and ridiculousness quickly turned to irritation. The game went out of its way to be more difficult than it needed to be and became less about following the story line to just trying to survive battle to battle for hours at a time. After awhile, it became pointless and irritating and, eventually, led me to stop playing. Because of this, I do not recommend this game unless you like pointless, mindless battles and games that are an obvious rip off from someone else's idea.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505008407, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505008407, "recommendationid": "34850972", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512852", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506093696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 756, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1295, "steamid": "76561198217636583", "num_games_owned": 253}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Stay away from this game! It's not worth your money or your time.\n\n\n.The main plot is a cheap copy of Naruto's but it lacks all the charm and makes no sense. It starts of as a variation of Masashi Kishimoto's first mangas (involving main events from the Ch\u016bnin Exams and the Sound Four) after what it devolves introducing a made up religious cult mixed up with Akatsuki's plans... Bottom line: the whole thing is a 10 chapter mess.\n\n.The dialogues are so bad, full of clich\u00e9s and swears, that you won't even want to read them. And what little you do read, is poorly written and you notice several mistakes.\n\n.The combat system is terrible, there's no option to remember your last action and it feels clunky. Among other things, there's no way of knowing whose turn it is (you need to be aware of each members AGI but enemy turns are not displayed so you can't know who is going to attack when). Also enemy attack animations take forever (when there's no way of skipping them) which prolong the fights' length unnecessarily and you can easily skip your turns by mistake.\n\n.Enemies are ALWAYS stronger than you and more numerous. Their defences are sky high and they deal a lot more damage and negative effects than you, so the only way to progress is using items in combat (which I hate).\n\nTo make things worse, the game forces you to play with different characters all the time (which you honestly don't care about) so you can't just focus on some of them because you'll have to fight with pretty much every character later on. This, in turn, forces you to invest more money in their gear and spend more time trying to beat the most bothersome parts of the game (specially chapter 8). And to top it all off, enemies will spawn at random (appart from the ones you can see and avoid) and the Flee option rarely succeeds so you are constantly saving your game to maintain your progress at the same time you try to figure out how to solve the puzzles so you can finally finish all those parts (you end up ignoring treasure chests entirely since most of them just contain more dreadful enemy encounters anyway).\n\nThere are two particular encounters that deserve a special consideration. In both of them you fight with the Beast mode active and all your attacks will deal exactly 1 point of damage to your enemies. The only way to beat the first of these encounters is causing the Burn state to your foe and pray not to receive too much damage so that you can heal yourself using items. The second ecounter is even better: the whole fight comes down to sheer luck. Your personal skill in both these fights won't have any impact and the only thing you can do is keep replaying them until you finally emerge victorious (fortunately the game allows you to repeat your latest encounter, otherwise it would be even worse).\n\n.The character progression is awful. Enemies have auto-level and the skills you learn (when you level up) don't usually help because they barely cause any damage to your foes. As a result you end up using just a couple of spells and skills from each character. For example, from the 15+ skills Kitt can learn I ended up using only three or four, and the same happened with J.C., Maddie and Spark only it's worse in their case because you have both spells and skills. Alas, I only used two or three spells with each character and one or two skills because I could deal with enemies faster and using less energy that way. This comes to show most of your characters' skills are wasted which is yet another prove of the horrible gaming design of this release.\n\n.The game`s optional content consists on premade fights (which you face with just one character what generally makes winning them an impossible mission), trades that allow you to get a bit more money or experience with J.C. (that you end up getting anyway through normal progression) and the ocasional quizz. But there's no crafting system, despite the fact that you can get several crafting materials.\n\n\nOverall: 1/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506097302, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506279949, "recommendationid": "35131832", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504705", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506449949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1513, "steamid": "76561198094895850", "num_games_owned": 256}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I don't care if this game is a rip off of Naruto or not.
