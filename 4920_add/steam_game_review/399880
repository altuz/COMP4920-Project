My 3 y/o loves it.  It was nice to find a game that he could enjoy and challenge his mind a little bit. There is no real story that I can see, but I have only given it a quick eye test and watch him play it a bit. All in all, not a bad game to pick up so a little boy/girl can game like mommy or daddy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1453254632, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1453255141, "recommendationid": "20634683", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507736", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504637130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 636, "steamid": "76561198020660798", "num_games_owned": 103}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": " This title has a few mini games inside and it has been fun to watch my 3 year old get engaged in them.

Perfect.  My son loved it so much.  Very large variety of mini-games, and even a decent, voice-less movie that is extremely entertaining even for adults, although it's a bit trippy/psychedelic, so it's even more 'cool'.  great music as well.  8/10, worth 5 bucks imo", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502491907, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502491907, "recommendationid": "34178694", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
