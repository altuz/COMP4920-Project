The plot isn't /so/ bad considering it's a point-and-click, but the first act moves bizarrely fast. Rather than build plot and info you start off knowing pretty much everything and go from there. Once you get past that it's not /so/ bad; it's not the best, I rolled my eyes at times, but it's not terrible. The voice-acting, though, is absolutely godawful. Click to continue when you can, and if cinematics don't matter to you (they don't reveal anything at all this go) just go beyond them. The graphics are good, but that doesn't really make up for it all. The number of clicks is low, there isn't much to find or use or puzzle out. I would NOT reccomend buying this on its own, not even necessarily if it's on a good sale. if you end up with it, though, you won't want to slit your throat or anything. It's just not great. Artifex does good games on their own, but this was just of their production, not their creation. Replayability is basically null as well.\n\ntl;dnr - Eh. Even if you like point-and-clicks like me, just... eh. I love these things in general, but I won't be buying the prequels or the sequels.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498705914, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498706031, "recommendationid": "32970531", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504509", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492634354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 282, "steamid": "76561198136563302", "num_games_owned": 155}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really like this one and the story is very unique.
