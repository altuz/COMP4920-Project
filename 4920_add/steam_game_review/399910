Ooki with a sparkle in his eyes spots of his favourite \u2026. bananas! But then something terrible happens. Those awful yet terribly cute bullies gang up on Ooki and steal his precious bananas. Distraught Ooki goes to visit monkey god. He is told to beat ALL the cute bullies over 100 levels to get his bananas back! Life really isn\u2019t fair\u2026.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\n\nSo the story is just fluff and took one minute to write but this just setup for a very fun block puzzle game. Ooki has to punch all the banana blocks in a correct route. This consists of nine areas made up of ten levels and a mini boss fight. To unlock a new area, you must beat the previous one first. The faster and longer combos you achieve the better points you get. This in turn gives you a better rank.  Be warned slow coaches! Devil Cat will appear and start chasing you and try to kill you after a certain time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=707006703\n\nFiguring out some of the routes might make you want to punch something but they are all solvable. Additionally, elements, spikes, portals, floating and ground enemies are all determined to ruin your good time. providing some additional challenge. If you need extra help you can take the daily challenge to win a go on the prize machine for extra lives or helpers.\n\n[u]Artwork and Music [/u]\n\nThe artwork and character designs match the tone of the game perfectly and I feel it was a great design choice. Its big, bold, cartoon like and colourful. The main catchy instrumental sounds like a steel band jamming on an island. Devil Cat got his own instrumental too which is a scratch stopping the main and gives of a spooky warning feel. The animal sounds are very nice too.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=701169683\n\n[u]Conclusion [/u]\n\nThis is great value for its price providing hours of fun out if you enjoy puzzle games. After game completion you can still do daily challenges, banana chase and work on achievements. Devil Cat also wants you to try his ultra difficult levels if you are hard enough. I am also convinced the developers unleashed their inner child by naming an area Mount Doodeedoo. On a final note I would love the developers to add some emotes to collect for this game. If you have seen any screenshots of this game the character designs are too cute not to collect!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1475305327, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1475305327, "recommendationid": "25794762", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533903", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444854999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 24, "steamid": "76561198065933784", "num_games_owned": 47}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Very charming and fun game. Ookibloks covers the basics of good game design and presentation perfectly:\n1) It's very easy to learn, but hard to master.\n2) The pleasant, well polished (and very cute) music, sound, graphics and play mechanics are very cohesive...nothing ever seems remotely out of place, confusing or imbalanced. Nothing is wasted, and all that is there adds to the depth and charm of the experience.\n3) You want to not only finish the game, but also replay it to see how much you can improve on your speed, score etc.\n\nThe lives counter is also a great way to gauge your skill level. Can you make it through the whole game without the need to continue or even without loosing a single life?\n\nOokiblocks is a very fun and cute casual game which perfectly blends action and puzzle without causing stress or frustration. It's also a great game for a parent to share with their children due to its previously mentioned traits.\n\nSure, you can get a free to play version on mobile (which I will also do), but I much prefer a full screen, ad free version with d-pad support on the comfort of my own PC.\n\nOne final note:  I was surprised and thrilled when I ran into the first boss.

There's a nice tutorial at the beginning to show you the ropes and does a good job explaining how the game works.

The lives and daily challenges are very likely to be relics of the game being available for free on tablets, but don't quote me on that, I may be very wrong.\n\nAnyway, not claiming this is a problem, but it does make lives pretty much irrelevant and somewhat annoying since a game over screen is pretty much a loss of time. There's also the fact that there's no quick and easy way to reset a level when you try to go for a perfect combo and the background graphics seem to \"break\" if the resolution gets too big (On the world map with a resolution of 1600 X 900)\n\nHowever, beside those nitpicks, the game is really nice. I saw that the music was given with the game and I was sceptical about it really worth being MP3s and oh boy was I wrong. The music is superb and really catchy, probably my favorite aspect of the game. I like the music so much that I went on the data files (\\resource\\shared\\sfx) and got the actual music files myself and added .ogg to them so I get the real music files to listen to :P The MP3s have some very noticeable compression artifacts.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but challenging, controls are very responsive, however as I said the lack of a Retry button is annoying.\n\nI also expected a custom level editor for that kind of game but it seems there is none of that.
