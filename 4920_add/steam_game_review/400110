The negative reviews turned me off from this game in the past and nearly did so again, until I watched 3 minutes of a YT video just to see what the hacking component was like.  It was enough for me to buy it to grind through the early game that everyone talks about.\n\nThe negative reviews couldn't have been more wrong about the early game.  I am loving the fact that I, for once in a long time, have to go out looking for what to do rather than having a quest arrow or a map icon show me.  I appreciate looking at the map and not seeing a blinking \"me\" icon and having to figure out where in town I am.  \n\nThis game is for those who want to think, those who enjoy the journey and who don't just want to minmax their way through all of the quests and who want to have to investigate and take clues.  The story is also underrated.  I would classify it as very good, but it is also trippy and very random, which may or may be not your sort of thing.

Great artwork and an interesting concept. I can only recommend it.\n\nWhich leads to the minor problems in this game:\n[list]\n[*] Most disks only contains information, not programs. While you can boot a disk from some machines, I think only 2 or 3 disks have valid programs on them, and for most of them it looks like and accident. (And without a modifier, booting one of the disks can lead you to a dead end)\n[*] There are not much (useful) computer programs out there. Most computers are just a floppy data reader, the pedestrian OS, a movie title generator, TriPod OS or some other program that you've seen several times before.\n[*] The story is... well, I personally don't like stories without a good ending.\nThat being said, the story is good at the beginning. It even has a few side quests. But later on.. There is only one path or \"end this now\".\n[*] Connect() with Slurp() and RemoteFunctionCall() is ridiculous overpowered; especially if you know the name of a few computers with their special APIs. Honestly, this thing breaks the game if you use it.\n[*] Elevators are strange. While the code on the inner elevator will tell me, that it will go to door A, because it's an elevator, and the elevator is on a different floor, the inner elevator door will lead to door B. I expected elevators to be coded in SPRAK. (Ok, this might be hard with path finding.)\n[*] Money is pointless. There is no point in having $1000000 or $-5000. It doesn't matter at all. You can even spend money if you don't have it. And you are never expected to pay it back.\n[*] Door unlock codes (that's what keys use) are not controlled by the code of the door itself. Kind of boring, because if you can read a doors code, you can put this code on any other open door and just use the new door.\n[/list]\n\nBut this are just small points, that I hope will be changed and will make else Heart.Break() more internally consistent.\n\nAll in all, 10/10, would hack my coffee again.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504291586, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504291638, "recommendationid": "34666588", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505233", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502356252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1353, "steamid": "76561198096608094", "num_games_owned": 150}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Far and above the best hacking game I've played. It involves actual programming, yet still allows you to do the cool shit that hackers do, like bump their bank balance up to a hundred thou. I can't say what a person's experience will be like if they don't know any computer programming -- I expect it might be a difficult but rewarding challenge. But a programmer will have a great time; the first time you build a universal key you will feel like a god. The game world is atmospheric and the characters are solid. The dialogue is a bit mediocre, but doesn't detract from the plot. You will have to play through two to three hours of plot before you get to do any programming, and even then you will have to explore to find the means.

The story is intereasting but the real game starts once you acquire the \"Modifier\": a tool that allows you to hack anything from a computer to a lampost to a cigarette to your very own can of refreshing all natural Wellspring Soda. \n\nThis hacking ability allows you to do nearly all you want. For example, change the colour of the light emitted by the lamposts, hack your soda so that instead of lowering your sleepiness by 5 it lowers it by 99999999999999999999999 (something, i believe, you will be doing rather often). If you are looking for something slightly more amusing you can make it so each time somebody uses a computer it will say something, or you can loop two doors so that an NPC will simply go trough one door on one end of the room and come out the other end, only to try again and again (something i did on accident while [spoiler]  trying to get into Mondas apartment [/spoiler]).\n\nIt is this hacking aspect that kept me hooked and coming back, not the story, for it is linear with only one ending, but it is this rich world that i can hack and modify. The Sprak language is suprisingly user friendly for the more basic tasks, but can easily get more difficult if you are trying to do more complicated things.\n\nSo, if you are still intereasted in buying this game, then don't expect a rapid first try, it will be slow and you will likely think you wasted money but trust me, it is well worth the price. \n\nAlso, the title makes sense", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502030683, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502030683, "recommendationid": "34061653", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499535385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1158, "steamid": "76561198028520876", "num_games_owned": 25}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have really enjoyed Else Heart.Break().
