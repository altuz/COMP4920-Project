I have such mixed feelings about this game. It's an amazing game in concept, it provides an entirely unique gameplay experience, the humor is childish but spot-on, and it feels like it should be fun. I want to like this game SO BAD! That said, I've only played three or four hours and have already found myself repeatedly asking \"what were the devs thinking?\".\n\nFor example, this game, which involves permantently placing objects on a board in a way that one misplaced item can lose you the game no matter how early you make said mistake, gives you a hand size of TWO. This results in extremely luck-based gameplay, even for a deck-building CCG.\n\nAnother example: if you tie with an AI opponent, instead of adding another column as a tie-breaker, you straight up lose.\n\nAdd this to the fact that there are numerous UI issues (reseting takes a solid 10-15 seconds on many maps, sometimes clicking menu objects will instead place objects underneath the menus (remember my first point), no way to disable tutorial popups, etc.) and I am reluctant to recommend this otherwise awesome game.\n\nHOWEVER, Steam's bad design has forced my hand. Like so many other games which fall into this category, I can't give a review of \"neither amazing nor terrible\". I have to say either it's awesome or it's awful. Devs, I'm giving you a thumbs up because I want this game to succeed. Valve, this isn't a children's lemonade stand. Adapt or GOG will replace you. Well, replace you faster.\n\nEdit: I changed my mind after another half hour of play. Thumbs down. One more clarification: I said it was building things behind the UI. I was wrong. Clicking on the bar on the left side of the screen will often build things in the center or right of the screen. There is a \"solution\" for this in the menu (\"Are you sure?\" messages for each building placement), but that doesn't fix the problem; throwing up pestering messages every five seconds will just train the user to say \"yes\" to any such messages.\n\nBy buying this game, you are basically buying a really, REALLY bad slot machine. Will it give you an unwinnable situation which you can't forsee or predict? It's all the luck of the draw!\n\nWell, lesson learned: set a timer for 1 hour 55 minutes ANY TIME you buy a Steam game.\n\nSeriously, how in the world do you screw up mouse controls that badly?", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496881327, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1496887195, "recommendationid": "32258612", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540567", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492574026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 224, "steamid": "76561198014698888", "num_games_owned": 551}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": "1", "review": "The game starts off interesting enough, but rapidly goes downhill.  It's a deck-building board game at heart that has absolutely nothing to do with city management and very little flexibility in the deck building.\n\nYou have a set of cards that correspond to various types of developments and must place them into a grid of city spaces in such a way as to earn points.  The game is purely a puzzle game with randomized pieces. (Think Tetris, but with a bit of theme.)\n\nThe campaign starts you off slowly.  Houses are the point earning buildings.  Schools, shops, and entertainment make houses worth more points.  Factories, power plants, and warehouses remove points.  Your deck starts off with basic cards that you generally don't ever to use once more cards are unlocked, but you're always stuck with the junk in your deck and no good way to get rid of it for most characters.  Pretty soon more cards are thrown into the mix but no strategic advice is provided to determine how the cards can work well together.  There are a plethora of cards to unlock, but doing so requires an incredibly difficult and lengthy grind of replaying the same game over and over to level up each character.  Each character also has a complicated tech-tree full of abilities for you to figure out how to use (with very ambiguous descriptions provided).\n\nLevels very quickly ramp up in difficulty and even stack the board against you.  The solo campaign ends before you even have a full understanding of how the game works.  After that you're forced into multiplayer battles against AI who always have better decks than you.  The game doesn't really provide any feedback to how you are doing until it's too late.  You can start a match thinking you're doing well only to later realize that you don't have enough of the good cards in your deck to score any points in the end game, whereas your opponent is perfectly poised to score over and over again.\n\nI think the game has an interesting premise, but the execution and delivery are just downright terrible.  The tutorial needs to be completely revamped so that it actually teaches players how to fully play the game.  It may be more enjoyable if you didn't have to struggle for hours on end trying to understand how each mechanic works and how to actually play strategically.  The game also needs a playable campaign for each character that focuses on the strengths and weaknesses specific to each character's deck instead of what it currently does, which is to just throws you into a new character role with no explanation on the particularities of the character.  These poor design choices force you to repeat the same handful of levels over and over again, which grow boring very quickly.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492574534, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492574534, "recommendationid": "31230630", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515593", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504926653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1981, "steamid": "76561197998388812", "num_games_owned": 191}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A great game for those who enjoy turn based games/board games where you can take your time planning your next move(s).

Concrete Jungle is a game that is learned quickly, but takes some careful planning to master. And part of the fun of these games is learning all the patterns, unlocking all the top-tier cards, and then creating an unstoppable deck. The problem is this game doesn't allow you to become an end-game god. \n\nIt's not because the game is difficult. I could respect a game that ramps up in difficulty to the point where it is unbeatable. Concrete Jungle certainly has those types of elements. However, the game stopper for a skilled player is something insidious: hidden caps. For instance, one card allows you to increase your building allowences (think of it as a budget), but eventually you hit a limit and the game stops counthing them. So effectively this normally great card becomes useless. Actually, worse, it's a penalty because the card is forever in deck wasting space. And the limit isn't because you reach some obsene number that could cause an integer overflow. No it's because you reach 200-- a value easily reached in custom game play.\n\nAlso, the block sizes are capped. Normally blocks are limited to 4 tiles. Some cards allow you to increase the block size which can be helpful for cases where where you have a ton of +1 bonuses attached to that block. You can rack up a lot of points this way. But then, at around 15 tiles in the block, you can't increase the size of the block anymore. This hidden cap snuck up on me at the worst moment. I spent 30 turns carefully planning how to make a maximal efficiency block only to find when I needed to reap the rewards, I no longer could because my carefully crafted block maxed out in size. There's no logical reason for this limitation and it feels like a punishement for playing the game too well.\n\ntl;dr If you're a perfectionist who enjoys mastering games, CJ isn't worth your time.
