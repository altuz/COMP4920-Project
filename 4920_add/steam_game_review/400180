The music is very catchy as well. I juts keep wanting to unlock more permanent starting heroes since that is one of my favorite things to do in roguelikes, you usually loose everything else after all. Plus, as a philosopher, this game is really a dream come true.\n\nPeople have been reporting bugs, but I myself have only experienced one very minor bug and the developers are active and responsive.
