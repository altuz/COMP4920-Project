The game is very short providing a rewarding satisfaction from being able to solve the puzzles.  All of the hallmarks of extreme difficulty are present, from objects hiding behind other objects, to tiny objects, to objects color matched to the background, their all here for the brave explorer willing to venture to the lost planet.\n\nThe game is very short, even the \"casual\" or easiest difficulty doesnt make the game much easier so go with expert which still provides a hint button if stuck or lost.  Half of the puzzle solving is figuring out what the puzzle is, what to do next, or even how to solve a puzzle.  No instructions for puzzles, and many barely have hints to figure them out making even solving the puzzle itself a mystery, let alone finding them.\n\nGreat cast and characters, not enough of them in game.  While most games never have characters or the player is the character this has a small group of explorers part of a space mission which makes it that much more interesting than traditional HOG formulas.\n\nProbably the most comfy menu screen in gaming with the whole game having atmospheric music that fits the feeling of an alien world.  If anything the game can be worth getting just to leave the comfy menu screen on in the background.\n\nVeteran HOG gamers should consider this title.\nRating:  9/10  Value:  $4.99", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505696803, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505702520, "recommendationid": "35036393", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519700", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "total_reviews": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 18}}
