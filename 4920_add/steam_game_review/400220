There is no real indication of where to go or what to do other than dodge things and shoot at stuff.\n\nThe game itself is something I want to enjoy but it feel buggy and unfinished. (I heard it was still in an alpha state, but I see no \"early access\" listed at the time of this review so I assumed it was a finished product before buying.) On problem in particular is the fact that the game speed constantly changes, sometimes it'll get so fast that it's hard to react to anything and other times it'll slow down as if your computer can't handle it. This seems odd for something that is so minimalistic in appearance, and really hurts the enjoyment.\n\nHopefully they are planning to flesh out the game a bit more, because right now it just leave you feeling like its incomplete.\n\nit certainly not the worst game I've played on steam.

It's not. It's just a twin-stick shooter, and TB, god bless him, has no patience. You're a dot, you shoot other dots, and they drop dots that you collect. When you level up, you get to pick an upgrade. That's the most complicated thing about it; if you move around and fire a little bit after placing a statue in each spot, you'll get an idea of what the upgrades do. There are save points every now and then, they're the satellite dish looking things.\n\nIt took me like... two minutes to work all that out. It is an incredibly simple game, and requires only the very smallest desire to experiment. If they made a tutorial for this game, people would likely joke about how unnecessary it is. You'd take one look at the thing telling you to shoot the thing so you can get the thing and say \"oh yeah, haha, I've played this game like five hundred times.\"\n\nComparing it to other twin-sticks, it's fun, but not special. Pretty colors, simple gameplay. The one thing I'm disappointed about is the music. It's a huge letdown, especially considering \"interactive music\" was one of the features offered by the description. There aren't any good chiptunes here, it's just very weak bleepbloops all the way down. Bass Blocks was a terrible name for this game, because there isn't any.\n\nI don't regret buying it at all, and if you like simple twin-sticks, you should probably get it, too.

I've figured out some aspects of how it works and where it's going on, but I hope not all of them yet.\n\nThe statues you come across are save points, if you die, you respawn at them... There's a decay that spawns at where you start and works outward to slowly consume everything, if a save point is gobbled up, you won't spawn there anymore, so you constantly have to try and find a safe point further away from the decay.\n\nYou level by killing creatures and finding colored blocks and also finding statues... Everytime you level, you will be brough to the level room, where you can put the levels on a pedestal (I think), as you level, your shot becomes stronger, but the game also start to move faster, at some point it's recommended to turn the game speed to 'half' because it'll be going crazy fast otherwise.\n\nWhen you reach certain points and defeat certain bosses, you will get an extra safe point that you can travel to, meaning, you have progress in the game even in death.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442582777, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442582777, "recommendationid": "18083664", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485532", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442896071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 128, "steamid": "76561198052578975", "num_games_owned": 166}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[h1]A very unique and abstract RPG shooter with a great sense of adventure and discovery.[/h1]\n\nIt's a good game at it is but it also has amazing potential, I feel as if this game was released in early access it would have been received really well. And judging from the developers comments it seems that it will have many updates in the future to fix some underlying problems and possibly add things. The art is amazing as well as the atmosphere. I love how you have to discover the game for yourself unlike some other people who can't seem to understand some of the concepts, Altough I agree there should be an optional tutorial for some people that can't grasp the content. I do wish there was a better representation of the perks that you were getting. I don't like the perk you get around stage 2-3 where you can suddenly move like a supersonic jet, in thery it's helpful but almost impossible to control. Though this was easily helped by going into assists and turning the game speed to half. It felt much more responsive and fun when I played in that mode.\n\nThere are a number of balencing changes that need to be done to make this a better game and a fairer game at that. The difficulty ramps up so much at the 3rd level that it feels almost imposible but these things will be ironed out soon I hope and I will update my review if they do because this is so close to being an amazing game. \n\nI would for sure recomend this game just for the expeirence it provides, the enviroment and new things to explore are what make this game so fun. The developer seems devoted to this game and working on fixing all the problems.\n\nI'm going to reiterate this but if you are having problems with the games pacing turn the game speed down and that seemed to fix all the unfair deaths I was having and made it way more fun for me while still being a challenge.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442575912, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442575912, "recommendationid": "18082536", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507491", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442637847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 25, "steamid": "76561198082668103", "num_games_owned": 132}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Exactly what it says on the tin,title, same thing.
