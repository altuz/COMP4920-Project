My cousin and I got this abomination and all you ever do is walk around collecting seashells, reading books, explore a shitty world and that's it. It is MMO though, however NO ONE PLAYS IT and literally the only other player I saw was my cousin. You play as a floating orb. REALLY?! AN ORB? I can't take this game seriously, when you go \"swimming\", you can't even swim, you just walk on the ocean floor underwater, COLLECTING SEASHELLS. I HIGHLY recommend that you dont buy this game, not even for free, don't get it on your computer at all.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502057880, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502057880, "recommendationid": "34070011", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500592", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 106, "total_reviews": 191, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 85}}
