I first played through Adam's Venture Episodes 1, 2 and 3. They didn't cost much, so I appreciated the simple game, which still was funny, beautiful and family-friendly. Those episodes aren't available anymore, instead there is AV: Chronicles - a same game with a little bit remastering. There also Evelyn's hair color had changed from blondish to brown, and episodes had moved to chronoligally \"right\" order. \n\nSo this one is already a remastering's remastering, or is it a remake... at first the game was good as it was, but not SO good it should've been made three times within quite a short time. I regret I didn't check at first what the game was about, still the same adventure, and now I lost three times as much money as I paid for the first version. I also noticed that the first puzzle, where you have to make gunpowder, had been simplified, and I quit the game right away. \n\nBuy this to waste your money.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495886989, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495886989, "recommendationid": "31995294", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484884", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
