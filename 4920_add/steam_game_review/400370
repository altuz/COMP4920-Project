With this release I feel lied to. Sadly, the trailer that steam has playing IS the American version of the game with Corey's voice acting, however what you get when you purchase it is the very dull British version where all of the Norm guards have very thick cockney accents and the main characters voice is some random guy who sounds about as interesting as your history teacher that hates his job. I would request a refund but from what I understand Steam works kind of like Spiderman, you only get one. So this time around I will eat that whopping $4 I spent and be sad and save that refund for another day. I wont dog on them too much though, I LOVE steam to death, just wish they would have been a little more clear on which version they were selling.

Normal sound, normal gameplay, normal graphics, normal puzzles, normal retro feeling.\n\nNo seriously, even if you didn't play it back in 1996, if you like 3d first person perspective adventure games with graphics like duke nukem 3d, then you have have a big reason to buy this pearl. It is funny, crazy, challenging (a bit of the old unfair vibe is also there, but now we have the internet :-D), nice looking and it has plenty of cut scenes.\n\nThe Publisher KISS ldt listened to feedback and will try to bring the other language packs back, that seems to be the only complains from people that played it back than. Personally, I played the game in German so any english version is fresh for me and I can't complain so far.\n\nSome glitched are DosBox issues so far, but it's only a short reinitializing of the resolution which makes me wait 1 few seconds longer till I can get into the menue or an item, but I can life with that, after all, I spend time playing a 20 year old game, what are a few seconds for me :-D.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444414016, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444414016, "recommendationid": "18399157", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561538", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445196184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 418, "steamid": "76561198130001132", "num_games_owned": 22}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Most influential game of my life. \n\nThey really don't make them like they used to!
