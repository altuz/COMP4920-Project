I thought maybe people were kidding when they said finishing a season in this game would be impossible, now I see it. This is a game with a good idea gone horribly awful. The grind, the slowness. Yes you could get a match done faster if you use the AI, but trust me, you don't want to use the AI.\n\nThing is, there is already a fun turn based football game out there, it is called Football Tactics. Football Tactics is the game that is my comparison for this one, but there is no real way to compare them since Tactical \"Soccer\" is just awful. The game isn't very tactical, you just get close enough to aim for the lower left corner and money. Headers do nothing and you cannot receive a pass and move, not even a little, not even to turn your back to the defender who gets their turn right after you get the ball.\n\nCan I say anything good about this game? Ummm, it looks nice?
