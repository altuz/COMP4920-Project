This review represents both versions.\nFirst, the good:\n\n+Music.  The music is incredible, and is by far the highest point in the game.  Supremely good soundtrack.\n+Visuals.  Great, crunchy graphics and excellent representation in how the game conveys information on the playfield.\n\nThe not-so-good:\n\n-Collision.  It feels like everything is an obstacle in the game, and you can see your character getting hung up on areas that you're clearly not even touching.  When you have to deal with this, on top of a ton of enemies all aiming railguns at you, it makes the situation feel needlessly frustrating.\n-Menus.  The menus feel clunky and minimalistic, involving a lot of scrolling though inventory, and new items feeling like they're sometimes placed at random.  It's just unintuitive.  There's a lot of space available on the screen, and menu occupies so little of it, and cramps everything into a tiny, inconvenient area.\n-BIOS/Mutation/Skill/Whatever you want to call it when you start the game.  There's no reason to take anything other than self-healing.  Health packs are few and far between, you wind up taking excessive damage faster than you can realize in the later levels, and other, cool starting perks, like Blademaster, winds up being usless due to poor developer foresight.  To elaborate on that, that perk makes all weapon drops melee weapons.  There are explosive canisters on the floor in each level, and when they explode, they deal heavy damage to all things nearby, and with a melee only build, you can't safely destroy those.  So, if you're in a cramped corridor with a canister, and tons of enemies, you're likely dead, nothing else to it.  General shortsightedness in game balance makes the perk system almost inconsequential.\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea.  A difficulty curve that ramps up too high, too quick, questionable collision on every wall and prop in the game, tedious, unintuitive menuing, and poor weapon and ability balance make Neurovoider an awkward red-headed step-child in the already over-saturated rougelite genre.  Great presentation can't save this game from its own mechanical issues.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505682168, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505682460, "recommendationid": "35033129", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522624", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1492071813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 36, "steamid": "76561197966447198", "num_games_owned": 246}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Alas, I had higher hopes.
