The voice acting was terrible, the visuals were frustrating and there is less than an hour of gameplay. There weren't any scares that I could find either.

The content on offer from 'The Final Take' is respectable enough with regard to visuals and atmosphere. However, given that there is only four levels to the game, there is precious little on offer to really review. The two levels that are for exploration and exposition showcase the game's strengths best. Eerie pickups and sound effects echoing through the dark are what work best in a game of this nature because these aspects add depth and detail to the scenario, even if the protagonists largely fail to provoke emapathy with their flat and listlessly acted dialogue. \n\n[h1]The Levels[/h1]\nThe other two levels play out like a sort of scavenger hunt while you also essentially have to play tag with the malevolent apparition that passes for the game's antagonist. The biggest criticism of 'The Final Take' becomes apparent during these sequences because the control system can sometimes be a little fiddly. You automatically unequip your light source when you run, which is a bit awkward at times, as can the issue of having to collect items in a specific way when the ghost is never any more than a couple of steps behind you. However, but if you can master it then it's tolerable. \n\nAll in All [u]The Final Take[/u] is a good Horror Game! \n\n7/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep[/i]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503138057, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503138057, "recommendationid": "34347258", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502186", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 43, "total_reviews": 81, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 38}}
