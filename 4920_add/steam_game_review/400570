For example, the Defender's ability, which teleports him back to his goal line actually puts him in a position where he will score on himself even if he makes the stop. Since the goal can be scored going in either direction, that is particularly frustrating. Some abilities, like the Defender's, are just crap and won't be used at all until they are overhauled.\n\nThe game is visually shoddy, the figures do not bend or move organically in any way, they make sharp turns like characters in an NBA or soccer game for the original PlayStation. They are also entirely faceless, which is better than being in the uncanny valley and lends intself to the sci-fi feel. Underdesigned interface features such as font, color choice and information \"blocks\" rather than gauges like Rocket League's boost meter or a racing game's speedometer also reinforce the cheap feel of the gameplay experience.\n\nThat being said, the game is cheap at just nine dollars. If you really think it's a cool idea and have someone to play with then go for it. Don't expect a polished game and don't expect there to be anyone at all in the game lobby.\n\nTL;DR: Reccomended if it seems appealing but early access-ness is strong with this one.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497400906, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1497400906, "recommendationid": "32400885", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545405", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
