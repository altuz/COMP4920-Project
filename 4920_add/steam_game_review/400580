I really enjoyed it.\n\nPros:\n- Addictive gameplay (solving mysteries simulation)\n- Encourages critical thinking\n- Beautiful, gorgeous CG art\n- Two sets of art styles (note: you don't actually have to play each path twice; you can just use the mouse scroll to go back, change the art style, and get both sets of a character's CGs in one playthrough)\n- Excellent writing\n- Great character development\n- Yuri romances (it takes place in an all-girls school)\n- People of color representation, such as the protagonist being black, Vonne being (partially Japanese?) Asian, and Rowan being partially Native American\n- Various difficulty settings, so those who like more of a challenge and those who like casual gaming both could enjoy the gameplay\n\nCons:\n- Blocky, unappealing standard character art for the first art type; the second art style's standard character art is nice though\n- A couple of mystery cases were really difficult to figure out, no matter how many times I had a chance to solve them (maybe I'm just too dumb though? :P )\n- Fighting the \"boss\" (the game's true villain) can be a bit tedious, especially in later playthroughs; I feel like her having 100 in all stats is a bit much\n\nI definitely recommend this game for those who enjoy sim games, VNs, and yuri romances!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500410432, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500410432, "recommendationid": "33637790", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533915", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503412226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 103, "steamid": "76561198099290840", "num_games_owned": 114}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "HARD!

Its only real weakness is the element of random chance in its design; every so often there will come a playthrough that just blitzes you with cases too hard for you to survive, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's not that big a deal, but it can be frustrating. Both sets of art are okay, with the best images being reserved for [spoiler]Vonne losing her god-damned mind,[/spoiler] which never fail to crack me up.
