The overall design of the game is just super cute, I really enjoy the art style as it's a really pleasant view. The gameplay is great, it's sure to keep you hooked for a couple hours, if not more. The gameplay is silly and also challenging. You fight multiple monsters, you make multiple friends, and a plus, the game is very fun to mess around with as theres a lot to do on this game. For example you can travel to SplenkWorld (which is an included theme park in the game. The park itself doesn't serve a purpose other then to have fun and go on rides, buy stuff, and play games. It's good to go to whenever you need to chill for a bit). Another plus, a lot of characters in the game are just great. I can spend hours upon hours just talking to anyone I can talk to, and just for fun. Overall, Wuppo is a super fun and unique game that provides a pretty wonderful experience to players.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505624221, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505624221, "recommendationid": "35014365", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506267", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505801910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2409, "steamid": "76561197983190771", "num_games_owned": 110}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "review": "One of the best story driven adventure games in recent memories. Full of surprises from almost every corner with interesting gameplay mechanics. \n\nThis is a game that can keep saying 'yes' to me when I want to try different things inside their world.\n\n\n**I puchased 110 games on steam over 10 years and this is the first game that make me feel like I should leave a review to support this developer!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505656037, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505656558, "recommendationid": "35023905", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504172", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504998161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 445, "steamid": "76561198102790977", "num_games_owned": 28}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Wuppo is an awesome, Nintendoish, Metroidvania game, that has a lot of cool characters with funny dialogue, and an interesting story, with a deep history and lore. The gameplay is fun with combat that is just interesting enough and puzzles that are fun to figure out as well as quircky situations that Wuppo has to offer! You never know what this game will come up with next. One day you will be racing with a giant snail, the next day you will be scuba diving, and then playing volleyball with mud the next!\n\nWuppo is an awesome game that is reminiscent of games from SNES era, with a nice art design and music that is catchy and fun to listen too. I hope that this game gets the recognition it deserves and possibly a sequel or a similar game made by the same developers!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504995551, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504995551, "recommendationid": "34848001", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495383", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506265482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 92, "steamid": "76561198128332830", "num_games_owned": 130}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is so cute,i like it.but first \"jump pack\" i think is harding.i cant go to next place.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505837467, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506174188, "recommendationid": "35067494", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500285", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 183, "total_reviews": 187, "num_reviews": 4, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
