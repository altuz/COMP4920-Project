No.\nDoes it have depth as deep as the ocean? No. \nAre the graphics amazing? No.\nIs the story something to take to the mountains and declare it legacy to the world? No.\n\nBut does it do what it does well? Yes.\nIs the story fun, even if a little simple? Yes.\nIs it easy to pick up and learn right away? Yes.\nAre the characters, even if simple, pleasent? Yes.\nOverall is the game enjoyable? YES.\n\nAnd that's best part of the game, despite being short and being a rather shallow stratgy game. It's still fun to play, even if a bit repetative. It does what it does well, and never make itself out to be more than what it is. Plus, it's a relatively cheap game that you can throw a couple dollars at and play off and on while haveing a laugh here and there. I haven't regretted a single minute i spent in this game and I look at it with a smile when its in my libray. Is it my favorite game? No. But I don't care because I have my fun with its gameplay and story, and thats all I expected from this game. Hell, I feel bad for buying this on sale because for the regular price its a pretty good buy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500863456, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500863456, "recommendationid": "33757366", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509367", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 176, "total_reviews": 192, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 16}}
