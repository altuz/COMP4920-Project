Those people are fools.\n\nFor one, despite some ecchi-ish CG art, nothing's flat out NC-18 (No nudity, certainly no lewd acts), this ends up being one of the most solid Metroidvania titles in a long time. Why? It embraces the non-linearity that makes a good Metroidvania. This is a Metroidvania where you can literally go \"Y'know what? I don't WANT my primary weapon. I'm gonna run the game without it.\" And you can challenge the game with just Ribbon (Your 'gun' of sorts). Sequence breaking isn't actively blocked, in fact it's outright encouraged. \n\nOn top of this you have a fun bullet-hell esque form of boss fighting that keeps things quite intense, but due to the upgrade nature of the game, you can always snag more health and attack power to get the advantage in a tougher boss fight whose patterns you haven't quite nailed yet.\n\nThis is a Metroidvania that gets so much right where other games in the genre get it wrong. Virtually the entire world map is accessible to you from the getgo if you know how to bypass certain obstacles with Erina's hidden techs.

It's aware enough of this to lampshade Ribbon's skimpy outfit at times. Don't be turned off by the Steam store page description about a bunny-girl costume, because I would not have sunk 200 hours into this game if I just wanted to look at ecchi. You'll see some humorous dialogue teasing at yuri themes as well, but overall, the story of the game is an actual story about Erina, Rabi-Rabi Island, and some of its inhabitants, though it doesn't truly begin to unfold until halfway through the game. The initial premise is that Erina, formerly a pet rabbit of Rumi but turned human by unknown means, is tasked with trying to track down Rumi's sister Miru, who has been magicked away by a stone tablet, and Erina needs the help of other magic-users on the island to power this tablet and follow Miru. But there's a much more interesting story that you'll uncover about the island's origins and a figure from its past as you progress--though it remains bunny-themed to the end.\n\nProgression in Rabi-Ribi is similar to other Metroidvania games in that you start with just a basic jumping ability and go on to acquire myriad upgrades to your attacks, mobility, and statistics hidden throughout the world. In the prologue, you are railroaded towards the town at the island's center, but afterwards you are free to explore almost the entirety of the fairly large overworld, with just a few areas locked behind certain events. Two big twists that delighted me as I played this game: one, every single item, even Erina's primary attack, is optional, if you look hard enough for alternate routes and can wrap your head around the island's layout; two, while the game explicitly guides you (with waypoints and objectives, even) towards a smoothly curved difficulty progression that will help you pick up important items early, you are free to utterly ignore this and go virtually anywhere in any order. One achievement, for example, requires you to traverse the entire world \"backwards\" from the start to avoid meeting a boss just outside of town for most of the game.\n\nIn addition to simple stat ups and new movement and attack abilities, you will find badges tied to the game's nicely tuned badge system, allowing you to equip a limited point value of badges you've found to tweak your stats, gain immunity to various statuses, earn more currency, and the like. It's a fun system that allows you to heavily prioritize offense or defense, as several badges trade one for the other.\n\nThe major attraction in Rabi-Ribi is the boss fights, however. After a few easy bosses in the opening sequence, the game quickly ramps up to a brutal difficulty; outside of the lowest difficulties (which are fairly easy as long as you pick up a few items), this is a game where you will not beat many, if any, bosses on the first attempt. Most fights are fairly short, about five minutes in length, but some late-game bosses can exceed ten or fifteen minutes. If you love the feeling of gradual improvement, learning how to deal with various patterns, progressing farther each time only to be faced with an even more brutal attack, then this game will be a great fit for you. If this is a turn-off, and you're only looking to coast through, it's still a decent game, but you won't get the same sort of value. Those who want to challenge themselves get the option of six difficulties, each of which scales up in difficulty nigh-endlessly with repeated loops of New Game+ (though the actual dodging mechanic starts to fall apart around four or five loops and it just turns into a battle of overpowered offenses). Challenge aside, each boss has their own unique theme (with the exception of two pairs of siblings who have variants of the other's attacks), and it's wonderfully illustrated in their attack patterns. Cocoa, the penniless inventor, fights using an assortment of automated bombs; Pandora, the ancient princess(?) waiting inside a tricky pyramid, can slow your movement and fights with several puzzle- and trap-like attacks; Ashuri feels like a classical Ordinary Magician and takes to her broomstick for several fly-by attacks.\n\nOn top of the story mode, Rabi-Ribi offers a speedrun mode which skips the intro segment and all cutscenes automatically and has a frame-accurate timer plus leaderboards for all difficulties, any%, 0%, and 100%, plus an absolutely brutal Boss Rush mode that places you against absurd odds (the \"True Boss Rush\" mode will easily take over 90 minutes to finish, for perspective).\n\nTechnically, the game is known to have some issues; the game speed is tied to the FPS count, which must be exactly 60 for proper behavior. You may especially have issues getting the game to work on a 144 Hz monitor, though various launcher options are provided that attempt (but may not succeed) at addressing this. I did not personally have any trouble with this, though as of the current patch, the game has a tendency to crash when alt-tabbing out while OBS is recording.\n\nRabi-Ribi was easily my favorite game of 2016, and continues to occupy me periodically nearing the end of 2017. There is simply so much to do here, especially if you follow the achievement list for ideas for your next challenge, that you are pretty much certain to get insane value from the purchase if the genre is at all to your liking. Please, don't pass on this hidden gem just because the outfits or bunny-girl theme turn you off.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505635318, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505762519, "recommendationid": "35017189", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515537", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507160069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3514, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13485, "steamid": "76561198045433415", "num_games_owned": 234}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "3", "review": "[h1]Pros  [/h1]\nDo you like rabbits? Fairies? Characters with animal ears? Cutesy art style? Lighthearted and a little bit silly story on the outside with darker themes on the inside? A variety of different personalities? \n\nIf that didn't spark your interest then perhaps you are more interested in things like a great soundtrack, platforming and map exploration or bullet hell style boss battles? Those things I just listed are only a few reasons why I like this game. \n\n[h1]Cons [/h1]\nThere is this one boss battle that makes the game run super slow in an environment where the main character is already slowed down on purpose. The problem is probably on my end though because I haven't really seen other players complaining about this. \n\nAside from that I can't really think of anything else negative about the game. \n\n[h1]Story summary [/h1]\nYou play as Erina, a bunny who got transformed into a human for unknown reason while keeping her bunny like features such as bunny ears. Soon you meet Ribbon, a small fairy who acts as your companion and ranged attack. Your main goal is to find Miru, Rumi's sister, who has gone missing. To do this you must find magic users to power up a stone monument called Stele. To recruit helpers you must first persuade them in a form of a battle and trust me, they all find various excuses to have battles with you. \n\n[h1]Difficulty  [/h1]\nThere are plenty of different bosses each with their unique attack patterns and some are encountered more than once. The game offers plenty of challenge for both beginners and experts by having difficulty several difficulty settings from casual to novice, normal, hard, hell and bunny extinction (aka BEX) (+ more in Artbook DLC). At first hard and below difficulties are unlocked but hell and BEX must be unlocked by playing the game. \n\nI personally think normal is a good difficulty to start with. I wasn't sure if I was ready for it because I don't consider myself being good at bullet hell kind of games and I had heard this game was partly like that but I gave it a try anyway. In return I got plenty of challenge and I felt like I had really improved while playing the game which eventually led me trying it on harder difficulty. If you feel like you've chosen the wrong difficulty to start with then there is an NPC early in the game who can change the difficulty of your game. \n\nSomething to keep on mind is that bosses' levels scale with your progress so the more you do in the game the higher level they get. They also know what items you already have and use attacks that are possible for you to dodge. A good example of this is that in the beginning Erina can't jump very high so the bosses with attacks that you must jump over can't be higher than your maximum jump height. \n\n[h1]Replay value [/h1]\nI started the game on normal and have played it through on that difficulty including the main game, post game, special bosses after the post game and all the current DLC content (halloween and 'Is the order a DLC?'). On hard difficulty I've cleared both the main game and post game. Now you might ask does the game have other replay value than just harder difficulties. In my opinion yes, it has. \n\nFirst of all it offers NG+ option that you can access within the game after you've cleared the post game. Secondly it unlocks speedrun mode once you clear the post game for the first time. In speedrun mode it cuts cutscenes and story stuff, it also shows you spent time, map exploration % and collected items % making it useful if you want to do a 0% items playthrough. There are also plenty of Steam achievements that requires you to play the game several times and in different ways. \n\nClearing the post game also unlocks boss rush if you are into that kind of thing. It uses Erina & Ribbon from the save file you choose to give you the items and consumables you've collected. \n\n[h1]Replay value - Achievements  [/h1]\nThis game is non-linear in the sense that you can do bosses in which order you want and some achievements requires you to defeat some of them before others. This might sound easy and simple but it is actually quite challenging when you have to figure out how to skip some bosses and making you to take a long way around. It might sound tedious and boring, and I can agree to some extend, but it does teach you a great deal about how different parts in the map are connected. It can also give you \"I never would have thought about that!\" kind of experiences when you realize things that you completely overlooked on your first playthrough. \n\n[h1]Replay value - 0% items  [/h1]\nI mentioned 0% items playthrough a moment ago. Yes, while there are many items in the game and finding them is part of the fun, none of them are actually required to beat the game. On my 0% items playthrough I've cleared both the main game and the post game and even on casual difficulty it gave me plenty of challenge. It's definitely not something you should try as your first playthrough but it's good to keep it on mind something like that exists. \n\n[h1]DLC  [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Soundtrack \n    [*]Artbook \n    [*]Cicini's Halloween!\n    [*]Is the order a DLC?\n[/list]\n\n[h1]DLC - Soundtrack [/h1]\nI don't have any real complaints about the soundtrack. The game has great music and there are several songs I like. One of my favorites from the soundtrack is 'The Truth Never Spoken'. Overall many of the map area related songs and boss battle themes are very good and fit well for when they are used. \n\n[h1]DLC - Artbook [/h1]\nThe interesting thing about this DLC is that it actually contains some playable content and not just the artbook itself. I haven't fully explored all of it yet but some of it includes a few short (but challenging) mission type of battles, 'Impossible' difficulty and, if I recall correctly, boss rushes as another characters other than the one from the main game. Those were just a few that I could think of right now. \n\n[h1]DLC - Cicini's Halloween! [/h1]\nA free DLC which includes a new area to explore and a fun boss battle with two bosses at once. You can even choose to have it as mildly intense or incredibly intense. You also earn a costume as a reward for defeating the halloween boss. \n\n[h1]DLC - Is the order a DLC? [/h1]\nGives two new chapters with new areas to explore and boss battles to fight and extends story (and backstory) from the game. It has a heavy emphasis on difficult platforming but boss battles are quite enjoyable too. In short it has exactly what makes Rabi-Ribi such a great game. If you already like Rabi-Ribi after playing through the main game and the post game then I can recommend this, otherwise it's not something you absolutely must play unless you are a completionist. \n\n[h1]Other things I'd like to point out [/h1] \nSome players might wonder if the game has a lot of fanservice. I'd say it has and it doesn't have. It depends on where you put the line. If you check the screenshots on the store page you should see Ribbon, a small fairy, who doesn't wear much clothing. If small fairies wearing little clothing doesn't bother you then you are probably fine with the rest. There is also one CG that I've seen raising questions but in my opinion it is more about the POV you want to see it as rather than the content of the CG itself. \n\nAside from clothing and a CG there is some dialogue, either direct or something you can read between lines, that can be slightly suggestive but whenever it takes more direct approact there is a black screen leaving everything to your imagination. Considering how you can skip cutscenes and story sections with a button and the real selling point of the game is actually solid good platforming with bullet hell bosses rather than fanservice in any form, I'd say anyone who wants to play this game purely for the gameplay but is concerned about fanservice should still give it a try. \n\n[h1]TLDR [/h1]\nIn my opinion it's a great game with good DLC and worth the price.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506314518, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506872137, "recommendationid": "35196361", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508685", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507132737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2492, "steamid": "76561198393007209", "num_games_owned": 35}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I recommend. though. some areas are just frustrating for me  - like those laser things underwater that almost deal 1hit to me (I'm on hard mode) and some of the areas design is just... ugh. overall ; great game :D must buy", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505372091, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505372130, "recommendationid": "34943572", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506259", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504714345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2014, "steamid": "76561198206075424", "num_games_owned": 36}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Extremely cute and fun game.
