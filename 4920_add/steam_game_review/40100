When I bought this game, it was because I own Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. That game was fun, involving strategy. This game? This looks like Square Enix decided we were all too fucking dumb to understand how video games work, so they dumbed it WAYYYYYYYYYY the fuck down. This game was NOT worth the money I put into it, or the .2hrs I put into it. Will be requesting a refund.
