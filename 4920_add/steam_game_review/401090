Whole features that don't work such as\nmirroring a set of bones over. or in the case that you did get symmetry to work it only works during creation. When you have to change the bones later symmetry no longer works.\n\nBascially Bone creation becomes a very 'Eye-balled' process where you can't even guarantee that the bones are symmetrical.\n\nWhen you start weighting all this, Half the menu's that are in the documentation dont even match what you are seeing. You are left trying to figure out why you can't see a menu, or get access to something that is supposed to be there.\nIt becomes a very 'Eye-balled' process once again.\n\nFor a payed program there seems to be less documentation than that of Blender.\n\nI can't realistically see using this to create any game for production. Too many core features that were 'Put' into the app as 'Working' and effectively don't work at all.\n\nIf your on a tight budget, just start learning Blender since its free. \nIf money is not an issue, 3ds Max would be my recommendation.\nIf you're somewhere in between Maya LT is a very good option for indies.\n\nI believe all those options are far better than Modo indie 901.\n\nI've already sunk money into the original Modo indie and the expansion 901.

More often than not, this is a far cry from the truth, with users simply being picky and spoiled. This is not the case with MODO Indie 10.\n\nOh my god, the bugs. From \"You have no undos left\", despite my prefs being set to 100 undos, and not having used a single one of them, to broken symmetry, double polys, and the like. It is broken on PC. It is broken on OSX. More time is spent correcting the program than actually modelling in it.\n\nIt crashes, it hangs, it freezes. It UNINSTALLS ITSELF. \"Save early, save often\" is not enough here. You're left having to choose to save after every move, knowing full well that if you save, there is a very real chance that it may just crash and corrupt the file during the process.\n\n\"Contact support!\" I hear you say! As other users have pointed out, MODO does not see Steam users as actual customers. You'll get a generic email back telling you to check the forums. If you find anything in the forums related to your problem, more often than not, it's just other users saying \"Same problem here, please fix.\"\n\nAs a student at KCAD, our entire class is required to use this program, as the local Underbite Games insists that it is the industry standard. Again, this is absolutely not the case. If you're a student, get Maya for free. If you're anybody else, get Blender for free. There are so many superior options to this broken, rudimentary program.\n\nUPDATE: After saving after every major move, the program glitched out, undo stopped working, so I tried reloading to my last major change. I loaded it to find out that the program had not, in fact, actually saved since my initial project save. Hours of work, lost.

I have been using the other version - the plain MODO indie on Windows 8, and it NEVER crashes - I don't even know what a MODO crash looks like. So hold your horses and don't panic - the choppa is on the way.\n\nThis is the most amazing modeling software I have ever seen - even for a newbie / anti-talent like me - normally, I can barely draw a circle (I'm a games programmer). After a few hours, seeing some very good tutorials available on the official and third party sites, I am confident I can do anything - from models and mechanical structures to environments. \n\nMy first day in MODO - my first 2 hours actually - following a tutorial I messed something up, and I had to redo everything all over again, and I was able to retrace my steps in a few minutes !!! It goes so fast that it never crosses your mind to give up, because everything you do is a huge waste of time, and the results are riddled with errors and asymmetries anyway \u2013 useless for any decent commercial project. How many times did you get that feeling, trying to use a new software, and seeing the modest results of your best efforts? \n\nHow many times have you seen presentations about how great and easy to use a program is, only to hit a brick wall after you got it, and realize that you will have to pour weeks and months of hard work into it before you get some half decent result that, as a first attempt, will have to be remade anyway from scratch, while you are wondering if you have what it takes - a perfect memory, some rare talent that only some goblins have, and an impossibly steady hand that allows you to move and place everything with the accuracy of an industrial robot? \n\nWell, MODO is nothing like that - the interface is simple, intuitive, everything is automated, processed directly with numeric values, and with a few simple commands you can create things that are incredibly detailed. So far I have been building the inner workings of a car \u2013 steering, transmission, suspension, things that are rather industrial-design oriented \u2013 isn't details and devices that appear to work what everybody wants? Now that I think of it, some degree of realism must exist - many components really need to work since game engines are physics simulations, and if you just attach 4 wheels to a tin barrel, instead of a car you will end up with a shopping cart moving really fast \u2013 good luck trying to stay on the road and steer it properly. \n\nMODO proved to be everything I hoped it would be. The Foundry has all the best movies you have seen in recent years in their portfolio, and if their software is not enough for you to succeed, then nothing is.

You also have the ability to texture, UV unwrap (which I found quite easy to do compared to other programs I've used, by the way), render, animate, and even paint on the mesh directly.\n\nYou also have the option of remapping the keys in order to make using the program a customizable experience, and even has a number of preset options which mimic other programs; an option for 3DS Max was a godsend for me, but there's also options for MAYA, Cinema 4D, and more, which makes learning the program quite a bit less intimidating.\n\nThere are a few shortcomings and limitations for MODO Indie, however. The biggest ones are that it uses its own file type (called .lxf) for saved meshes, so it's impossible to open meshes made with MODO Indie in other programs without exporting it to another file type. This is where its second biggest limitation lies: meshes with more than 100,000 polygons cannot be exported at all. It may sound like a large number, but trust me, it really isn't. This is fine if you're working on a video game by yourself (since real-time applications only use low-poly meshes anyway), but these two limitations make it very difficult to share work between team members. Additionally, scripting is not supported in MODO Indie, although I've yet to encounter a situation where this proves to be a major setback. Thankfully, those are the only major limitations, so go nuts with the animating, texture mapping and UV-ing!\n\nThere is one issue I encountered with the paint tool, though, and it's that the texture I'd painted on became darker and darker each time I reloaded it. This is easily solvable by simply using a separate program for painting on textures, though, and MODO is primarily a tool for modeling, anyway.\n\nThose limitations aside, MODO Indie is a very powerful modeling program, and is very reasonably priced for what it is.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466806874, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1470690906, "recommendationid": "23771395", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509360", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507150891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2074, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 23662, "steamid": "76561198055768672", "num_games_owned": 233}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Awesome piece of software! \n\nOver the years I went through a couple of different 3D modelers like 3Ds Max, Maya or Blender.

While it's nearly identical to the full version, there are a few things that may impact your decision, mainly the Python scripting is disabled (meaning a lot of external plugins that rely on scripts aren't going to work), and there's a 100k polygon limit on any FBX/OBJ file you export.  Personally, I haven't had any major issue with any of the restrictions.  The 100k polygon limit just means I bake my normals in MODO and export the low-poly version, which is what you probably want if you're doing game development anyway, and the missing scripting isn't as big of an issue as it used to be since the newer versions of MODO include a lot of the functionality that external scripts added.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461636915, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1461636915, "recommendationid": "22639768", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502212", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505800770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 40412, "steamid": "76561198111197594", "num_games_owned": 87}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Incredible Software.

The Foundry has wisely placed the most common tools in easily accessable hotkeys and menus for quick access, and the tools are amazingly functional.  \n\nBefore I updated this review, I had some compaints about there being some problems with baked texture compatability with other software. This has been fixed in Modo 10, with the introduction of the Game Tools. We now have a what-you-see-is-what-you-get workflow with multiple shaders available, ease of exporting, ease of vertex normal editing and improved baking tools. \n\nThere still are times I wish I could simply export the high poly model out and bake the normal and ambient occulsion in the Substance Suite, but baking those two in Modo is fun and easy enough now, so I can easily live with it.  \n\nEnjoy Modoing!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459324250, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1462420445, "recommendationid": "22137743", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503292", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504806643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1890, "steamid": "76561198012043263", "num_games_owned": 597}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Fast and I mean FAST modelling.
