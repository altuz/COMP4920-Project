It was a great price so I tossed it in my cart.  I am really glad I did.  It looks similar to Tetris-- but it isn't a clone.  There is more to it than falling shapes.  You link up the colors, then explode the group with an electric spark before the stack reaches the top.  Anode is well made with colorful graphics and different objectives within the game.  It is a fun casual game and a steal at full price...even better on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499189012, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499189012, "recommendationid": "33239842", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502982", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498919477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 294, "steamid": "76561198051357516", "num_games_owned": 1647}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "lovely game i enjoy playing it with my family \nand thx for linux support :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498319944, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498319944, "recommendationid": "32732560", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 17, "total_reviews": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
