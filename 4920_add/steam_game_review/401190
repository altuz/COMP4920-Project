All you do is run backwards while shooting at the dinosaurs until they die. If you shoot them in the head it will speed up the process to get achievements. The only thing good about this game is that there is a decent amount of weapons. I would never suggest this to anyone who actually wants to play a real game, but I would recommend this to achievement hunters. It has alot of achievements and can be finished in under an hour. Recommend on sale to achievement hunters only!\n\n[b] This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: [/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nOnce we have a 100 followers on our group there will be a game giveaway, but only the followers have a chance to win. \n\nIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.
