I love the whole Zulu vs British history era and was looking forward to this games release. firstly what it is with devs nowadays releasing a so called game which no where near finished and so bad its not funny. Graphics very poor gameplay very poor not even any great depth to it if i were a dev i would be ashamed to release this what the hells wrong with u ppl. just another poor excuse for a game and charging ppl for the pleasure or not in this case probably another money making scheme like so many of these devs r doing now knowing full well ppl will pay to see what its like. shocking if this is your best attempt at a game please do us all a favor and get another job cos u suck at this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499616559, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499616559, "recommendationid": "33408041", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493675", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "total_reviews": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 15}}
