The devs did an amazing job. The locale really shines and gives a sense of a coherency. There are somewhat frequent translation errors, and the game requires an independent mind. For all the cute, relaxing atmosphere, I can confidently say Dark Souls is a good analogue in terms of how much the player is expected to figure out. The difficulty is, on normal settings, fairly forgiving. There is a permadeath hardcore mode, and a no-pressure story mode.\n\nThis game features....\n-A solid and well-developed exploration feature, with a convincingly designed artificial environment and map\n-A story\n-19 possible recruit-able characters. In addition to the player character, there are three open party slots.\n-4 weapon categories the player can switch out and train to master\n-A polished version of the standard RPG-maker battle system with improved art, non-static party member portraits, and dynamic weather and backgrounds. The character also holds the weapon you've equipped. (something far too few non 3D RPGs take the time to do)\n-Lore you can read if you so desire(but it's not required in the slightest)\n-Pixel art\n-time management with a two-year deadline\n-rescources to gather, and things to craft\n-affordable cost\n\nI will try to update this review as I get further into the game.\n\nShameless self-promoion(character recruitment guide): http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1081436257", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500584791, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500601762, "recommendationid": "33681484", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488242", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "total_reviews": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
