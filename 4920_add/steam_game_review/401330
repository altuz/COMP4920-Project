Imagine if you had to wait 10 seconds each time you died in those games . Granted this game is not really a platformer but it is formatted around trying to beat the same section over and over .\n\n[b] Gameplay/Tedious Respawn Design [/b]\n\nAkuatica is a mixture of puzzle solving and reflex battles. Regardless of how smart you are, it won't prevents you from constantly dying. There is a 4-second loop after you die followed by another 5-second cutscene. Checkpoints are not always in optimal spots so let us just say it takes 15 seconds to respawn in-game where you will die over 300 times.This game would probably be okayish but the wait time between deaths and checkpoint locations just kill the game completely. If you Developer is reading this review , just remove wait time between deaths and maybe you can salvage this game.\n\nTo be fair controls are not awful but you will get caught off guard with some of the interactable mechanics. Hitboxes on some of the obstacles are not very friendly and you will likely progress by trial and error. I think Akuatica makes a wrong impression by making you believe that this is a brain game. In fact, it is actually a rather difficult reflex game that happens to have puzzles while you dodging a load of crap on the screen.\n\n[b] Puzzles are not always logical or rewarding [/b]\n\n\"Challenges that cannot be overcome with sheer force alone. I must use my wits .\"  taken from the Trailer.\n\n2 Minutes into the game you are using water bubbles to fight a boat. It was not hard to figure out this puzzle since there was nothing else on the screen. I just refused to try that solution for about 20 minutes because there was no logic behind it. Some of the puzzles would be interesting if you were not waiting 10 seconds between deaths. Most of the sections still require moving timings so solution to the puzzle by itself does not get you through.\n\nThe only upside here is that game seems to be pretty long . I am not very far into the game but the enjoyment value ranges from decent to god awful. I guess the unfair frustration raises a challenge for the player which is not a compliment but perhaps worth mentioning. Some of us play the terrible games for the difficulty believe it or not.\n\n[b] Graphics and Aesthetics [/b]\n\nThe game is presented well but not enough to forgive gameplay problems. Music and level design are acceptable but not remarkable. Some places are more interesting than other. \n\n[b] Verdict: 4/10 (would be 6/10 if death downtime was removed)[/b]  The time it takes to respawn and try again is counter productive to the format of this game. Easy fix Developers!  Even if you know the solutions to the puzzles you still have to get though many instadeath areas where good reflexes are not substituted for luck. As a result, the hard difficulty of this game is not balanced by rewarding gameplay.
