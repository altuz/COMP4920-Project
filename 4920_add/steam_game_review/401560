I will say NO, because the other review is similar, but recommends this.  This way, the over-all reviews balance out.\n\n[strike]It feels VERY alpha, much like a senior project in computer programming.[/strike] [i]UPDATE: Some mix-up had me download a development build (linux version), it has since been updated and is much more polished than the first download.[/i]  I love the broadside action, but that's about it.  The rest is mindless wandering around, shooting stuff.  I was only able to get the grappling done once, and did a boarding - [strike]I thought it was a joke at first, my guy was dancing / fighting with no one around, as I moved.[/strike] Boarding combat is much better, but still on the \"cheesy\" side.  Then the opposing \"crew\" came at me (like 4 on 1 or something).  Killed the crew, finished off the captain in a most unremarkable way and got the larger treasure galleon!  (which meant my ship sinks?)\n\nAnyway, it is not something I would put serious money towards, but for $3.74 I did not feel too cheated.  $1.99 or $0.99 would be more realistic, [strike]and have EARLY ACCESS or ALPHA plastered all over, so people are warned![/strike]  The game does feel more finished, albeit lacking depth (again, for under $5, what do we expect?)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442635202, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442672235, "recommendationid": "18093551", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523425", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1443573558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 139, "steamid": "76561197972128233", "num_games_owned": 286}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 25, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Meh\n\n  I bought this game expecting something similar to Pirates!  and instead got a watered down arcade game.  The controls are clunky, the graphics are ugly, and the objective is simply to sail around and blow shit up for no ryhme or reason.  There are no ports that you can land at, you have no crew, and you will be overwhelmed eventually.\n\n  Overall if the pricepoint were any higher I would say stay far away from this game, but at 3-5 dollars you get your moneys worth if you play 2 games.  Its entertaining enough to justify that, just dont expect a masterpiece... Or even a particularly good piece... This is the gaming equivalent of the cheap minibooks that are in line at a bookstore.
