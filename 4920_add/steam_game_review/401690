Even when the future of the bunker and their race is at stake, they will happily slack off while suffocating because the generator is dead. Farmers outright refuse to actually farm, leading to food shortages and starvation, and god help you if your people suffer from disease because the medic just despises work.\n\nCould it have been a good game? Hell yeah, though a bit lacking, it's got a solid foundation, however the stupidity and slacker nature of the residents means they're a bigger threat than anything else.\n\nUntil that issue is fixed, I cannot reccommend this game, and I'm genuinely sorry for that. The residents are just too frustrating.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506650577, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506650577, "recommendationid": "35279395", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505365999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 211, "steamid": "76561197972898689", "num_games_owned": 167}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game could be fun if it wasn't for the raw stupidity of the 'fellow bunker residents'.\n\nAs soon as the first few stones have been cleared in making way for a new area, its like a call goes up. Startled, the random residents look up from what ever they have been doing (eating dirt, licking the walls, or playing with faeces) and make a stampede to get to any new area they can. \nWhen the dust settles, and the new walls are in place - you will usually find the majority of residents in pockets of air BEHIND the walls where they stare blankly at the wall and start to cry. If freed, they will even see someone building the last section of wall and make a beeline to be on the other side again.\n\nI also had a resident who broke a toe on a treadmill... at the start of the game when I don't have any treadmills.\n\nI would like to be able to play this game, but at the moment its causing rage-quit.
