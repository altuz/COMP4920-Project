Flinthook as a whole has a tendency to waste time due partly to overly long animations inbetween levels, which might be charming for the first hour or so, but quickly become annoying to sit through.\nYou can equip cards that you obtain after each run, but these don't really spice up the gameplay, they mostly just make numbers go up (More experience, More HP, more item drops etc...) and boost your abilities slightly (shoot/hook further and faster). After 8 hours of gameplay, i feel like i've seen everything the game has to offer.\n\nArtistically the game is very pleasant: the sprites are all very colourful and well animated, but they tend to clog up the screen, making it difficult to spot traps. The music is serviceable, it's very upbeat and energetic and fits the gameplay well, but it's not something i'd listen to outside of the game.\n\nI give Flinthook a recommendation despite my mostly negative feedback because the core gameplay is very fun, it feels good to hook all over the place and land impossible shots on your enemies. But as a rogue lite, Flinthook runs out of steam extremely quickly.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505334801, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505334801, "recommendationid": "34926774", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508653", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506801639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 179, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 179, "steamid": "76561198069287495", "num_games_owned": 83}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Its frusturating. There is certainly a level of polish and fun and stuff to the game, but it feels not so much hard as annoying.\n\nSo many traps and enemies just trip you up and mess you up, because whilst the hook mechanic is very fun, the game almost punishes you for using it because of how specific it is.\nThe timestop mechanic is nearly useless because of how short it is.\n\n\n\nSo lots of good mechanics just implimented in a way that makes you yell \"THATS BS!\"", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506735370, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506735370, "recommendationid": "35318674", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504608526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 349, "steamid": "76561198061750921", "num_games_owned": 380}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "MacOS user, so it's possible my problem here is Mac only. \n\nThe game keeps crashing. i can't play more than an hour, sometime 5 minutes, without having the game quittin all the sudden. \n\nNo update since forever, no help on the discussion boards. \n\nSorry, i'm moving on to something else. It's a difficult game, and i could maybe put the time in it to up my skills and master it, because it seems to have lots of content and when it works, it's kinda fun ... but with these constant crash, i simply don't want to. \n\nLast time it crashed during the raid completion screen and it costed me all my progress, a ton of xp and boosters. Lame.\n\nAlso i agree with everybody who commented about invincibility frames. \nthere's no time to correct mistakes, and you lose a ton of HP in a few seconds if you're in a bad spot. it can get very frustrating.\nAlso for an isaac-like, the game is quite stingy about upgrades.
