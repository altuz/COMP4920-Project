We are not ones who have the time to play epic, long term games which literally take over your life. We came through the old way of Mario Brothers and Pack Man, when they first arrived. We are from the beginning of the Internet! These were just after the days of the video arcade when the guns were not digital, but made of metal.  Do not  ask our ages.  What impresses us most about this game is the mood it sets, with a Film Noir flavor both in graphics and music. Terri especially liked the artwork in the city when she arrived to the cafe at night, reminiscent of  'Nighthawks' by the artist Edward Hopper.\n\nWe enjoyed that  each level is presented as a day in time, though short, this is unique as part of a whole month of days on the calendar. This is how the game's creator has chosen to challenge us.  The game play is simple, and only needs a mouse. \n\nDriveby Gangster provides hours of entertainment. Imagine playing in the fog, rain or total darkness. Picture a seaside with bad guys everywhere and you as the Gangster have to make the hit. Later it may be your turn to take a powder. Imagine ... this game is created by one man, not a cast of thousands.  We are also a fans of The Godfather. The Tommy Gun is perfect, for after all, this is in the 1940s. Yes it may be large but it is effective.    We thank you for a journey down Memory Lane      \n\n                                        Carlo and his gun-moll Terri", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446633037, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446633094, "recommendationid": "18871922", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493937", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1442114695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 72, "steamid": "76561197967407410", "num_games_owned": 280}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Find your true calling with Driveby Gangster and clean up the streets one driveby at a time.

It's basically a drive by shooting simulator with a very easy introduction and it gets progressively harder as you move through the stages.  \n\nYou are sitting in a car which is automatically moving and you have to hit the gangsters in the crowds of people and minimize the casualties of innocent bystanders.  \n\nFor the price, it's worth it.  I know the animation quality isn't the best but other than that, there's nothing really wrong about the game concept or execution.  There are a few issues I have with it, though. \n\n- no way to change sensitivity on controller analogs for look speed.  this makes it nearly impossible after just a few levels, however it is possible to use the mouse which moves 100 times faster so IMHO it's what you will want to be using for this game.\n\n- no way to see what your controls are beyond them being flashed at the screen at the very beginning.  I don't know how to speed up the car, I can't just hit start and see the controls in the options screen, nor is it in the main menu.  You seem to need to have to start a fresh game and memorize it right there.  Big oversight, I hope it gets patched into the in-game pause menu at some point.\n\nIt gets very difficult early into the game (7th day was starting to ramp up the difficulty quite a bit) so if there are ~30 days in the game, you might find this game to be difficult.  But hey, for $2, do you accept the challenge?\n\nI couldn't help but noticed the large majority of people are downvoting my review.  I guess this is one of those \"downvote the positives and upvotes the negatives\" sort of games where people are blindly voting because of some vendetta against poor animation quality.  That's fine.  The game isn't great but it's $2..  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR9BJ3FHNi0", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441931539, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442022604, "recommendationid": "17976560", "language": "english", "votes_down": 59, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443605", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1465783668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 13, "steamid": "76561198047505033", "num_games_owned": 134}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I don't think Drive By gangster is a good as other players are suggesting it is.
