If anyone's confused, you start off with a creation with a topic of your choice out of two it gives you. With that topic, you are given 10 objects/characters/backgrounds which you can use each panel of the four. You can edit your objects by resizing, altering a pose, rotating or mirroring a object (except backgrounds which sucks), change color of a object, and add text. At the end, you are able to export your image to your PC, where you can share to wherever you want. If your not finished with a comic, you can always save and exit but be warn, if you start a new comic while you already made another one, your progress for the previous one will be removed, as when you've started a new one, it'll override your previous progress, which again I recommend the developers make multiple slots for comics. If you didn't get any of this, there's also a tutorial, which comes in handy. The graphics are like your standard 8-bit Pixeljam games put into artistic symbols. Sadly there's no music, but it fits I guess.
