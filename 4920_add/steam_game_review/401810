End of story now get out of the review section and buy the game if you want to kill a good 32 hours collecting things.\n\nokay that's not entirely true so read this instead\n\nPLOT\n\nYou and your sister run away from the city in order to find Adventure. On your adventure to find adventure you meet up with Mario in his mid 80's who asks you to get his sonic ring with ribbons attached to it down from a tall stump due to him being a crotchety old man who can't do it himself. So you jump to the top of the stump, grab his ring and when you bring it back to him he tells you that the ring is called an \"Explorers Medallion\" and they are foudn all over the world. So he asks you and your sister if you want to get on his magic flying whale blimp to find him and since choice matters as much as it did in TellTale's Walking Dead Season 1 in this game, you say yes and off the three of you go to go get the Medallions and save the world or something\n\nYOUR CHARACTER ADN YOU\n\nIt's simple, you got WASD Movement, Space Sar jumps, pressing it twice duble jumps, pressing Space while sliding down a wall wall jumps and if you time it correctly you can do a triple jump, A roll you can preform by pressing Shift that can be used to kill some enemies and a roll jump you can do by rolling and pressing Space HOWEVER long jumping can only be done after rolling for a little bit and you can't wall jump after doing a triple jump. Later on you get tools and you press E and Q to scroll through them and R to use. Sounds easy, yeah? BuT iTs NoT. Your character only has three hit points to start out with but if you loose all your hearts you'll go right back to the last checkpoint you reached. Luckily bottomless pits don't kill you or make you lose any HP, you just start back at the flag, However, health is extremely scarce unless you have the shovel that allows you to occationly dig up a heart that allows you to get take another hit, an enemy randomly drops one for you to pick up or you can buy a small health extention from Mario so you can take an aditional hit, so you best pray to RNGesus that when you're low on health you can rip out the beating heart of a defeated enemy so you may consume it and gain strength or start saving up so you can buy that extra bit of padding for your fragile child body.\n\nWHAT THE FUCK IS MY PURPOSE?!\n\nIn Poi you gotta collect things. A lot of things. Like, a lot a lot of things. Your main collectibles are the Medallions however    there are also golden gears you need to find so a mechanic can repair her ship and in each world (Plus the Hub and super secret gears) There are 5 total with the exception of the challange levels which have one gear per level and two medalians to be earned, one for playing normaly and another for collection a certian number of keys as fast as you can. Every time you bring five gears to the mechanic she gives you a Medallion and once you have all of them she gives you jack squat except a new line of diolog thanking you for all your hard work and the final Medallion she has\n\n\nThere are also the special locations in every world with a grand total of 16 locations per world, they're pretty easy to spot and chances are you'll find most of them without you even knowing. Once you find every special location in a world the man with the rocketship will give you, you guessed it, a Medallion. \n\nThird, there are 8 fossils in every world (except the micro worlds) The only to extract them from the earth is to buy the shovel from Mario and every time you find all the fossils in a world, some crazed hobo on a floating island in your hub will give you, say it with me now, a Medallion. \n\nOn top of all that there are several minigames and sidequests you need to do in order to get every single medalian, such as the Pin Penguin's six missing babies or the gliding challange where you need to fly through a certian amount of rings before time runs out. For each minigame there are 3 diffaculties: Easy, Medium and Hard, for each one you have to pay a little bit more just to have a shot at and each diffaculty grants you one Medallion (meaning there is aMedallion to be earned for completing each mini game on all 3 diffulcities)\n\nNext are the costumes, finding all of them does not grant you anything special besides changing how you look, giving you an achievement and gettign you closer t othat sweet, sweet 100% completion rating. \n\nFinally, there are the photos. Upon buying the camera from good ol' Mario, you can take pictures of anything in the world but in order to 100% the game and get the achievement, you have to take a photo of every single enemy in the game, that includes bosses and one special NPC that I will not spoil.\n\nOh, and I almost forgot about the stowaway's High Scores. There are 10 of them, they are easy to top and it's pretty much just free Medallions she's giving away\n\n BOSSES\n\nThere are four of them, and each of them are pretty easy\n\nBoss one is Mr Octopuss, all he does is try to pimp slap you with his hentai grabbers that are really easy to avoid and duck under the water. Wait for him to get into position, hit him with a soccer bomb and the world is done.\n\nBoss two is just the leader bully from Super Mario 64 but instead of S H O V E I N G him off the platform you get on a rising platform, monkey bar your way over until your on top of him while avoiding fire stalks, drop down and repeat two more times before clearing the world.\n\nBoss three is just boss one again except he's a mole who makes crystals fall vrom the roof of a cave, but he's not menecing due to his crystals being patheticly easy to dodge and he gives you rocks to kick in his face. Kick three rocks in his face and he's fucking dead.\n\nLastly, The Finial Boss aka a good kick in the dick is by far the worst boss I'e ever had to fight in all of video games due to the game playshifting from decent platforming and exploration into a shooter where you need to launch bombs onto his crystals while shooting down his projectials. It sounds easy enough but due to how bad the cannon controls it's alot harder than it should be. The cannon is way too slippery for this kind of a boss battle because the boss is constently moving, meaning you'll have to change your trajectory often so you can line your shot up with the crystals on his sholders, chin and head but you can't due to the god awful cannon controls. Not to mention if you manage to shoot off all the crystals, the boss gets to throw a hissy fit and start launching projectials at different angles at you. They don't come in too fast so you have alot of time to react but by the time you hit him three times you'll have to manage shooting down the projectiles and hitting the crystals. I also forgot to mention that i nthis boss battle you cannot get health back, so if you don;t have the health extention chances are you'll have to take down a boss that has 5 hit points while you only have three. And guess what else, if you die you'll have to watch an unskipible cutscene before you get to fight the boss again and it makes me wonder what the developer was thinking when he did that because the cutscene maybe about 2 minutes long if you mash your spacebar into oblivion but that's still 2 minutes I don't want to waste reading the same diolog over and over again.\n\nConsidering there are four worlds plus the micro levels and excluding the final level due to it having only one collectible, that being the end game object that serves no other purpose other than to tell you how fast you finished the game and show people who completed the game the fastest, there are a grand total of 101 Medallions, 50 gears, 32 fossils, 64 special locations, 21 creatures to take photos of, 9 minigames run throughs (Granted you beat every single one on your first try) and 7 costumes for you to find and deck yourself out with. All in all, I'd say you should buy this game, but only if it goes on sale for 9$ US or lower and you are really into colectathons", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501448895, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501448895, "recommendationid": "33914104", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508722", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 189, "total_reviews": 200, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
