And we can say there is no replay value.\n\n+ Good story\n+ Gameplay mechanics are not repetitive, each stage has its own mood and flavour.\n+ Nice visual art style.\n+ Nice lore and atmosphere, especially for the lovers of Scandinavian mythology.\n\n- Audio quality is low for some sound effects, fine for some others.\n- There was an animation bug towards the ending where a character walks sideways and it was immersion breaking. Restarting fixed it.\n\nIt was a good VR experience and I recommend it to players who like story driven VR games.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498640018, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498640018, "recommendationid": "32921338", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 42, "total_reviews": 62, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 20}}
