The game started off promising and I liked the rush point mechanics and the story, but I was quickly lost with the pointless officer barrier mechanic that they put it. How do we take away from an enjoyable fast paced combat system? Put in a barrier that will have to be broken repeatedly in order to do damage to the officer and while they have that barrier they are unaffected by anything hitting them and once its broken it stays down for under 10 seconds before coming back at full strength and having to be broken again.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500424972, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500424972, "recommendationid": "33641219", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499932568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 113, "steamid": "76561197965396869", "num_games_owned": 1081}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Unless you love games like Dynasty Warriors where you're basically 100 times better than nearly everyone on the battlefield and able to destroy hundreds of enemies with a swipe or two of your sword, avoid this title.\n\nI don't like DW, and I don't like this.  The controls are poor, horseback combat is lame, and combat on foot is mediocre.  The controls just don't respond well, and the camera's annoying.  It doesn't follow you so you can see what you're doing most of the time.  Enemies just appear in front of you from nowhere, and some disappear for no reason, too.  You only attack on one side of your horse, mostly, and you simply button mash while mounted.  It's not skill based at all.  On foot there's a tiny bit of skill involved, but not much.  Mash buttons, win.  Yeah, if you want \"high scores\" you have to get better, and really learn how to exploit the game mechanics, but it's just not worth the effort.\n\nIt's too bad the fighting is so poorly done, and so silly.  One guy can't take out thousands of troops no matter how good they are.  It's ridiculous how hundreds of enemies, and a few dozen allied troops, mostly just stand around waiting for you to do something.  They rarely attack, barely do any damage, and generally just mill about on the battlefield waiting to get REPEATEDLY knocked over before they die, and vanish.  The only challenge, other than actually lining up your attacks, comes from mini-bosses and bosses.  That's partially because they have some lame shield mechanic where they *SOMEHOW* regenerate a shield during combat and you have to repeatedly break it down.\n\nThe ability and gear system consists of cards and styles.  The cards alter your abilities to some extent, and they're limited by your level and their point value.  No matter the point value, you can equip 3 of them maximum.  You can also swap weapons around a bit, and they do have different options for attack styles that each have different effects, but even if you repeatedly hit the right combos they don't always work.  You also don't get to choose your weapon options, or armour, it's just doled out to you and you're stuck with whatever you have.\n\nThe story is tired and predictable.  That's about all I feel like saying about that.\n\nThe animation and graphics are okay, nothing special, nothing terrible, but it's clear a lot of work went into it.  It's too bad the gameplay is flat, dull, uninspired and repetitive.\n\nThere's very little here that will be able to hold my attention, but it might a game some people can enjoy.  I simply don't, it's too repetitive and too dull.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499933797, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499933797, "recommendationid": "33498070", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481076", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 49, "total_reviews": 74, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 25}}
