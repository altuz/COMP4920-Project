I adore its style and mood, but at the moment the game is essentially a multiplayer asset tour with a handful of cute but gimmicky interactive elements. There is very little to bring you back into its world once you've explored it, and none of the interactive elements seem to contribute to the social environment. There are free Social VR titles with more content, more customizability, and a much more stable technological framework.\n\nI can't help but feel like the developers are shooting themselves in the foot by revealing the game so early and with such a high price tag. If the game was free or significantly cheaper it would stand as a neat experience to check in on once in a while, but I have a feeling loads of people will pursue a refund while they still can.\n\nI hope that the developers are able to stay on course and flesh out their world because it really does have the potential to become something very unique and interesting. I'm just not so sure that anyone is going to feel compelled to stick around until then.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497566562, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1497566562, "recommendationid": "32455644", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516180", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497560343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 45, "steamid": "76561198035690841", "num_games_owned": 67}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I had to stop playing just now as for the first time ever I got VR motion sickness. \n\nFirst impressions: Really interesting concept. The maps are very complete. They don't look as good in VR (Supersampling at 1.4) as they do on the intro videos in 2D  but they are nice.\n\nThere's not that much to do (yet).  I haven't explored everywhere but there are some cool little areas. I expect this will get better and better.  It would be cool if there were more things going on. Even just cars or robot people milling about. The town feels a bit dead. There is one chap playing his guitar but I don't think he does anything else. More stuff like that would be good.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be an overall goal to the game/experience.\n\nSome bugs I noticed:\n- The oars are laggy on the boat.\n- When throwing things (fruit/puppets) - they don't let go immediately when you let go.\n- Motion - I used locomotion. I found this to be one of the worst bits. I couldn't predict when it would walk and when it would run.  A side-step option would also be good.\n\nChat - Although it says I was online in the main menu, when I clicked voice and pressed login, it just seemed to be loading but never finally loaded. I couldn't hear anyone and I dont think anyone could hear me.\n\nYou have to register via a web page before you start. I did this but still couldn't chat.\n\nI'm really looking forward to exploring the rest of the world. It definitely needs more users for it to be viable long term. I hope the devs can help me out with my voice issue.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1497636875, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497561368, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1497561368, "recommendationid": "32453756", "developer_response": "Thanks for the review!
