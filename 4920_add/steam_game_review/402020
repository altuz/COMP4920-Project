During my time with [i] The Park [/i] I realized how a game creator can turn a simple tale such as [b][i] Hanzel & Gretel [/i][/b] and twist it to a [spoiler]pill addicted mother killing her innocent son.[/spoiler] \n\nThe game opens with you, the mother, driving up to this theme park, Atlantic Oak or something along those lines. Your son Callum is in the car while yoiu get out and just walk away. Apparently we left his [strike] Teddy Bear [/strike] inside the park and we must retrieve it. You walk extremely slow during this section and are unable to look at anything. You can either beeline straight to the ticket booth where the game progresses or you can walk yourself up this curvy hill into some mist? I'm not sure why they added that other than a cheap [spiler] achievment. [/spoiler] This guy is inside the ticket booth and he gives us the clear to go into the theme park to look for this [strike] Teddy Bear.[/strike]\n\nDuring the \"First Chapter\" we are allowed to Sprint, Call for our son Callum, and examine clues that give us more information on the theme park. While calling for Callum a blur will appear on your screen indicating you to go whatever dirction and Callum will call out with a \"THIS WAY MOMMY!\" Which adds some creepiness to the story. The atmosphere of the Park is actually pretty chilling. I did play with the brightness up slightly higher than suggested which may have affected some of the more ominous and scary portions of the first chapter. At this point, Callum has us running to the Swan Ride, on the way there we learn that the Mascot for [i] The Park [/i] \"Steve/Chad the Squirrel\" is not liked very much and people think the person is a creep. After going down this small hill ight inside of the park, we are greeted by Callum and watch him joyously jump onto a swan boat and take the dark ride into the tunnel. We then get on the next boat and venture into the cavern, where we are greeted with \"Hanzel and Gretel\" projected onto the cave walls. The story goes through how their parents hated them, to the point they were going to leave them in the forest to die. Hanzel is like \"I'll go out and make a trail of rocks and breadcrumbs to the house!\" But we all know it doesn't work and birds eat that [spoiler] shit [/spoiler] right up. Anyways, they find a house made of candy after being dropped off in the forest and let to die for three days. Hanzel, being the little tubby he is, ate the walls of the candy house. An older woman then comes out and offers them food. Little did they know she wanted to eat poor little tubby. Gretel being the smart gal she is, asks the witch how to clean the oven properly and then rightfully pushes her in. Then the kids eat the witch and are so filled and happy. During this story the boat is knocked around a couple of times and the Mascot, Chad, is seen inside watching us for a breif moment.\n\n[b] Chapter 2 [/b]\n\n\nAfter this boat ride, we are allowed to venture over to the Ferris Wheel. The Ferris wheel portion of the game provides us with all the info we need to start to feel horrible for our character. We learn her husband died while she was pregnant with Callum. We also learn that all we wanted for Callum was to have a great life, but unfortunately his sister died a still born. So we filled the part of his sister and his mother. The ferris wheel starts to creek and turn as we get more and more depressed thinking over how our life was. Once we get off the ferris wheel we are led down another hill, where we learn that the park was built on old haunted land. We also learn that people died all the time while this park was being built. \n\n[b] Chapter 3 [/b]\n\nAfter we learn this, we go to the Bumper Cars where we learn that our character was hospitalized and injected and tested on with something. Nothing much else is learned other than we're depressed. during the end of the chapter, a bumper car taes life and starts to drive wildly towards us, unfortunately this game does not come with audio sliders, so the music was so loud compared to the SFX. Nothing was terrifying due to this. \n\n\n[b] Chapter 4 [/b]\n\nWe head over to this lake with this weird carnival theme. There's a giant spinning ride in the center of a pier, with extremely loud, over used, carnival music. I just ran around the entier pier neglecting anything scary, looking for clues about the park and my character. Fortunately, this area is saved by the backstory of \"Steve/Chad the Mascot.\" This is where we see an Eye-Witness report of a murder that Chad commited. A person waiting in line was watching Chad make an ice sculpture, as he was very good at it. Chad was seen taking his time, but whatever he was carv ing had so much detail people could not look away. The eye witness reports seeing a face popping out of the ice, with no eyes and no teeth. Just as the eye witness was looking at the sculptor, two teens walked over and laughed at Chad. Chad took the ice pick and stabbed the teenagers over and over, until he got an eyeball out and put it in the hole of the ice sculptor. \n\nThis was a pretty interesting eye-witness report and it got my hopes up that Chad would soon scare the poop outta me.\n\nSoon after this report, we walk up a hill to an employees room, where we learn a fellow employee of Chad had died. This employee had a note written saying how Chad never took the suit off, and it stank like decaying flesh. The employee said they hated Chad and sometimes he would walk over and stare at her. As soon as we put the note down, the lights on the inside of the room flash and we can see Chad's siloutte standing over an employee, holding his ice pick.\n\n[b] Chapter 5 [/b]\n\nWe head over to the carnival section of the map, but this area provides us with little to no information. The only detail here is that a child was killed behind the cotton candy maker. then we go into this weird psychadelic world, which feels like an Oxy trip, where everything is slow motion and the devil's laughter echoes in the background. Nothing more than that... We pic kup a bottle of pills and a roller coaster ticket though\n\n[b] Chapter 6 [/] \n\nThe roller coaster opens a whole new perspective on our character. During our ride, we are greeted by a mysterious slender-man esq, person who is telling us how horrible we are. As we ride the coaster, we get these insane strobe lights which are supposedly flash backs to the hospital when we were having Callum. This idea was horrible by design and horrible narritavely. It provided little and was only to show that the game would have a roller coaster. We pick up our first and only item, the Flashlight.\n\n[b] Chapter 7 [/b]\n\nWe head into the house fo horrors where we learn...! We [spoiler]KILLED CALLUM![/spoiler]  We also learn that we are in purgatory, and we have to relive the same day over and over. The same scene over and over. I must have walked through the same area 11 times. Each with slighly changed and more evil aspects. We learn that we are the Ice pick killer, and that Callum was the innocent victim behind the cotton candy tent. Then that's the end of the game. It was an okay expirece. \n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Alright narrative\n[*] Interesting lore and back story for the park\n[*] Atmopshere\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Gameplay was extremely boring\n[*] Linear story line\n[*]No items are secrets\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\n\nI'd give this game a [b] 6/10 [/b] It was alright, the only redeeming quality is the atmosphere.

I have played lots of them. First of all I would like to say that the settings of this game are done quite well. The amusement park is spooky and eerie and reminded me of those classic childhood horror movies of abandoned haunted parks. It felt really good to explore and soak in the atmosphere and enjoy the rides.\n\nBut apart from that the story is told in a very ambiguous way dropping us with some vague clues on what happened with the main character but clearly not explaining enough to build an assumed explanation. I have played a similar psychedelic horror game like this, \"Layers Of Fear\" and even though it was also ambiguous it clearly dropped enough clues to form some explanations on what happened.  While the story of this game is quite engaging it would have done some more effort to explain on what exactly happened. Add to the fact that I got to know later that it was made  as a spin off and is set in the same universe as another game \"The Secret World\" made it more confusing. I can think of one or two things that may have happened but not enough to get a satisfying conclusion. It could have been so much more as the game definitely had the standards to be a good psychological horror game from the rest of the things it did.\n\nThe rides in the game offered a little insight into the mindset of the main character and they were unique in itself. Also, the graphics were really beautiful and creepy and the game performance was good. I just wish the story could have been a little more polished so that I could have enjoyed it more. I never complain about the length of a game because if i enjoyed it for the time i played it then its good enough for me. You can buy this game on a sale and play it to experience the game settings and atmosphere of the amusement park. Other than that, I am hopeful the developers will make a more engaging story driven title in the future for us horror fans.\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506667640, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506667640, "recommendationid": "35284601", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500354", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506372828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 101, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 101, "steamid": "76561198155791777", "num_games_owned": 12}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I bought this on sale and im still dissapointed", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506372918, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506372918, "recommendationid": "35210490", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498779", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506219615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 64, "steamid": "76561198091571570", "num_games_owned": 145}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Didnt make an awful lot of sense and was kinda boring", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506219812, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506219812, "recommendationid": "35168793", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498574", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506432544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 75, "steamid": "76561198025407995", "num_games_owned": 232}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "+ walking simulator\n+ unreal engine\n+ great performance in 4K\n+ a jumpscare that actually did work\n+ atmospheric\n- story is flat and not immersive\n- option to toggle run\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506432793, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506432793, "recommendationid": "35221906", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492530", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 865, "total_reviews": 1187, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 322}}
