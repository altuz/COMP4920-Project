Dick short story. \n\nSet on one street the game explores themes in the same way PKD writing did, it asks questions about the world around us and our place in it rather than provide answers.\nThe puzzles are a clever narrative aid[spoiler](mumbles somin\u2019 about looking at the world in a different way)[/spoiler]and the environmental design/voice acting/soundtrack are great. \nIf you enjoy Sci-Fi, PKD's writing or comics by artists like Jean Giraud, Charles Burns, Richard Sala would recommend getting this game, play it in one/two sittings to get the story build up, turn up the music and take in the shifting realities. \n\nI didn\u2019t experience any of the technical issues mentioned in other reviews and the setting of one street fitted the story. \nThough inspired by - for me it felt like a real representation of Philip K. Dick's writing. \n\n5 out of 5 altered art realities.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494867684, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506004950, "recommendationid": "31772568", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512048", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 48, "total_reviews": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 21}}
