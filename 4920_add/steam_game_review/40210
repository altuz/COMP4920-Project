Would play again.\n\nIn all seriousness though, this game is a genre-defining work of art that had years of development and years more of community input and insight. I belive that this work of art should be spread to all users accross the internet, not just Steam users, and that a Kickstarter program should be started in this respect. This masterpiece is an absolute must-have in any true Steam library, perfect for anyone, anywhere, and at any time. I cannot stress how much fun I have had with this game. \n\nCountless moments of edge-of-your-seat gameplay for every single hour of the 34 hours that this game takes to complete will absolutely blow you away. In addition, the tutorial utilizes a revolutionary design; a very clever mix of hand-holding and do-it-yourself walk-throughs.\n\nThe graphics are phenominal and state-of-the-art, and the game even comes with its very own well-intigrated dev-module, that allows you to create anything you could possibly imagine, and render it in stunning 2D.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is a must have.\n10/10"}]}
