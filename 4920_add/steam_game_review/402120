The game aims and fires for you, which works really well, actually. You just worry about dodging and using your specials. Reminds me of a bullet hell rendition of Dungeons of Dredmor (one of my favorite actual roguelikes), minus the humor. Great amount of variety in enemies, items, and environments. Lots of progression between runs through unlocks. \n\nI wasn't a huge fan of the art initially, but it has grown on me. There are some interesting 3D (I guess?) effects that run on top of the pixel graphics, and it's all very smooth.\n\nEach run is a good length for a single session, and the difficulty feels well-balanced. It isn't impossibly difficult, but is far from trivial. If you're lucky, you can end up massively overpowered by the final boss, but that's fun, too.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499781135, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499781135, "recommendationid": "33456443", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507239", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1502092369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1117, "steamid": "76561198203058437", "num_games_owned": 814}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "An interesting rogue like game, with many Cthulhu elements.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500644955, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500644955, "recommendationid": "33696999", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494851", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 136, "total_reviews": 159, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 23}}
