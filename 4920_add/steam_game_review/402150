In the most obvious cases of the game getting it wrong, I had to choose which of two strings to cut when the sound they both made was completely identical.\n\nIn a game where the aim is to determine which notes are being played, this is quite a big issue. Its extra time challenges, where a single mistake by you OR the game means a restart, are a lot less appealing now.\n\nI'd love to see more games like this, but that one problem really messes up this game's potential.\n\nRating: a diminished fifth out of ten.\n\nP.S. On a less justified, more personal note, dominant sevenths are the best sevenths, so it's sad that they don't make an appearance.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495372786, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495372786, "recommendationid": "31882706", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511728", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "total_reviews": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 8}}
