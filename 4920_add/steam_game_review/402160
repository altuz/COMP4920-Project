It has been a slow process, but they are adding to and updating everything as they are able.  It has its share of technical issues, but as a whole, the game is decent.  Organizing a crew, upgrading your ship, and supplying your team with weapons, food, and furniture is fun.  \nWhen this game is complete, and officially released, I feel it will be the very starship simulator game that I have hoped for.  The IOS version of Star Command was fun, and I think this is an expanded version of that.  Would I recommend it to be bought early, in alpha?  No.  But, after final release, I think people will pick it up and really enjoy it.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505142164, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505142164, "recommendationid": "34884429", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1484639002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 694, "steamid": "76561198044589461", "num_games_owned": 64}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Do not buy. This game is extremely buggy, barebones and it is hard to imagine this game being completed. I understand this game is in early access so there should not be an expectation that the game is complete and I certainly did not purchase this game with that expectation. What I did expect was to see the game progress towards a final product and for the developer to regularly communicate their progress and goals as the game developed. That is not the case with this game. While this game is \"progressing\", the progress is limited to annual (or bi-annual if we\u2019re lucky) updates that are so miniscule that this game will likely not be playable (let alone completed) in my lifetime. Communication from the development team generally comes in fits and spurt and largely focuses on assuring people who bought the game that despite all evidence to the contrary, the game is still being worked on. If you buy this game today, know that you may be travelling the stars as captain of your own spaceship before you will be doing so in this game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507105857, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507105857, "recommendationid": "35466227", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 81, "total_reviews": 120, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 39}}
