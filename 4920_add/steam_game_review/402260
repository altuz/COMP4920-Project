You have four suspects, and most of the game consists of searching the scientist's house for clues, reading notes and newspaper articles, and piecing the evidence together until you know what happened. There is also a supernatural aspect to the story, which helps creating a creepy atmosphere and maintaining a sense of danger throughout the game.\n\nI found the story interesting and quite good - it unfolded naturally, made sense, and the revelation at the end did not feel tacked-on or forced (perhaps a bit foreseeable if you do find and read all the notes). While not the best story ever told, it's definitely solid material for an adventure game, I've seen way worse. Don't expect too much from the \"multiple endings\" though, they are just different ways to fail. The story is pretty linear.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy - solutions are either obvious, or at least have clear cues. Sometimes the game even tells you explicitly that the item you just found can be used to solve a puzzle you encountered a few rooms earlier. All this did not prevent me from wasting 40 minutes with searching a key in the wrong place, but I think that was rather me being stupid and overlooking a cue, the puzzles really aren't difficult by themselves.\n\nThe game does not provide free movement. It puts you into a fixed position, from where you can look around in a full 360 degree panoramic view. Clicking on hotspots lets you interact with objects or move to a different position. While you move between positions, the game shows a very slow walking sequence in first-person view as if you walked yourself, but you have no control over the movement and cannot interact with anything during these sequences. This restricted type of movement was probably chosen because the game was also released for VR, but unfortunately it creates a less immersive experience for players with \"regular\" monitors.\n\nFor the same reason, controls are a bit unusual, but I found them easy to use regardless. You have to look straight at the hotspot you want to interact with, and left-click to perform the interaction (open the drawer, move to the next spot, etc.), or right-click to access your inventory and notes. For some reason I couldn't find a good setting for mouse sensitivity and had to move the mouse across large distances just for looking around, which was a bit annoying, but perhaps that was just a problem with my hardware. (I'd suggest to check other reviews for similar issues).\n\nGraphics are good but not stellar, voice acting is unfortunately pretty terrible though. A robotic female voice slowly reads lines as if her mind was somewhere else completely. It's not quite bad enough for saying that the game would have been better without it, but it's close, in any case the voice work did not do the game any favors. The overly correct pronunciation gave me the impression that the actress had had basic training of technical aspects, but lacked the ability to actually convey emotions through her voice. Thankfully only a few passages of the game are voice-acted, most of the information is text only.\n\nThe game includes a few jump scares - nothing extreme, just something unexpected appearing on the screen, accompanied by a loud sound effect. I did not find them particularly shocking, but if you're [i]very[/i] sensitive to jump scares, then you may want to consider that you [i]will[/i] encounter some in this game.\n\nDead Secret is a pretty short game. I think I completed it in 4 hours and I'm usually a slow player. I don't mind a game being short, actually I appreciate a game that tells a complete, engaging story in just a few hours over one that tries to waste my time with repetitive gameplay or grinding - I'm not a kid anymore and rarely have time for the latter nowadays. However, I think Dead Secret's price tag is a bit high for what it provides. You may want to wait for a 75% off sale on this one, but for a price of under 4 bucks I'd definitely recommend it to adventure and mystery fans.\n\nCaveat: The purchase also includes the VR version of the game.

You are a reporter that try to get her big scoop by finding out the truth about the deathof an reaserch professor. The police think it's a natrual death, but you belive there is something more to the story and that it's actually murder. There are some minor horror elements in it, but it's mostly cheep jump scares. The game builds a fairly decent mystery and it does get a little creepy from time to time, and the overall story is good for the most part. But the games problems destroy the experience for me. \n\nYou walk around to hotspots in each room like in all similar Myst-like games, but instead of instantly moving there like in most similar games, the devs for some reason choose to play the slowest walk animations I think I have ever seen. Seriously, each time you click to move there is an excruciatingly slow animation for no reason at all. I wouldn't be surprised if a fourth of the gameplay was that damn crawl of an animation. The UI is also really poorly implemented, and slow to navigate. The actual puzzles are really easy, but even if you get stuck you can brute force through them. Other than that, it's mechanicly pretty much a \"escape the room\" game, 90% of the puzzles are find a specific object and put it in a slot and you will get another item to use in another slot... It get's really old pretty fast. The good thing is the actual mystery of what happend, but it's entirely told in documents you find around the house, why the police didn't care about the piles of documents that hint that it might not be a a natrual death is anyones guess. It is quite funny that you can \"Nope the f*ck out\" when bad things start to happend, and that is one of the 5 endings. \n\nThere are also lots of minor technical issues, There are no resolution settings. There are no manual saves and only a single save file. You don't even have sound settings in game. It's not a deal breaker but together with the above mentioned problems, it really comes down to what feels like a pretty good story stuck in an technicly and mechanicly mediocre game. \n\nWas quite dissapoited in this game, but It's not worth the asking price of 15\u20ac IMO. If you could pick it up at +50% discount, especially if you have a VR rig, then you might be satisfied.

I would definitely recommend it to other VR players at the $15 price point. The story was intriguing, the mystery well-written, and the environment fun to poke around in. The fright is weighted more toward jump-scares but there's lingering tension and creepiness as well. \n\nNow for the other stuff. \n\nYou should be aware that it's a ~3-hour experience, which I think is worth it in VR, but your mileage may vary when deciding to purchase it non-VR. \n\nI'm not a big fan of the hotspot movement, but perhaps full movement would have been a bear to implement. I liked seeing the avatar body in mirrors, but actually inhabiting it was wonky--I often found myself clipping out of it, so the body popped into my view, even when I didn't move my physical body. I would've gone for an invisible avatar viewable only in mirrors. Hmm, except looking down at your feet was a nice touch. I would also have liked to see more done with the mask view.\n\nThat's it for criticisms. Overall I thought it was a solid, if somewhat brief, creepy adventure. The puzzles are basic and inventory-based, and it leans more heavily toward walking simulator than adventure/puzzler. Don't expect survival horror! This is a story-driven game.\n\n*edit: Oh, I did have another criticism. I think they should have hired a voice actress to voice the protagonist.
