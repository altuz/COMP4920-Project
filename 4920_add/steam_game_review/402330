Meh, it's okay I guess. A funny, live-action film footage game that's good for one or two sessions but gets boring fast.\n\n+Funny and quirky sense of humor.\n+Never takes itself seriously.\n+Campy style.\n+A few funny choices can be made by the player here and there.\n+Good plot which breaks the fourth wall.\n+Funny idea.\n+Very cheap price.\n+Good attempt to maintain a fairly realistic first person perspective throughout, which is very difficult to accomplish with most movie cameras (even if one has access to a steady-cam or similar apparatus).\n\n+/-Nice pop-culture references though they are becoming a little dated in 2017 and yet the game is still \"early access.\"\n+/-This game doesn't use very much traditional computer animation. Instead is more like an experimental interactive movie in which buttons must be pressed at certain times to get certain results. While interesting at first, this also makes the game extremely repetitive.\n+/-Adequate sound but not fantastic.\n+/-Nearly no music though music is not very intrusive.\n\n-Extremely repetitive after just 2-3 play-throughs.\n-This game seems to be eternally stuck in the early-access phase. It doesn't seem to be improving or growing very much as time goes on though. Meanwhile the developer already seems to be thinking about making a sequel.\n-There are many more things that could have been done with this game. Not all failed button presses should result in death or repetitive do-overs. Entirely alternate branches of the story could potentially exist if the game was ever actually finished.\n-What's wrong with watching your girlfriend shower? The apparent prude who wrote the script for this game seems to be under the misapprehension that there's something wrong with wanting to do that.\n-Some button-pressing combinations are overly difficult.\n-There should be an easier than easy difficulty for old people who might get a kick out of the game but are definitely not gamers nor have any great hope of ever greatly developing such button mashing skills.\n-What little gameplay exists mostly consists of reaction-time oriented games and button mashing.\n-The game is short and the ending feels somewhat abrupt and the plot is not resolved.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500891751, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500892069, "recommendationid": "33762813", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502183", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506998504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 56, "steamid": "76561198140273187", "num_games_owned": 25}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "World star simulator 11/10", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1499624402, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499624402, "recommendationid": "33411119", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500006", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1503608051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 47, "steamid": "76561198044287902", "num_games_owned": 275}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "If you like bad acting and poor writing, then this is the game for you.\n\nI know a lot of people like this game, but the acting and the writing was way too painful for me.

It was just weird and not in a good way and the fact that it went on for so long was something I just couldn't get. I know that the whole game is a self referential joke about a trope, but just making the joke doesn't mean that its automatically funny.
