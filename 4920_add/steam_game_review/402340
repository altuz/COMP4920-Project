Nice time waster.   It has a cool 'floaty' handling of the hovercraft.  Missing a little back story tho.  Even something to read from the menu screen would be cool.

The game looks quite well and plays good. What i really didnt like was the difficulty setting: The stages are quite easy, the bosses are hard.
