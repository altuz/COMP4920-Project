The duration of each match is long enough to for the heat of the competition to come up, but short enough so that everybody can have his own revenge in a matter of minutes.\nSkills matter in this game, but in the chaos of action, some luck helps too, so that players who are behind do not feel too overwhelmed and have some chance of getting back in the game.\n\nThe game modes are varied and offer a wide choice to suit a group subjective preference. Pong and soccer are especially great and fun.\n\nThe action is chaotic and you'll spend enough time after the game talking with your friends about epic moments, unlikely suicides and own-goals and \"friendly\" fire. If your friends are still with you, that is.\n\nTL;DR : highly recommended!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444739026, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444739026, "recommendationid": "18454268", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516281", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1456513173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1150, "steamid": "76561198036423744", "num_games_owned": 42}, "votes_funny": 12, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Positive:\n-Lot of different vehicles (and horn sounds)\n-Combat mechanic is really fun\n-The soundtrack alone is probably worth the price\n\nNegative:\n-Requires a controller\n-AI is possessed by satan himself\n\n\nYou get to kill your friends in space driving an over-weaponised car and then you can honk to mock them when they are dead!\n\nRecommended if you hate your friends! 10/10\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444729903, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444729903, "recommendationid": "18453074", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516707", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445262554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 89, "steamid": "76561198071577937", "num_games_owned": 24}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is a lot of fun especially in local multiplayer!\nLast night with my friends we played this game non stop, laughing a lot and hating each other on the space soccer fields and the last man standing arena :)\nIn single player mode you basically train with an AI that is best then you and all of your friends out of the box, even in normal mode 0.0 (had fun but Maaaaaaan that needs a lot of focus!)\nRECOMMENDED \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445097398, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445097398, "recommendationid": "18528878", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491791", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1471034854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 686, "steamid": "76561198025564234", "num_games_owned": 36}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Lovely!
