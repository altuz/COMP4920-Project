I never really gave it a shot. Boy, am I an idiot. \n\nThis game markets itself as XCOM meets Dota 2. I guess that would be correct. Except the only aspect of a typical MOBA to be found here is a wide range of characters to choose from.\n\nHaving never played XCOM for more than an hour I can't make a fair comparison to that game, either.  However, I have played Aerena, Duelyst, and other Tactics games. This feels a lot like Aerena. But you don't know what I'm talking about, because that game is dead and nobody played it. So, basically, Aerena was a game where you built a team of characters with different stats and abilities and sent them to battle against another team in turn-based combat within a stage.\n\nNow, you take that, you give the characters more abilities (from 2 to 5) and you make it so instead of 1v1 with 4 characters per player it's 4v4 with 1 character per player. That is Atlas Reactor.\n\nON TOP OF THAT, a new gamemode has been introduced with the latest patch that lets players play a more \"traditional\" mode where players duel 1v1 with 4 characters if they feel like having their brains explode. So if you're a 1v1 purist then this game will be even more challenging than usual.\n\nAs far as I know, you unlock characters with both in-game and premium currencies but can purchase them all for a one-time payment, a la Smite.\n\nSo basically, this game is awesome and you're dumb for not playing it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504857640, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504895578, "recommendationid": "34809823", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505146", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505300960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 8846, "steamid": "76561198112365801", "num_games_owned": 105}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I wish more people played this game!\n\nIt's refreshing to find a colorful multiplayer strategy game, but yeah...
