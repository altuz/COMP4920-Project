The artwork is crisp and well-drawn (artist is peg and you can find more of their work [url=https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?id=5020]here![/url]), the score is pleasing to the ears and never feels worn out or tiring, and the sound direction is very solid. The dialogue text display is easy on the eyes by default (you can change the opacity of the dialogue text box). I would've chosen a slightly better font, but that's minor and entirely preferential. The voice actors chosen for this game (side note: not all the dialogue is voiced) are very skilled as is apparent by their work here. Not a single character felt like the VA behind them was mismatched, and a few of them absolutely shone out above the rest. The localization of the actual dialogue is also an extreme selling point. The folks at MangaGamer show genuine care for the product they are localizing for stateside release and it shows in the (verified!) high translation quality and stellar editing of the dialogue which helped give the visual novel life.\n\n[h1]WRITING[/h1]\nOnce you get past the fact that the game revolves around a pair of lesbian ghosts, the visual novel is...surprisingly grounded in reality. The characters, for the most part, are realistic without being uninteresting (a few of the characters, specifically Koba Youka, I've grown to be very fond of and am astonished at how especially good their characterization was), and the interpersonal relationships are plausible without being lackluster. I haven't read the original Japanese text, so I can't verify if it was originally written as such or if it was the (high-grade) localization that makes it seem this way, but engaging with the dialogue in this visual novel was very rewarding throughout. This all being said, there was one relationship in particular that drew some mixed reception; the teacher-student relationship. In all honesty, it was somewhat awkward and felt a bit rushed, but it was nowhere close to a dealbreaker for me.\n\n[h1]OVERALL[/h1]\nI don't read many visual novels, but I do engage with plenty of yuri media. And Kindred Spirits on the Roof is one of the finest entries in both of those categories. Do I consider it worth the $34.99? Honestly, I don't know. It does seem to be a bit on the pricier side (especially since STEINS;GATE is the same price and that's longer and more comprehensive), so on the occasional chance that this visual novel goes on sale, please do get it.

The characters all have distinct personalities and facial expressions. I got so invested in all of them. There are a few choices presented to the player throughout the game, but they don't actually affect the outcome of the story.

The intended audience is girls, but anyone who enjoys romance and cute stories will enjoy it.\n\nMy favourite character is [spoiler]Kiri[/spoiler], she gets so flustered over cuteness and her internal dialogue is so funny.

Finishing the game 100% (including reading all the extras) took me 23 hours, and I read at a pretty fast pace. There were so many different couples with problems of varying levels of complexity, but all of it felt fresh and fun. I love how closely-acquainted the reader gets to feel with all of the girls through the eyes of Yuna, and I also love how more context and background is provided for characters (in the extras) in relationships that may have felt sudden or contrived in the main story.\n\nThere were only two things that really annoyed me:\n1) The game slows down drastically every couple of minutes of gameplay--which I'm sure most reviews have already complained about. The solution for me was to save immediately and close the game before it froze completely.\n2) Some of the voices for the girls were way too squeaky for my taste. This may not be as much of an issue for someone else, but I'll just put that out there. I got by by clicking and reading quickly, though I suppose it would have been easier to just mute.\n\nAnother thing, there IS a relationship that occurs between a student and a teacher if that sort of thing really squicks anyone out. However, the teacher is very considerate and never holds her status as an adult over the student to make her do sexual things.\n\nAnyway, I love ONYS/KSOTR and all of the girls so so much. I'm ridiculously thankful that I got to live vicariously through these complex characters who struggled and overcame to share their love with their friends and girlfriends \u2665", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499904930, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499904930, "recommendationid": "33491863", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498714287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1684, "steamid": "76561198132633038", "num_games_owned": 78}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really loved this game. the sound track & the storyline are great. 9.9/10 i wish it had a button that plays thought the dialogue because it get kinda annoying having to click every time you want to contine the dialogue especially when your eating while playing it but oh well everything about the game makes up for in the end", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500279102, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500279102, "recommendationid": "33602999", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 261, "total_reviews": 265, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 4}}
