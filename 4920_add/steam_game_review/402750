Yes that might not exactly be the fault of the game as a gamepad or keyboard/mouse are simply not the optimal devices to control such machines, but there isn't any support for steering wheels and joysticks either.\nThe radio offers a wide range of awful music, but hey that's at least realistic.\nAnd the worst thing, when you are supposed to load material using an excavator this simply isn't possible because almost all material chunks you take from a pile are simply disappearing through the bucket. Now loading 250 tons (game measurement) of material in almost empty bucket loads of 3-4 tons is a quite tedious job.   \n\nAll in all this game feels like a burden and is no fun at all.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498563682, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498563969, "recommendationid": "32851848", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510492", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 52, "total_reviews": 75, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 23}}
