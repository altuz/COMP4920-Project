The Skeleton Warriors game? Well. Imagine that, but mixed with all the classic B-Movie's from the 80's and 90's that we loved. Red Sonja and Conan are not here; but there's definitely a couple of very similar counterparts who offer some stiff platforming but a very satisfying combat system, very gory and fun. It won't win ANY Game of the Years award but it is more than recommendable. It is FUN. And I think companies like this one, who even more than a year after are still correcting bugs and adding stuff to the game, deserves our full support. I can only imagine where they would take this game if a full sequel is released. \n\nBuy it!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506446147, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506446147, "recommendationid": "35226025", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513636", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505583591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2142, "steamid": "76561198267455815", "num_games_owned": 9}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I can't visit the web-sight so I'll write my complaint here.

In the 4 hours I have played since the time of writing, the game has crashed atleast 7 or 8 times. Only one of those times was I given an error (for microsoft visual C++ runtime). No way to send reports of crashes either, clearly the studio wants to know about your issues. Atleast the game saves at every milestone so not too much progress is lost.\n2. The character controls like it is on ice. Often times I find myself sliding into pits, or into those spike pits, not due to failing the obstacle, but the character failing to stop when I let go of the controls... \n\nAlso, the skeletons seem really glitchy, there was no obvious way to deal with them. They kept self reviving so I found myself kicking them to the opposite end of the room relative to the door I wanted to use and then rolling to the door and glitching the combat off so the door would activate.\n\nOveral, the combat is not very smooth (seems intentional?).
