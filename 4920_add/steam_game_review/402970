He expects the  game to increase in price when the game is released.  The full price is \u00a314.99 which I personally was  happy to pay as I love single player  roguelike shmups.   I've played the game for  several hours so far and although at times I found the game a little slow,  most of the time I throughly enjoyed playing the game.  \n\nYou  can see where enemy  ships are located  via the mini map that is provided.  The developer has promised ship to ship  encounters (i.e.  being able to board the ships and  fight your way through the enemy ship; however, at this time there is only ship to ship  fighting via the usual  lasers, photon and rocket weapons).  I've still to   find many of the promised  thirty plus weapons and  allthough I've encountered quite a few  weird and wonderful  looking ships there's  a lot i've still to discover.    There is a level editor  and in future there will be scope for  shareable moddale content, so  the potential for unlimited content if this game  becomes popular is  petty much assured.\n\nThe art style is original and IMO  excellent, with a retro feel, but without the pixillated graphics older games have.  There's a large number of enemy ship types (86 at the time of writing)  as well as friendlies that can  help defeat stronger  enemies.  The game also has RPG elements with upgreadable weapons,  ships and crew training.\n\nThis is  only  an initial overview of what I've found so far. I expect to play this game   for many more hours over the coming months and years, so will be updating this  review as and when I am able.   I will be keeping an eye on the developers updates. His last one was  31st December 2015 and prior to that about 6 weeks before release.\n\n\nYou can see some  videos of the game [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNe-0uQ2h1U][b]HERE[/b][/url],   [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN-0dMXCSW0][b]HERE[/b][/url],   [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjGBTaAG9Yg][b]HERE[/b][/url],   [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piHBlRrw0xw][b]HERE[/b][/url],   [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyT4l9oxIQU][b]HERE[/b][/url],   and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=903YZf34zA4][b]HERE[/b][/url],   \n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/402970/\n\nYou can see the  developers SpacegameJunkie Podcast  via the following:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STXqTU8YOeI\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451701941, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1451701941, "recommendationid": "20201705", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519689", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
