I paid a little over $5 for this and I still feel ripped off. The background never changes and there is only one \"enemy\", it crawls in a straight line back and forth and it dies if you jump on its head. No unkillable enemies, enemies that chase you, anything to make it a little less boring. The backdrop also never changes but I didn't mind that much at all.\n\nThe real issue I have with the game though is the camera. It is perfectly fine for levels which fit fine on your screen, but my god when the levels get taller the scrolling is horrible. It seems like every vertical movement you make the camera adjusts, there were a good few levels where I couldn't even see the only hud there is, which lets you know if you can teleport or not. Also when you die and respawn the camera starts in the middle and quickly pans down to your character, so the first third of a second is spent without your camera focused on you. It is disorienting and made my experience very bad. Also the funniest part, there's a few areas where you have to drop from the top of the level to grab a key and when you hit the ground the camera doesn't pan all the way so you can't even see where you are landing. Absolute joke.\n\nI didn't like the teleport ability that much, it was very difficult to control. It seems you can only teleport up and to the side, might just be a personal gripe but I thought it felt awkward to use and preferred the normal platforming when I could.\n\nThe normal controls were solid though, with normal movement I felt very in control of my character which is probably the only reason I completed all 40 levels.\n\nI can't see justifying this purchase if the price is anything above $2.50, there simply isn't enough content to justify spending that much money. If you are really trying to beat the game quick you can have it done anywhere between 35 - 50 minutes if you are decent at platformers.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448243259, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448243259, "recommendationid": "19227152", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539373", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477269011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561198149197055", "num_games_owned": 82}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Pros:\n+Price--I only paid 60 cents for this game with a steam coupon.

There are tons of other platformers similar to this. The only thing it adds is a teleport that moves you around through walls. The problems are that the dificulty goes up and down at random, one level is very difficult and the next is nearly tutorial. The controls aren't very tight, you slip and slide all over and the teleport is very difficult to judge how far you will go and what it decides you bumped into or not. There aren't many leves, but that is fair for the price, but the issue is that nearly none of them are very fun.

Its largely quite a solid platformer with a difficulty level I like, not too punishing but with the odd tricky spots.\n\nThat said, its very short, with quite a few levels being very similar to each other, and the teleportation isnt enough to make it stand out from being a very standard affair. (The sound also has some glitches where tracks play over each other, and the ending is just... odd.)\n\nAn hour of play in a very average platformer is simply nowhere near worth the nearly five pound entry fee.
