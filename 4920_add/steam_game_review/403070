From the murder of Agent Valdez's former partner, Sara and Valdez investigate the disappearance of a hedge fund manager, attempt to locate an informant, search a suspicious bloodstained scene at a fisheries warehouse and follow a trail of clues back at Silver Creek Falls, a college campus, a pharmaceutical company's involvement and a secret research facility as a mystery adventure with thriller and comedic references.\n\nHaving played through most of the visual novels by Sapphire Dragon Productions, I would say the plot hook and story writing for mystery is better by having interesting plot hooks and development than the romance visual novels which seem rather short and rushed in comparison. I am recommending this chapter and the entire series because I know and hope Sapphire Dragon Productions do read through and take some of the player reviews and comments seriously and will consider my suggestion to focus more on mystery storylines and also consider adding comedic references in other titles in future. This chapter is recommended when at discount or in good bundle offer with chapter 3 as the game can be finished in less than 10 hours [spoiler]and the chapter has a cliffhanger ending.[/spoiler]", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501264094, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501264094, "recommendationid": "33861299", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563091", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 25, "total_reviews": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
