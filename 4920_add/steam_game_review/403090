The levels are weaker and the game is a bit slower, but in the end, it is playable.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nIf you enjoyed the first Rescue Team, you will enjoy this sequel as well, since they are pretty much the exact same game. If you did not play it, then you might as well start with this one, because the differences are marginal: both are using the same basic time/resource manager game mechanics of ordering 1-3 workers to collect resources and clear obstacles.\n\nReturning players may find only smaller changes: the game adds a new resource type, but in practise, this only means that finally you use fuel for the rescue vehicles instead of powering them with gold doubloons. Not that you need these vehicles as often, since the task of rescuing injured citizens falls on a new unit type, doctors.\n\nThe game has one serious flaw, its level design. The developers struggled to come up with as many new stages as the first game had, so they often resorted to drawing cute pictures with the roads, hoping that the players will not notice how tedious some of those levels get. This issue was almost big enough for me to downvote the game, but in retrospect, Rescue Team 2 still managed to tether on the brink of being adequate.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494427534, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494427534, "recommendationid": "31666425", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506587", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
