We use a bunch of rescue workers to collect resources, clear obstacles, patch up ruined buildings, and save civilians. Thanks to one nice trick though, it is also a lot faster than its predecessors were: workers stay on the field a bit after completing a task, which cuts downtime significantly, resulting in a tighter, more fun gameplay. (Also, we can finally use the civilians for one-time production bursts.)\n\nThe real strength of Rescue Team 3 lies in its storyline. Many may not like its approach, but it is a refreshing change compared to the sanitised cuteness of most casual games.\nIn this game, we have to rescue the citizens of one of the most corrupt government in existence, who wilfully neglected all safety precautions to embezzle even more money. Now, they use some of that money to pay off a bunch of amoral, lazy rescue workers who spend almost as much effort looking for ways to fill their own pockets as doing their job. Yes, this game is full of cynicism and sarcasm, but in an incredibly humorous, nonsensical way, and this change alone makes it probably the best in the entire series.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497165207, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497165207, "recommendationid": "32336176", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519260", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
