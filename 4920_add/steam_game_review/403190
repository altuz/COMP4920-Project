I'd also say it had a ton of potential. The problem is, it's not in early access.  \n\nThe plethora of things that appear to be missing are at every turn. This is a base building/city-building management survival simulation on another planet. Certainly I should be able to direct my workers instead of let the questionable AI do or not do what I prioritize AT ALL despite having excess resources to be processed. Let alone hire specific ones to be placed into humanities expansion into the galaxy. \n\nMore specifically, There is no way to select or hire and make a distinction between workers, biologists, engineers or medics. The only way is to manipulate it by selecting a percentage want within the landing restrictions and turning the power on or off from the landing pads. Even then you may get more or less than you wanted unless you get really meticulous and change the wants to 100% per type of employee. Even THEN you still run the risk of how many coming off the transport not being what you anticipated. Short things short; oxygen isn't readily available and you have a limited supply of power to create it. It'd be nice to be able to regulate who visits my station. \n\nYou have two main power methods. Solar panels and wind turbines. Now, I didn't get past the frozen planet biome-esk thing. There is also a gas giant and storm biome-esk location. I only bring this up because it'd be interesting to have to deal with a location without an atmosphere and I'm not sure if there is a location I missed. As once the star of whatever solar system this game takes place in hides under the horizon to warm the other side of the planet all you have is your battery backup and turbines to provide oxygen, water and electricity to the station throughout the night. The consequences in failure to procure these things should be quite apparent. \n\nEach biome you build, be it a canteen, laboratory, airlock, sick bay, or a hydroponics farm \u2013 as far as the interior/environmental controlled ones \u2013 are all hemispheres. Connected by tunnels; there is no way expand the rooms except for building them large to begin with or completely destroying and then rebuilding them. It makes for this ostensibly never ending network of tunnels. For some of the areas that would make sense, especially for crops needing a different environment to prosper. However, none of that is in this game. All the biomes are exactly the same. External constructs need a pathway, logically for wiring or plumbing. \n\nYou can prioritize certain things to be constructed, though to what end I'm not sure. Specifically, I had a bunch of ore from the mines I wanted processed into metal so I could expand. I had 6 engineers that [i]could[/i] have done that processing at any point but they just didn't. I prioritized that biome and nothing came of it. This happened as well for bio-plastic created from starch. No processing was to be had from the AI even though it was prioritized. Additionally, if you have different crops, or fabricators that build different things within the same biome you can not prioritize them separately without constructing an entirely different biome and constructing the devices therein appropriately.\n\nNow, here is my [b]BIGGEST[/b] complaint. You'd think, you would [i]certainly[/i] think that on a remote planetary expedition that you'd be able to set a clock. A schedule. A regime. When certain biomes are on or off for the conservation of power/oxygen/water. When specific employees are to be working and where. If not just the specific type of employee. At no point can you even use a logistics screen to have certain resources stored in certain places or to be processed in a closer biome. The AI runs it all and it does a poor job at that. \n\n[i][b]THE GIST\nLike I said up front, if this were early access I'd say I can't wait to see what's next. But this is out; it's even been updated after v1.0.

Planetbase takes everything I like from these kinds of games, and puts a new twist on it by making the base be on different kinds of planets, each with their own dangers. At first the game was rather difficult for me, as I was trying to figure out how to balance food production with the number of colonists in my base without overworking my people. I love this game as when you solve one bottleneck, another one shows up; it keeps you on your feet. For some people that would probably be rather annoying, but I find it rather true to real life, which is why I enjoy it.\n\nThe only building I wish that was in the game presently was a hallway extender so that you don't have to build another building in order to extend your base in a certain direction. I also wish that you could add more connections between buildings. Also, if I recycle a building, I usually am not able to put the same building back in the same spot. \n\nThose things mentioned above though don't detract from the overall gameplay, they would just be niceties which may come with time.
