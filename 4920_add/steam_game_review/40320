Armour values on tanks are completely fictitious. Graphics are poor. Difficulty levels are obscene. Most (maybe all) scenarios have time limits, a pet hate of mine in RTS games. Voice acting dreadful. Appears unpolished, unfinished and unprofessional.\n\nIt is SO crap that not even the title here on the Steam Store / Library and the title of the game itself match. You see it as \"Rush for Berlin\" here? In the actual game it's name changes to \"Rush for the Bomb\"! This is the *GOLD* version? Jesus!\n\nCheap it may be, but still it is a complete waste of money. Avoid."}]}
