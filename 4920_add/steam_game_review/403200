The response from dreamatrix was \"saltmummy626 0.4 hrs on record, you actually have no clue what we changed inside.\" I have comitted another three or so hours to LoDR, and am ready to say that \"yes, I do have a clue of what you changed, and that is hardly anything at all.\" and so, my review remains, except for this paragraph, unchanged. It's easier to push negative reviews under the rug when it looks like people have hardly touched the game I guess. Read on potential buyer, and you'll get what I mean.\n\nTHE COMMUNITY-DEVS\nLegends of dawn is a game made about two or so years ago. Two or so years of empty promises and exagerated claims on the part of dreamatrix caught up with them in the sheer number of negative reveiws their barely functioning framework had garnered. One day, fairly recently, they decided that they would slap \"reborn\" on the title and re-release it and take down the games older listing. By the way, taking down the games older listing also took down the negative reviews and the amount of time played by the negative reveiwers, which was undoubtedly the plan all along.\n\nThe community around this game is mostly made up of dissatisfied customers regularly getting banned and thrown out of the games forums and steam community page, and a very small, caustic, sect of zealous fans. Moderators and the developers on the forums and community hub for this game are unhelpful and downright unfriendly, especially towards people with complaints or bug reports. \"We are a small studio.\" is the go to excuse for dreamatrix when it comes to serious bugs, disregarding the fact that other smaller studios have made far superior games with fewer horrendous bugs.\n\nTHE GAME ITSELF\nThe game itself? It is almost a complete copy paste of the \"old\" version. same game, very few changes. Same ability to devour your computers memory and run poorly regardless of it's power and the games outdated graphics. Same stock sound effects and music which is suspiciously similar to music from other games. Same awful character creator with the same races (Human, Elf, Ferengi.) Same equipment peices which are no better than other equipment peices (a steel helmet still gives the same defense as a cloth hat.) Same abymsal voice acting. Same miniscule FOV. Same enemies which detonate hilariously when they are killed. Same NPCs who do not care that a stranger is in their home, stealing their underwear. Same Same Same. The only \"improvement\" I saw was a change to the games already fairly creative lockpicking system and magic system. Some other changes I saw were the massively reduced inventory size and reworked crafting. Both of which work together to make the experiance slightly more unpleasant. Oh yeah, another change? even though this is the same as the old one, they somehow have the audacity to raise the price a full 10$. maybe that doesnt sound like a lot, but 30$ is a hell of a lot to pay for a product as shoddy as this. Even if it were free, you would still be paying too much. I only wish I could find the backup I made of the old reveiw so I could repost it here, becuase everything in it still stands.\n\nSome stuff from the games description on the store page.\n- Legends of Dawn Reborn is a 64-bit ONLY title. Streaming technology enables playing without any loading screens. All data seamlessly loads in background- except there are loading screens. They suddenly appear when you travel long distances, a bit like the little bar that said \"loading\" which would appear at the bottom of the screen in morrowind, except LoDs is a splash screen and not an unobtrusive bar.\n\n- Expandable huge inventory with bags with item stacking and sorting- well item stacking is a nice new feature, but you still collect a large amount of valueless junk which uses up that small \"upgradable\" space pretty quick.\n\n- A completely new informative tooltips with all data about single item type, including runes, potions and spells; Important data about magic level, crafting etc.- screen filling, and confusing. There is such a thing as \"too much information.\" also, these tooltips will compare your weapon to your food for some bizarre reason, which just takes up twice as much screen real estate.\n\n- Additional combat animations- Not really, no.\n\n- Major upgrade with keyboard and mouse navigation - A Bald faced lie, the controls are exactly the same.\n\n- With full freedom, explore hundreds of unique locations;- If you don't get stuck on the geometry and have to load your game that is. It's pretty easy to do too, the pathfinding is prehistoric and youll clip into objects you are trying to interact with, and get stuck in them and even though you are stuck on the container, you still won't be able to open it becuase you aren't positioned right.\n\n- Hundreds of types of wild creatures and monsters that drop loads of loot;- eh. Don't you know? Creature variants don't actually count as another creature type. just becuase you change the color and size, it doesn't mean you have made a new creature.\n\n- Legends of Dawn is no longer supported or available for purchase;- Except for an extra ten bucks on this store page. \"Look, we put \"Reborn\" in the title! that means it's a whole new game right?\"\n\n- If you already purchased LoD do not buy this LoD Reborn, you are qualified to get it free of charge.- Just their way of making it look less like a scam.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\nDo not buy, do not buy, DO NOT BUY!\nIf you really MUST buy this game, than all I can say is: Welcome to the septic tank, thank god steam offers refunds now.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445488989, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445934852, "recommendationid": "18620998", "language": "english", "votes_down": 29, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.713938", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446876145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8, "steamid": "76561198002971991", "num_games_owned": 236}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 32, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Absolutely do NOT buy this game. It is a scam. I am not stating that ironically, or to be malicious; this game is unequivocally the buggiest, most poorly managed, poorly updated, and awful piece of garbage that has graced Steam's greenlight program.\n\nBUT, for the sake of a review, lets discuss why.\n\nEntire subsystems and 'class mechanics' dont work.\nPathing is a nightmare, and its possible to get stuck in terrain, path through cliffs and never be able to walk back up them, etc. You can die from falling a foot, and die from falling in water.\nTextures and meshes seeming load in and out of the camera's view randomly. Entire houses will pop up around you, or disappear entirely as you're walking into them.\nProgression is entirely arbitrary. Items are random, quests may or may not work depending on the alignment of the stars, \"dialogue\" is schizophrenic and characters will seemingly have entirely random or baseless reactions to spoken text.\nSkill progression and pseudo-class progression is trivial and unimaginative. (The only exception being the ability to craft magic)\nThe graphics are abysmal, character models, NPCs, and monsters appear to have been created using software from 1998.\nThe camera and movement controls are horrifically limited. The camera will only allow about a 620x480 field of view, no matter the resolution you're attempting to play it in.\nAnything and everything can be locked, and the 'rune' system to unlock ANYTHING is never explained and so convoluted theres multiple sections of the manuel that attempt to cover it.\nThe storyline is non-existent.\nThe game has hardware and technical issues, crashes, buggy meshes / textures, etc, etc.\nInventory and item management is a chore, and I had found myself not even bothering to loot drops at a certain point.\n\nI can go on. Honestly, I havent even listed half of the things wrong with this travesty of a title, but hopefully this will suffice. AVOID. THIS. TITLE.\n\nI dont even hate the developers, im sure they're great people. Im sure they're nice and loving and wonderful individuals. However, they have produced one of the absolute worst titles to ever hit steam, and I cannot in good faith recommend this to anyone. Seriously.\n\nDont even buy this for 50 cents. This game is going to go down in history as the next E.T. for the Atari. There's going to just be a virtual landfill with Legends of Dawn (Reborn) and anyone's wallet that accidentally purchased this title.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446876167, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446877421, "recommendationid": "18923617", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528105", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446599849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 312, "steamid": "76561198052385248", "num_games_owned": 121}, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 38, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I wanted to give this game a second chance, but once again was disapointed.\n\nMy computer overheats everytime I launch the game  even on Low setting, which looks like S,,,,,t \n\n\nMy Rig:\n\nIntel Core I5-3570 CPU 3.4GHz\n16 Gb Memory\nGTX 660", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445552793, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445562461, "recommendationid": "18631231", "language": "english", "votes_down": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527924", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446311835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 261, "steamid": "76561198041818023", "num_games_owned": 1799}, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 26, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I felt kind of bad for Legends of Dawn.

Is terrible. I got *this* 'for free' by buying the non-reborn version.

Running into a quest element exploring the world will often put you at that point in the quest so when you get back people are talking as if you've accomplished something you have no idea about. Crafting is awful. Recipes are needed for everything and there's no recipe book. Plus they can disappear out of your inventory so you lose the ability to make the components you need (you need to craft components for most, if not all, weapon and armour crafting). There are a number of holes in the terrain and a number of spots that are crab traps (you can walk in easily but good luck getting out) that have no reason for existing. Infinite falls are a risk when walking between two things at different heights. Monsters will be unlootable if they're at a higher elevation than you are since they'll sink into the terrain and be unclickable.\n\n\nThere's more but that's enough.

And I have played both the original, and have started to play the \"reborn\" version (and I say that lightly, because like many others have said, not much has changed.)\n\nMy biggest gripe, and some would see this as something not worth griping about, is movement, or travelling, etc.  It takes a dog's age to get anywhere!  There is no \"fast travelling\".  Then add that to the already slow and clunky moving character, and well.  Hope you're up for long journeys from A to B.\n\nWhich leads me to my next gripe.  There is absolutely no quest markers, at all.  What kind of adventurer would go out on a quest and not mark their map in some way so that they know where they should go, where they should look, and who to return to once the objective is complete?  You can easily spend several hours just trying to figure out who it was that gave you what quests, and where the heck you're supposed to even go to begin, let alone finish... oh, and once you do figure it out, it takes FOREVER to get there and back again.\n\nDon't get me wrong.
