This game really is beautiful, both visually and accoustically.\n\nBe aware that's it's a very short game, even including replaying it to see all the different routes. It can feel slow when going after completion, since you will be repeating scenes which take their own sweet time to unfold. Emphasis on the \"peaceful\" I mentioned at the beginning. You're on a sweet, strange little journey around your corner of the ocean, not on a swashbuckling adventure.\n\nThe controls were the only part of the experience I found unpleasant. They were definitely intended for a touch screen, not for a mouse (certainly no keyboard!), since the only ways to interact with the world are tapping, holding, and dragging.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505039286, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505039286, "recommendationid": "34858494", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 32, "total_reviews": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 11}}
