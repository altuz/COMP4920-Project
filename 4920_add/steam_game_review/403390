I can't say that I had much fun playing Undercover Missions.\n\nThe story suffers from a rough English translation. There's quite a bit of engrish and nonsensical sentences in this game. All of which is voice acted rather blandly and monotone. Even when things get exciting. Our heroine sounds like she is about to fall asleep.\n\nFrankly, I can't say much about the story because it didn't make much sense to me. All I got out of the plot was that someone wants to blow up this sub for some reason and yeah they are on the sub. Maybe a lot of the story was lost in the translation. Perhaps it's better in German. Also it seems like a lot of the minor plot lines are forgotten about. That whole bit about your missing partner isn't talked about much. Hell only the steam description really talks about it.\n\nAs for the puzzles. I found them to be very frustrating and I mean frustrating in a bad early 90s adventure game way. There is a fair bit of moon logic in this game. Most of the number based puzzles in this game have to brute forced through. I can't say I find it fun having to trying a dozen different number combinations until I chance on the right one. Also, key items are often hidden in places that you have already checked before. Or worse are in places that make no sense but are only reviled after clicking on it a bunch of times. To me it seems like the dev just threw stuff around haphazardly. Likewise, there are a lot of red herrings in this game. You'll pick up a fair bit of items and interact with a number things that seem important or useful but aren't.  \n\nAt the end of the day. I spent most of my time in this game reclicking on everything. Unsure of what to do and where to go. I just didn't have a fun time here. \n\nOver all I know this is an indie game. But even as indie this game feels cheap and unfinished. The ending doesn't make any sense and the story goes nowhere. While the puzzles are just frustrating. Maybe this game would be better with a walkthrough. But I don't think anyone has made one yet.

However, after finishing the game and realizing they must have run out of money at the end, I wish they had gone the 2D route and invested more in story development. \nPuzzles are the bread and butter of any adventure gamer.

Items just suddenly appear out of nowhere, after some trigger has occured. They appear in places you could never have suspected. There could be a locker, or a cabin, in which you looked 10 times and never had the game told you something was there. But then, after an arbitrary trigger, something is in there.
