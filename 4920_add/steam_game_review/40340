The story isn't fully fleshed or in any way intricate, but rather a bit shallow and simplified. One can't help to think that they could've done a lot more to get a more fully story told, but I still found it entertaining enough.\n\nIt's an old game now, and it shows through looking at the characters, several backdrops and the cutscenes. Several are a bit blurry and low on detail. However, some backdrops looks a bit sharper. Anyway, it probably looked damn good when it came out, and it doesn't look half bad today. That is acceptable.\n\nThe voice acting is overall ok, but it lacks a bit emotion and suspence. There are several tongue-in-cheek comments from the main characters that sometime works and sometimes don't. It is hard to tell at times if the game takes itself seriously or not.\n\nFiguring out the puzzles in this game was entertaining enough, with proper clues given and mostly quite logical solutions. Sometimes, though, they felt a bit cheap and out of context. The locations you go to are also mostly interesting.\n\nThe game as a whole seems based on a good foundation, but a bit rushed and inconsistent. The coincidences within the story is a bit too much to swallow. I'm sure it is probably based on time and budget like most others. Either way it is still entertaining enough to enjoy if you are into these sorts of things.\n\nI also played the first in the series and enjoyed that one as well. There are a few references to the previous game but you certainly don't need to play that one to enjoy this. It is a whole seperate storyline.\n\nI can absolutely recommend this game for fans of point'n'click adventure games and for people who like a bit of mystery. If you're not into these types of games to begin with, it is probably not going to change your mind.\n\nI rate it 6/10, because it has aged a bit and has that thin storyline. If I had played it when it came out and rated it at the time it might have been rated a bit higher.\n\nAs always. If you are looking into buying this, don't base your decision on this review alone. Others-, any your opinion might differ from mine.\n\nHappy gaming :o)\n\nTJ"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492341820, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501788", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31176085", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198083289730", "num_reviews": 90, "last_played": 1492341704, "num_games_owned": 1265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 699}, "timestamp_updated": 1492341820, "received_for_free": false, "review": "As with the previous game \"Secret Files 1\" I had a blast with this one as well, the game is very divers in scenery, has a great plot, nice puzzles, great diversity of chars with very decent speach actors and also some funny references to the first part.\nAll in all again a gem of a game, highly recommended!"}]}
