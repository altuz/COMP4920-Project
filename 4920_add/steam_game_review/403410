Okay.\n\nIf, on your computer, you want to play Ms. Pac-Man EXACTLY as it appeared in the arcade with very few frills or fringe benefits (other than a few steam awards and some fun alternate settings which, incidentally, will prevent you from earning any steam awards if you modify them away from their default paramaters) then this game is for you.\n\nHowever, even given what it attempts to achieve, this game is far from perfect. The system requirements for this game are stupidly high given what this game allows you to do and it says nothing about whether the game is designed to run on a smart phone (which would be cool if it does). Why does Ms. Pac-Man need 2000 megabytes of RAM? Why does it need at least a 2.3 Ghz processor? These system specs are completely insane for a game of such utter simplicity.\n\nSure, this game runs fine on my computer but that's entirely missing the point. Ms. Pac-Man should have been designed to run fine on ANY remotely modern electronic device which has any kind of screen and some sort of controls. The fact that the game designers didn't purposefully attempt to reach a far wider audience (all phone users which exist) is baffling and absurd. This version's designers simply weren't ambitious enough and somehow caused this game to have system requirements which were completely undreamt of when this game first came out (the year 1982) and that seems to me to be either a little crazy or very lazy.\n\nI wish this game's requirements simply said \"Any electronic device which has any kind of operating system which has been made since the year 1990.\" That would have been a cool programming achievement to attempt but Nooo! The makers of this version didn't even try to get close to that fairly obvious concept. What's next in the future, a classic version of Ms. Pac-Man that requires two GTX Titans? Or worse still, a quantum computer?", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506754998, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506755642, "recommendationid": "35325984", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 26, "total_reviews": 32, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 6}}
