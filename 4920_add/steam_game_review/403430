Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bullets at and attempting to crash into them. In later stages, some enemies even break from an entering group in a frantic attempt to crash into the player. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost by colliding with an enemy, being hit by an enemy shot, or being captured.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505567918, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505567918, "recommendationid": "34996767", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507194450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 134, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 186, "steamid": "76561198034986387", "num_games_owned": 27}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Classic, nice interface.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506233068, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506233068, "recommendationid": "35172023", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505537490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 20, "steamid": "76561198060972855", "num_games_owned": 301}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Galaga, Pac-Man, Ms. Pac Man and Dig Dug where great in the \"Galaxy of Games\" arcade I used to visit frequently as a kid.
