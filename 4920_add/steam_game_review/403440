I know you don't mean any buttons on my controller because there's no support for that, so I make a good guess, hit enter, and am rewarded with success: new game, load game, or options. there actually are no options; two separate volume controls and a window size control. don't think about rebinding keys because it isn't happening for you. oh, and if you hit escape from the second menu, it pings helpfully and superimposes the \"PRESS TO START\" command over it. awesome.\n\nanyway, start the game. it has some control instruction which is handled very straightforwardly by flatly scrawling it across the screen with a \"hit h to toggle\" command, so at least there's no mystery here; hit space to jump, and... s a i l across the screen like Luigi from Mario 2 just stepping out of a moonlander. mein gott, is the control and movement intended to be this mushy or is the game just that painfully laggy? my machine runs Skyrim on ultra-high quality with no problem; it handles Risk of Rain on Monsoon dfficulty three or four loops in, no problem... if this is bogging me down it's the game, not the computer, and that's assuming that isn't just ... how this game plays. the store page video didn't really shed any light on it either. the combat seems like it could be good but the opioid languor with which it proceeds makes it impossible to tell. oh yeah, and that other basic I mentioned above? there's no pause. inventory doesn't pause; it just obscures a still-active screen with the inventory (a decision other games than this have made, granted, and which I fail to understand in any context outside of online play). map doesn't pause either; it doesn't provide a map - oh no, it takes you TO an overworld map, the existence of which was not hinted at beforehand and which ends your progress in the level it dumps you in at the start. and escape... well, escape just pings stupidly and achieves nothing.\n\nso in summary I cannot recommend this game without some serious fixing; it seems like a kernel of a good idea executed very frustratingly.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446422478, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446801606, "recommendationid": "18827913", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519668", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447889039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 45, "steamid": "76561198241309916", "num_games_owned": 29}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": "2", "review": "PROS:\nNice 2d pixel art. \nResponsive controls\n\nCONS:\nVEERRRRRY BUGGY (seems unfinished)\nGets repetitive after awhile\n\nHopefully it will get better after they fix some of the glitches", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442530632, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1442530632, "recommendationid": "18077178", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510162", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1450912835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 293, "steamid": "76561198264087874", "num_games_owned": 62}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This seems like it was designed for console and kindof spit out on PC.

Strange that they have you use Q+W to attack, E to block. Basic default typically is WASD (or arrows with Z+X for attack). Whatever happened to configuring your own controls, just something to think about when designing games. A gamepad would have been nice on this, too bad. It has a good concept but the bugs need major reworking (ie. hitboxes are off, blocking works 50/50). Also the hazards are too tight together, meaning you jump avoiding one spike to hit the other. If the general idea is to progress by trial and error then it needs to in my opinion gradually work you into it and not such a high chance for failure. I'm just nit picking now but the tracklist could be widened, it's literally one track on loop. You have three screen modes: small, large and full screen.\n\nIf it was in EA I would give it more grace but it's just a pretty high price for something that is hardly playable due to bugs and is supposively feature complete.
