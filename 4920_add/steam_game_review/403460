I really don't mind losing that much against most of the characters (especially not the mysterious Jessica) but there is something about that artistocrat smugness that really gets to me. I'll keep at it though, honing my skills until I become the ultimate SkyScrapper. And then Phileas... then I'll hunt you down. And I will kill you.\n\nSeriously though, get a bunch of friends with controllers over and this is great competitive fun (even if you lose).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444985658, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444985658, "recommendationid": "18499216", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505180", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482894000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561198021262801", "num_games_owned": 205}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "At first, SkyScrappers looked like a lot of fun for a couch gaming session with friends, but it is more like gambling with friends, because the only thing you do is button smashing for attacks.
