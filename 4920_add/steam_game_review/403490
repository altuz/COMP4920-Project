Creative ideas. Unfortunately most of them feel rushed. My guess is zero funding. I feel the pain of indie developers. Creating games which require a great deal of time for little to no money. \n\nRandom thoughts:\n\n1.) Bands mixed with monster level scaling to the player. The system IMO revolutionizes what it means to group in an MMO. Other games can learn from this. Any level player can group with any other level player and enjoy the same content because monsters scale to the unique player. Bands earn points per kill to spend on various things. The entire idea is amazing. I hope other devs see this and get inspired.\n\n2.) The loot system and stats overall. Items range from +0 to +10 and the possibility of more stats but rare. Unfortunately, the combat and character building was so simplistic. Combat consisted of spamming 1 ability. So itemizing around such a simple system was pointless.\n\n3.) On-use leveling and losing progress if you respec is a huge no no. Time investment lost because someone wants to try other skills. \n\n4.) The game tries to be a sandbox but ultimately feels like a themepark game that throws you into a linear story line. I think the game woulda benefitted from being a full-on sandbox with no skill limitations and a large open world, especially how the banding works and treasure maps etc... Being a linear quest game makes most of the cool features feel lackluster.\n\nOverall, a game that has/had huge potential. Seems like there is zero funding so I would guess \"had\" potential.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445004927, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445004927, "recommendationid": "18503406", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514348", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445158757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 14, "steamid": "76561198006535739", "num_games_owned": 405}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "3", "review": "Let us look at this in perspective, for a moment. A small indie team made an actually decent experience that works as intended most of the time. To that end, it's better than a lot of stuff on steam.

I got murdered in one hit by a monster my level. \n  [*] The game is positively begging you for money at every turn. Strong boxes need purchased keys, avatars need buying, and even premium classes. This starts on tutorial island and does not stop.\n  [*] The level design feels directionless and meandering. \n  [*]  No real game tutorial for a new combat system\n[/list]\n\nDid they achieve something pretty cool? Yeah, actually, they did. Is it worth paying money for? Well, see, I have a rule. If you're charging me for the game up front, you don't get to ask for microtransactions.

There is a lot to do, sometimes it feels like too much. As well as the general main quest progression with associated side quests you have challenge areas and player dungeons, most of which dynamically match the player\u2019s level. Combat and quests are relatively simple. Combat is turn based and quests usually follow along the lines of kill x monsters or get y drops from monsters. There is a good crafting system in place and various standard to decent loot drops from mobs. You are able to spend skill points to not only learn new active powers but also new base skills \u2013 these new skills are available to anyone no matter what class you pick to start out. \nThe thing that most people seem to not like about this game is the in app purchases/micro transactions. Thing is they are not really necessary to make. Yes some of them can be of use, especially in the early game, but most of the really good stuff I have has come through game play not purchases. \nThis game is well supported by a very dedicated Dev how always seems to be around, unlike many bigger, more expensive titles. Yes there are issues such as limited customisation regarding you look etc, but for a game that costs less than \u00a32 I don\u2019t see that as an issue!\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446133245, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446133245, "recommendationid": "18743995", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "4.993758", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1454510134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 8, "steamid": "76561197999075859", "num_games_owned": 666}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "review": "So here's the deal, Deccy's been making games for over a decade now, basically just him and an artist or two. First I played Forlorn Hope Online in 2003 (still wishing he'd re-release it), a web-based game with a 2d grid map in the top corner and everything done thru menues basically with character represented by static icons. Next came Land of Hope online, basically the same thing, but level-by-use skills (one of the first games I ever saw use this) instead of skill points every level, and a huge combat/skill overhaul that basically removed a certain overpowered mechanic. \n\nThen he started with his first game that used moving sprites and stuff, like a snes game. Then another game kinda like FH:o and LoH, and now this one. \n\nHere's the thing -- apart from the seriously outdated micro-transaction system ( even tho I've spent about 400 USD on LoH, and I think around 70 on this one, maybe 70 more on one I can't remmeber the name of, and these were all free to play at the time), the map is boring, the sprites and their animations are not only ugly, but they have nothing to do with gear as well. Pick one sprite and you'll have a bow in hand as you kill things with a sword and fireblasts. The combat is an uninteresting take on old JRPG turn based formulae, and you pick skills at the start that you level thru use, but lose progress if you repec. \n\nThere's a couple good reviews that cover the good bits of this game, and Deccy's ideas are always interesting but -- as much as I want to like this game, I just can't. As outdated as Lands of Hope is, and as much as it can really boil down to \"fill your crafting queue, kill things for 5 minutes, repeat\" .. . for 1000 levels (and 10000 sublevels after that!)  . . . it's a fun bit of nostalgia for people who remember that kind of period in web-gaming, and the micro-transactions are much better balanced compared to this game (read: the only reason to pay for anything, even expansion content, is if you feel like it -- cause the expansion content is basically all just new mobs to grind for their rare drops, to turn in for quests).\n\nI love Deccy's stuff, and in the interest of seeing more of it I recommend buying this game -- but I can't recommend the game, as interesting as it is, as cool as some of the ideas are -- Deccy has always been good at having new gameplay ideas a couple years ahead of the gaming industry, but it's high time he learned from the industry when it comes to monetization, and I'd really like to see a project that had an aesthetic that could have a broader appeal. This game looks fine on Kongregate, but it's embaressing on its own, or on steam. \n\nUgh, I kinda hate myself for this review, so I'll reiterate a point -- seriously, go play Lands of Hope (just google it), you'll find rabbit hole you might take months to crawl out of -- and do give this game a try if you can spare a couple pounds/bucks/whatever--- it has some really interesting ideas that may be turning up elsewhere in the future (once one person has an idea, it's out there, it'll turn up again eventually).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454511471, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454511471, "recommendationid": "20932680", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503748", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445223005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21, "steamid": "76561198008558539", "num_games_owned": 365}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "In-app purchases.
