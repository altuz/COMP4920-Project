The voice acting in general was very good I thought, some of the chinese characters sounded a bit too cartoonish for my liking. \n\nThe game is a standard point and click,and solve logic puzzles by combing and clicking on unlikley objects affair.... however one hurdle is you often have to examine things that seem straight forward in the inventory to find a second item hidden within...so if you get stuck try this.\n\nOverall a suprsingly fun little adventure game that pays homage to film noir and Indiana Jones-esque adventures.I got this on a steam sale for an INSANE $2.49 but honestly its probably worth full price... my only major gripe is some of the music is really annoying. \n\nAnyways I give it a 7 out meh... :)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501681233, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33971268", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197997355562", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1501681161, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 477}, "timestamp_updated": 1501681233, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Got this game on special for $3\n\nTotal 8 hours gameplay\n\nReminded me on old Indiana Jones games\n\nWorth it."}]}
