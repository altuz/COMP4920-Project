I wanted to try this one, published (it's the keyword) by Artifex Mundi on Steam. And you can't see that it's not them that developed it.\n\nYour role is to search who is the hooded man that is trying to bring back giants on Earth (or into that magical world, choose what you want). Based on the fairy tale \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", you're going to search for beans, guardians, a traitor and a way to save Jack and stop that terrible plan.\n\nWhile the story is good - I enjoyed it, the gameplay only suffers of some well-hidden objects. But that's where the frustration begins. I rarely hit the hint button during a HO game. In fact, I refrain myself to do it in a game with achievements included. Unfortunately, I was forced here to do it because of these needed items to advance in the story. And it's the same for the HO scenes. There is also a lot of objects that need to be \"repaired\", making you go slower for the achievement where you have to find everything under a minute. You will probably unlock it in a second playthrough, after keeping somewhere in your head their locations.\n\nAnd while the graphics are really correct, though not transcending, I was disappointed in the soundtrack: I already heard it in another HO. Yet, well, it's a good track.\n\nAnother thing with the gameplay is that it's different in the main game and in the bonus chapter. The main game is showing you a list of items to find from a scene to another to build what you need - and these items become clickable when you find the use for them. The bonus chapter is more behaving like any other HO game: you don't need to find that this item will help you to click on it, you can collect it without the knowledge.\n\nWhile I'll recommend the game, I'll advise you to get it with a discount - I don't think it's worthy of 10 bucks. The -40% discount for the launch was already a better price but this game will probably drop lower, so I suggest you to wait until it's 2 or 3 bucks.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444480016, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1444480016, "recommendationid": "18410636", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509199", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1481568613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 379, "steamid": "76561198195170475", "num_games_owned": 33}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This will be a slightly new interface for those of you who follow Artifex Mundi.

There's also an odd inventory system where, in order to do anything, you need to find multiple objects throughout the environment to build any object needed.  It essentially makes the inventory system into mini-hidden object games, and becomes the primary gameplay of the game.  What's strange is that this system is abandoned in the bonus chapter for a conventional inventory system, and makes it feel somewhat arbitrary, as if the game developers ran out of money to program the entire game as intended.   The bonus chapter also features more hidden object scenes than the full game.\n\nIt's not a bad game, and some of the inventory/hidden object puzzles are pretty tough.  But for whatever reasons, perhaps as a result of a rather thin and uninspired storyline, the game feels pretty underwhelming.  It's also a short game.
