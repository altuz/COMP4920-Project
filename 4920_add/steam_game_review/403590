A serious disgrace to the unreal engine. From afar it looks like a good game but as soon as you either buy it or check some reviews, it doesn't hold so strong. Believe the bad reviews, the game is a buggy mess of a concept and executed horribly. I bought me and my brother this and it kicked me out for various errors about 3 times, also on 1 of the 2 maps ONLY, there is horrible unplayable desync. I would recommend waiting until the devs either get thier crap together, or actually fix the game.\n\n+ Good concept\n+ Large open world\n\n- So many bugs\n- Desync\n- Executed badly\n- No options menu\n- Bad optimization\n- Pointless VR\n\nOverall i'd say a 2/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500095493, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500095702, "recommendationid": "33551673", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526443", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499545387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198155033948", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's a great concept but way too glitchy to play, i waited a few months with high hopes they'd fix it in patches but it's still unplayable & now it's way too late for a steam refund, awesome.

As a game developer myself I know the struggles between thinking of a good game and making it a reality so I may be a bit different minded than the average gamer however I feel this game is enough fun even if it has a few bugs and issues. \n\nWhat this game is :\n\nFun \nHilarious to play with friends\nFairly easy to get in to\nDifferent from the generic shooter or free to play mmo\nUnique, I haven't seen any game do this before and I probably won't see many more in my lifetime\n\nWhat this game isn't :\n\nBug free (they are working on the game of course)\nAAA (the graphics are nice but weirdly demanding)\nThe best game ever (yet xD)\n\nHere are some reasons I would suggest buying this game for yourself and in some cases friends as well :\n\nYou want a game to mess around in where you can drive like a maniac and rob houses - Tick\nYou and a friend/friends are bored of shooting people in other games and want something different - Tick\nYou want to play something with a more authentic lock picking system than 90% of games - Tick (I lock pick from time to time with a decent kit and some amazingly nice locks)\n\n\nAnyway, I hope I have given a decent review of this title and I hope to see the game completed.\n(Bonus points to the developers if they add a lockpick gun, cos straight up if anyone was gonna rob houses for a living they would spend the extra 5 quid to get a faster entrance xD)\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500752494, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500752494, "recommendationid": "33728286", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490421", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498282436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 59, "steamid": "76561198178681515", "num_games_owned": 84}, "votes_funny": 7, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This game is so glitchy that I started to get achivement progress before it was even doen installing... 10 outa 10 best game of the century", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500050397, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500050397, "recommendationid": "33539606", "language": "english", "votes_down": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488061", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 55, "total_reviews": 110, "num_reviews": 6, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 55}}
