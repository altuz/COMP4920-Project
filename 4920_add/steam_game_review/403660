I got bored around ten minutes in, lost further interest by sixty minutes, and had mostly decided to refund before I reached ninety minutes, but I played out until just shy of two hours because I wanted the game to become fun. It never did.\n\nI believe that the core problem with Omnipresent is the fact that the developer had much bigger dreams than his (it seems to be a one-man game) skills could complete. There are a lot of mechanics and interactions that COULD be really fun, but end up being really boring.\n\nThe stock market: It fluctuates WILDLY from second to second. Stocks can change by hundreds of dollars in the blink of an eye. Of course, you can drop any stock to near-zero just by hacking the relevant site, buy at almost nothing, and sell for everything. The only problem is that you keep getting blocked and having to pay money to unlock your trading account -- which isn't fun or challenging (when you make 3 million per sale of stock, paying 3 million for an unlock still results in obscene profits), it's annoying.\n\nThe hacking minigames: There are two. One is supposed to be timing-based, where you press the right key at the right time. Or you can spam lots of keys all the time and get 90% of the way done, without even pressing some of the right keys at all. The other is just outright spam keyboard mash. Niether of these are fun mechanics.\n\nThe hacking overmap game: There are these little enemy bubbles that wander around the map. Hack when they're nearby, and you get detected. Hack when they're far away and you don't get noticed at all. This isn't fun. You can just wait for them to wander off and then hack whatever you want. Sometimes they don't wander off, and you sit there bored.\n\nThe in-game browser: A neat idea, but having all the sites being \"blocked by NSO\" or otherwise redacted is no fun.\n\nThe objectives are sometimes unclear (Being asked to hack CTI to get a \"special software\" with no dialogue or explanation that CTI stands for the California Institute of Technology.)\n\nThe e-mail autoresponses are idiotic, where sending a mission success e-mail with required data is replied with a payment and \"So-and-so is unavailable.\"\n\nThere's never any overmap pressure. You're never being rushed to do things. Any time your detection risk gets a bit high you can wait for the NSO or MIHQ to **** off and the risk to drop, and in a few minutes you'll be right as rain. Never a downside.\n\nI think the final straw was when I started being able to hack the NSO and MIHQ and all of a sudden the \"fun\" mechanic of tracking viruses started. Oh no! I have to click EVERY GODDAMN SPOT OF THE INTERNET TO FIND VIRUSES, THEN CLICK REMOVE. AND THERE ARE FIFTEEN. THIS IS A WASTE OF GODDAMN TIME AND ITS NO FUN AT ALL.\n\nI'm sorry, but Uplink is simply a better hacking game, with more fun mechanics. And if the play-as-AI is your love, there's an uncompleted game titled Endgame:Singularity available for free (legally for free, it's open-source) that is just a better AI emergence simulator. That game is both free and UNFINISHED and it's still better than Omnipresent.\n\nI think the big lesson to learn from Endgame: Singularity was the overmap time pressure. In that game, any base could be detected -- and shut down -- by the humans at any time. You had to spread out, but spreading out too much would result in some bases being found (since they each had individual chances to be detected), which would raise worldwide suspicion. You were under pressure to expand to get the processing power needed to complete research and money-making tasks, but also under pressure to remain small and hidden so you didn't get destroyed. It. Was. Difficult. Omnipresent isn't difficult. It's a time-killer.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443496142, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1443496142, "recommendationid": "18244478", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637173", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458759913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 103, "steamid": "76561198011105637", "num_games_owned": 351}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I recommend this game, even though it is quite difficult to take the grasp of.

I often found myself wondering if the reason I couldn't complete an objective was because I was doing something wrong, or if I'd simply hit yet another bug.\n\nNot all of  the game's problems are the result of bugs, however, as many of the mechanics for the game are lackluster, make little sense, or unblanced.
