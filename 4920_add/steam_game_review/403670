I completed the game in 3 hours. I felt the story made little sense and most of the written clues were in broken English. The apartment with the naked girl in the shower that does not acknowledge your presence was bizarre. If the two story lines were to represent a dream and cloudy reality, the creators of the game did a poor job.

While some puzzles were really interesting and well thought out the majority of them were really hard to figure out and I ended around just clicking everything hoping to find something as there were not really much to go on from other than a few sound or visual clues on some of the puzzles, but those who did have the clues were really nice and seemed to be well thought-out.\n\nThe game does also have a save decent function, and instead of restarting the game from the beginning it only takes you to the beginning of the level. The last level were pretty punishing as you needed to do certain things in a specific order or you'll get kill and restart the level from the beginning!\n\nThe background music were the same 2-3 minute loop over and OVER again for the entire game, and it got really old fast and the few times there were a bit of silence or change to the music it was amazing.\n\nThe main monster; while he were creepy and it did get me a few times, the hiding mechanic makes it so easy to escape it. Instead of the suspense of seeing the monster looking for you to seem to simply reset when to hide and the other \"threats\" in game were main cheap ass jump scares.\n\nI will say the game is decent and I'd probably not be this critical over it if I haven't paid 5\u20ac for it, to be honest I've played better free horror games that had an equal 2-3 hours play time.\n\nI will however say the ending and the story the games tries to tell is pretty interesting and I've still not entirely figured out what it all means but I probably won't play the game again to find out which is a shame.\n\n\n\nPros:\nNice atmosphere\nInteresting plot\n\nCons:\nMusic gets trivial\nBad Physics/going through walls\nMonster/Jump scares\nThere's better free games\nPuzzles\n\n\nProbably wouldn't recommend this unless you're really running out of things to play.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446385406, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446385406, "recommendationid": "18815677", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504782", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1445004850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 429, "playtime_forever": 348, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "num_games_owned": 1513}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Apart from some trifling issues such as the odd crash, some dodgily translated documents, a rather difficult first level (at least until you suss what you're supposed to do), and a severe lack of save points, this is actually one of the better \"budget\" horror games you'll play this - or just about any - year.  \n\n   It looks amazing, is highly immersive and atmospheric, and has a genuinely intriguing plot...but again, ONLY if you show a bit of patience in the first area, which I'll confess I nearly gave up on (hint: it's not that hard, once you observe the A.I. for a while and play it super-safe).  \n\n   A minor gem lying in wait for those willing to persevere.\n \nVerdict: 8/10.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443873542, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1497467109, "recommendationid": "18306099", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508890", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446839320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561198141679034", "num_games_owned": 73}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "fix this cursor bug on the main title screen!!!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446316685, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446316685, "recommendationid": "18798457", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504982", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1447890945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 182, "steamid": "76561198021530859", "num_games_owned": 75}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It's too short but nice survival horror game tough", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448747827, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1448747827, "recommendationid": "19346929", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1468440377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 248, "steamid": "76561198079626101", "num_games_owned": 242}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "PRO: Nice short horror game.
