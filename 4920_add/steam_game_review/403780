I recommend it, but I got irritated many times in later levels. It's the wall jumping levels. When you jump, the character already has his own momentum, and the tight wall levels don't fit with this momentum. Counteracting the momentum by holding the opposite way you're jumping is finnicky at best. I died countless times even though I knew how to solve the puzzle and did all of the right inputs, but the time you have to react feels like miliseconds. If you hold the button just a fraction too long, you overcorrect and land in spikes. Undercorrect, and land in spikes. There is no room for error.\n\nOther than those levels (there are only 2 or 3), I really loved this game. The colors mechanic is very interesting and mind boggling at times. It's a great concept. I completed everything in 2 hours and some change, but it doesn't feel too short or overstay its welcome, and for its heavily discounted sale price, I definitely think the game is worth it despite the few unfun levels.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492512703, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492512703, "recommendationid": "31216121", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532725", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499013121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 23, "steamid": "76561198106169266", "num_games_owned": 70}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Thanks for making the game impossible xD", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499013162, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499013162, "recommendationid": "33139285", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490431", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0}}
