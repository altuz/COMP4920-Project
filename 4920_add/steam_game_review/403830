You die a lot in this game and thats not a bad thing, because everytime you die, you've more than likely learnt how you could have done better. Leveling in this game adds new features to your game that weren't there before. For example, one of the first things you unlock after your first couple of playthroughs is a perk tree of sorts, it allows you to allocate points into certain areas such as max ammo, max health, max sanity, resistances... You get the idea. The great thing about that however is, you get to allocate points every playthrough, so you can experiement and play around with the perks until you find a perfect match for your playstyle.\n\nI highly reccomend the game for those of you who are patient and willing to learn every bit about a game and get lost in the worlds lore. \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500766348, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500766348, "recommendationid": "33732164", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499824958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 71, "steamid": "76561198029126609", "num_games_owned": 127}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I think its a fun little game, being a fan of Yahtzees work I can definitley aprecciate the effort he has put into it. To start on the positives it does have a nice atmosphere and good difficulty. I like a lot of the mechanics and systems put into place. It has a lot of nice ideas in general. The influence from the likes of say FTL is quite obvious. I also aprecciate the progression system.\n\nHowever I cant say I would reccomend this in a circumstance other than sale. For starters it has a rather low quality early 2000's web game look to it. The combat is clunky and incantations/spells are also clunky to use. Maybe a turn based system would suit the game more. I also wish the game had a bit more variety to it which would make more playthroughs diffirent with more variety.\n\n7/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499706293, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499706293, "recommendationid": "33435739", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489821", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 136, "total_reviews": 146, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
