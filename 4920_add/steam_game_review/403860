It wasn't [i]as bad[/i] as I thought it would be, was still pretty bad though.\n\nThe main menu lacks any control options, no way to change your sensitivity.\n\nGraphically it's a mess, ammunition pick ups are [b]massive[/b] and so are the books. The lighting, is atrocious, it's hard to see in some places, bright in others. The animations for the guns are atrocious, the textures in this game arew absolutely horrendous!\n\nSound was very bad as well, thankfully it wasn't ear-poppingly loud, but there is no option to adjust the sound regardless. The music seemed to be all over the place, the zombie sound effects were very stock, to the point I actually heard quite of a few of them in songs I listen to.\n\nAs for Gameplay, it's just Slender The Eight Pages, but with guns and zombies. Honestly, it wasn't super bad. Not great or even good, but the concept is sort of different, I guess?\n\nOverall, yes the game is very mediocre, far from the worst thing I've ever played, however.\n\nI don't suggest buying it even on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499090663, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499090663, "recommendationid": "33185126", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1493628160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1973, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 4956}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Tags: 1PS - First Person Shooter\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library (1.2GBS)\n\nTLDR: Its Trash\n\nReview: Easter Egg in a moderately large map - must find 5 items (pages) - from what I gather there might also be sub-bosses that you trigger by activating a book item (which I thought were a page) - In my case I summoned the end game boss by using the item without having found the five items making that run rather short lived. In any case this is an incredibly obnoxious title that will constantly have zombies moaning in your ears and spawning in circles all around you, the zombies die in one bullet and have large hitboxes, but their constant non stop spawning is truly a force that will chip at you little by little, not your health or your ammo, those drop randomly all around you as well.
