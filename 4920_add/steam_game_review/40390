Enemies are relentless and they might block you in a chain of attacks where you cannot retaliate or block. In the beginning of the game especially, your character will be very weak compared to the enemies faced and they will destroy you easily. The game is intentionally designed so that you get to enemies that you cannot beat and you have to backtrack and change areas and quest in a different place. This will continue all the way to the middle of the game and if you prefer Elder Scrolls type of freedom you will not get it here. As the game progresses, you will learn new moves if you invest in certain skills as well as get new weapons  by advancing the main quest but the game does not tell you this directly and it might be overwhelming at first seeing all the possible skills which are not suficiently explained. The levelling system is also quirky and needs a bit of time and experimenting to understand.\nThe most serious issues that this game has is related to quests as some, a few, but they can get annoying, may not be completed if you do things in a certain order; they will fail. The bugs are not unsurpassable however and can be solved by reloading and doing tasks in a different order but it can be very annoying. The game also has some moments where you get to make a choice about what to tell characters or use a certain skill in conversation but it can only be used that specific time and no later. This means that if you want a certain line you have to save, meet the character and see the options, load, go somewhere else and progress, level up and then come back and have the conversation from the begining without having met the character. Also, the game does not give you many choices and the single important choice in the game is thrown at you rather early without any kind of description. When compared to Bioware RPGs, it might really seem like very primitive and punishing in this regard.\nThe game also has some frame issues and most of the character models are repeated. It was initially made in German so if you are an English native speaker, you might not enjoy the voice acting of the translated dialogue.\nAnother quirk in the game which is intentional in this series is that you may not skin animals initially or pick locks and if you want to get all the loot you will first need to locate the right items to do the skinning of which there is no hint whatosever in the game since there is no hand holding and where lockpicking is concerned you will need to level up that attribute consistently since every chest has a specific requirement.  \nThe game is a sequel to Risen 1 but, although you play the same character, the story does not tell you how many years have passed since your last exploits, what happened to the previous world, what of the final outcome of your battles there or anything regarding most of the characters. In the beginning it felt like I was thrown in a very cheap, amnesic sequel. Also, the first game was a high fantasy, medievally-themed game, while Risen 2 is set in a high fantasy universe with pirates, vodoo and colonialism. Lastly, the game displays a large amount of profanity. \n\nIf these motives seem dislikeable, stay away from the game as they will not change throughout the game.\n\n[h1]And now, to the features.[/h1]\nThe game is not easy to get into in any way unlike many Bethesda or Bioware RPGs or even the Witcher, but if you really plan on enjoying this game you will be in for a surprise. This is one of the most unique and enjoyable games I have ever played although in a wierd way. First off, the game is hand-crafted, meaning no random animals, no respawn. Everything is put there with a reason. All the animal species have a specific amount of experience that they will confer you upon defeat, a certain habitat and certain trophies that they will confer. The game is also story driven, meaning it has a plot and new locations uncover after finishing main quests. The game is made through islands and each island has at least a bit of a hunt, loot, or hidden objects and quests areas. However, you can completely avoid these and just continue the story and the story is rich in that it will take you through characters to important locations. The story goes from the very beginning up untill the end and it has some twists and intersting characters and locations. \nThe pirate motive is very strong and I enjoyed the original vodoo setting although leveling up in this path is not very straightforward. \nI really enjoyed the graphics, the setting, the huge explorable world and the very satisfying character progression. Every quest you do and every animal you kill gives you glory points which when you have enough you can invest in skills. There are 2 ways to fight in the game, melee through swords and epees and ranged through muskets. These are complemented a bit through off hand weapons: pistols, throwing sand, bombs or daggers; and through a bit of vodoo magic which serves to weaken enemies. If you play the game the first time, it will feel like a survival game so I suggest going ranged, survive, enjoy the quests and avoid the headache that the melee system can bring. This is for playing solo. The game is much easier if you get one of your NPC companions to join you. \nI really enjoyed the number of quests, the variety and the strong, atmospheric setting. It is a very wierd game but which nonetheless has a believable world and logical progression. This game kept me up for one week of nights in a row and I really finished a beach holiday earlier to come back to its rewarding musket combat and rewarding exploration system. I have read reviews about it and I know some have found the musket system boring, so it depends on your preferences. I have felt it to be very satisfying. I personally really enjoyed this game and I am now playing its sequel. \n\nIf anything I wrote here seems like something that you might enjoy, maybe try out the game. There is a gem there somewhere but I think most people will not find it. In any case you have to be really open minded about the game and all its unique elements. If, however, what I wrote does not seem interesting, avoid the game as many people on the internet really did not like it and it definitely is not a game which is easy to get into. Also, only begin playing it if you have at least a few hours to spare since it will take some time to get used to the combat and leveling system. Also, it involves a lot of backtracking and possibly a written journal kept by the player with chests and loot that you could not previously access."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506044429, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500713", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35117830", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198050605488", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1506043902, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 481, "playtime_forever": 2616}, "timestamp_updated": 1506122009, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is game is  a really good pirate RPG (which is very rare!).

I came across one glitch with a legenday weapon where you receive the wrong piece and i was unable to make that weapon. in the biginning i found it hard to progress but soon figured it out.
