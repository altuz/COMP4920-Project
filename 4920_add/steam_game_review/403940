First of all it's casual, means - easy and relaxing. Secondly - it's well done: visuals, sounds, humor are polished, I haven't encounter a single bug. It's pretty addictive and doesn't let you (me) go until it's done.\n\nThough the game value entertaining-wise is a bit low, as well as there are some poorly designed elements:\n- only paladin class is viable skills-wise, other classes feels like total crap;\n- very high difficulty level of first dungeon in act 3 (before you are able to get 10 buffs, that's what I mean);\n- there are mobs what steal items and mobs what steal spells, those makes game harder and less fun;\n- dwarf with gun shooting for coins doesn't fit (coin can remove mob with 30 hp, while dward does 3 points of dmg) and appears way too often;\n- bomb crafting can become very tedious at some point..\n\nBuy it with discount and enjoy.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495306487, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1495306487, "recommendationid": "31866894", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509909", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 54, "total_reviews": 85, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 31}}
