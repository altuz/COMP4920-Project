There is nothing like it, and it is completely amazing.\n\nI have spent huge parts of my life playing this game, and probably even more time strategizing and thinking of the amazing armies I could build. Can I win as the Priest King on a small map with max AI opponents on knight? Easily. Can I do it with the Baron? Or the Troll King? Can I ever win as the Enchanter? If I play as the Druid on a Huge map, could I summon a few Beholders? \n\nOne of my most fun games, I was playing the Troll King, and on turn one he found a Staff of Fire. He had 500 kills, was Invulnerable to non-magic, and had a +3 MR item when I won that game. He was a God!\n\nLate game units like the Earth Mother or Baal, who can single handedly obliterate hundreds of enemy units, or the immortal Lich that can teleport around the map, and blow enemies up. Or half-crazed necromancer apprentices, summoning more and more undead for your armies.\n\nBuy this game.

It's charming but also an insane amount of fun. The variety of factions you can play is immense and they all feel so incredibly different. The maps are always randomly generated, and they've added so much more from the 3rd game, including battles that actually play out with units moving on a battlefield.\n\nThis game has come a long way and is a ton of fun; well worth it for anybody who loves strategy games with RPG aspects and doesn't mind 2D graphics. Trust me, the content more than makes up for it. It might look like Grandma gave you socks for Christmas, but it turns out she snuck a $100 bill inside.

A 4X game centred around building armies of various types of soldiers and monsters, CoE4 will really punish you for your mistakes; your favourite hero with hundreds of kills and exceptional weaponry can die in the blink of an eye like a common footsoldier if caught unguarded in an ambush - a human is a human and a crossbow bolt is a crossbow bolt.\n\nOf course you can typically aspire to stronger units than footsoldiers, and each of CoE4's 23 (as of review date) factions are remarkably unique. Sprawling forests are merely a nuisance if you play as the Dwarf Queen, prefering to create strong fortresses in the snowy mountains of the north, but for the Druid or the Witch classes for example control of the forests is key to supporting your economy and gaining access to the strongest monsters in your roster. Cities are always worth capturing but give different benefits to different classes, such as Blood Sacrifices for the Demonologist (to summon Demons) or 'Hands' for the Necromancer (to raise the undead).\n\nThe surprising depth of CoE4 gives significant extra replay value.

Well, maybe not, but I'm feeling generous with praise. You don't play this game for the glitter.

It seems like a very simple turn-based strategy on the surface but there is just so much stuff in it that I still see new units, spells and events in every single game after 80+ hours. There's a huge number a factions and they have distinct playstyles and care about different resources on the worldmap. Some people might be turned off by the way combat works (you have no direct control) but I think it works very well most of the time and speeds up the game considerably compared to most turn-based strategies. Some units suffer because of it (fast moving spellcasters who charge into enemy lines for no reason and die) but it's pretty rare.\n\nThe biggest issue I have is that for a game with this amount of content there's very little love put into the UI and simple quality of life features.
