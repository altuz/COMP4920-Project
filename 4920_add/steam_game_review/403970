The story telling and art are solid and very good in my opinion. \nThe fighting is bullshit imo. It's fun to play but it gets frustrating very fast. Your guys get pushed around all the time, you can't realy controle where they stand. They also move around while fighting. I sometimes have a hard time finding them in the battle. You losse health so fucking fast and you can't do much against it. The items don't do very much and if there is too many enemies you just get overrun. \nI really wanted to play this trough but I don't think I will, simply because I can't get past a massiv ork camp.\nThere is also a mission to avoid fighting the camp I think, but that mission is bugged for me. I can't throw bombs in some holes and I get overrun after some time. Very frustrating and buggy game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504627564, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504627564, "recommendationid": "34759542", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496793", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 128, "total_reviews": 173, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 45}}
