It wasn't satisfactory, so I torrented it after. The game is good enough (For Me) that I later bought it due to liking it.\n\nI don't know much about this game, or how to play it well, but I know this is a game where you must be vigilant always, and you mustn't make stupid choices.\nMost importantly, you must save often, or else you'll risk all the work you've done, crumbling around you in an instant.\n\nThat is this game. You will Die. Over, and Over.\n\nWelcome to the Dark Souls of real-time strategy games, and welcome, to a review where that line, although still REALLY cringey, isn't remotely wrong.\n\nThis is the hardest Strategy game you'll ever play in your life. Some things have NUMEROUS counters, other things have no real counters. *Cough* Human Raid Starships in mass amounts *Cough*\nBut playing with friends, IMO is the most fun, because although games take numerous hours at best to win, there are no desync problems like in all modern Civ games, and you don't even have to play with a base, but a respawning champion with massive potential strength.\n\nIf I knew enough to rate this game, and if I were that sort of person, I'd rate it at a 7/10.\n\nGame has some problems, like how Settings and Ship designs are saved being total garbage, and a backwards way of doing it, or how dialogs are missing from you overwriting the above with default settings, and that settings and designs don't carry over from game ot game unless you \"Copy to disk\" any changes, and then go to a different game and \"Copy from disk\" to get those changes and your other settings/designs.\nAlso certain ships are blatantly broken and not designed to be used in massed numbers against the player, having no actual counter beyond overwhelming numbers, which is not a virtue you can have often enough to make a difference later in the game."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506459017, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35230047", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198345506804", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1506574535, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1011, "playtime_forever": 1011}, "timestamp_updated": 1506481619, "received_for_free": false, "review": "AI War: Fleet Command is a space-based RTS with incredible AI and the largest number of units (30,000+ in most games) of any game.................whats not to like ! ! !\n\nAmazing ! ! !
