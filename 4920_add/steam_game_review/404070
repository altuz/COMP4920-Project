Things happen over the life of a studio, I get it, they have had some issues, but nowhere did I see that this was a part time project when I ponied up for the EA o so many months ago. \n\nThis series of events with this game highlight three of the problems with Early Access:\n\n1. Devs hiding, over promising or lying about capabilities to Valve and the consumer\n2. No long term refund policy.  Shit happens, refunds should too.\n3. Consumers like myself making poor purchasing decisions, getting too worked up about tossing a couple bucks at a prospective project and then manifesting their frustration in poorly written reviews that are the equivilant of screaming in the vacuum of space.\n\nI hope this game gets finished properly and I can flip this review around, I really do.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504405309, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504405309, "recommendationid": "34700367", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505580", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497842581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 19, "steamid": "76561198121066809", "num_games_owned": 140}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Devs have abandoned this game less than 1/2 finished.
