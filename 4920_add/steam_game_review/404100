The game promises to be spiritual succesor to 16-bit games such as Front Mission: Gun Hazard, Metall Warriors, Cybernator, Ex-Ranza etc.\n\nActually, it has nothing to do with this games. Poor mech customization, poor graphics and sound, slow paced and repeptitive gameplay, lack of ideas and easter eggs make this game worth playing once, when you have nothing to do (or play).
