In the game's description it mentions the weather in the game reflecting your actual location, which I never saw much variety in, whether as a result of it being clear days here, having some kind of location service/recognition switched off (??) or just having not tried to \"play\" the game enough. All of that aside, as a feature, if that doesn't affect the gameplay beyond only an aesthetic change, I don't see it adding much value to the title overall, beyond a kind of cool visual 'app'/technology.    \n\nIf the game at least made an effort to conveying some kind of narrative or sense of progression and wasn't quite so experimental / abstract of an experience (and had a lower price point in lieu of that..) then I might recommend it, but as-is, on sale, all-in-all it amounted to what I expected of it: Some funny / nice / weird settings, without much to do.    \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504994114, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504994114, "recommendationid": "34847606", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "total_reviews": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 15}}
