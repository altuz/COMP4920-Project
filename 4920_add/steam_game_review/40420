You cannot move the blocks around and drop them where you want like you can in Tetris. They just fall and mix things up. If it reaches the top, you lose, just like in Tetris. The game consists of clicking on a square, and a light pops out and goes up to three spaces away, lighting up any other blocks of the same color, following those blocks' arrows as well. If you light up three or more blocks, they each disappear, and the other blocks fall lower, Tetris style.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes you just can't find a match. Tetris is always engaging, even when it's moving slow, in my opinion. However, with Tidalis, there were periods of 60 seconds or so, where I was just staring, without 3 blocks that I could match, waiting on more to fall, and it could take a while. I believe you can speed it up, a bit, but I think the lack of things to do at times in this game is a fundamental flaw. I don't like Tetris better because of nostalgia. I will sell the original Super Mario Bros out to any game I think is better, and same with Tetris. However, Tidalis is not superior to Tetris, or even on the same playing field. It's kinda like rebooting a film when the original was great. Reboot something that is garbage and make it better.\n\nTidalis should have been a spin on a game that needed improvements; not on a fairly perfectly-designed game, at least in my opinion."}]}
