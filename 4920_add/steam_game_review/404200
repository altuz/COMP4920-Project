Just Wow!!\n\nThis is exactly the kind of game I've been waiting for.\n\nAs a developer myself I'm sad I didn't think of this, however now I get to play it and have fun rather than worry about bugs and keeping people happy... so in a way I'm glad I didn't think of it LOL\n\nKeep it coming.\n\nI would like:\n- A custom map editor\n- a custom mini maker (to build scenarios with. stats and all)\n- Co-op Play\n\nWhat I want to give you:\n- A pat on the back for a job well done\n- Thanks for taking the time to make this\n- My support if you need it\n- My money for Real DLC..

How you can rotate move and zoom in/out plus the sounds and animation works. You can easily move around the battleground. Maybe sounds basic, but there are games that do not have this. Can change the keys from the normal wsad \"of course\". Overall, one of the games that I wait for to be perfect :) As it is already very good. Tutorial in its own way is I think, creative also. This is really something new(!) with some familiar things, mostly the movement, in it. Works in real time, though I don't think the enemies move \"that much\".. like in rts. There is a slow motion available which at least so far, looks quite nice in action, during the battles especially. The graphics, especially when zooming in, could be better but it is quite good still.\nIf you like figurines and Powermonger / Populous (yes they are old games:) style maps.. or at least a bit similar, with cards and nice details, very good sounds and more... you could like this a lot.\n\nVery minor spoiler alert ahead:\n\nNo idea why they chose the need to click Continue on two different positions and why no \"Quit the game\" option ;) I guess it is either an early access \"thing\" and explained somewhere or a decision made because, you do not want this game to end.\nPS.
