No one ever dies and you cannot lose. You build a city and complete quests. You godly power helps a bit. It feels like a cheat at first, but it's rather annother ressource which slowly refills then used. The game starts with a tutorial, and immediately after the tutorial the game is at its weakest moments. You have to wait quite a lot for stuff to finish. That gets a lot better, because later in the games there are a lot of corners where you can do something. I'm a big fan of casual games, and All My Gods is the best I have been playing this year. The story is not very deep, but the building of the city is really fun. Most casual games I've tried this year prevent fun by implementing a slow process and introducting coins/gems/whatever to speeden up things. That only helps temporarily. All My Gods is ok with buying it once and then actually playing and liking the game.

You build your city, but there's no real challenge or losing conditions. Running out of food will make people protest. Enemies will wreak havoc, stopping a building's production. Aside from an in-game acievement for playing for x amount of hours without upsetting your people, there's no real repercussions for messing up.\nThe game consists of a single level which plays out linearly until the endgame grind for very expensive decorative buildings. It's fairly balanced, and playing normally the game will unlock new buildings as you need them. You can still completely break the tutorial by predicting tasks, though.\n\nIs it a good game? Maybe not. But it is colorful, playable without sound, and easy to follow.
