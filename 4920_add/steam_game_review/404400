But every time I've loaded it since then, it hasn't worked, and I really want to play it more.\n\nPlease please, import a controller asset from the Unity asset store and map controllers 1 and 2 to the two players.  I've tried wired and wireless Xbox 360 controllers, and knockoff 360 controllers and no luck.  :(", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506053070, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506053070, "recommendationid": "35119743", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2}}
