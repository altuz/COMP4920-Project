I prefer to opt out of combat missions like escorting science ships and luxury liners and prefer to stick with one ship as opposed to building up an entire fleet, and my list only includes the last few things I did to get to the point at which I could pass that up as an option. Oh, and there's WAY more planets and ships than Smugglers, it's not even comparable in that respect.\n\nI got it for free, so yes, definitely worth it, but I would have paid whatever I paid for Smugglers V AND its expansion and have been perfectly satisfied. And it's still in development, but perfectly stable for me, easy to mod, and it's possible to overcome the somewhat wonky combat controls that some complain about, or at least become familiar enough to where I can fight off several (very weak) raiders (that had no business preying on almost defenseless victims) in a transport ship.\n\nTonight I will dream about transporting families of miners and farmers and desperate immigrants hoping to find a better life on a different alien world.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485663170, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1485663756, "recommendationid": "29556030", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519675", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506126991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 99, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 339, "steamid": "76561198034024368", "num_games_owned": 33}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "3", "review": "This game, where to start...\n\nAs of the Coalition's update (0.9.5 unstable beta) there's the depreciation of modules and ships to contend with. If you like the previous version, just go to the github and get a previous version.\n\n1. Anyways: the map is big, still expanding, and has plenty as-is to offer. There's aliens, civil wars, and planets to conquer.\nYou can be a humble merchant, trading and hauling for steady pay. There's also passenger courier work which require the safe-keeping of those aboard to arrive at their destination. Escort duties involves distracting and attacking pirates then escaping before your objective gets destroyed. Bounty-hunting requires combat reputation, so getting a bigger, stronger ship and going pirate hunting will build up your rep to be given those high paying contracts. Or even do some of each just to make end's-met.\n\n2. When starting out, even if you want to get a feel for the game on your own: TAKE THE TUTORIAL!!! It pays, it gets you going in a definative path, and you can buy some local maps (which it's highly recommended to just buy maps early on). Once you open up the sky with areas you have explored, do some jobs for a while within them. There are two time markers early in that you can use as reference points to gauge off of. If you manage to pay off your loan before Rememberance Day, you did awesome. If you pay it off before the Civil War, great. If you can't pay it off until after then, you may need to rethink your career choice.\n\n3. Don't worry about goofing off and exploring or anything until AFTER you pay off your first debt (like I said before, buy some maps so you don't go stumbling about early on). If you are having problem with the Pirates, stick to the middle and 'north-west' part of the map and do trading. If you are in the mood for salvaging or capturing ships, aim for the 'south-west' area around Aldhibain (five jumps 'south south-west of Rutilicus/home-planet) since there is both a strong merchant & local milita and Pirate raids. Also, the planet within the Aldhibain has both an Outfitter & Shipyard along with the trader, so you can not only sell the parts you get, you can sell any captured ships, equipt any modules you aquire or buy new ones when you get the money for them.\n\n4. Lastly, once you upgrade your ship (anything over $million should do) go explore and visit each unexplored spot. Can't reach there? No worries, you will soon enough. If you prefer a more peaceful venture (aside from Pirates) visit the 'north north-east' area. Want to fight some tough enemies? Visist the 'east' area and say 'hello' to the new-comers (with several salvos of cannons). Once you unlock advanced flight, throw yourself to the far corners of the galaxy and discover all there is to this game.\n\n5. ...then finally, once you do everything this game has to offer: quit it. Yes, quit... for a few months, go play something else,  do real-life things.\n\n6. Then come back and find new contents has updated... then you can start a new save and play through the whole thing in record time.\n\n7.
