SC2VN is a great VN (Visual Novel), but unfortunately isn't much of a game in my opinion (ironic really, considering how its about esports). There are only a handful of choices that affect the games, but I feel the game compensates and even rises above those cons.\n[*]The artwork and art style is amazing; Beautiful, detailed, and very comfortable to look at.\n[*] The music was pretty decent, not something to brag about, but definitely nothing I can complain about.\n[*] Like I said earlier, gameplay isn't that big of a factor, but does enough to make me feel like Im actually controlling what happens; Though I'd appreciate more choices in future games.\n[*] The story is actually pretty great, Its shockingly accurate and realistic. There's intense tension during practices, fun jabs between characters like they've been friends their whole lives, some hints of romance, vengengeful rivalries, dramatic actions, stressful turning points, and strategic but friendly \"hang outs\".\n          \n(*Though about eSports, don't be afraid of missing something. Theres a ~2-3 minute \"tutorial\" about the background of eSports in the main menu; I mean theres even a damn Glosasary in-game if you miss anything. Regardless, its made to be comfortable and understandable by everyone: StarCraft fan, basic gamer, VN activist, or just any regular ol' joe.)\n\nOverall I'd rate a 9/10. Only reason its not a 10/10, is the \"game\" is way too short. I uinderstand its a relatively small developer team with limited resources and such conditions, and granted it took me ~4 hours to finish, but it ended right where the story was getting good;  right when you felt invincible, already subconsiously thinking \"Oh man oh man, now I gotta practice. Oh! what are we going to do now? Are we going to become famous? Can't wait to tell everyone back home. Should I talk to Mr. Yeon and thank him?\". But as you finish processing what just happened, you come to a slow, but sad realization: the game's already over and the credits are running. Like, DAMN!  \n\nBut anyway: 9/10 for outstanding characters (woo Reva <3), beautiful art style, intriguing, passionate, and relatable storyline, and great execution making it an enjoyable and understandable game for anyone to purge in.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487640769, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1487640963, "recommendationid": "30069895", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498791472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 193, "steamid": "76561198034254695", "num_games_owned": 16}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Excellent VN.
