It's a surprise, given the hell I usually go through to get servers up for indie games.\nGoing from struggling to make a few bucks, to making thousands of money per minute is really satisfying.\n\nWith workshop integration, patches and modding, the game has potential to live on, past its release capabilities.\n\nFor the price, there's definitely enough content to be enjoyed!\nAs always do watch a few videos to see if it's your thing.\n\nThanks for reading! :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505662980, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505663401, "recommendationid": "35026539", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543663", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506889485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1836, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 3203, "steamid": "76561198026146858", "num_games_owned": 945}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Conceptually this game is amazing.  You take the best aspects of GTA: San Andres, Sim City, and Minecraft and combine their mechanics to form a game where you can progress in skill, progress in monetary value, create custom buildings and fight over turf or just make money.

The zoning, the protection money, the stealing cars, the cops, the enemy bases, the turf wars, and the random missions.

There's so much to do.  Great value for your entertainment dollar.\n\nUpdate 1: (60+ hours)\n\nThis game is spectacular. It has everything.  You can build cities via the mapmode.  The cities are functional in the sense that it is the world you are playing.  Building placement is about what works best for you.  \n\nThe economic design is solid.  Vanilla settings permit you a healthy set of options in the beginning.  Complete a few early missions to boost your progress.

This game is about management.  You are managing simple soldiers fighting simple enemies.  They won't get all \"tactical\" on you and execute complicated maneuvers.  Enemies charge and shoot until you or they are dead.  Simple.  Yet, the management aspect of the game is where the strategy lies.  Want to conquer a base?  Sure, you can be all stealthy and tactical if you want to play John Wayne and take the world on by yourself.  But... it is more fun, IMO, to surround the enemy base with a few of your own bases, fully fortified.  Use some rockets to shell their compound while your AI minions fight them.  Numbers.  Have two bases or more.  Maybe three or four for those big bases populated with missile soldiers.\n\nWhile they do that, go jack a car.  Get the missile spawning perk.

It's a one-man made game. It's cool. Yeah.\n\nBut no.\n\nI hadn't much hope for the game, i didn't expect much. But the idea of a game with the Building aspect of Minecraft, city making of the sims and GTA gameplay, really catched my eye. The thing is: The game looks bad, it plays bad and it feels bad. \n[list]\n[*] Gunplay isn't fun, the gun sounds are generic and boring and even using a shtogun/rocket launcher doesn't make you feel \"powerful\". All the weapons feel the same: Boring pea-shooters.\n[*] Its just visually unnatractive. I usually don't care if the game looks bad as long as it's gameplay is good. Sadly, right before i started playing, i let out a huge sigh. Textures are hideous, people are stiff. weapons look terrible. There are almost no animations, when npc's die the explode (not in a cool way), cars look WAY out of place being the only non-blocky things. \n[*] FOV is crazy high, it almost feels claustrophobic\n[*] Game is kind of confusing even after playing through the tutorial\n[*] Controls feel wanky, but are bareable, however, controlling the helicopter is a nightmare. Cars feel nice, walking/running feels kinda weird, but flying the helicopter has been by far the worst thing about the game.\n[*] My computer has more than the recommended specs, and the fact that it takes about the same amount of time to load Fallout 4 and to load this game (from startup to spawning in) is outrageous! I get its a procedural generated world with \"over 1300 blocks\", but it takes forever for the game to startup and to load my save file.\n[*] Camera is crazy. Its ridiculousy fast and if you even think of moving your mouse while talking to an NPC, you're gonna be flying when you end the conversation.\n[/list]\n\nHowever, there are some great things that this game does have:\n[list]\n[*] The soundtrack is amazing. I really enjoyed my 30 minutes of soundtrack.\n[*] Exploring the city and bringing chaos to the innocent is also kind of fun (without the things i mentioned before). I got in my game, i bought a gun, and i went on a killing spree in the buildings next to the gun store. I shot down a full business building and made about 5k with all the money the people dropped. Even though the guns don't feel nice and the way npc's die is just laughable, its actually kind of fun to go around and f*cking sh*t up\n[*] The car-play is also pretty good. I enjoyed the controls the game has for the cars. It feels right, fast and fun. You can't run people over though... they just kinda float over your car, and it's kind of disappointing\n[*] The core idea of the game is great. It's just about giving the game and the dev more time to improve his work, and this will be a great game. It just needs to work in its graphics and some other small things.\n[/list]\nI think i'm being too harsh on a one-man made game that has been out for about a week. Maybe i should play a little bit more and then make my review, but i honestly don't like how the game feels and plays. Even though my review is negative and i've listed a nice amount of not-so-good things, i kinda do recommend this game. The only thing i think it should do, its to change it's aesthetics. People like the gameplay and i think i could enjoy it too if i got a little bit deeper, but its mostly the graphics what's making this game a bit of a pain for me. I say you should give it a try, buy it.

Coop MP is awesome. SP is what I got my hours in.\n\nPros\n-----------------------\n-The real-estate/racketeering system is pretty amazing.\n-Tons of default building/decor/base designs.\n-Ability to save your own custom designs and build them instantly at the material cost price.\n-Minecraft build style with more block types.\n-Some blocks are worth more depending on the material allowing you to increase a designs worth/profit. \n-Every building is enterable and NPC's are spawned inside.\n-Tons of GTA styled missions to gain XP/reputation while you await your real-estate profits.\n-You can rob/heist most of the comercial buildings in the game. They will have safes in the back.\n-RPG Perk/Stat system. Progression is felt for sure.\n-Honestly the music is pretty catchy at times.\n-A vast array of vehicles which actually feel pretty good. Races are suprizingly fun.\n-The abillity to develop land and expand the city limits and population. \n-Sim city style residential/comercial/office/industry supply and demand system.\n-Steam Workshop support. \n\nCons\n-----------------------\n-Performance/optimization sucks atm. Easy to improve game just came out.\n-Cop/enemy combatant AI sucks atm. Very predictable pathfinding/reactions.\n-Guns lack weight. Better sound effects+blood particles would improve this ten fold. \n-No ramps for cars means your city is flat. Adding ramps for road height changes and vehicle jumps would be awesome.\n-Car damage is generic. Adding hitboxes to vehicles(engine/wheel) would drastically improve this.\n-No way to fish-tail a car. Add a handbreak.\n-Where is my vehicles radio? Lets get some different radio stations too!\n-Lack of enemy types. Armored swat members could be cool. Maybe attack dogs. \n-No melee weapons/enemies.\n-No drug dealing. If he added a drug wars buying/selling system mixed with Crazy Taxi delivery system.. OHMAGaWD! GOTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n-Lack of voice overs. 25% of the GTA atmosphere is all of the vocal chatter. This would make this game like 1000x bettter.\n-Navigating the city can be a little bit difficult. Better GPS system would be nice.\n\nSo there you have it. Most of the cons can be easily improved and the pros are pretty awesome/groundbreaking! Even if this game never gets improved its still worth a purchase because the concept and game design is so freaking slick.

It reminds me of Garry's Mod Fort/Base Wars. This game also has a potential for roleplaying which is always great in my books. So currently there is 3 different gamemodes: first, is a simple generated city and you start your life and buy land and make a gang or buy a business. This is the basic gamemode. Second, You scavange and collect money to build a city then proceed to run it. Third, There is already a city and lots of AI factions and you use diplomacy to control the city.

Two teams would spawn into the world and had to defend their flag from the other team by building a base and fighting it out. That game quickly bored me, as it had a very limited building system, no vehicles, etc. \n\nThis game seems to be exactly what I wanted Ace of Spades to be. More blocks, decals, wiring, more detailed combat, vehicles, and so on. From the bit I played, it's still VERY rough around the edges, but with constant updates and additions, I have no doubt that this game has the potential to be the next big sandbox game.\n\nThere are a few issues. A lot of it's indie-ness I find to be charming and nostalgic, but there are some things (such as chat text overlapping with HUD text and taking up a third of the screen if someone spams the chat) that really do need to be fixed.\n\nSeeing as it just came out, it's still fairly impressive. If by the end of the year nothing has changed, however, I will have to edit my review, as it would be a waste for such a great concept to go unupdated. \n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505835536, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505835536, "recommendationid": "35066805", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507095890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 579, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1079, "steamid": "76561197992945171", "num_games_owned": 759}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Thoroughly enjoying this game.
