There are still problems with things, like targeting enemies and movement etc, but these are all issues with it being a console base game, and kb/m control.\n\nI don't recomend it though. In fact i vehemently suggest you look elsewhere, for one single reason.\nThe save system in this game is terrible. In a normal console game, anything the game gives you baring exp in a rpg, is still there when you die, that chest you opened you will need to open again, but the items you get are still there. In a normal action rpg/hack n slash with random loot (like this game), your character is saved at all times, you pick up an item and die, ou still have that item, or if an enemy drops something and you die, it will still be there on the ground when you make your way back.\nNot in Vikings. If the game gives you that lucky drop, gives you that amazing new weapon you've been hunting for, and you happen to die before the next checkpoint. It's gone forever. This and this alone can kill any fun this game could give you.\n\nDo not buy this game, unles they introduce a secondary save system or change the checkpoint save system completely.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506684587, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506684945, "recommendationid": "35290273", "language": "english", "votes_down": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519430", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505170082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2022, "steamid": "76561198018455985", "num_games_owned": 131}, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 25, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I tried to like this game, but in the end I can't recommend it.

Crows, for example, just dive on you to do some minor damage to widdle you down and you just kinda smack them away.\n\n-Quest system has you doing raids (quests) that involve you tearing your way through something while killing and collecting everything to complete additional tasks. This system often requires back-tracking, which not long prolongs the game artifically, it makes early levels *really really boring.* \n\n-The raids seem to repeat the same deign every level\n\n-The story is hilariously simple that it made Diablo 3's look good. Nothing is expalined, no connections are made, characters have no defining traits, they all kinda look the same.\n\n-Voice acting is hilariously basic and sounds like it was done in one take.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe game is worth it's money on sale and I would pick it up if you like game's similar to Diablo or Torchlight. However, don't expect to become immersed in the world with hours of content, because there really isn't that much sauce in the pasta.\n\nI wish this game the best of luck and if you can support it, then please do as I can see this going a long ways with enough time.\n\nEdit: After my initial review, I have now seen the extent of the creativity this game has... or rather its lack of. Let me explain:\n\nEvery single raid I have done has the same layout. As you can imagine, it's mind numbingly boring and I've only put 7 hours into this game. \n\nEnemies are reused more than I would like. Even boss abilites are shared with some high level trash mobs, making damage patters easy to remember.\n\nPlayer skills can only have their dps numbers increase with time. \n\nSkill upgrades are also bound to the amount of resouces you have, so I need wood to rage longer... great.\n\nThere is a pitiful amount of skills, which is worse considering you can't mix and match since weapons determine what skills you can use. \n\nA lot of the trash mobs become a sponge at points, which is espically anoying when you are in an enviorment where you have to take shelter every 2 minutes. Attack for a few, run a lot, attack for a few, run a lot, it gets boring real quick.\n\nThe main character is chliche and is increadibly 1 dimentional. Imagine generic a-hole that just wants to kill.\n\nWhen given branching dialog paths, they all seem to be the same as well as don't give you what you are acutally going to say. Some serious Fallout 4 vibes.\n\nGear upgrades and skill upgrades come at a snails pace.\n\nGear has no skill altering affects other than some generic damage boost, exp boost, attack speed boost, armor boost, or skill boost. Beyond simple.\n\nAt this point all I can say is that this game is so simple and safe it makes my head spin. If this game wants to stand out, it acutally has to do something new.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506825218, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1507148900, "recommendationid": "35361199", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504577", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506850952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 113, "steamid": "76561198023427841", "num_games_owned": 220}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Could have be a decent game, but just too many dumb mechanics and decisions.  Really? weather condtions that cause you to loose health for being out in the elements after a minute and you have to make a rush to another campfire ignoring everything?

At first I thought it was a bit clunky but once I mapped my keys properly and got used to rolling around it was all good. Usual ARPG stuff but I really like the Viking setting. It's not over complicated which means it's great for a quick bash drop in and out and nothing too complicated to master. Maps aren't ridiculously large and the check points are generous. Decent variety of loot but not so much to cause analysis paralysis deciding what's best to use.\n\nGraphics are really nice, sound is great, haven't seen any bugs. My only gripe is there needs to be some hover tool-tips. There's a few things I don't know how to use or what to do with yet eg: runes & crafting stuff. I'm sure I'll figure it out. I'd also like to be able to remap my right mouse button to something other than roll. \n\nOverall this is a fun ARPG that's not overly complex.
