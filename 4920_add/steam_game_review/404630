It sounds minor, but gets irratating after playing for like 15 minutes.\n\n- Sometimes the ball would stop moving for no reason, and you have to reset the level and watch it slowly make its progress again.\n\n- Gadgets glitch out and you can't click on them after reseting the ball, so what you need to do is reset the whole level and place every gadged again.\n\n- The ball is constantly slow-ish, no matter if it goes through speed boosts.\n\n- There is no indicator of how far the ball will be thrown by some of the gadgets, so you're left experimenting until you get it right, not because the puzzle is hard, but because the game failes to give you useful information.\n\n- First 30 or so puzzle were really easy, don't know if they become hard at some point, but I personally don't have the patience to play anymore.\n\nThat being said, the game can be enjayable for those with patience and high tolerance. I personally won't play much more and can't recommend it because of the reasons stated above.", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1465207975, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1465108923, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1465109062, "recommendationid": "23394462", "developer_response": "If you're having problems, please write into the forum.\nYou've played 30 out of 115 levels in about 40 minutes.

There is 100 puzzles.\n\nI beat the game in 9 hours or so and could be solved faster.\n\nDownside:  There should be more puzzles.  It felt really fast for me.\n\n There is a ton of glitches that can happen.  Picking up the pieces of machines can be a daunting task.  I fairwarn you!  The game is fun, but not super smooth.  Things will launch in ways that are not consistant with each other.  If your level glitches while your in the middle placing objects, I suggest quitting the level and then restarting.  You don't lose much on any level if you restart.  There is a lot of spelling errors in the translation of this game.  It will annoy you if that thing annoys you?

Everywhere i clicked, no response. I went back to the left and realised the icon on the below left on the screen was the first level. A bit confusing. But...\nAfter the first 10 tutorial levels i got the hang of it. The tuturial is self explaining, all you have to do is press Play on most levels or place items.\nI'm now at level 39 and most levels are easy, but some are tough (it took me quite some time for level 38).\nYou have to realise you must get certain hazards at the right speed, jump over obstacles, or find another short-cut to the finish. Every level you are given a limited amount of items, which can be jumps, detours, speed up, reverse bungee-cord, etc.\nSo far i like this game, i wish only for a reset button to take the items back in the inventory and start the level again and on the level screen i miss the level numbers\n\n+ Nice overall graphics\n+ Much levels\n+ A nice mix of Easy and Challenging Puzzles\n+ Nice sound effects\n\n- Picking up items does not react as wanted sometimes\n- Only one background music, gets boring\n- No level editor\n- No rotating the screen, only zoom in/out (or i missed the buttons for rotating)\n\nIf you want a nice puzzle game to play, i recommend this game. The current price would be right if there was a level editor. Needs a reset button and buttons for rotating the screen (if there are then they are to well hidden).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445799488, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445799488, "recommendationid": "18682863", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 2}}
