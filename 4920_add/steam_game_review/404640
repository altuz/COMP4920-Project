I mean what kind of game is this exactly?\n\nLimit your scope, this might be very detailed, but it is not fun, and the interface of needing to navigate to different buildings and then navigate to some sub screen just to do anything is time consuming and annoying.\n\nWhy do people keep making these strategy games with incredibly tedious \"theatre of the mind interfaces\".  It seems like a German thing, and it is atrocious.  Have a freaking responsive dropdown menu.\n\nEDIT AFTER MORE PLAYTIME\n\nI tried to give the game a second chance since the developer responded to the review.  I still would not reccomend it.\n\nThe tool tips and gameplay cues about what happens when you say advertise with your game, versus advertise for the company as a whole are not remotely clear.  The lack of save functionality is crippling in realtime game with poor and non customizable autopause features.  Trying to get the information about say what games are popular is on a totally different screen than the one that offer syou contract and it 3 or 4 clicks away.\n\nThe whole bank makes little sense, the loan terms are all wrong.  You ae only charged interest once, it is not amortized.  So you can get a $100k loan for 1 year for a one time 7%, or over 25 years for a one time 30%...which do you think is a better deal?  Loans don't actually work that way.  A 1 year 7% loan indeed costs you ~$107k, but a 25 year 30% loan costs you $750k NOT $130.\n\nThere is a good game here somewhere with a better interface and so more clear tool tips and fat cutting of needless features and more focus on the game development portion of game, but uggh what a chore to play right now.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460138250, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1460500937, "recommendationid": "22304269", "language": "english", "votes_down": 45, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691874", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1460136914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 47, "steamid": "76561197995678858", "num_games_owned": 630}, "votes_funny": 8, "votes_up": 112, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Aside from launch/early access hiccups (audio language mismatch, missing text, etc), the control is abysmal: the interface requires you to constantly switch between rooms and needlessly navigate redundant menus.

That quote above is the entire review.  Since I wrote it, the developer convinced me to give the game a second chance.  Mostly because I didn't give the tutorials a chance.\n\nSunlight Games: \"@NME Plays: You should try the tutorials...\"\n\nWait, that was the very first thing listed in my review above.  \"Awful tutorial\"\n\nSunlight Games: \"The game was 6 month in EA and got a lot of polishing. Did you play ALL 5 tutorial?\"\n\nFine, I'll play all 5 tutorial.  I went back and replayed them, but for reasons described and demonstrated in my video, I didn't learn anything from the tutorial.  I tried to restart the first one, but since I'd completed it, I guess the game thought I had mastered all the skills available in that tutorial, and wouldn't want a refresher course.  Oh well, I guess I'll just work on 2 through 5.  So I did.  I made it through 4 more tutorials, all of which were just as bad as the first.  I didn't learn anything.\n\nIt took about 35 minutes to complete the remaining tutorials, at which point I was released to the world of Game Tycoon 2 to do as I please.  I choose a character, which I assume I'll never need to see again.  I pick a company name, NME something or other.  Then a company logo...I chose the H8 logo, because I H8 this game.\n\nThen, because I'm super confident in my skills from all the excellent information given to me by the tutorial, I choose hard mode and start my game.\n\nI lay out the groundwork for my game.  A brilliant piece of work.  Truly, a masterpiece of it's time.  It's called Bang!, and it's a shooter.  But it's not just any shooter.  This is 1980, we don't have fancy things like graphics.  It's a text based shooter.  I can clearly see this will be a hit.  Just imagine with me...\n\n/fire at grue\n\nSYNTAX ERROR\n\n/shoot grue\n\n>>You can't see <GRUE>, it's dark.\n\n/shoot north\n\n>>You hit the <GRUE> in the leg.  <GRUE> Eats you.  You are dead.\n\nThrilling, right!?  Now, don't go stealing my ideas or anything, because I've already filed the paperwork to make this a reality.\n\nSo, we start developing Bang!, but I run in to a problem.  I don't have staff!  How dare I make the assumption that a beginning developer start their first game on their own.  No!  I need a programmer and a graphic artist.  I don't know why, because there are no graphics.  Maybe he's also a writer, because he's a creative type.  This is where the one point of realism I liked came in though, because I deliberately didn't want sound in my game, so I wasn't required to hire a sound guy.  Nice touch, 1 single point to Game Tycoon 2 for that.\n\nNow, let's go back to my office and watch the little Newton's cradle on my desk.  Yes, there is a semi-functioning Newton's cradle!  If you hover over it, the balls go back and forth.  Well, the ones on the end do anyway, the 3 in the middle just sit there transferring energy.  Lazy good for nothing...wait a minute.  Something is missing.  Apparently I wasn't the only one to not hire a sound guy, because Sunlight Games didn't bother to put that little clacking sound these things make in the game.  I'm taking back that point I gave you in the last paragraph.\n\nFinally, the time has come.  I made my game!  Bang!  It's here, it's done!  I rush over to the production and distribution area, where I design a box.  In the tutorial, I just went with the standard poor quality box, and it showed.  Man that thing was ugly.  Not for my pride and joy though.  Nothing but the best for Bang!.  I go with the Noble option.  Yeah, the scale is Normal, High Value, and Noble.\n\nOh, I also skipped Copy Protection, because A. I don't believe in it, and B. it's 1980, what options were there?  A sticker that says \"Please do not make illegal copies of this software\" as the Simple option, and Complex is a copy of the music video \"Don't Copy That Floppy\" that is mandatory to watch every time you load the game.\n\nBack to production, we don't get an option for a manual, which is odd to me, since the developer of this game is really invested in making sure the player sees the tutorial.  Maybe all games just come with a built in guy that talks you through everything in an unintelligible language.\n\nI make 1,000 copies of the game, since that's the minimum, and I have no idea what the market is like.  I'll play it safe, assuming I can make more later, I just might miss a sales window if I have a hit.  I get my 1,000 games, and...are you kidding me?  This is Noble quality box making?  Not a single edge on this box is a straight line!  I'm all for artistic design here, but come on, be practical.  How is this supposed to sit on a shelf?  I guess consumers are forced to lay it on it's back.  Although, for all I know, the box isn't big enough for all the disks, and it starts to bow outward a bit.\n\nWell, let's get to business.  All this work is about to pay off.  Time to sell these games.  I need to determine a price.  Well, I vaguely remember it costing over $1.00 to manufacture each game, but I don't know if that price includes development costs or not.  Let's assume not.  I suppose $3.00 is a fair price to ask, but I want to make sure.  I'll just drive down to the local game store in the mall, and price check other games.\n\nI make it to the game store, which doesn't sell erotic games by the way.  They made a point of specifically mentioning that in the tutorial.  The only thing here is a list of hit games.  But because it's before any games have been released, it's empty.  Why does an entire store exist that doesn't sell anything yet?  I'm feeling my immersion start to fade.  Everything is falling apart and nothing makes sense in this world.  Just then, a black hole emerges from the empty game store, sucking everything into it, where I die and it's game over.\n\nThen I woke up, and I was still playing this game!  I angrily drive back to the distribution center, where I say screw it, sell it for $3 a game, I don't care.  But I don't have a distribution contract.  Now I have to drive to the lawyer, negotiate a contract, drive back, ship my game, and repeat the process.  When I make it to the lawyer though, there isn't anyone interested in distributing my game.  No one wants a text based first person shooter.  I guess there's a lesson to be learned there.\n\nMake sure a market exists for the game before you make it.  Because no matter how much you defend how great a game it is, if no one wants it, you've just wasted a bunch of time and money.\n\nTo anyone who does like this game, fantastic!  I'm beyond thrilled that you found something in this world that brings you joy.  But for the general public, and those on the fence, and those who think this is a sequel to Game Dev Tycoon, I would advise against buying this game.
