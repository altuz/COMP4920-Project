That could be a good gauge of how annoying a platformer is.\n\nThe jumping is kind of crappy and not as responsive as the level design would demand. Vicky should've probably put in some cardio, used a trampoline and done some squats before this damn game began, because the ability to DUCK in a platformer with somewhat unresponsive jumping would've been really helpful. \n\nAlso, the checkpoint mechanic is kind of shitty, because all it really does is respawn you, any enemies out and about chasing you before your death and respawn will still be there. \n\nBut, I can't fault this game too much, I got it for 50 cents, it's usually an \u20ac... and it is visually kind of interesting and quirky. Not so bad I would hate it. I would probably hate it if they asked 5 or 10 \u20ac for it, but for what it is, it's totally fine.
