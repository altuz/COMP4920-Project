I wanted to be able to call it a masterpiece.  There are so many things it gets right.  But there are others it just gets completely wrong.\n\nFirst off, the game has no dialogue and the only text describes you power ups.  The story is not force fed to you, which is good, but is also bewildering.  What makes the game shine is the world.  As you progress through the game, your actions change the world in dramatic ways.  I won't spoil it, but there are two main ways you change the environment, and both are very cool and satisfying.\n\nAt first glance, the game feels kind of like a Zelda game, but not.  You have a sword, you swing it, you roll out of the way and dodge enemies, and sometimes use a shield of sorts.  There isn't a whole lot of combat fortunately, and it works well most of the time.\n\nThe game is mostly about exploring your environment and changing it as I stated before.  And this is really where the game shines.  The environment is so beautiful and masterfully crafted.  The graphics are amazing and the style is off the charts.\n\nWhere the game fails is platforming.  And you have to do a lot of it.  You always have a fixed perspective, and the camera is mostly OK, but there are times where you will jump in a direction and know you will hit your mark, but you somehow won't.  It's always hard to judge precise jumps, which can often be frustrating.  You will die plenty.  Fortunately, load times are quick, but sometimes checkpoints are several minutes back.  \n\nOverall, Runic did an amazing job on a game that I want to call a masterpiece, but I will call it great instead.  I liked feeling like I was actually helping to fix the world, and that part was a lot of fun.  Sadly, the end left a lot to be desired, but that's just how it is with some games.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506830696, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506830696, "recommendationid": "35362958", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566453", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506657177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 565, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 565, "steamid": "76561197970245818", "num_games_owned": 407}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 67, "comment_count": "3", "review": "There is a lot I liked about Hob, particularly in the early going, but the more I played the game, the less I liked it.\n\nHob is a super linear Metroidvania with a little bit of Zelda sprinkled in.  You'll get a small handful of upgrades that unlock new areas of the game, and you'll hunt around for heart containers, energy upgrades, and chests that contain money or gear.  The majority of the game is wandering around the large world pushing buttons to open up new areas, with a little bit of really simple combat thrown in.\n\nFor a while, I really enjoyed the laid back nature of wandering around, pushing some buttons, and seeing what happened.  After a few hours though, the game had shown me most of what it has to offer.  I'd seen most of the cool visuals, gotten all of the gameplay-changing upgrades, and found out about all of the different button types to press.  That's when I realized that there was nothing to the game but pushing buttons.\n\nThere really aren't many puzzles in the game.  Everything is solved by walking around, finding the button you haven't pushed or ladder you haven't climbed, then pushing or climbing that thing because it's all that's available.  In a better puzzle game, like Zelda or Inside, there's something to figure out.  \"If I push this box here, I can reach that rope, which I can use to swing over there and light the torch, and once I light all of those...\"  In this game, what happens when you push a button (or lever or box or whatever) is unpredictable.  Sometimes the entire room will move around.  Sometimes a ladder will appear.  Sometimes it lights up a button three rooms back.  There's little thinking involved.  Just keep your eyes open and everything solves itself.\n\nIt's not uncommon to spend an hour in one part of the map pushing buttons and jumping around, just to find out that all that accomplished was allowing you to push a NEW button halfway across the map.  That's not particularly rewarding.  After going through that routine a few times, the games myriad of little problems started wearing on me.\n\nThe camera sucks.  It will lead to you dying because it swings around in unexpected ways, hides the place you're trying to go, or gives a bad angle for the jump.  If you've ever played a Lego game, it's the same problem here.  Fixed camera + 3D platforming = missed jumps.  The penalty isn't too harsh, but it's not fun running back to where you fell for something that doesn't feel like your fault.  Combat is pretty basic with sword swings, a roll attack, and a couple situational moves.  In the back half of the game, enemies take enough hits, and give so little reward for beating them, that combat becomes  tedious and usually just best avoided.  Backtracking is hampered by a poor map, lack of mini-map, and insurmoutanle walls of trees not any taller than the character is that randomly cut off progress when you just want to get back to one of the too infrequent fast travel spots.\n\nAnd there are bugs.  Most of the crashes seem to have been fixed, but upon release it was crashing every 15 minutes.  It was fixed very quickly, but why did it ship so broken?  Even after the patches, I still had the force my guy to respawn when he got stuck in geometry, and died dozens of times due to getting stuck in geometry, bad hit detection with the environment, or a sudden loss of control causing my guy to fly off the map.  Once I had to restart because the map suddenly when completely white as if I hadn't explored any of it.  With all these little issues, moving around the world just feels bad, which is a problem since wandering around is most of the gameplay.\n\nNone of these flaws, individually, make the game not worth playing.  But they all add up to a pretty mediocre game that makes a good first impression, then peters out.  It runs out of new ideas and devolves into wandering around the map looking for the things you haven't done yet.  There's fun to be had if you can overlook the flaws, but I can't recommend the game as a whole.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506658754, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506658754, "recommendationid": "35282000", "language": "english", "votes_down": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584035", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506740592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 872, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 872, "steamid": "76561198010526526", "num_games_owned": 65}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 31, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I'm enjoying the game immensely.  The art style is gorgeous and the world is vast and breathtaking.  Exploration has been fun so far; The game has a distinctly metroidvania feel to it, featuring unique and interesting environmental interactions with various character abilities.  Both movement and combat are suprisingly crisp, fluid and responsive with no animation locks. Even the music that I've heard so far is atmospheric and resonant without being intrusive.\n\nThe game's outstanding issue so far is odd inexplicable FPS drops and slowdowns. With a system that tremendously exceeds recommended specs ([url=https://www.reddit.com/r/watercooling/comments/6bxycs/secret_caselabs_illuminatihandshake][b][i]LINK[/i][/b][/url]) the game drops as low as 20 FPS at times.  So far I've tested in 1920x1080, 2560x1440 and 3840x2160 with a variety of settings and the same results.  I haven't ruled out the possibility of some issue on my end however, and will continue to experiment.\n\nI've had a great deal of fun with the game so far and hope that sooner rather than later the performance issues will be ironed out.\n\n[b][i][u]EDIT 9/28/17:[/u][/i][/b] Turning off Vsync in the Nvidia control panel and playing with only the game's Vsync yielded some favorable results.  There are still massive framerate drops, but even the worst drops are well above my monitor's 60mhz refresh rate.  It'a a band-aid solution at best.\n\n[b][i][u]EDIT 9/29/17:[/u][/i][/b] Finished the game and admittedly my response soured somewhat towards the end.  Hob does a lot of things right, but there are some missed opportunities for really spectacular gameplay.\n\nThe complete lack of boss fights is puzzling as the crisp, fluid combat quickly becomes unnecessary and inconsequential.  I kept getting cool abilities and upgrades, then just running past enemies because [i]not[/i] fighting was faster and more efficient.\n\nThe game seems aggressively underexplained; Even at the final cutscene you're given nothing more than characters pantomiming while speaking unintelligible gibberish.  There are locations where the lore of the game is supposedly revealed, but they're optional so the player can skip them either intentionally or accidentally.  In addition, the lore locations all seem to show obscure symbols and lights devoid of context.  I'm still not entirely sure just what happened in this game.\n\nThe worst issue is the camera and the player's inability to adjust it.  The only zoom and rotation are controlled by the game itself at specific points; The game shows the player what it [i][u]thinks[/u][/i] is relevant at the time.  This can highlight important changes in the ever-shifting world, but just as often it leads to frustration when you can't even get a good look in the direction of your objective or line up a jump comfortably.  Lack of depth perception will become an issue eventually, as well as the necessity of making blind jumps towards the screen.\n\nEven with these issues however, the game is definitely worth a play just for the experience, although it's probably best to wait for a sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506493253, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506742986, "recommendationid": "35236560", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547043", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507050595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1066, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1066, "steamid": "76561197983033209", "num_games_owned": 95}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": "5", "review": "So as a gamer getting on in years, it's been harder and harder to find something that really pulls me in.  So many of the big games seem to want a deep committment of time before they get good.  Others start good but soon turn into a grind, revealing its shallowness.  Sometimes I wonder if I'm outgrowing games and will have to take up gardening or something.\n\nLuckily Hob has come along.  Hob has been fun from the beginning and is still fun.  New mechanics, zones, and story elements are introduced regularly and I'm having a great time.  The pace is not hectic, and the visuals are beautiful.  Eventually I'll finish it, but I actually think it might be worth a replay.  Watching the world evolve is been a unique experience, and it would be worthwhile to watch it again from the beginning.\n\nMany have compared Hob to other games, but I don't think anyone has compared it to 'The Room' series of games.  The way the puzzles work and the way pieces of the landscape fit together remind me on it.\n\nI have a pretty mediocre computer, but have had no issues with this game; it plays pretty smooth.  I've played most of it up until now with a keyboard and mouse, and it wasn't too bad.  But I just splurged on a controller and it makes the game much more enjoyable.  I didn't find the platforming hard with the K&M but combat was a chore.  Now it feels much more fluid.\n\nIt's disappointing this game hasn't received more buzz.  If you're sitting the fence I recommend you give it a try.\n\nEDIT: Finally finished it.  Some have claimed to do it it in 7 hours but it took me twice that.  Except for a brief period at the beginning (when I focused on an objective I couldn't yet achieve) I never was at a loss for something to do, and it seems like you can hit the main objectives in different orders.  I still have many secrets I haven't found, however. There are at least two endings, and the game lets you 'continue' after you've experienced one to try the other.  The endings are open to interpretation; I'm still puzzling out what they mean. Which is good!\n\nIn summary, I'd say this is one of the best games I've played in a while.

A little direction may have helped, but I understand that they wanted to do the story without words, so I suppose it was like another puzzle to solve. While the puzzles aren't very complicated I do enjoy figuring them out. The combat is also enjoyable with different methods required for fighting different enemies. Some enemies will one shot you. I have died many, many times playing the game on Medium difficulty. Most deaths are a result of falling off narrow bridges, missing jumps, or due to some other environmental hazard though. Overall I am enjoying the game and am surprised to only have earned 14% of achievements after 5 hours of gameplay. I did not expect the game to be much longer than that for a single play through.

What I miss in the game is a bit more clarification as to why the hero has to do what he's doing.

I'd give it a timid thumbs up, around 6/10. Details I'll be listing below\n\nPros\n-Nice art and visual animation\n-Flows quite nicely in the beginning\n-Simple, but good story(feels a bit like hollow knight with 0 dialogue, or like ori and the blind forest)\n-Combat mechanics aren't difficult, a lot of combat ends up being optional\n-Upgrades are optional, and can naturally gain a few throughout the story\n\nCons\n-Lots of little bugs, one of them was where I ended up dying in-game during the cutscene right after the final fight. Couldn't fight back, so I had to respawn and go back to get the ending scene\n-The map isn't super descriptive about some areas(e.g. [spoiler]lore rooms[/spoiler]), so if you end up forgetting certain parts of the map and see those landmarks, you'd probably end up having to go back to remember what it was\n-Can be repetitive at times with the same puzzle mechanics although it's varied enough to not feel too boring\n-Not sure if this is the game's intention, but I've personally been unsure of whether or not I could land on certain areas or if it was considered to be too deep. There's also some invisible barriers and objects that you end up going right through instead of landing on\n-Felt like some of the checkpoints were a bit too far away from each other in some of the later areas in comparison to the start\n-More of a wish than a con, but just hoped that the story would've been a little more compelling. Maybe it's because I've played similar games, idk\n\nNotes\n-Played with mouse/keyboard. I've noticed that you sometimes need to use the right-click button to move around rather than WASD sometimes just to get the proper jump or smooth pathing through a narrow walkway. It also takes some getting used to one of the main story upgrades that you get([spoiler]grappling hook[/spoiler])\n-It's not too hard of a puzzle game, definitely not as hard as majora's mask anyway. You are left a bit directionless towards the end of the game, although you can usually tell what you have to do especially if you look at the map.\n-Because it's 3D, sometimes my depth of perception can be off so I end up falling to my death rather than landing on a platform\n-I did get some lag occassionally after certain story events, but wasn't enough to make a real gameplay difference (settings on high, with AMD Quad-Core 3.8GHz, NVidia  GTX 950)\n\nFor what it's worth, I do also appreciate the work involved into creating this, as it is a 3D puzzle platformer with just about the right difficulty of puzzles and efficient map design.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506575961, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506576395, "recommendationid": "35255134", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544593", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506817160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1394, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1394, "steamid": "76561197998169371", "num_games_owned": 254}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I haven't enjoyed a game as much as this for some time. It is highly original in a number of respects (even the way that objects animation when clicked), full of charm (the little creatures are delightful, and the bad guys laugh over your bleeding corpse), with a good level of puzzling and platforming challenge but not punishing. It looks gorgeous, and the cell shading gives it a cartoonish charm. There are additional save points are various scenic locations, where you can sit and enjoy the view, which is cute, and original.\n\nIf you love metroidvania, you'll love this, so expect quite a bit of backtracking, but if you love being in the game world, as I did, it's no hardship. It is called an \"open world\" game which might be seen as a little misleading, as the main story is fairly linear, but you can take time out to explore, hunt for that elusive power up, scythe the grass with your sword, interact with the animals, or go and pick a fight.\n\nIf it has a downside, its minimal storytelling sometimes left me wondering what to do next, as not all keypoints in the main narrative generate mission markers on the map, and I have a short memory.\n\nIt really does need a controller though, as some parts are close to impossible with a keyboard, and when you are navigating along a narrow ledge or platform, which twists and turns in odd directions, there is sometimes no key combination for the required direction, so you have to tap the two relevant direction keys in varying amounts to generate the right direction. I managed to get through the game, with a good degree of completion without a controller, but it does get very frustrating sometimes.\n\nThe back story and characters don't really have a lot of emotional depth however, it's really the PLACE with all its charm which provides the depth atmosphere.\n\nA delight to play, close to perfect, but not quite. The map is a bit too minimal to be useful sometimes, and some of the animations e.g. when emerging from a save point, are too lengthy when you are tapping the keys in frustration after your latest failed precision jump, waiting to get to it again.\n\nAlso it's a bit buggy at the moment but the devs are sweating blood to polish it up, so full marks for effort.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506724288, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506724288, "recommendationid": "35314660", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525082", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506621272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1039, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1039, "steamid": "76561198038594124", "num_games_owned": 264}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 37, "comment_count": "2", "review": "I can tell that there was a lot of love put into this game.\nThe art design is superb and I found the unique world/level changing mechanic enjoyable.\n\nThat said the amount of bugs and glitches completely ruined the experience for me.\nI'd say around 4 hours of my total playtime was spent wondering what to do next as a direct result of game triggers not working correctly; and my assumption that I had yet to reach the furthest point of progression.\n\nI also found clipping through objects to be a fairly common issue and the electro-grappling hook was a miserable experience.\n\nOverall I really like this game and I think that with a few updates and bug fixes I'd give this a 9/10, but I just can't recommend the game in it's current state.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506628083, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506628083, "recommendationid": "35270507", "language": "english", "votes_down": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538422", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506513901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 248, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 248, "steamid": "76561197998827138", "num_games_owned": 631}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Despite the warning on the store page, this is perfectly fine on Keyboard+Mouse.

The puzzles are not so so enough to make you feel bored through your first 2 hours of playing. The combat is pretty great, you got slash and dodge at the beginning and would get more various techniques throughout the story. Personally, I quite enjoyed playing this game till the very end.\n\nThe problem is, Hob doesn't have much explanations about the basic things in game. Maybe you will wonder a lot at the beginning about how everything works because there won't be any conversation explaining what you need to do. \n\nAnother concern is the control part. ugh.. I don't say this game has a terrible controller support. It works perfectly but the moves are not quite right for me. For example, you can't control the direction while in the air, it's just a straight way jump and I really feel uncomfortable with it. I mean, oh come on 3D moves without 3D jump eh? For me it's a big problem because you can't enjoy the game fully if you're uncomfortable with the control right?\n\nFor the summary, I will rate this 8/10\n\nIf you go for the Adventure-Puzzle part, I absolutely recommend you to buy this game but for the platforming, it's such a let down.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506511300, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506700135, "recommendationid": "35239793", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518427", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1507129015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 759, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 759, "steamid": "76561198053628243", "num_games_owned": 86}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "review": "[b]A zelda-like with fun combat, and moments of wonder, but plagued by a couple of unwise design choices.

Mouse + keyboard ain't too bad, but the experience is definitely tailored for the controller.\n\nThe games good in the ways you'd expect.

You know the games that make you go \"wtf where do i go, what do i doooooo...\"? Yeah, that.\n\nThis game lack dialog entirely. This isn't a bad thing in of itself, but most good games that do this tell their stories in other clever ways. This lacks such an alternative. After finishing the game I felt I understood very little about the world, which untimately left the ending feeling very unsatisfying.\n\nThis games overworld (where you spend the majority of your time) suffers from some pretty severe frame drops, which is a real shame.

Most notably the many jumps. This is a little bad since this is a massive part of the game. There have been occasions where the jumps have seemed to be misaligned or shown from an awkward angle.  A lot of the time, the checkpoint is quite near so not too punishing but there are points where I had to travel quite a bit to get back where I was and all because I couldn't even see the paltforms properly.  This all means that the game can get quite frustrating at points and I have yelled at the screen a couple of times. \nStill, I have persevered and have gotten further in the game each time.  There is much to be said for the joy of finding hidden passages and solving some light puzzles. \n\nA bit more story wouldn't go amiss either. The game feels a little isolating.  It would be nice to have something a bit more substantial. I guess that is the way they wanted it to be though, so I wouldn't criticise it too much for that. I guess it adds a purity to the exploration.  \n\nI've played it for 6 hours up til now and I can only see one edge of the map (the bottom edge). The other edges still seem quite a way away from the parts I have explored so I estimate it being more than double the size of what I've seen so far.  That makes it a decent sized game.

We've seen many games that fall into these genres before, but let me say this one stands out just a little bit. \n\nI enjoyed the little things the most about this game as basic mechanics you'll find as familiar from other similar types of games, but the small little features enhance the overall experience. Part of those little things being quick load times, when traveling across the map or between indoor and outdoor environments, load times will likely stay under 5 seconds (using modern and well kept hard drives, results may vary). The title screen changes depending on your last save location in game from wherever you left off and as soon as you hit continue, you're playing.\n\nThe design feels minimalistic in a sense but also quite detailed and loyal to a single style. The UI is minimal but not difficult to navigate in any sense. inventory labels are missing but you also know what each item is, they're almost unnecessary and leaves the UI clean and nice to look at. When buying ability upgrades, each ability is explained with enough detail where there's no chance anyone will think it's vague. The 3D modeling is clean, but texturing shows quite a bit of attention and care were given to each model. That being said, it's still relatively minimalistic, we're not talking about a AAA game that will take all the VRAM on your video card. However, the simplistic aesthetic combined with cel shading and soft lighting effects make the 3D game world appealing to look at. My only complaint is finding one spot that allows you to look off into the distance and seeing some of the animal life move around at a very slow frame rate.*\n\nSpeaking of frame rate, I'm proud to say this game runs, as far as I'm concerned, at an unlimited frame rate. The game allows you to lock your frame rate down to your monitor's refresh rate with vsync to make the experience feel much smoother. While I do play with a 144Hz monitor, it feels as though input latency with vsync is much lower compared to many other titles available. I don't belive any part of the game is tied to FPS - like physics and mouse sensitivity in other titles - but other players have mentioned some aspects are indeed tied to FPS, however it likely won't affect your experience in any way as it seems subtle more than anything. The gameplay, in the end, is quite smooth and is not difficult to push a standard of 60fps in any way.**\n\nCombat feels about as smooth as game performance, until you try to make combos between using your sword or your fist. Punching alone feels a little clunky, but comes as a nice utility attack towards many enemies. While a full charged punch is almost required against some armored enemies, it's nice that any enemy suffers a knockback that allows you to recover and attack with easy sword combos along with abilities you may have unlocked. You can target enemies by pressing down on the left control stick to conituously face them, but I never remembered to do so. It feels as though it's practically unnecessary as you will typically have an overhead 3rd person camera that allows you to see where you're going despite the focus on a certain enemy, unlike Dark Souls where you have a brutally angled down 3rd person camera that follows your back. While moving, you always have a sense of where you're going in Hob because you can literally see the area around you. That's about it for combat; while there's a decent amount of fighting, it's quite simple and typically boils down to pressing X/Square for your sword and Y/Triangle to punch. Other abilities become required but you'll find those situations only a few times and easy to adapt to, just remember to dodge roll.\n\nA major part of the game is its demand for your exploration, and I like its execution as well. There aren't all that many games that will put you in a 3D world and not really tell you where to go. You meet a friendly robotic figure in the beginning and the most he'll provide you with in terms of direction is a short point towards a direction and a short distance escort. You cant get much direction out of him either as his dialogue is to the tune of robotic and somewhat weirdly gutteral noises. There's no known language spoken in this game and it's up to you to figure out how to navigate the world. That being said, there are quite a few shortcuts that make the trek much more accessable the further you progress. Those shortcuts are also wonderful to have as there can be quite a bit of backtracking if you're hunting for collectibles. Not everything is obvious though, you have to pay attention to the world detail to find some bonus areas or even progress for that matter. Most of the world is delightfully tranquil though, so even if you might be someone who can get frustrated by not knowing how to progress like I am sometimes, stress levels tend to stay low, just keep exploring. Vista points also make for pretty good screenshot and wallpaper generators, showing off the visually appealing style of the game.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game, and I think it has very fair pricing. We're talking about a game that doesn't offer very much in replayability; you can find all the collectibles or replay the game on a harder difficulty, but there's no variety to it in that sense. That being said, it's also not a AAA game with a giant development team. The people at Runic are a passionate bunch that wanted to tell a story through art and that art was this game. I'd give it a 8/10; wonderful art style, smooth gameplay, may feel a little lacking, but enjoyable altogether.\n\n*I assume this is done to relieve the load on system hardware.
