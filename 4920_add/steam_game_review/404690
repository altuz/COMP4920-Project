It managed to disturb me at times, which is not easy. It's a bit less subtle, less refined and Lovecraftian than I anticipated it to be and instead more in the direction of in-your-face gore and horror. But it works.\n\nThe most disappointing thing is perhaps how quickly immersion is lost. The first attempt is atmospheric, but only the first. There are plenty of ways in which to die while learning the choices by trial and error, and having to click through so very many paragraphs of text over and over again replaces fear with indifference. Also there are no RPG elements or meaningful combat whatsoever, despite what one of the screenshots might suggest. This is entirely a \"choose your adventure\" type of game.\n\nSo is it worth getting? Yes, but only at a discount; it's somewhat short. You'll need a good grasp of English to fully enjoy the descriptions. And if you're the type that's particularly squeamish about the occult and demonic, this is definitely not for you.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502662404, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1502662404, "recommendationid": "34223927", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 57, "total_reviews": 67, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 10}}
