You can read a lot of the other positive reviews to learn why it's a really good development framework.\n\nI was about to choose Godot as the engine for my next game, but then my partner noticed that there were posts dating from over a year ago reporting screen tearing and frame stuttering, and these reports continued up to the present.  (Search for \"godot screen tearing\" to see some of the posts.)\n\nI had not noticed the problem because the scenes we had made for our evaluation project did not have scrolling.  As soon as I added some scrolling to the project, I saw the problems.  Unfortunately, there seems to be no workaround.  Even Godot's own Space Shooter demo has the problems.  Neither turning VSync on (or off) nor enabling pixel snapping helped.  It would sometimes look so bad that one could clearly see the seam flicker between two triangles of a texture.\n\nOnce Godot fixes the screen tearing and frame stuttering, I will gladly change my recommendation to \"Yes\", but for now, it's not good for commercial use.  It's still good for personal projects, prototyping, and game jams.\n\nUPDATE (25 Feb): As another test, I created a project with no scrolling.  It was simply a 4-color Sprite node that one could drag around the screen, and the background was a solid color.  If I dragged the sprite rapidly around the top 1/3 of the screen, I would see weird ripples inside the sprite. Slower movement minimized the rippling, but it was still noticeable.  I don't think it's simply a hardware issue because similar behavior does not happen if I recreate the demo in GameMaker, Corona, or Unity.  It seems like a renderer issue to me.  I hope Godot 3's new renderer fixes the problem!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487375841, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1488052105, "recommendationid": "29996200", "language": "english", "votes_down": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579695", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501563879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5694, "steamid": "76561198069804725", "num_games_owned": 380}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I've used a lot of game engines in my time. Unreal, Unity, Game Editor, Love2d and out of all of them Godot has become my favorite engine. Considering how simple it is, it's wildly powerful. Once you learn how to use it you feel like you're using a well tuned instrument. I find myself working on features I've never made before and just *knowing* what I need to do to make them. \n\nI'm not saying it doesn't have a learning curve. It's Scene-inside-a-Scene workflow definitely will take some getting used to. But it helps to just think of Scenes as containers for things that you can use to group stuff into one inside another scene(container). \n\nAfter that you can learn to use GDscript and signals in a day. After that you're on your way to being a game dev wiz.

From what I have read so far, the new 3D component will feature a more modern OpenGL renderer with Physically based shading.
