I think a part of me always roots for obscure underdogs and amateurs looking for big breaks -- I'm that kind of person too. I'm inclined to give those people a shot like I would want others to.\n\nSo this a puzzle adventure game for kids, it'll give an adult about an hour of enjoyment. The draw is admittedly, not the gameplay, but the cute artwork and innocent storyline. It opens up with a surprisingly well-rendered intro with some pretty good character modeling. It's a cute story about a kid who gets trapped in some magical world, and befriends a sphinx. They go on adventures in different parts of the world. The sphinx character is absolutely cute, I can't imagine any kid not being charmed by it. Much of the other character art really is very nice and clean. I like that the game has themes about assertiveness and sticking up for oneself, not just about being nice. If I was a parent I wouldn't have any issues with the themes.\n\nThe puzzles themselves unfortunately lack good implementation. A lot of the issues could be solved by using a grid, the pixel-based movement (if that's the word for it) is really more than you need and makes things feel a little janky. There are only five puzzles, and only one of them is what I'd consider a real \"puzzle\". It's where you rearrange centipede-like creatures to build a bridge, and it would be very interesting had the developers spent some time refining it. It is especially disappointing because I was initially reminded of puzzle adventure games my childhood, like Logical Journey of Zoombinis or Island of Dr. Quandry, and Escape from Puzzlegate isn't really even comparable. In a game for kids, things need to be a lot more user friendly.\n\nBut, this is $2, and that's important. Had Escape from Puzzlegate been $10, I would have thumbed it down without blinking. But it is very cute, $2 worth of cute in fact, so I'm happy with the time I've spent with it. A modest suggestion to the developer. If:\n\na) The puzzles were redone on a grid.\nb) The puzzles were made more user friendly.\nc) There was some level of replayability.\n\nthen Escape from Puzzlegate would be an absolute no-brainer. You clearly have the art skills, I would just love to see solid implementation.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445223637, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445223637, "recommendationid": "18561972", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524536", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444859044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 64, "steamid": "76561198071767479", "num_games_owned": 115}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Let me start off this review by saying that I personally know the developer of this game. She is a real sweetheart and makes amazing games with the Renpy engine!\n\nPuzzlegate, at first glance, may not turn a lot of heads. If you take a closer look, however, you'll find that the game has more than one challenging puzzle if you don't pay close attention. The difficulty is nicely balanced, the art is colorful and cheerful, and you'll grow to love each and every character!
