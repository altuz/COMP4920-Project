It's a single player, learn through attrition type game. Some stages are top view and some are side scroller. \n\nPro: \nIt's difficult. I enjoyed that about the game because a lot of what's out there now tends to just hold your hand through progression without any real threat. \n\nIt looks nice. The visuals are nice. It reminds me of Ultratron in color and art style. \n\nCons:\nIt's single player. The game does market that and it plays well, but a CO-OP mode would be nice. \n\nVery linear. The only choices you really make are based on which unit you select for each tier. Auto-rockets or sniper? Machine gun or shot gun?\n\nNo story at all. Nothing that gives you a purpose or understanding of what you're fighting or doing. Units don't have names, enemies don't have names. \n\nIn the end, I say it's a good game. 9.99? not really. I'd rather spend 4.99 for it. It's a good casual game to mess around on but it needs some specific things to go anywhere. \n\n1- Achievements. Seriously how did this not happen?\n2- Name the units and add an almanac with unit & enemy info\n3- Stage select. Being able to replay some stages would be nice without starting all over.\n4- Endless mode. Time Trials.

However there are a few things that could be significantly improved.\nThe feeling is of a shooter, fast paced but really strategic and positional at the same time. I have never seen anything like it. You need to keep your eyes opened for immediate threats as well as avoid getting slowly pushed into a corner. The powers available are really strong but they have limited uses and cannot be spammed thus strategic use of powers is essential for success.\n\n[u][b]The gameplay:[/b][/u]\nYou play as a nanobot inside an organism which in itself is already cool. You collect energy and can use that energy to spawn other helper bots. You can keep the bots out and they attack enemies (and you can no longer fire yourself) or you can pull them insisde the main nanobot and then you can fire on your own. The bots are stationary but their fire power is higher than your own. You can pull bots and redeploy them at will for kiting enemies. After a mission you can use energy to buy different helper bots. Advanced helpers come in two flavors, once you buy one helper type, the other type becomes unavailable for that playthrough.\nYou get three main powers:\n-a stationary shield that blocks incoming enemies (except mini bosses and bosses) and projectiles\n-a mine that explodes after a while\n-a mist that freezes enemies it touches\n\nPowers may interact, for example a mine detonation will break a stationary shield in smaller travelling shields.\nThe freeze power can freeze a shield altough I dont know how it actually changes the shield.\n\n[u][b]The issues:[/b][/u]\nThe game is highly positional which is good but the screen does not always move to keep the player ship in the center which is contradictory to the positional spirit of the game. I mean if you need to stategise you should be able to see what is ahead of you and not be surprized by it.\n\nYou have no control over firing. This is really annoying. I mean most bullets you fire have a travel time and you need to fire ahead of the moving enemies but you cannot as there is no fire button. Everyone that can fire, does so at the location of the cursor but they only fire if the cursor is over an enemy and only when the enemy is close to you. This makes it impossiblle to shoot ahead of a moving enemies or even shoot at enemies that you can see but are far away! This coupled with the fact that the screen is not always centered on the player makes for some very frustrating moments.\n\nYou can only spawn basic helper bots during figts! This is a major downside. This means that while you may have lots of energy available you cannot use that energy to revive your advanced helpers. This makes a loss of a helper snowball to a major inconvenience. Some helpers are damage dealers and usually losing one is not such a big deal but other helpers are strategic and their loss could mean defeat. For example you may start the level with 6 upgraded attack bots, 1 helper and 1 antimissile bot. The loss of an advanced attack helper can be somewhat replaced by spawing a basic attack helper but if you lose the healer or the antimissile you are basically screwed.\n\n[u][b]The bugs:[/b][/u]\n-The game crashes ocasionally with no reason\n-I am currently stuck after defeating the freeze boss. It tells me to use the freeze power, I use it for a while and then the game cycles again to tell me that now I can freeze enemies...\n\n[u][b]The suggestions for improvements:[/b][/u]\n-Make the player always be in the center of the screen\n-Put in a fire button that the player can control. If the developers dont want players to snipe bosses from afar with no risk of exposing themselves then they could make the bullets dissapear after traveling a certain distance.\n-Develop a mechanic to allow for spawing of advanced helper bots (that are already unlocked) - or at least a mechanic to spend energy to regain the bots that the player had at the start of the mission\n-Eliminate the bugs that keep crashing the game\n-Fix the issue preventing passing the freeze boss for some players\n\n[u][b]The conclusion:[/b][/u]\n-Nice game idea.\n-High potential not fully realised yet.\n-Worth a buy but only at a discount. I got it at around 6 EUR but I think it should sell for less in its current state. It could be worth higher but only if the bugs and gameplay issues above are fixed.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457420608, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457421200, "recommendationid": "21701434", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506761", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1462427149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 294, "steamid": "76561197982459758", "num_games_owned": 180}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I find this game to be very entertaining for what it is.

I found that if you're dying over and over again, there's somthing you're not doing right, you need ALL the ablilities and firepower you can get, unlike a lot of games where it kinda just remains unused until a hard boss fight where you go \"oh that's right i had THIS power\". You need everything you can to survie, and it shows a lot of thought and testing went into it.\n\nSecond, the horde mode i found to be fun. Not the best one i've ever played, but fun. Enjoyable, play the story missions up to the last one before horde mode otherwise you won't know what you're doing. \n\nLastly, the boss fights, i loved them. They really do make you use everything you've learnt up to that point to just try to stay alive, and if you want to beat it, you're gonna need to figure out a way. It's so satisfying to beat them however, unlike  a lot of games where the boss is a bullet sponge and can't really hurt you unless you're in the way of it's one bullshit attack.\n\nBUT if I had one MAJOR complaint about this game (and I do) it's this: what seems to be the last level is absolute [u]garbage[/u] and it made me not want to play the game ever again. \n\nNow, I'll block out the spoiler, up to you if you want to read it, but if you don't want anything spoiled let me just say this: the last level wasn't \"too difficult\" I went into it wanting a really meaty challenge, but that isn't what the last level is, instead, it's just trolling the player.\n\n[spoiler] so for the last level (from what i could tell i couldn't get past it) all of your abilities and powers except for a shield are taken away. Instead it turns into a survival horror maze game where you have to get a bunch of glowy balls to put into a big glowy ball in the center of the maze. You start in the center, and have to explore the surrounding maze to find the glowy balls. In the maze are insta-death monsters who screech really loudly and are essentially a jumpscare death. You have a flashlight to see the monsters ahead of you, because otherwise you can only see a small radius around you, but they can also see the flashlight and will chase you. Also they're much faster, so it isn't as much of a chase as it is a split second telling you that you fucked up. It wasn't hard, it was frustrating and just plain not fun. I hate games who's end challenge is a different set of gameplay from the rest of the game. And I hate mazes, and I hate insta-death, super fast enemies, and I hate fetch quests, so the last level is all of that rolled together. Oh, and you have to gather 5 balls without one fuck-up, if you do, you start all over.

It's almost OK. Actually, if it wasn't so amazingly frustrating, it actually would've been good.\n\nThis game gets a lot right. It has good graphics (for a game of its genre), interesting gameplay mechanics, good controls, great music (I really wish there was a soundtrack for this game but there isn't), good sound and an interesting setting. But for all this it gets one important thing very, very wrong; This game is too hard. \n\nThis game too hard for commentators who try to play it on youtube. It is freaking hard and as a direct result it is extremely frustrating. To make matters worse, the fact that this game gets so much right makes the act of trying to play it (and repetitively failing) that much more frustrating. And then, to top it all off, if you really love this game's music like I do, THERE IS NO SOUNDTRACK WHICH YOU CAN BUY and the music isn't even on youtube.\n\nMy recommendation? Avoid even getting involved with this game. I was able to get to the second boss (the one right after the travel, cell-dodging section) but that was it. I was unable to finish this game. Argh!
