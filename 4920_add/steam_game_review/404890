Hell, even Battleship Surface Thunder is infinitely better than this game and it's a mediocre game from 2000...FROM A CEREAL BOX.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/i70D4pVCc0k \n\nTechnicals:\nOptions- Virtually none. there is no options menu in the game and the only place you will be able to find an option to use is while you are in a mission and that is the option to disable sound.\n\nPerformance: The thing runs at 1000fps according to my computer which it better considering the low graphics but even then the main menu still manages to produce screen tear when you are scrolling through the mission thumbnails.\n\nGraphics/appearance:\nA mixed bag of bad. The game runs in 4:3 inside of a square frame hud thing which doesn't even properly fit the screen, The map is ridiculously low resolution (Imagine if you were playing an early 2000s videogame and zoomed in all the way to stare at the ground) and isn't even well designed it looks as if land masses were just shoved all over to make it look fuller but it just looks horrendous. \n\nThe units have a completely different aesthetic to them, the map (despite the low res) is a kind of \"realistic\" texture meanwhile the units have a mixed bag of drawn textures or just flat colours and some of the models just look terrible like the boat you start in. \n\nThe one cool thing I will say is that when your boat takes enough damage the hud gets damaged and your fuel guage falls right off which is pretty amusing.\n\nSound: You start off with some rather satisfying music at the main menu but the instant you enter a mission the music stops...there is no in-game music. The only audio you will hear for 90% of the time is the sound of the submarine's engine (which sounds more like a muffled jetski than anything) with a bit of sounds from combat. \n\nGameplay: The submarines control horribly and unrealistically. Turning while moving is the most sluggish thing ever but when I stop holding the forward key I can turn do a 180 almost instantly. When you aren't submerged you can hold shift to spring...yes sprint, because that's a thing boats do.\nAnyway, holding shift makes your boat move at a ridiculous pace, you are just speeding across the map like no tomorrow despite even your normal movement speed being more than twice as fast as battleships. \n\nUnits make no sense, I can go up to a battleship and stare it down for 10 seconds while my single deck gun autofires at it and I will win despite not using any torpedoes and the battleship being twice my size and having twice as many guns which should be stronger as well. On the other end of ridiculous a biplane (which is larger than the starting sub which I'm pretty sure isn't accurate but I'm no expert)  flying by overhead can unleash a torrent of bullets at me and sink me in aboujt 2 seconds flat. \n\nThere isn't even a point to being a submarine, you travel 10x faster unsubmerged and enemies can spot you while you are submerged anyway, the only thing that makes it feel like you're diving is that enemies can't use gun-based weapons on you but battleships can throw these massive watermines at you while you are submerged so wth? You can dive even deeper but that disables your weapons and makes you move so slow you may as well not be moving.\n\nThe game is literally kill boats instantly with your op weapons and dive when you see a plane. \n\nThere is no consequence to dying, you just respawn and they tell you how many times you've died and try not to die anymore, \n\nConclusions: Bad bad game, Go buy sid meiers piraes instead when it's on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452230544, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452757823, "recommendationid": "20390390", "language": "english", "votes_down": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516913", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1452230289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561197998348465", "num_games_owned": 1788}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "review": "This is by far the worst game I have ever seen released in Steam. \n\nOnly the keyboard works.

There weren't many so I decided to give it a go myself.  And after playing it for a bit, I think it's been given an unjustly bad rep so far.\n\nYes it's a cheap and cheerful game, but what it does it does pretty well.  The sub is fun to control, the different height of your dives and their impact on the game make it diverse and interesting.  It's a fun little action game to play.\n\nTo address some of the criticisms:\n - That they call going fast a \"sprint\" and that boats don't sprint.  Technically I agree that sprint probably refers to a human running strictly speaking , but coloquially it's often used as a general term to refer to short bursts of maximum speed (usually at the expense of being able to perform any other function at the same time).  And that's what holding the shift key in gives you - it gives you a short burst of maximum speed during which you can't fire, turn well, etc.  So get over it (the terminology), it's not that bad.  If you want to use the correct nautical terms, play a sailing sim.  \"Sprint\" very accurately represents its function in this game.\n - That a sub can outgun a ship using only its deck gun.  Yeah well in CoD you can take 50 bullets over the course of half an hour, and still walk without a limp.  In Skyrim you eat an apple to recover from an axe to the head.  The day we start judging games by their parrels to real life is the day we call all games shit.\n - That you can't use the mouse.  Yes but you don't need to, it's not a point and click game.  The menus aren't difficult to navigate without.  Game pad support would be welcome, but you can use a mapper such as joycur or antimicro (I tried the latter and it plays really well!).\n - That the map isn't high res.  I don't think it's supposed to be.  The idea being you're given only basic direction so that navigation is a bit of a challenge (similar to being on a real boat!) and part of the game.  For example there are plenty of shortcuts not shown on the map that you have to work out yourself.\n - That the sub doesn't control well.  It doesn't control like a car, which is what they seem to be making comparables to.  To be fair it doesn't control like a boat either, but again it's an arcade game not a sim!  I actually like the way it controls.  It feels very fun to play.\n - Someone mentioned getting annoyed by the sonar beep.  Didn't bother me, it's not very loud.\n - That the graphics aren't great.  I personally quite like them, I think the whole environment's done pretty well.  If I'd paid \u00a330 I'd be more critical, it's not the best, but it does the job quite well.  I like the water effects and the sub looks cool, so do the ships.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this isn't an epic.  It is a cheap, fun game.  \u00a34 is probably about right.\n\nOne reviewer said you'd be better off buying Sid Meier's Pirates.  That may be true, but that's a very old game that has been played to death.  It didn't cost \u00a34 when it first came out.  It's also a story/quest/RPG/strategy type game, whereas this is just action and tactics.  Not a fair comparison.\n\nSome indie games have huge ambitions, and make early access games with massively complex ideas, and none of them end up working very well, and they end up with a shambles of a game that they never actualyl finish.  This on the other hand has done it right IMO.  They've kept it simple, and what they've done they've done well.\n\n It also has some nice touches like how ships can target you at dive level 1, but planes can't (however if you've recently finished diving the existing fire will still hit you); how the sonar works properly eg it's not a real time display of where the enemies are, it only updates as the scan goes round; you can only dive to level 2 in the deap sea, and can't dive at all when it's really shallow; snow effect when you go to the north east, damage effects when ships/sub is low on health; the instruments on your HUD getting damaged; you unlock new subs all with different characteristics, of which there is plenty of variety (fuel, oxygen, hull strength, seperate damage speed and ammo count for torpedos, AA, and deck gun).\n\nI also think they deserve a lot of credit for originality.  While top-down naval shooters have been done before, I'm not aware of any putting a spin on it like this, so the whole controls and fighting is not like any game I've played before.  there are some similar, but the whole sprint, dive 1&2, deck gun, torps, aa mix gives it much more depth to traditional top down shooters.\n\nI think a star rating on your success on each level (similar to the one in Orcs Must Die and CastleStorm for example), and a difficulty setting would go a long way to increasing its appeal to the more hadcore gamers.\n\nAt the end of the day indie devs are on a budget, they can't throw the resources at it like big company's can.  Whoever's written this has focused on the important things i.e. gameplay; rather than spending there limited resources on in-game music and various refinities it'd benefit from.  I'd like to see more features and more refinement in future, but it's not an early access game, it's fully functional and entertaining as it is now.\n\nIf you have a few hours to kill and a few quid (UK) to spare, you could do a lot worse than this.
