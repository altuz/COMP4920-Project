You start with set gold, and you gain more by turning builder units into towers, that just instantly give a set amount of gold. But towers must be so far away from each other and maps are small, so there's a fight for territory constantly. You could also turn those builders into spell towers, which are global use, but with a long-cooldown, and every one is pretty damn strong.\n\nSo the building itself is quite novel, but then army mechanics are pretty light. There's no tech tree, and no fog of war. Just watch what the other guy's doing, and make counters. All small army/lone unit stuff.\nIf a unit dies, you get back all the gold from it, and can build a new one at your base within 3 seconds.\n\nI'd have to play more to get a broader sense of tactics, but it's just really different from most RTS games out there."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1441572731, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500130", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "17918600", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971725079", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1441572851, "num_games_owned": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 46}, "timestamp_updated": 1441572920, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Its an RTS game with a capture the flag twist.\n\nThey added some neat elements, like a spell system to disable or weaken your opponents or buff your own.\n\nThe only resource in the game immediately replenishes when a unit dies, this combined with no fog of war means the game leans toward action rather than strategy.\n\nThe main menu system was not very well designed (options were hard to read), and a few times the game would crash on its menus or on exit. \n\nDespite some of these neat additions, I didn't really feel the game had very much depth. There weren't many unit types and it seems like there's only a few different ways to play the game. A lot of time is either a mad rush for their pig or chasing after your own. The bots varied from incompetent to incredibly difficult. \n\nI didn't get a chance to check out multiplayer, but for a game this obscure, I don't think there's a lot of people playing. EDIT: I checkd out multiplayer, its just Local Area Network. Sad, because not only is that not a very common way to play any more (without special programs like Himatchi), but it means there's no ladders or neat things we see in other RTS games like Starcraft.\n\nBut hey, if you wanna see all the RTS's out there, this one has a few new neat mechanics to give you some fun for a while.
