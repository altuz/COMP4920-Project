The tutorial is minimal, but I did pick the gist of the game quickly enough I suppose.   The graphics look fairly dated and generic, but are serviceble enough I suppose.\n\nThe game play was the weakest part for me.  Basically the player is tasked with picking up vehicles with various thought-balloon \"wants' and then dropping them at the appropiate venue.  Varous venues can be built, but several require the currency of \"Bonuses\" as well as in game money.  This one got very boring and repetitous for me very quickly.\n\nOddly, that doesn't mean it's easy.   One has to periodically restock one's venues, which is fair enough.  The problem is that I even dragging and dropping as quickly as I could, I found the restock fee negated any profit I was turning.   So I can add the word \"fustrating\" to the list of things that describe this game.\n\nI got it during a 40% sale, for the price $1.79.  I don't have high hopes for games that run that cheap, so I guess I can say it's a fair value, if drag and drop games appeal to you.

After nearly 13 years of gaming this game is one of those games I will highlight in the High Score of the worst games at rank 1. The idea could have come from a developer out of the 80's. Someone who is thrown into the nice world of creating games. But for now we are lot's of years later. And people can compare their work with the once from the others. \n\nIf this game would only come with a catchy art work. But not even this. The graphics are poor, the sound horrowable, the mechanics inexistent. Pulling cars from the track to the refill station and wait till you grinded enough money to upgrade your tankstation to been able to refill the next cars. And so far I have to rate this game with at least 1 out of 10. Because the creator didn't lie when he named his game \"Fill Up!\". You wont do anything else.
