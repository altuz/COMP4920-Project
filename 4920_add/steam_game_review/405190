Come back another day when they've made something of the game.\n\n[u] Interface [/u]\nThere's a very limited interface, a controller scheme display and graphics settings, that it. The developer needs to add options for sound, FoV, the ability to scroll out and most things expected in modern games, including any appreciable music. I will however say that the interface you get when adjusting and customising your vehicle is very decent & finished and while it could do with a quick help screen telling you the whys and hows it does its job well.\n\n[u] Graphics and environment [/u]\nThe graphics are good, for what's actually in the game. The landscape is very, very empty. It feels like driving an exceedingly skittish vehicle across wide, open but dull plains.  \n\n[u] Story  and Acting[/u]\nNone\n\n[u] Controls [/u]\nIn a word, terrible. The driving scheme abandons the modern concept of accelerating towards where you're pointing and replaces it with something from the early 2000's. It's near impossible to move and shoot at the same time. The driving controls are also very over sensitive and there's no gradation due to the control scheme. This is by far the biggest failure of the game.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506471047, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506473190, "recommendationid": "35232497", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1505970920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 17, "steamid": "76561197973493630", "num_games_owned": 983}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "William Gibson?
