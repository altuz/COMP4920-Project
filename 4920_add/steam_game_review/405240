Additional issue is lack of sound control by type, it might be a little more playable if most of sound effects were not farts and sounds of releasing the excrements, without ability to turn it down or off, while keeping other 'action' sound effects intact e.g. hammers or pickaxes. In short - while game has lots of potential it is being taken to hell due to poor and immature execution. TL:DR - if you think farts are funny by themselves you won't have issue with this game's promise, but I'd rather move on and throw the cash into more mature developer; Crude humor is not reduced to 'make chars fart around all the time'\n\nlemme elaborate on description:\nFeatures\nSurvive barren deserts, frozen wastelands and ashen plains! - true; too bad random element is waaay too powerful; \nManage your dwarves physical AND emotional needs! - as in \"give them place to go to the toilet or they'll soil land where they stand; as per emotional - dwarves need gems\"\nBuild your way from stone blocks to shining steel! - most likely true\n8+ hours of gameplay! - potentially true if not put off by other stuff\nBad puns, rude jokes and cheeky humour! - 'cheeky humour' is not only, or rather - should not be only about dwarves running around and farting every few steps; Puns are there, jokes - barely visible; unless as mentioned before throwing few F-bombs can be considered 'rude joke'", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499782336, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499782336, "recommendationid": "33456837", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496136", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "total_reviews": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 4}}
