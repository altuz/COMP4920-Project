I enjoy almost all their games very much and have a significant collection.  However, I was really disappointed with this one comparatively.\n\nThe biggest problem seemed to be a lack of creativity/laziness because the game is like half identical to the Superheros game.  The helicarrier and overall city layout is incredibly similar.  Unfortunately though, instead of the ease of that game to get to the menu to replay levels, you have to \"go to space\" and navigate around a globe to find each level.  Considering the default is to drop you in Manhattan, I found this very annoying.\n\nAnother huge pet peeve for me is that a large chunk of the achievements are not possible without getting all the DLC.  And all the DLC is not even included if you buy the \"season pass\" which I thought was the point of those things.  I didn't get the DLC because I was waiting to see how the main game went first, so I can't comment on it being actually fun or not.  \n\nThere is definitely a big focus on the open world play in this game, which was also true in the Superheros version, and there are some fun things to explore.  But the main levels held so strict to the movie, probably so it could use the exact audio, that it was a little bit boring.  They did still hide the character tokens and minikits on each level which I think are always fun to find.  And there was the handful of specialty actions that could each only be done by special characters which is what helps to make these games great and replayable.\n\nIt hurts to write a negative review about a Lego game honestly, but I feel like they have set the bar higher for themselves, and this one didn't deliver as I'd hoped.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505934344, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505934344, "recommendationid": "35090291", "language": "english", "votes_down": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519317", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 256, "total_reviews": 342, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 86}}
