I went to look at the controls and there is no mouse and keyboard controls listed, so I have no idea how to turn the map or anything with mouse and keyboard. It doesn't seem you can delete a tower after you place it either. Maybe I am wrong about these things? No idea, can't find help about this anywhere.\n\nAwful voice acting, it just gets annoying to the point I want to skip it as fast as I can.\n\nI thought you could build walls, it looked like a real fortress builder in the screen shots, but it is not, that is just the connectors from one tower to the next. The Base Building part was what lured me in, but it is not actually base building, just tower placement with automatic connectors.
