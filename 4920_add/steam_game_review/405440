Example: moving out of the way of the wider projectiles is impossible without certain speed level ups. So if you are happy to join a smashing your head against a wall from time to time until you have enough experience to past then you should like this game.\n\nSome pacing issues I found: Shield takes a while to reload outside of battle meaning waiting between rooms for it to reload is artificially making the game seem slower then it should be.\n\nWeapons having to \"reload\" each time you switch also takes away possible skill elements to the game as well.\n\nSolid enough nothing genre changing at all. Recommend to people who seen videos of the game play and like it. Looking for the new genre or to be on the start of something \"early\" then not for you.\n\nRest in video:\nhttps://youtu.be/1E04LutoIQo", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457722997, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1457722997, "recommendationid": "21771688", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497409", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1489130654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 55, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "num_games_owned": 799}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I got the game on sale for about 1.00USD$ and I'd say it is worth (or more near) that. \n4.99 is too steep for its general quality when compared to games with higher budgets for sale at similar pricepoints. \n\nThe trailer may make the game look a little more complex and polished than it really is (especially in regards to graphics, they look way worse in the actual game than what appears in the trailer..) but what is present is a solid top-down shooter. With full controller support, a dodge button, and equipment and skills to unlock, it presents a \"full game\" for its price. A lack of any kind of camera control (it follows directly above the player) may be irksome to some, and does make the animations appear a bit more stilted than they may need to, but it also keeps the action proceeding simply and smoothly.\n\nYou can level up, unlocking skills (higher health / shields / more ammo / higher dmg etc..) and you find and unlock a plethora of guns which are available later for loadout customization. Grenades and medkits add further complexity to the gameplay, however it largely is a \"what you see is what you get\" kind of game (and its budget is readily apparent..) It has a certain charm if you're a fan of sci fi / alien type scenarios, and the gameplay itself is fun as you survive further levels into the derelict space facility, while fighting off a variety of enemies and bosses.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489129933, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1489130585, "recommendationid": "30421625", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458738854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 134, "steamid": "76561198090472882", "num_games_owned": 55}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "After 2 hours with Ares Omega I felt like i'd experienced everything it had to offer, in fact after an hour i'd felt like this so what is my recommendation for you guys? well, there's nothing here to persuade someone who doesn't already like top down shooter and for those who do enjoy them, well there's nothing about Ares Omega that sets it apart from crowd so i would leave this one alone. I'm sure there are better games, even within the same price range.
