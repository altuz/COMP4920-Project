ALSO PLEASE NOTE THAT UNINSTALLING AUDIALS WILL NOT REMOVE THE DEVICE DRIVER.\n\nIt's a very unfortunately combination of bugs in each program and this causes users hell. I was >< close to reinstalling windows over it. \n\nNow that that's out of the way, I do really like this application, I can snatch youtube videos off the web, and I even gave it the acid test of downloading something off redtube. It did moan with redtube, but it did somehow manage to wangle the download automagically and convert it, so it passed the test. \n\nOne feature i would like in this application is a feature to only remove the sound directly from a youtube video, without installing the audio capture device. It's always better to get the data directly from the source rather than through the soundcard - if possible.\n\nDevelopers: please fix that uninstall.

Doesn't matter if you start it from your Steam client or not. This is a kind of stupid bug that should have been taken out way before it was released. The second thing I saw, was that if I search radio stations by country, the list is empty. And if you find a station you want to listen to Audials One Suite might suddenly stop and you have to push play again. There are other bugs too, but for now this is the two most annoying bugs for me.\n\nInterface is kind of messy. Its made in a clumsy way, and feels like it needs to be done something to. Its not like i.e. Winamp, wich has a nice and compact interface.\n\nI made a thread in the forums here on Steam to see if the developers responded to the activation-bug, but it seems like they do not care at all. \n\nThere are other software that can do what this does, and you can find free apps that does the same.

You can search for music and videos and download them, converting them as you go and tagging them. Once you've learned how to use Audials, basic tagging and managing media libraries becomes fairly easy.\n\nThe program crashes sometimes and a recent patch introduced the below-mentioned activation bug - I believe the devs will fix that eventually, as they seem to work on the program. But there has been no official statement or hotfix to this in a while, which at this price tag is unacceptable to me. I currently have an earlier version running and that one's okay.\n\nPlease note this is not a simple audio player, it's a proper media management tool that allows you to do a lot of different stuff. You can convert formats, download music directly from youtube, listen to internet radio stations, manage libraries on different machines, clean out duplicates and so on. If you only need an audio player, this is too expensive and feature-rich for you.\n\nWell, it's a mixed bag. If you're tight on money, look for something else. But if like me you're often ripping audio or video from websites and have big media libraries on different machines (some over network) that you don't have a dedicated tool for, look into getting Audials.\n\nAudials One Suite is powerful, but can be inconvenient at times.

Since I bought this on sale, I've saved money by not only buying this software but also by not having to repurchase music that is incompatible with certain games and media players. So, if you have music or movies that won't play due to incompatibility issues, this software definitely helps fix some of those problems. Also, it's fairly easy to use. I haven't tried making copies on DVD, so I can't review that part yet, but if I decide to try it, I'll add it later to this review.\nI'm changing my review from recommended to not recommended. I've had to reinstall Audials One 4 times, not because of the software but because I had repairs done to my computer. Every time I've reinstalled and signed back into my Audials account, music and video files have been missing. Even some of the backup files from my portable drive that were converted or recorded using Audials aren't showing up in Audials. Also, the settings I had are completely messed up. I can no longer record or convert files in MP3 or MP4 format, the only format choice I'm given is WMA or WMV in the worst quality- 128 Kbps. I used to have the options of MP3 and MP4 in a much better quality- 320 Kbps and HD video quality in MP4 but now I can't get ANY other format or quality. Audials stated that when I created my account, I'd be able to access the media converted or recorded with Audials would be accessible on other devices but I can't even access my media on the same device it was originally stored on unless I make backup copies and then copy/paste them onto the device.\nOne more thing I forgot to mention: it's true that every time one launches Audials, it asks for the activation code. This is just a minor inconvenience and if one keeps the notice on before launching,  it will give you the code before launching and all one needs to do is copy the code to clipboard and paste to the Product activation prompt and you're good to go. If you turn off the prelaunch code reminder, I think you can reaquire it by clicking the \"CD Key\" option on the right side of the library page.\nAnother wasted effort. I had to re-download this app to a new computer and some of the stuff I saved under my account is missing AGAIN. This is the 6th time and every time more stuff goes missing. I've registered my complaint with Audials several times but they do nothing and waste my time by making me find, redo, and save things all over again, wasting a lot of time. I would recommend another software since this malfunctioning piece of junk will only waste your time and money.\nI just redid one of the missing items and it's still missing from my computer, Does this software do anything right?!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1472961811, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505543753, "recommendationid": "25338550", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "total_reviews": 10, "num_reviews": 10, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 4}}
