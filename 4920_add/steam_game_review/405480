However I'd add to this that this is just one (possibly minor) part of it, as some would argue that free economic markets are even more important in creating composite technologies by leveraging actual actions (instead of words) across multiple \"hops\" and networks of humans minds, each acting as a neuron in a collective consciousness. Could be an interesting follow-up to this.\n\nHowever, I need to warn that from a technology choice perspective, certain unfortunate design decisions and ignorance of VR user experience guidelines make this a seated experience, and not a comfortable one.
