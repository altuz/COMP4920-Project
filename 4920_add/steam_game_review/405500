There isn't much to the game, it's a Burnout crash mode clone with not as much variety in the levels.  The controls are pretty poor.  In many levels you can't even see where your ball will go after you hit it, leaving you just blindly guessing in the beginning.  Partly because of these bad controls the difference between a good run and a bad run feels really arbitrary and kills any fun you might have been having.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501814308, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501975486, "recommendationid": "34006514", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497429", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 59, "total_reviews": 78, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 19}}
