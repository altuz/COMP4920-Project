Simple, but fun.\n9/10.

This game is a lot of fun. There's a lot of multi-tasking, mindset shifting, money collecting ( my favorite), mainly just a lot of action in many different forms. It has five levels which do a very good job of standing out from one another, a bunch of achievements (as you can see), four characters excluding the special secret one, many power-ups that are all very useful, a great soundtrack, minigames, and more! But the most important thing to point out is that if you find bugs, the developer WILL fix them, and quite fast too! Not only that, but you can suggest ideas, and if he likes them (which he usually does), then he will add them! So, what are you waiting for? A steam sale? I guess that's fair, but ten dollars isn't too steep of an asking price for a game like this. I can almost guarantee that this game will provide an experience like no other. That's all I have to say, thanks for reading.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494893725, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494893725, "recommendationid": "31778570", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509886", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498275260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 293, "steamid": "76561197991757162", "num_games_owned": 223}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really like the graphics!
