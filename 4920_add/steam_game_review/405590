It is a platformer, but the style of the game is spot on, the gameplay is very different (but can get repetative), and the story is average. Despite the story being average, it's quite a nice little gem.\n\nThis game is done to look like cave paintings, or art done by cavemen. It is a platformer, which fits really well with the style, as it gives you that side-on view. The 'caveman' style is accompained by the dialogue in the game being written crudely and in broken English. This broken English feels a little silly (probably meant to be some kind of comic relief), but does make the 'caveman' style hold up. Very few colours are used, the background is often grey or brown, holding with the style, and the only real colours used are red, orange and green. This gives the game a nice dark feeling, like you're in a cave.\n\nThe gameplay is not unlike Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, as through most of the game you need to control two characters at the same time. This starts off as a little awkward, but you soon get used to it, and it ends up giving the characters new ways to cooperate, with one character attacking, and one defending at the same time, for example. The two characters you play are also brothers, drawing more similarities to A Tale Of Two Sons, one of the brothers is strong and defends with a shield, and the other is very small and attacks. Although this gameplay is very different than most games, it can get a bit repetative, as most levels seem to be you doing a very similar thing, but variaty doesn't seem to be a strong concept in caveman life.\n\nThe story is nothing really that special. No real plot twists or anything. You are brothers, you go kill things, [spoiler]and your tribe gets overrun with a rival tribe, you then need to save everyone, by killing more things[/spoiler] . The story isn't terrible, but I don't think you'd play this game for it's plot. But the plot does have some interesting parts, they are not that memoriable though.\n\nI do recommend this game, it's quite a nice little indie game, the art is really nice, and not like other games, the gameplay is very different, and like the art, not like other games, but the story is quite average, like other games. An average story is not a bad thing, but if you are a real plot nut, you might want to just watch a playthrough for this game or something.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1484402135, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1484402329, "recommendationid": "29247896", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513879", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1482840128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 362, "steamid": "76561198318234850", "num_games_owned": 11}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "review": "Funny, relaxing and simple game, just 6 levels.
