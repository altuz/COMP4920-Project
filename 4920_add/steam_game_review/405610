I felt sick after 1 minute of gameplay and i'm pretty sure I'm going to have nightmares about it. \n0 creativity, horrible gameplay, this shouldn't be even considered a game\nit's weird to think that a couple of people (i'm being generous thinking that more than 1 guy worked on this, but whatever) gathered themselves in a room, pitched a few ideas, and yet the best they managed to create was a top down shooter where you control a medieval knight who shoots fireballs and moves at an incredibly slow pace (even though he's riding a horse). i've heard people saying that the only good thing about this game is the soundtrack: some pieces of classical music from the 1800s (even though the game is set in the age of knights smh) which seem to be downloaded from youtube after a quick search on famous classical music. \nit's hard to imagine that some people played it and thought it was acceptable \nit's hard to imagine this game costs money\ntl;dr fuck this game", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505009441, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505009441, "recommendationid": "34851194", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502377", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 30, "total_reviews": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 52}}
