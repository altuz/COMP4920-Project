Developers have proven to be a scam.\n\nFirst of all, anything they say it's hacking will be reported as that, with no further explanation. They don't say what methods they use to check if runs are legit or not, and don't provide any source of screenshots to see if they're aiming properly with their scripts. \n\nSecondly, the game was beaten legit months ago. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valkama/] Amaklav\t[/url] did it time ago but was nulified for \"abusing the pause menu\", and immediately updated a new patched limitating the pausing during levels. So they literally changed the rules during the contest. Gamers outsmarted them by \"cheesing\" the game and they considered it as \"hacking\". And since they're the ones who give the money, who can obligate them?\n\nAnd finally, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/baioArk/] CreamyBubble[/url] beated this game fully legit, and even recorded the whole session (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lFDcvX_9kk).

I rushed home, bought it the moment it came out, and proceeded upon my descent into the maddening hell that is this game.\n\nZero Reflex is self-explanatory. You're limited to moving around a perfectly circular track that surrounds a nameless Eye. The Eye employs different attack patterns in each level, which you progress through in a random order. You work your way through the game, avoiding the things that make you die. Continue to do so until you win. Harder than it sounds, I assure you. \"Ah,\" you think to yourself, \"well that may be so for you, puny mortal, but I am the God of the bullet-hell genre.\" Well then, my Lord, if that is the case then you should definitely buy this, but seriously, this game'll still make you cry.\n\nThe unique twist that Zero Reflex employs is that whenever you die to a level, you have to repeat a certain amount of the levels you had completed prior. Die in any of those, and you regress even further. The higher the difficulty you're playing at, the further you regress with each death, and the less life you're given in order to survive each level. Effectively the game has 60 levels, comprised of 20 unique level designs, each with three difficulty modifers. Beat all 20 once, and you're made to repeat them at a higher difficulty. In the final set of 20, you die after one hit, and are sent back three levels for each death. Please be warned; this can get very upsetting.\n\nI haven't quite beaten the game yet. I came incredibly close, before it decided to take what little hope I had of success, and beat me religiously with it until I gave up. And so I'm taking a break to write this review. However, I do believe that the $10,000 has already been won, given the amount of people with 100% of the achievements. That said, don't let it discourage you from buying this. For less than $5 it's a steal, the developers deserve your money, and what's more, it'll develop a love-hate relationship with you that you'll be telling your kids about for years. - \"Ah yes, Timmy.

As farther you progress though, you see that it gets very boring and repetititve, that's exactly the way to describe this game's punishment method: repetitive. When one dies, he gets sent back an amount of levels, and needs to replay it to the point where he was before. I am sure it looked nice on paper, but in reality it just gets extreamly boring. Then, the difficulty scaling, is absolute bulcrap, the attack pattern remains the same, it just goes faster, you got less lives, it sends you back EVEN MORE and optionally the eye shoots more bullets at you. Fake difficulty indeed. But appart of this, it has this little fun effect, doesn't look like a finished game to me, more like one of these generic android games which you download, try out and delete in 5 minutes, mostly cause as you see all the patterns, it gets boring. \n\nTL;DR: \nGameplaywise it is an \"OK\" game, could surely get better if the devs would put more effort into it and implement more stuff. \nSo no, I DON'T reccomend this game, but i'll surely keep an EYE on it, for what happens next. :)", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455309025, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491502087, "recommendationid": "21160626", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508041", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1479229505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 75, "steamid": "76561198057106658", "num_games_owned": 1781}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Negative review for the $10 000 scam advertising campaign.

This is a very interesting game because it brings in front a whole bunch of cool mechanics, and all of them are combined towards perfection in a stellar manner, as you would expect.\n\nWhat makes Zero Reflex great for me is the simple fact that this title offers you 30 seconds of amazing goodness. Simply put, you need to survive in a ton of worlds that have an eye at the center of it all, and that particular eye throws a ton of stuff at you. It can attack you directly, from behind or you will have to avoid numbers, small balls and so on. It\u2019s a unique combination of tools that can be accessed here, and all of them are offered in an amazing manner which you will love for sure.\n\nIt\u2019s exciting and fun what a simple reflex title can do, and I have to say that I really like their mechanic when you die. The idea is simple, when you die, you get transported to the previous level, so if you finished level 20, started 21 and you died there within those 30 seconds, then you will get back to level 20. This way the game doesn\u2019t really offer a setback, instead it\u2019s created to be more rewarding and fun as a whole, which you will love for sure.\n\nThe whole idea of passing all 60 challenges and winning $10000 is amazing, but let\u2019s face it, this can be a tough challenge even for those that are accustomed with this type of game. The title can be frustrating at times, true, but it\u2019s the entire nature of playing such a game that offers such a feeling, so you can expect yourself to spend a lot of time playing and trying to complete each level.\n\nI was impressed with Zero Reflex to be honest, as it does an amazing job when it comes to making its gameplay fun, accessible and quirky! It\u2019s a really cool game, and at the end of the day this is what matters the most. It\u2019s exciting, funny, but also frustrating, so it\u2019s basically the perfect combination for those that want to enjoy a challenge and also have fun playing this sort of title.

It's a simple and straight forward game as you simply avoid hazards left and right while trying to make it to the next level. While it had the $10,000 as the draw, I wanna say it didn't need it as it's simple gameplay is complemented by the use of expectation between levels very well. The mechanic of having to go back X amount of levels on failure is helped by the levels feeling so different from each other, yet having a familarity in them as well. It uses the content it has very well as contrasted against itself, and it's only helped by a strong visual aesthetic. The soundtrack, while not my cup of tea persay, definitely does the job in terms of action oriented gameplay. While I'd like to see more levels and some other game modes in the long run, for 3 bucks, it's hard not to say the game is worth it, as it reminds me of the simplicity of games like Super Hexagon, while keeping the action up.
