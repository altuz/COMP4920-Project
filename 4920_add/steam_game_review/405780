First of all, the graphic style is really ugly. It's full on uncanny valley with the emotionless character models and stiff animations, and the backgrounds are decent but some things you use are very hard to see. This is a time where pixelart would have made a huge difference and made the entire experience a lot more enjoyable. Because the overall plot (while fairly short) is pretty good. The \"supernatrual things happening on a remote research station\" is not the most unique of ideas, but it works. The writing is prettt good but the plot moves to fast, having the plot take place over a few more days and have some more character development would have med the end ressult better. \n\nThe puzzles are for the most part the usual point and click. There is not that much moon logic, but there are still some pretty obtuse puzzles with contrived solutions. The entire station is very small, about 10-12 rooms including the outside areas, so if you get stuck, there aren't that many areas you have to search, but some puzzles drove me nuts because the game wanted a VERY specific way of doing things. The other puzzles are when you are doing some deductions in your investigation and use a text parser to write words. I'm not entirely sold on that they are a good idea. But there are only a few of them. Overall Alpha Polaris is heavily flawed, but is barely a recommendation due to that the stoy had me interested the entire way and I'm a sucker for the setting.

The animated scenes could have had a lot better graphics tho and with the low quality graphics they shouldn't have tried to put in the mild sex scene, it just looked plain weird with the derpy graphics. Overall I enjoyed the game and the fact it brings in mythology, but nothing really shocked or wowed me. Also the puzzles were anoyingly hard becasue they don't really give you anything to go off of.\n\nOverall ambience was good and the story was good, just not great or amazing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501567000, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1501567067, "recommendationid": "33942798", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500960", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500105707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 323, "steamid": "76561198067401494", "num_games_owned": 147}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I had high hopes for this game and I was so bitterly disgusted and disappointed. You'd think it was made way earlier than just 2015 from the barely decent 3D models. I'd expect more from first-year art students. Some of the puzzles are okay, the rest are questionable and the ones requiring you to input words provide shoddy clues towards what those words are yet require you to be very specific. \n\nThe story seems to have been written by a bunch of exciteable teenage boys who did some Wikipedia-ing on old and tired horror monsters and who wanted a horror story with some good ol' fashioned 1980s slasher tit in it - I swear you see the only female character there naked before you actually see anything scary, and some of the dialogue options and achievements surrounding her (you get to find some of her underwear in a suitcase and comment on them) are in poor taste and... \n\n... I'm not going to blather on, because the title just isn't worth it. Really just truly disappointing. That's the only word I can use. Don't waste your money folks. \n\nAs for the devs - please take some time to mature before you make your next game. Brush up on your 3D skills and read some good horror novels for Odin's sake. As for your lady character, she wasn't treated the worst I've seen, but this sort of sexist crap was never fun, but for a 2015 release you're -really- pushing it.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500104849, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500104849, "recommendationid": "33553687", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499973", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 55, "total_reviews": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 22}}
