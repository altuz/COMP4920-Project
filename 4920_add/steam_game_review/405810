This is nothing like Rogue Legacy as a few people claim it seems like.  Rogue Legacy was fun to bash monsters in.   This, is a complete mess.  Controls when attacking monsters are a mess.  You will get hit most of the time attacking anything because your just a small group of pixels running into another group of pixels with a pathetic weapon.  The spells really don't explain what they do.  There are barely any gear drops early on from what I saw.  The appearance of the game coupled with the simplistic gameplay is NOT worth 10 bucks imo.  The whole game just screams simplicity.

It's not terrible, but I believe that at 10 dollars it is a waste of money.  Wait for a sale or something.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdBfAytZSzc\n\nThis game is a combination of action platforming and roguelite.  Being a fan of roguelites I was excited to get my hands on this game, as the art style looked really cool, but it falls short in so many areas that make it hard to recommend.\n\nFirst, platforming is paramount in this game.  That's perfectly fine, as I loved Risk of Rain and platforming is very important there, too.  However, Valzar's controls are sluggish at best.  You feel as though you're walking in molasses which makes traversing through the environment an absolute chore.  The worst part is that you have to trek your butt back to the exit door at the end of each room, and when you find yourself at the bottom of a pit having killed the last enemy, you curse the fact that you have to painstakingly climb your way up with the slow and clumsy movement.\n\nSecond, the combat, while initially fine, quickly devolves into chaos with unavoidable damage.  You move in molasses while your enemies fly toward you.  I've had enemies get knocked up then track me perfectly as they fall.  I've had enemies shoot endless strings of homing bullets that move faster than me.  I've been hit by so many things that I couldn't really understand than I could count.  Combat in these games is supposed to be fun, but in Valzar it is a chore.  A barrier in your way that you have to chip at for 2 billion years through many lives.  It could drive a man mad.\n\nThird, the game seems indecisive on what it feels like it needs to explain, mechanics-wise.  For the most part it's okay, but there's moments when you have to make a choice to keep your spells as they are or or replace it with something else.  You can test it out there, but sometimes the text is ridiculously vague, leaving you to make a blind choice.  You can always go back to the room, but that wastes valuable resources and time, forcing you to enter each room (rooms are moved to from a world map in a adjacent tile kind of system) even if you've already cleared it.\n\nFinally, on the nitpicky side, the UI and control scheme is just awkward.  The START button on the controller is unmapped, but Left Bumper opens the inventory.  What?!\n\nValzar's ideas are there, but the execution falls way short in the most important categories.  Unless there's massive patches to combat unavoidable damage or make platforming less infuriating, this game will be little more than frustrating.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452979865, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1452979865, "recommendationid": "20570574", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495218", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1459919460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 90, "steamid": "76561198268222814", "num_games_owned": 39}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Really nice background art but the characters are really simple and lacking.  Really they look like the most basic pixel art you can imagine.  Animations are ok.  The platforming controls are ok for the most part but it's hard to control your jump height.  The level design isn't very thought out.  Obviously its randomly generated so that may be part of the problem.
