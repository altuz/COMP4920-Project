I mentioned in my review of Night Dive's remaster of the original Turok (also highly recommended) that I was really looking forward to seeing what they could do with Turok 2 because it was my favorite installment in the series. My opening statement should let you know that they did not disappoint. Turok 2 is way bigger than Turok 1 in every aspect. Bigger baddies, much larger worlds to explore, and an incredible amount of weapons to toy around with. It's also quite a bit less linear than Turok 1 which leads to some pretty fantastic dinosaur hunting nastalgia. \n\nIf you loved the original version of Turok 2 this is an absolutely worthwhile purchase and even if you didn't and you're a fan of old school shooters, it's worth a look. Highly recommended, especially if you can catch it on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504669668, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1504669668, "recommendationid": "34769061", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504894157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2393, "steamid": "76561198061590699", "num_games_owned": 13}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "One of my favorite games I played as a kid.
