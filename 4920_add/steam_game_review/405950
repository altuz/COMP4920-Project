This time I absolutely made the correct choice.\n\n\u201cLowglow\u201d is a casual, meditative puzzle game composed of colors, lights and sound. Lights fall from the \u201csky\u201d, and must be guided by the player to that puzzle\u2019s target, somewhere on the screen. This is done by placing, and angling, one or several \u201cbouncy\u201d lines. There is no time restraint, no rush (except for one specific achievement.) The lights fall, and bounce, and change direction and speed based on color and type of the object they contact. \u201cLowglow\u201d is, in fact such a simple game, conceptually, that I find it difficult to produce an interesting review, though to not make the effort would be tragic.\n\nSometimes it seems the object of \u201cLowglow\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily to simply reach the target, but to create the most beautiful, and musical, pathway of flowing and singing lights in the process. I suspect there are \u201cbest\u201d methods, but the presence of achievements based on supra-par success indicates that there are many, perhaps dozens, of winning choices for each level. This is also a strong indication of replayability. The line(s) must be placed and angled very precisely, so a knowledge of physics and Newton\u2019s laws of gravity will certainly come in handy. Lines can very easily be placed, changed, moved and deleted. Controls could not be simpler.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long \u201cLowglow\u201d gameplay lasts, but after about 2 hours I have only 2 of 12 achievements, so I suspect the increased difficulty of further levels will add quite a lot of time to game completion. (As levels are locked until accessed, I can\u2019t speak further at this point.) As well, there is an editor in the works to add even more interest and wonder. Sometimes I find myself grinning from amazement at the complexity of a winning scene.\n\nAlong with \u201cLowglow\u201d gameplay is a pleasant and entertaining story of exploration, and (one presumes) spiritual growth. While interesting to some, this can be easily skipped by those that wish, as it doesn\u2019t seem necessary to the puzzle mechanics. The puzzle mechanics themselves seem to be such that as soon as it seems the game grows easy, something new is encountered that must be investigated thoroughly through vigorous investigation of the effects of gravity and propulsion.\n\n\u201cLowglow\u201d is a wonderfully entertaining game with a superior learning curve and significant challenges. It\u2019s a bit more expensive than most conceptually similar puzzle games, but by no means excessively so, and quite possibly the editor will add completely new dimensions to explore. It can be played very easily while doing almost anything else that you may find to be of less interest (such as meetings or conversations.)

I doubt there should be any \"motivation\" of the solution for some of them.  I solved vault 1 by first noticing a chaotic behaviour in the intersection of two forcing fields, then putting the line there and adjusting for around 100 different angles (subtle adjustments, obviously). And not surprisingly, even the smallest adjustment of the position will lead to a completely different outcome.\n\nI think when you have two constant force fields acting in the opposite direction with possible reflections (as in vault 1), the system becomes highly chaotic. I mean not even normal dynamical systems like a double pendulum but much more complicated governing systems. It is therefore almost impossible to know what should work out - you just have to keep trying.\n\nMore surprising is vault 4, it has a constant forcing field and an electric field (as the particle gets repelled), I believe the system should be 100x more complicated that the above case and have not yet figured out the correct position of the second line. You need a huge acceleration from the forcing field, but I don't know whats the initial condition. \n\nMaybe I am just not playing in the correct style, but aside from the bonus puzzles everything work out fine for me.\n\nAlso, it will be extremely helpful if there is a replay mode - Some of the curvatures are amazing.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449715074, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449715183, "recommendationid": "19593681", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505019", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1497759397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 860, "steamid": "76561197976293631", "num_games_owned": 413}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "quite enjoyable, from the music and sounds to the colors and visuals.  not violent or stressful, no time limits, and smooth play.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456490900, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1456490900, "recommendationid": "21473744", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503856", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1451353903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 191, "steamid": "76561198001898652", "num_games_owned": 50}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Great graphics, and easy to play around with.
