Im used to HC in Path of Exile so that is almost required to keep me interested.\n-I get to keep my skills upon dying, so no repetitive early game.\n-UI looks clean, Level design and Skill animations look good. \n-Hitting stuff has weight and impact to it .\n-Mouse movement, no WASD.\n\nWhat could be improved from my 2 hour experience with it:\n\n-Skill animations from melee hits take too long, so it's hard to dodge projectiles.\n-Gameplay could be a bit faster.\n-Can't bind LMB manually to something different than basic attack.\n-Volume sliders randomly went to zero multiple times, probably on alt-tabbing. When it doesn't happen, sound plays while tabbed out.\n-Character moves while navigating in menus.\n-Dodging stuff actively is always nice and i didn't see a dash ability. I hope the \"Charge\" one works for that, couldn't test it tho.\n-5 skill slots are be a bit too limiting, i see why its limited but for me the right number is 7+.\n-Loot doesn't fall to the ground directly, what ARPG does that?

Go play Torchlight or something.\n\nLong Story:\nOf Audio:\nThe sound work is horrible, i can still hear the static tap-tap of my footsteps. Some of the in-game narratives were goodish, but in general, they were in bad quality, and the poor acting made them seem a bit silly for such a 'hardcore' game. The game has no hit sounds/effects of any sort for the player, for example the enemy arrows just dissapper into you, which makes it really hard to tell if you are hit or not (in cae of you are shot from afar).\n\nOf Graphics:\nThe map looks nice, and the models are decent. Everything else? Complete utter poopoo. The splash at the start has worse quality than youtube videos from 2005. The intro video (which the game wants to show you every time you start the game) is ... hilarious? I can't honestly do nothing but laugh at it. And the game tries to sell itself as 'hardcore'. Well, you can't really be hardcore without the right atmosphere, which the horrible voice acting and poor intro video certainly do not set.\nThe items you equip seem to have no effecr on your appearance, which is understandable, for this is a game from small team with no time to model each item.\n\nOf The Map:\nThe levels are static, which is kind of fine, though i hope they will change this later on. Static maps really hurt replayability in these sort of games. What I don't understand is, why is there no automapping? Since the levels are static, it should be easy to implement, and I see no reason why it isn't there. (Back to this later on).\nNow, I must admit I only played the first level, which was somewhat dull. We got some prison cells, some zombies wandering(not) around, etc etc. The typical rpg dungeon settings. The first level seemed lacking, as because of the horrible voice acting i could not follow the story (had to consentrate not to giggle and cringe). It was just a bunch of rooms thrown together.\nThe boss of the first level was. well, 'lacking', so to speak. The combat was closer to point and click then actual arpg combat, for the boss only seemed to have 2 spells; one which was AoE that hit basicly the whole room, doing little damage (so easy to soak, no reason to stop hitting/move away), and some sort of curse(?) or likes, that cast a kinda nice looking effect on the player, making them unable to move (but could still hit the boss), and after a period of time, inflicted some damage. There seemed to be no way to play around these spells, so the bossfight was pure dps race.\n\nThe Combat:\nI really like combat, like, really. When i play a ARPG game i expect fell-refined combat system with multiple ways to aproach the fight, that supports different playstyles, and suchs. Now, the combat in Sunken is pretty much point and click. Press 1 for damage, left-click when OOM, and Q for heal. The game decides not to explain the combat system in anyway, which could be another failed attempt to make the game feel 'hardcore'. Even the first bossfight was a dull DPS race. During my second run on the first level, i found 2 spells, so there seems to be some spellcasting system in place. However, the damage of spells is static, and spellcasting is limited by a) mana b) cooldown, and from my experience, there is no way to affect cooldown, so it's the limiting factor. With static damage and static cooldowns, going for caster type doesn't seem reasonable.\n\nThe Character:\nYou get experience points from killing monsters. You level up when you receive enough experience. Each time you level up, you get 5 'points' you can assign to attributes. Each attribute does something 'Each click', which seems to be a ARPG term i do not know, but I assume they meant by attribute level. Dexterity, for example, improves armor by 0.5, and crit chance by 0.1%. You start with 10 points in each attribute, so for example to max out crit chancem you have to be level 190, and by then you have 100% crit chance, meaning your attacks do 150% damage. Sounds rad, right? I haven't played long enough to actually confirm this, but this is what the game tells me when i first choose which attribute i want to level. I'll most likely write a full analyzis on how much each attribute affects gameplay later on.\n\nThe 'Hardcore':\nThis game aims to be 'hardcore', I like that. I like hardcore games. In fact, I'm designing a game that I'd like to call hardcore. But what makes a game hardcore? Sunkens ideology seems to be, that stripping down user experience is 'hardcore'. The lack of minimap/automapping, the lack of tutorial, or any explainations of basic game mechanics or even showing the user the keybindings (or list the buttons for the action bar thingy) seems to be their way of doing hardcore.\nFor me, hardcore is more about being punishing. The game should be hard to beat, not hard to play. Players should have to think about which their choice will be, and the game should support that. Sunkens total lack of transparency makes it really difficult for me to recommend it, as it is nowhere near 'the fun of a hardcore game'.\n\nThe Conclusion:\nIt's not ready. The developers have fallen into some pretty basic pitfalls of game design. Luckily, these can be fixed, and there is lots of material available on how to do this. here is some of my suggestions.\n\n- Remove the intro. Seriously, it's bad.\n- Add a way to skip the ingame narratives.\n- Add a tutorial. The first level could act as sort of a tutorial zone that introduses the player the mechanics. The is plently of material on this avaiable on the interwebs.\n- Add a hit effect to the player. It's the simplest things that make the combat so much better.\n- Add floating texts to combat. I want to see how much damage i did, and how much i received. Even ascii-based roguelikes have these nowadays. Easy to implement.\n- Add a way to hit while standing still, even when not aiming at any monster. Basic ARPG.\n- This game does _NOT_ need more content at this point. It needs better gameplay. Look up how to 'juice' the game. Even hardcore games require some juice to make the combat more pleasing.\n\nThat's about it. Summing it up again, this game is nowhere near the 6\u20ac pricetag it has now, but I'm still looking up to see how it develops.
