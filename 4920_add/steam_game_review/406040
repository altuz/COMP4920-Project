The narrator is smooth.  The instructions are clear.  The interaction is a nice touch.  You don't just have someone droning on about Access.  You get a bit of hands-on too.  Granted, it's structured but still.  The interaction helps reinforce concepts and ideas.\n\nIt covers quite a bit of basic material to get you up and running in MS Access.  This course even includes a chapter on Office 365 and the cloud.\n\nYou won't find advanced topics like External Data, Web Apps, or VBA but if you're new to MS Access or need a refresher, this is absolutely the course for you.  \n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503688231, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1503688231, "recommendationid": "34487871", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500742322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 180, "steamid": "76561198027781041", "num_games_owned": 51}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Didn't actually teach anything.
