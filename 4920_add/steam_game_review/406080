Game is built to grind and can be repetative.\nPretty much one of the oldest clicker games out there.\nMaybe get on sale (>50%)\n9.5/10\n\nLong Review\n\nSo I see many of negative reviews and I do agree with many of them, but I will have to totally recommend this little piece of gem as I grab it as soon as I saw it.\n\nI first played this game maybe 8 or 9 years ago, don't even remember how I even got my hands on it and I totally loved it, made my day everyday seeing my colony grow and fight with the believible surroundings that you can pretty much live it as if it was real. Yes, you may probably get this game for free somewhere out there (just like many games in steam) but I just wanted to own this little gem in my library and also a way to support the devs that make my(as well as many's) childhood a little bit brighter. I mean 2$ that cost less than a cup of coffee. You have no obligation to buy this game so please don't whine about it for it being not free, no one's forcing you to buy the game.\n\nYes, to point out many reviews out there, that this game is indeed repetitive and is a grinding game. I mean which grinding game is not repetitive? If you don't like to grind then by all means dont get this game, no need to fill the reviews  with all the negatives its not fair for the game since you guys are just stating the obvious. \n\nTo put it in a polite way, clicker game, is better suited term than a grinding game. This maybe infact one of the oldest clicker games out there. Note that I spent over 16 hours in the game and that contribute to around 6000 days in the in-game time. Say I click around 30 - 60 clicks (combinding fights and whatnot) I spend the time clicking around 270,000 times!! I am not a fan of the clicker genre but man this game is fun and also frustating at times. I sometimes think this is one of those games that are made to make chidrends shut up. \n\nSo all in all, its a pretty decent game with hand-drawn annimations and keep in mind this is a pretty darn old game. As I mentioned, this is not a game for everyone, especially those that don't like games being repetitive. Grab it while on sale or even at full price I would say it is worth it.\n\n9.5/10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445686986, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1445687031, "recommendationid": "18655768", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506996", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1476725651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 91, "steamid": "76561198022483562", "num_games_owned": 107}, "votes_funny": 16, "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": "2", "review": "Ant War: Domination is set in 1945, just after the fall of the German empire.

The whole game is a clicking simulator, which isn't bad for some, as games of the like are usually great ways to pass the time, which is one redeeming factor the game has. The art. HOOOOOLY CRAP the art. The whole game is literally clip art images that you can easily find on google, some of which have been animated very simply (we're talking a few pivot points on some images in like, Adobe AfterEffects). The music and sound effects are maddingly repetitive, as well as the \"battle\" sequences which are just some more clicking (if you win you get some stuff if not oh well).\n\nEssentially, this game is horrendous, if you buy it, use it to waste time and only to do so.

I remember the old version when i was a kid, it was a lot better, i had a lot more fun. Now with this? I want a refund... \nOne thing that i hated right off the bat speaking of battles, was that you COULD in the old game, spam click the attack button to be done quicker, instead you slowly, slowly..... slowly.......... kill your enemy\n\nUpgrades are a joke, after 5 levels the low tier are relics, and by level 20 all 'powerups' are non existant. After you hit level 35 you just go to the beach and spam Go, it's that easy.\n\nRandom events are completely wiped, sure you still get them, but like 2% work. I found myself going \"Oh, another storm... *Clicks Go*\" when in the past i used to think \"well this is about to be painful\" because your nest would be taken down by a certain amount, and that would both hurt your defense for battles, and limit your food storage. \n\nGrinding for population is probably the most irritating thing ever. As i said you spam Go constantly with the exception of a few battles. I remember it used to take me just under 5 mins to hit level 10 now? It took about 3 hours due to food shortage, only getting 1 per second (4-5 per day) and battles.\n\n\n\nI can go on and on, but i'm not going to. If you want to play this, go ahead i'm not stopping you, but if you enjoyed the old game. Find something else... Avoid this like a plague. For it is boring, hair pulling inducing, insanity.
