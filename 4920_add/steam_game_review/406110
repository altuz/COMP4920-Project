It kind of reminds me of games like Lunar, Grandia and Phantasy Star. We've had quite a few games of this type released over the last few years, but as a true fan of the genre, I was a bit disappointed with many of them, since they felt a bit dull, as if being 2D JRPGs with turn-based battles and a semi-decent story was supposed to be enough to make them good games. I've only just begun playing Asdivine Hearts (1h+), so it might be just wishful thinking on my part, but I am getting a different, refreshing vibe from it, which I didn't get from other such recent games. \n\nAs for the game itself, there's nothing really fancy about it for me to write about. The graphics are decent (anime style) and the music is fun to listen to. No voice-acting, though. Movement control is a little limited and awkward (I'm playing with a XBox360 controller), but otherwise, everything is straight-forward and intuitive. If you've ever played a JRPG before, you'll feel right at home. The battles are classic turn-based JRPG style. There seem to be plenty of skills and abilities, using a Rubix/Jewels system, which is new to me, but seems flexible and easy enough to learn and use. More about that to come after I've played some more.\n\nThe best part, so far, seems to be the story. It feels funny and interesting just enough to carry the game, without giving you the feeling that the developers tried too hard to make you laugh (a feeling I've been getting too often for my taste, recently). Also, I'm not sure if it means anything, but at least so far, this game has no achievements and no trading cards. At first I thought it was a disadvantage (a minor one, at that), but the more I thought about it, the more it felt like this game might be good enough on its own to keep me interested, regardless. \n\nAnyway, I've been bothering with a relatively long review, considering I've only been playing for an hour or so, because this game does feel different. I hope I can explain it better after I've played some more. If and when I do, I'll be sure to update this review.\n\n[u]EDIT (Feb/12/2016, 12h):[/u]\nAfter moving farther along in the game (12 hours total), my impressions haven't changed much since my initial review. \n\nThe akward control remains the only significant negative issue I have with this game. The story and characters seem to be decent, at the very least, as they keep me curious enough to continue playing. The battle system is very well balanced, as it manages to be simple and intuitive without getting too repetitive. The Jewels system sure adds a nice twist. What I like about it the most, is that it allows you to change jewels any time. It means that if, for example, you encounter a boss that uses poison attacks often, before the battle you can equip more poison resistence jewels on the expense of other things. It's surely a useful tactical advantage for those who choose to use it.\n\nThis is a cute and simple JRPG.

I'm enjoying this game. The writing is amateur and non-serious, and I find myself smiling and even laughing out-loud when I read some of the dialog between the characters, so win for that. Not everything needs to be super-serious. I can tell there's a story in there, as the creators use classic, and cheesy, anime-style \"internal dialogues\" to heighten the drama surrounding certain characters and events.\n\nCombat feels FAST, most of the time. There are a few abilities, like \"BIte\", that have exhibit a delay I find undesirable. But those delayed-abilities are few. Did I mention lots of abilities? If you're familiar with the original Phantasy Star series, you'll enjoy the differentiation between \"magic\" and \"techniques\". Awesome spell-effects? Sort-of. Some are pretty \"WOW\", others are \"meh\", and some I find \"funny\". The names of the abilities are definitely tongue-in-cheek, and in a way I very much appreciate the willingness to digress from the standard \"fire, ice, lightning\" (but there is a lightning spell).\n\nThe combat system is complex; attacks, techniques, magic, limit-breaks, formations, trust-charges, etc. I just got my first trust-charge and WHOA, freaking awesome. The creators definitely put effort into making combat fun and fast. I feel encouraged to spam my techniques and magic.\n\nThe game is very, very friendly, too. Save anywhere. If your party wipes, you can retry the battle that you wiped on; hello, awesome?! If you win a battle, but lose one-or-more party-members, when the battle is over, those party-members are still alive, with 1 HP. THANK YOU!\n\nIf you find a pentagram that heals you, you can use it endlessly, and walk around in its vicinity blowing shit up with your magic and techniques. Did I mention auto-combat?

For example, stopping in front of a door or a NPC will require precision, and you must be directly in front to interact. It's like you are being forced to run all the time, and I couldn't find the walk button if it exists.\nThe menus look like large buttons with no clear prompts about which button does what on the controller, so the controls have a learning curve that I found to be a lot longer than it should be.\nThe music is really bad, and the sound effects are very tinny basically crap in my opinion, and the sound sliders blast the music and sound effects painfully high if you raise the slider too high.\nThe battle system tries to keep it interesting with a wide variety of enemies, but the battle frequency is very high, and I just found these battles to be more annoying than fun.\n\nI am no stranger to games where you grind a lot, but you have to find the right balance of fun and challenge.\n\nI expect more out of an RPG that I am going to spend potentially hundreds of hours on, and this game is a piece of garbage compared to other great titles available today.

With respect towards those who haven't played this game yet, I won't spoil the plot (essentially, the characters are escorting a \"light deity\" (in the form of a cat) to regain his/her/it's former power in order to defeat the \"shadow deity\"), but it seems pretty run of the mill for an rpg as far as plot goes. Where this game really shines (for me anyway) is the controller interface. I'm more of a console gamer (much to the chagrin of some of you here, I'm sure...), so I'm not too savvy with keybord and mouse controls (I'm getting used to them though the \"Warhammer 40,000\" series among others, however, so don't crucify me, if you would be so kind...) but fourtunately for myself, this game allows for the use of a controller. As far as the controller function and game mechanics go: they're decent, not perfect, but decent. I can't say they're \"smooth\" (traveling around the overworld is a bit akward), but at least I don't find myself stuck in walls or otherwise unable to move.\n\nAs far as the animation goes, it's slightly better than what you would typically expect from an SNES or Genesis/Megadrive title.\n\nAll in all, This game has earned four and a half stars from me, and Kemco has earned a customer.

Its not abysmal, its not mediocre either.\n\nMy first feelings after playing this game for a bit was regret and disapointment.\n\nWhich seems to be a trend for many new games on Steam nowadays, but I digress.\n\n!!BEWARE!! This is a mobile port. \n\nWhich is important information that is surprisingly missing from the steampage and even other steam reviews for the game so far. The quality of the overall product as far as I can see does not justify 10 US dollars ON PC and there are many better games in the same genre available on steam. The only place this is actually hinted is in the company discription. \n\nIt might be fine on mobile but its a different ball game here on PC.\n\nAlthough it supports controllers, movement using the analogue sticks feel laggy, uncoordinated and unresponive. Clearly showing how the game was initially built for touch screens. This is further proven by the clunky UI that is also evidently designed for touch screens instead of being adapted to PC. Elements of the UI also serve to detract from the artistry and flashiness of the moves during battle. \n\nThereby making the overall PC enjoyability of this title below that of the mobile version. \n\nAs a side note: Unless there is some way to disable specific elements of the UI, I'm curious as to why it does not show up in the screenshots in order to display the games fundamental mechanics (its only barely seen in the trailer in the background).\n\nThe characters themselves fit all the highly popular japanese character archetypes in every possible stereotypical way. Each character with any remote amount of backstory was clearly designed around an archetype rather than created with any one of said archetypes applying to them after creation. \n\nAs such many of said characters have clear psychological problems, from spontaneous outbursts of lethal violence for seemingly little to no reason to inability to display emotions and understandings of any kind of common sense.\n\nTo list some positives however.\n\nPersonally I really do like the art style for the cat, \nThe music is not bad. \nThe moves are flashy and sometimes nice to look at. \nThe jewel customization system is also innovative and novel.\n---------\n\nAnyway if you're a fan of anime fantasy stories, common japanese romantice subplots, cat gods and like reading (because theres no voice acting whatsoever) then perhaps this game is for you. But do yourself a favor and get the mobile version instead, clearly thats what this game was designed for. \n\nBut in my eyes this is a mobile port, with unrelatable 2D cutout characters placed in a generic fantasy world with generic romantic and inexplicable subplots centering around the harem master main character (and only relevant male in the entire game, perhaps the cat is also a guy who knows) facing a generic enemy based in a generic conflict between Light and Dark. With light naturally being the good guys and dark being the bad guys.\n\nSo therefore its not the game for me and therefore I do not recommend it.\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454599782, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454599782, "recommendationid": "20951065", "language": "english", "votes_down": 36, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481771", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1477967245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 107, "steamid": "76561198022102292", "num_games_owned": 41}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Its a decent old style rpg.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477984280, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1477984280, "recommendationid": "26349723", "language": "english", "votes_down": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484870", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1458763261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 344, "playtime_forever": 222, "steamid": "76561198015075204", "num_games_owned": 1358}, "votes_funny": 23, "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "review": "felix the cat is a pretty cool dude, but unfortunately the game includes people who are not douchebag cats which does tend to drag it down somewhat. 8 meowzers out of 10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454452601, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1454452601, "recommendationid": "20920906", "language": "english", "votes_down": 40, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437292", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1499965401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 414, "steamid": "76561198360416860", "num_games_owned": 47}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I played the game back when it was released for the iphone, and i must say i really enjoyed the game so damn much, it may not have the best story line nor characters, but for a 9.99 game, it is indeed worth it; of course im a rpg fanboy since my very first game, and i must play every single rpg that comes out no matter the platform; when the game released for the pc i decided to play yet again, and i was happy when i discover that Microtransactions were removed or replaced actually.\n\nI recommend this game a 100%, is just to kill time, it wont take long to finish nor master; way too easy to learn the mechanics; the rubix system is easy to manage, dont pay attention to the guys that says that is useless or bad designed, they probably didn't try other builds, when they realized you have to be careful with the jewels you want for your Chart.\n\nTalking bout the music, well if you've been playing some Kemco games for a while, you already know that the music pretty much stays the same; same goes for dungeons, or well at least they have the same formula, but they are actually good.\n\nthe only con for the game are the quests, the quests are the same over and over, kill X monsters in X area, and that goes forever.\n\nAnd of course THE GAME HAS GRINDING IN IT, IS A RPG for god sake ppl, if u keep listing grinding as a con, you clearly need to play other games jesus...", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506356285, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506356285, "recommendationid": "35205890", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "total_reviews": 13, "num_reviews": 13, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 3}}
