After a few blocks you will get a block that gives you a choice of making that block a gem that will break all the blocks of that colour that are touching. Sounds simple enough and it is and often a simple concept makes for an addictive compelling game (like Tetris/bean machine, puyo pop, etc.). \n\nThe game has a zodiac theme and a small star mascot that narrates the story and shows you the game mechanics. personally I found the star and the sound it makes annoying as all hell. The \"story\" is forgettable and the enemies being star constellations isn't very engaging. There are no power-ups with the exception of a  \"break all blocks of that colour\" warp gem.\n\nThere is some fun to be had here if you really like this sort of game, which I do but this was just not fun or engaging. It seemed like luck if you got the opportunity to change a block into a gem and the game often just didn't give you the gem you needed on higher difficulties. This wasn't because you didn't place blocks right it was just you are never given the chance to break them. Which made losing feel like you were cheated rather than beaten.\n\nAlso every time you play you start from scratch. There is no save and as far as I can tell you beat the 12 zodiac signs then go around again at higher difficulty, then again, then again until the game cheats you to death. \n\nI am not sure how they could fix this game, the main problem is with the mechanic which is the game itself. There are plenty of falling block games out there and most are better than this one. I cannot recommend I am afraid. And someone needs to kill that star (or shoot the mascot designer. Looks like one of those Milky way chocolate stars. Must have taken all of 5 seconds to draw/design. Very poor indeed).", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494246032, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494246182, "recommendationid": "31624130", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1}}
