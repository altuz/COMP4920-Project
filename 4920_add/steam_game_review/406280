It is totally online so you will find other players between your wanderings on the map, which is pretty big by the way.\n\nI thought the game would be more impressive if it had a singleplayer mode, with remarkable characters and a storyline that invites you to play more. After a while playing I lost a sense of purpose, and just wanted to keep my character alive as much as possible.\n\nThe game is good, yes, you will entertain yourself for a few hours and reward you for exploring, but the absence of a singleplayer mode and small character animation bugs can take you away from the immersion of being present in a dystopic and post apocalyptic world like this.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492458049, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1492458049, "recommendationid": "31205975", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "total_reviews": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 14}}
