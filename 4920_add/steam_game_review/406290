For me this is hands down the best board game of all time but not everyone will agree with that assessment. The digital version is pretty decent. If you've played any digital board games on Steam you've likely experienced some bugs or UI issues. I haven't noticed any bugs but the UI will take a bit to adjust to. Overall the UI isn't as bad as many other digital board games I've played but I can't say any of them have been perfect.\n\nThis is not a simple game to grasp. I struggled (heh) with it for several days before I decided to read some basic strategy tips and learned from my mistakes. But now that I have the basics down I find playing both sides interesting and challenging in their own ways. The two sides are pretty well balanced but the USSR will probably feel more powerful to a new player. The game is designed for the USSR player to initiate the conflict while the USA player reacts and counter-plays. It is for that reason I highly recommend you play as the USA until you understand the basics and can beat the AI.\n\nIf you enjoy challenging strategy games and have an interest in the Cold War this is one of the best games on Steam for you.\n\n10/10 Board Game\n8/10 Digital Version", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506992190, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506992190, "recommendationid": "35431880", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505578", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1504768071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 132, "steamid": "76561198043195303", "num_games_owned": 338}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "A Wargame without the war, Twilight Struggle is a seemingly simple game.

The speed of play is greatly enhanced.
