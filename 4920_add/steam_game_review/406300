The game itself is easy to learn but right off the bat some of the main menu get\u2019s confusing. The text is hard to read and the ranking system doesn't make a lot of sense at a glance. Playing it for a little bit longer i now understand the \u201cmatch\u201d and \u201ctourney\u201d mode, however I have no clue how the champion mode works. When I actually started playing it was difficult at first with the sensitivity set to the max in options as well as the sounds that was currently blasting in my ear. After turning those down the game got fun, blasting through the first ranks it then got more difficult. The power move was first overpowered but as the bots got more difficult there reaction time grew making the game great to train reflexes. With a few patches I could see myself playing this if I got board or my internet went down. If they added multiplayer this game would be fantastic. If you have a little spare money this game if worth it.\n\nCons: starts music to the max volume\n           starts with sensitivity to the max\n           text is difficult to read\n           non multi player\n           gamemodes and ranks do not make sense at first\n\nPros: Very skill based \n         Fun if you just need something to do\n         Bots actually challenge you at a certain level\n         Music and sound effects fit the game nicely \n         Little to no bugs\n\nPS: Please note that all cons can be fixed in updates but i'm not in charge of that ~seal\n\n\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446252999, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446252999, "recommendationid": "18780778", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519625", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1498984294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1107, "steamid": "76561198074980177", "num_games_owned": 21}, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "for an air-hockey game really nice.
