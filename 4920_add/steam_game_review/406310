Ive never seen an actual lobby (only played a few times with friends). Just take a look at the steam forums; on average 1 post a month and its some lonely person asking if anyone else still plays this game. They dont get their response until the next month when the next unfortunate is asking the same, only person number 1 has already given up. (Also try finding someone that speaks the same language, haha).\n\nI can only reccomend buying this game if you have friends that play or maybe you gift it to them I dont know. Its dead.\n\nThe whole idea of the game is great and tons of fun! Its just unfortunate that... its dead.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500782951, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500783029, "recommendationid": "33735765", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "total_reviews": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 11}}
