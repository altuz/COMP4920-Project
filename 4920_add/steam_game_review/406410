But I can't in good concience recommend purchasing this product. Not for $20, not for the $10 I got it on sale for... Maybe at $2 I'd consider it passable.\n\nIn 45 minutes I'd played through all the content with a friend and we were both exceedingly underwhelmed. The game has remarkably low production values. The low quality assets are used poorly. The interface is awkward. Gameplay is buggy and some features flat out don't work.\n\nOf the 18 holes I was impressed by the creativity of 3 or 4 of them, but that's hardly a glowing recomendation for a minigolf videogame. It's not so much polish that the game lack as it is professionalism. People complaining it's just a bunch of unity assets amateurly hacked together are not just being mean. Many of the course decorations are small art assets that have been absurdly upscaled resulting is stretched textures and super obvious low poly models. \n\nThe fact the tutorial starts with the developer introducing themself as a voice over and then passively agressively insulting you when the club bugs out and you don't hit the ball correctly on your first try really sets the tone for the level of quality you can expect going forward from that point.\n\nMultiplayer is more like simultaneous single player. You can't see each others balls, theres no score comparison... Heck, you don't even get a total of your own score and have to work out for yourself if you are under par. Teleport is janky and the ability to teleport to your ball is buried in a menu rather then bound to the controls. \n\nThe game is in Early access at time of review and even free I'm not sure it's really worth my time. Like I said the developer has some creative potential and well done to him for actually getting a product up on his own rather then just dreaming about it. But he might want to rethink his approach if he wants his product to be taken seriously.\n\nAs it stands anyone looking for a VR minigolf experience I highly recommend Cloudlands Minigolf.
