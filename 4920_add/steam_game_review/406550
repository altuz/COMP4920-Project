The plot was a perfect set-up for murder mysteries so when I heard Umineko involves a lot of witches and magic I wasn't sure if I'm gonna like it, in a sense it was like how Battler was trying to deny the witch using human logic. I was so sure that putting magical elements in the story would just complicate and mess up the setting, and it did but surprisingly not in a bad way. Infact Umineko's story thrives on these themes. \n\nThis is what makes Umineko great! by adding these elements it forces you to keep thinking (\"Turn the chessboard around\") to understand it further. It never felt repetitive even if the events themselves keeps repeating, and its all thanks to the addition of magic. never have I thought that magic would really add to the mystery side of the story, to help you better understand what I mean I'll give you a minor background [strike]spoiler[/strike] of the story.\n\nIt starts of with a annual family conference about the inheritance of the familiy's wealth on an isolated island called rokkenjima, when a typhoon passes through isolating the island. The basic premise of the story is  [spoiler] a battle between Battler a resident of the island and BEATRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICHE the rumored golden witch who supposedly gave the head of the family 10 tons of gold which became the foundation of the familiys wealth, and in the center of it all an epitapth containing the location the hidden gold promising to give both gold and headship to the person who solves the riddle. The battle of Inheritance turns into a massacre said to be a ritual to ressurect the witch. The tragedy would then sparked a game with both trying to explain how the massacre occured, with no one truly understanding what really happened to the island it created the illusion of the massacres being done by a witch. where magic and reality can simultaneously exist until the truth is revealed. the fight continues with Battler using [strike]twisted[/strike] Human logic to explain that the mysteries can be done by humans while Beatrice explaining the existences of witches and magic as the culprit. Putting them into an Endless battle to understand their own existence and to reveal what really happend in the island.[/spoiler]\n\nFrom there an epic story about mystery and fantasy is set. Honestly the story is so crazy and confusing that it makes it look like it doesn't make sense, yet the way Umineko explains it makes it sensible, Kinda like a paradox. The writing is really brilliant from references to its underlying themes and use of logical concepts such as Devils proof, Hempels raven and Schrodingers cat, the game perfectly encorporated them to further enhance the story. The soundtrack on the other hand is outstanding it really adds to the experience from the cheerful organ pieces that plays on tense situations to its haunting orchestrals and calm piano pieces, its such a pleasure listening to. I can go on about the things I love about this game but I'll stop it at that. \n\n[h1]Truly this game is an ENDLESS! masterpiece![/h1] if I can say it in red but I'll settle it with blue since this is my own opinion.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505394829, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505459130, "recommendationid": "34948208", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1501812945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4542, "steamid": "76561198213361692", "num_games_owned": 26}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "Nearly all stories 'concentrates' time, that is, a reader can spend like two hours to read about a story of one weak span.
