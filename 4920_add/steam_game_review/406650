It's hard to make characters interesting when you're not sure how the player will be interacting with them.

'Ratings War' is, however, far more comprehensively realised than most examples of it's kind on your bookshelf. Though I wouldn't discourage children from playing the game I would emphasize it's maturer writing style and suggest it's suitability for any age, according to taste.\n\nThe story itself is engaging, reasonably original and has a good sense of narritive cohesion, though now on my second run-through I'm unsure whether the choices I made had any real impact on the story itself, rather affecting other more superficial (but equally important) features. It's difficult to give a specific example without spoilers, but romantic implications, for instance, may arise that affect your gameplay.\n\nI picked it up at \u00a31.34 in a sale but at it's normal \u00a32.00 price 'Ratings War'  more than reasonable for an evening's entertainment. With a playtime of around 3 hours and some deal of replayability it's definitely worth a look.

It's competently executed and I've recommended it to several people already.  The cyberpunk theming is nice, but not deep, which I think is actually the fault of the character POV rather than the author.  It isn't sci-fi to the character!  The author does seem to have given thought to the implications of the technologies presented.\n\nI can't give an unmixed recommendation, but I'm going to limit myself to one big complaint.  My biggest complaint with the game is with a certain character who is both 'the cavalry' at a critical point, and then talking about throwing the PC under the bus a few pages later.  Come on, that doesn't make sense.  An asshole can save the day without ceasing to be an asshole.  \"I don't like you, but I'm not letting THAT happen to you,\" is a thing people can be motivated by.\n\nThe protagonist herself (her by default; player can choose otherwise) is a peaceful but tenacious individual who is sympathetic in every path I've played so far.  I like that decisions are typically given sympathetic treatment whether they conform to the preferences of people outside of journalism or not.  People aren't villains in their own POV.  (I wonder if accepting that bribe is treated sympathetically, too...)  In general, the game's writing is empathetic, and save for the character I complained about in the second paragraph every character major or minor is given some footing for the decisions they make.

The protagonist and her helper quickly talk about where to meet and it is decided that you meet at a coffee. You can't decide differently and you still get an achievement for drinking a coffee. This just feels odd. Espacially since the consequences of meeting in the office rather than in a coffee place are talked about, instead of giving you the possibility to think about the different outcomes and make a reflected decision, changing the path the story would take.[/spoiler]\n\nAll in all i am fairly dissapointed at this game atm, and will consider whether or not i will refund it within the next days.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1449179715, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1449179715, "recommendationid": "19466006", "language": "english", "votes_down": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480478", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1444078687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 322, "steamid": "76561198078680527", "num_games_owned": 183}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I really enjoyed this game.
