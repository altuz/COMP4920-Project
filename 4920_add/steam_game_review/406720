Hitman Style- You have the ability to change outfits, hide bodies and either take out your targets the good old fashion way of a bullet to the head or using the environment to your advantage. \n\n==The 50/50==\n1. The story sadly never really caught my attention. There isn't much characters to really get interested in and once you start your mission you feel no connection but to just run through it. \n\n==The Bad==\n1. Audio - I found a lot of audio issues such as enemies just spamming words at you, audio cutting in and out or non existing any more such as gun sounds sometimes randomly just cut out. \n\n2. Crashes- I found this game would randomly crash, most noticably after beating a level or restarting a level. \n\n3. Bugs - I a lot of bugs such as doors not opening, A.I phasing through objects such as walls, floors and doors. And sometimes killing my target has them flying off the map alerting everyone to my position.....\n\n4. A.I - The a.i is rather dumb. I found times the enemies would just walk down the same hallway and notice me pointing my gun or shooting their fellow  teammate only to see them decide to look at a dead body and walk off....I also found times after running around the base in the same outfit they caught me in they would not even bat a eye...\n\n==Overall==\nHonestly I wanted this to be good but sadly with all the issues I had, I have to recommend not picking this up unless it's on sale.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505878651, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505878651, "recommendationid": "35076932", "language": "english", "votes_down": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506097", "voted_up": false}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 23, "total_reviews": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 25}}
