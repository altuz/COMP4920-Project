It's not a game, it's not even a simulator -- it's more like an interactive art project someone made for SVA and then figured they could sell on Steam. The music is beautiful, haunting even, and I'd absolutely be willing to pay for the soundtrack, but that's about the only worthwhile part. It doesn't feel like the makers have ever been to a real graveyard, especially not one as old as Boon Hill is supposed to be. Graveyards that old aren't as empty as this game's setting, for one thing; 90% of the \"graveyard\" is empty space with a smattering of tombstones in small family clusters, even though it's supposed to date back to the 1700s at least. And we're not talking \"ruins\" or \"stubs that are old, broken tombstones, now illegible\" -- it's just EMPTY. Lots of grass, maybe a tree, but that's it. Also, it feels like they never finished this \"game\", since many of the gravestones can't be read -- and I'm certain that's not intentional because they AREN'T blank, they're simply not things with which you can interact in the \"game.\" Clicking on them does nothing. Most tombstones have writing that can be read, some are blank when you click on them, but this third group? Just...not there, as far as the program is concerned. That serves no narrative purpose, there's no explanation for it, and it really just ruins the immersion.  Sort of like that Spanish tombstone with the name of \"Inygo Montoya\" on it. Har har. Also, the Spanish tombstones? Yeah, they're pretty clearly just English things someone ran through Google translate and then incorrectly typed out. I wouldn't make fun of \"stupid Americans [who] can't read [Spanish tombstones]\" (that's the translation for one of them) when you can't even manage basic Spanish spelling, grammar and vocabulary. \"Mayora\" =/= \"Mayoria.\" I assume the same would be the case for the ones in Cyrillic script. I'm not really sure why they felt this needed to be Kickstarted, but good on them for being entrepreneurs, I suppose.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446977022, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1446977022, "recommendationid": "18949187", "language": "english", "votes_down": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568480", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1464509952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 16, "steamid": "76561197997517073", "num_games_owned": 446}, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": "1", "review": "I have experienced loss twice this year, two friends dead before their time.

Someone finding that stone one hundred years from now wouldn't know the difference.\nBoon Hill isn't real, but mortality is. Even knowing this game is fictional can't stop me from imagining a life connected to every headstone I found. When I stumbled onto what seemed to be a section for children, I had to leave. I felt real pain.\nIf you have never known death, I envy you. Maybe Boon Hill won't affect you like it did me.

Would I laugh? Would I cry? Would there be hidden zombies I have to fight? While those concepts were few and far between I came to the realization that the game is much more than what people expect from a \u201ctypical\u201d game experience. It\u2019s not meant to apprise to tell any set story but aims to set in motion for the user to create their own experience. To define their own meanings.\n\nAt face value, Boon Hill can seem as if it\u2019s a modest graveyard simulator but in actuality the graveyard is as disparate as it is eerie. The music is fantastic. It absolutely gives an otherworldly feel that sends chills down your spine as you interact within the world and its muses. Though the sound is simply an undertone to the real joy of play which is the diversity in reading the epitaphs.\n\nFrom the start of the game you already know there will be plenty to explore as each epitaph you come across is far different from the previous. Some are silly such as one that was simply \u201cThis sucks I\u2019m scared of worms.\u201d While there can be others that hit you right into the feels such as \u201cThe sun shall rise and find your eyes filled with tears for me for I know that you love me as much as I hold love for you and with the passing of enough days the tears will dry but each time you think of me know I miss you too.\u201d Boon Hill can definitely surprise you when you least expect it.\n\nIn the graveyard you walk and keep walking. There is no HUD, there are no map indicators, and there are no mission objectives. You venture onwards unknowingly between yourself, some NPCs, and the massive amount of dead that slumber in their graves. What I take from this is that this game is about the representation of our lives. We don\u2019t quite know where we\u2019re going until we cross paths with something we wish to take the time to glance upon. We meet people, see things, both ordinary and unordinary. And eventually we all come to experience the humor, pain, and intrinsic oddities of what death represents to us.\n\nRecommended.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447045140, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1447045140, "recommendationid": "18966191", "language": "english", "votes_down": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505742", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1446519004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "steamid": "76561198098138700", "num_games_owned": 37}, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "review": "This game plays like one of the more interesting parts of less well written games.
