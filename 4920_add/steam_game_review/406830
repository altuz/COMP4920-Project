I came away with lots of shortcuts and bits of info that I didn't know.  Some basic keyboard shortcuts, for example, are covered in this course.  One I really liked is the \"Dock to Desktop\" key (ctrl-alt-d) which opens a notepad-like page on the right side of the screen.  It's a quick and easy way to take notes while viewing something else.  Pressing the Windows+N keys opens up a Quick Note is another shortcut.\n\nSome other nuggets:\n[list]\n[*]Sections can be password protected;\n[*]OneNote can convert handwriting to text or math equations;\n[*]Audio and video clips can be searched for words or phrases;\n[*]Pages can have sub-pages;\n[*]Tags can be applied to whole notes, words or phrases within a note, drawings, pictures, or attached files;\n[*]Pages can be annotated or marked up using a ton of built-in tools - pen, highlighter, colors, and more;\n[*]Notebooks can have templates to apply a pre-defined style to a notebook; and \n[*]Notebooks, Sections, or Pages can be exported to OneNote, Word, PDF, XPS, or Single File Web Pages.\n[/list]\n\nThe narrator is the same from the other Professor Teaches courses.  He's easy on the ears and easy to follow.\n\nThe course is interactive so you get to move around in OneNote and complete tasks.  Not just a boring lecture.  You are hands-on in this course!\n\nThis is a great course for those new to OneNote or looking for some tips to become more productive.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505261614, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505261614, "recommendationid": "34910683", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501768", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score": 0, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0}}
