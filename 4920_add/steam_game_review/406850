Great music, amusing writing, and I think the pixel art is great at getting the point across. \n\nComplaints wise the objectives aren't always easy and require a remarkable amount of math at times for a game supposedly about big dumb barbarians attacking things but there's little in the way of penalization as long as you accomplish at least one goal, and that goal is in the title.\n\nA charming, swift, enjoyable skill challenge. There's plenty of rubbish out there without any care and this seems to avoid that.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506226145, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506226145, "recommendationid": "35170353", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1506467205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 43, "steamid": "76561198044122038", "num_games_owned": 396}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "review": "No reason such a cute and colorful game should have so much crass language.
