Played one many, many years ago and since then have always avoided them. But, now that I can't play most games due to a cast for boxer's fracture, I decided to buy this, since it was very cheap on sale anyway. Count me surprised! This turned out to be a really cool adventure. It has beautifull graphics with animations and video's, nice puzzle solving etc.. It's a high quality work and really fun to play too. It has actually gotten me into a genre I always thought was boring hehe. Immediately bought another one from Artifex Mundi aswell.\n\nDefinitely recommended!", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500829554, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1500829554, "recommendationid": "33748413", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1500313031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 104, "steamid": "76561198056223771", "num_games_owned": 441}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I have played several HOGs and really enjoy the genre.
