Monsterland takes that back to the Doom formula in terms of having six handmade levels and being a fast-paced action game. It's less solid than DoomRL, but DoomRL is one of the more interesting free roguelikes out there, so I'm not going to fault it too much for that.\n\nMonsterland is honestly a pretty amusing action game, but it also gets rather frustrating at times. When the developer says \"Game can be saved and loaded at any time. Because sometimes, you just eat a rocket to the face.\" it's ... pretty accurate, though suddenly running into chaingunners (teal Ms) or the few NRG-8000 enemies (bright yellow Ms) was just as bad. Dying or taking excessive damage from opening a door or blasting through a fragile wall into a pile of BS that you didn't expect is unfortunately common, but you can save at any point, so it's easy to just reload and come through with the appropriate weapon in hand and strategy in mind. I don't mind saving frequently for that, but if it seems like it would make you mad, this might not be the game for you unless you're better than I am. :)\n\nAs far as the weapons go, I found them nicely balanced, with the exception of the range shotgun, which is pretty useless except for destroying barrels and picking off single red enemies without wasting ammo. Most weapons were useful at different times, though the chaingun is pretty much completely replaced by the minigun once you get it - but you don't get the minigun until near the end of the game, so that's fair enough.\n\nIn sum, Monsterland is a pretty solid game for its $1 asking price. It has about three to four hours of content, as mentioned by the developer, and while it's on the simple side, the controls are responsive and the level design is generally pretty solid.\n\nRated TULILIHIUM AAHOOM/10.\n\nTHIS IS OUR SONG\n\n*static*", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1450487274, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1450487274, "recommendationid": "19772588", "language": "english", "votes_down": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501567", "voted_up": true}, {"author": {"last_played": 1453630719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 63, "steamid": "76561197960546592", "num_games_owned": 251}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "review": "It has a DOS-like feel.
