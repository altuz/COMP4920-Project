You play as RT, a robot, who lives in the woods as an inventor after an apocalyptic event killed all the humans. All robots that had been built by mankind were left behind in a functional state and there were quite a few who had fully developed cognitive functions.\n\nAll robots, RT included are required by the USS a not so fully explained organization of robots to have a job for the now newly founded robot society or they do not get provided electricity. So RT, a robot who doesn't know what he was built for but walk around and do a pathetic robots version of a human sigh builds small items and solves problems. Ahh a thinker! This game will surely be a myst like right?\n\nNot really. For starters you engage in conversations with other characters in the game and their are a few action sequences.\n\n[b]The Uncertain: Easy Mini Games[/b]\nSo i thought this game started with an easy set of tutorial style mine game like puzzles in order to introduce players who are not familiar with this style of puzzle solving an introduction for what they were in for. I was confused when the majority of the games puzzles were comprised on this. Thinking back the hardest puzzle i found was the piano puzzle and that was easily solved when i found the blazingly clear to find hint.\n\n[b]Uncertain: of the game i'm playing[/b]\n2/3rds of the way through the game you will suddenly find yourself in a awful driving game through a forest. Soon after dodging trees, you suddenly find yourself being chased with the camera aimed facing the back of your car. I think the devs thought this would aid the player in dodging the bullets being shot at the player's car. Really this just makes it annoying to dodge the trees in front of you.\n\nYour forced through this sequence twice with little explanation as to why it is happening other than its old technology and that you're in some real trouble if it happens again since you don't have a weapon. THEN INVENT ONE YOUR DOLT.\n\nAfter these driving sequences the game suddenly changes the way the camera has been working for 90% of the game to follow behind you. You suddenly lose the ability to turn left and right easily as if your character got shot in spin while they were robot vietnam. I thought the game was suddenly trying to limp its way into a 3D adventure game but the running was laughable and there was no jumping. In about 10 minutes i suddenly found myself in the resident evil style camera controls the game was playing with. So not only does this robot not know who he is, the game doesn't seem to know what it is.\n\n[b]The Certain: Don't play this game[/b]\nThis game feels like the developer wanted to make all their favorite games into one game. But they decided to skip the polishing stage before going onto the next style. There is potential from this game. I hope the developer has it all worked out before the next game. The story is a bit compelling.\n", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505519155, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1505519155, "recommendationid": "34983713", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500487", "voted_up": false}, {"author": {"last_played": 1485858482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 331, "steamid": "76561198077797661", "num_games_owned": 203}, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "review": "I was wondering if there will be another.", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506530034, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_updated": 1506530034, "recommendationid": "35245024", "language": "english", "votes_down": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495321", "voted_up": true}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 145, "total_reviews": 196, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 51}}
