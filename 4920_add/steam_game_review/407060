Each environment has specific loading nodes in set areas, moving stuff about is tricky (and requires assistance), this is an area it could improve in.\nThere are a few games you can play that really benefit from roomscale, i was hooked on disc golf (a combination of frisbee and golf) when i first tried the app \u2026.and as i type this i am telling myself that i have to play it again! \u2026. That just would not work as well in a 2d flat screen game. Also the maze just would not be the same with out \u201cbeing there\u201d, and that is the thing of VR it puts you there, be it a virtual maze or the front row of a comedy show (despite the lack of variety in avatars, the ones they do have are well made and you can tell when people are looking at you or other people, it all helps create the illusion that you are in this world watching a comedy show with 10 or 15 people and not in your front room blindfolded by vr while your cat sneaks the chicken out the kitchen and to her bed )\n\n\n[b]GRAPHICS[/b] \nAs touched on before the graphics of the areas are pretty cool, the avatars however are rather limited, there is a handful of designs, all pretty cool, and you can change their colours, but there is certainly not enough variety here, my friend and long suffering co-host of my old youtube videos (they are on pause at the minute) plays as a floating robot head, when i see it i immediately think \u201cMr Mole!\u201d until i see the name tag and ah nope it is RandomSomething554334 :( \nWhile i feel the avatars let it down you pretty soon get used to it and the rest of the graphics are fine, when you have a huge youtube wall up the videos are crisp and detailed, webpages are more than readable and the games are spot on.\n\n[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] \nI have not had any performance issues with altspace, not one.\n\n\n[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] \nWhile it is not exactly rocket science it does take a little bit to get used to what icon does what and how to use them, it could do with a better explanation of the basic functions, however there is always help at the welcome centre, AltspaceVR has a real live human on at all times who are happy to help you and teach you, I have overheard them dealing with less than savory people too and yet to hear a moderator lose their temper (since my day job involves a ton of customer service, i can tell you that is no easy feat lol) So not intuitive but not so anti intuitive that you will be cursing it, learn how to block people though. (aim at them and click the \u2026.oh man it\u2019s gone out of my head, but the icon will be clear ) and click it.\n\n[b]MULTIPLAYER:[/b] \nWell it is a social application so multiplayer is the key. Thanks to AltspaceVR being available on so many formats (and free, let us not forget the fact it is all free) there is a large population and you will often see large groups of people at all hours. As has already been mentioned there is a moderator on at all times, and you can block people so any issues with unruly people who decide that real world social norms are not applicable in virtual reality can be dealt with really fast, if you block them it is like they no longer exist. The times i have had to block someone are few and far between and most people i have met are great and a good laugh, you see their name and smile \u201cah itis sara!\u201d or \u201ccool, cats is joining the game\u201d, you get to know them is what i am trying to say.  \n\n[b]PROS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*]Very well moderated (always a member of staff online and easily contactable)\n[*]Massive support for developers wishing to make apps for their rooms or players making events. \n[*]On the whole a friendly community.\n[*]Its free!\n[*]You can be in vr with non vr mates.\n[*]Tons of events (all free)\n[*]Tons of free games that are actually so fun they could have charged for.\n[*]You can create your own private room and watch funny cat youtube videos with your mates even if your all miles of real world distance apart.\n[*]Play dnd with your mates. \n[*]Easy to block trolls.\n[/list]\n\n[b]CONS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*]Not enough avatar variety for a game with such a high population.\n[*]A very small amount of people believe social standards do not apply in vr and can ruin your fun briefly (while easy to block, this is still a negative).\n[*]No way to adjust your height on the vive (without third party tools)\n[/list]\n\n[b]VERDICT[/b] \nFor adults it is a fun application and given its free i urge you all to try it, however due to the nature of Holograms against Humanity (a 3d version of Cards against Humanity) and the few people who do not know how to behave, it is not something suitable for the younger crowd to use unsupervised. Fully worth putting time into it though, go play disc golf :) or if you are not easily, play Holograms against Humanity (try not to feel too bad when you laugh at the cards) and if you see a robot called dave(mrgreaper) that just may be me, or my clone, or if really low to the floor\u2026..my cat.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1487295074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2031, "num_reviews": 68, "steamid": "76561197966649882", "num_games_owned": 1091}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505227", "timestamp_updated": 1487534144, "recommendationid": "30043252", "timestamp_created": 1487534144}, {"review": "You need a little AltspaceVR in your life.
