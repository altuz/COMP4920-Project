{"reviews": [{"review": "Pretty fun game, the underlying gameplay is solid. It looks nice. Controls are adequate although could do with a facing command. The 20 levels are nice and has some thought put into it, the last level is somewhat epic. But...\n\nThere is nothing beyond that. No endless mode or random generated skirmish. I blew through the game, achievements included in 5 hours. I want more content. I want to see what a completely maxed out fleet can do.\n\nI recommend it anyway but do keep in mind it is short so buy cheap to compensate.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1498261182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 316, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198018776067", "num_games_owned": 347}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "timestamp_updated": 1498270498, "recommendationid": "32706909", "timestamp_created": 1498270498}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
