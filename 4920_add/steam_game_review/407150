{"reviews": [{"review": "Not bad.  If you like puzzles, this is fairly competent with decent controls.  It even partially works with a gamepad, although you still have to use a mouse for the sniper part of levels.  I would have much preferred to toggle control between the two and have full controller support.  I thought this looked much more fun and calculating than the non-Sniper-Edition.  It was OK.  Very good for someones college-level school project, or a home project.  However, it didn't pull me in enough to make me want to keep going.  Hard to recommend as a paid-game, but good job for someone's small project.  (2/5 stars, still good for trading cards).", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1463029797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 187, "num_reviews": 88, "steamid": "76561198262864341", "num_games_owned": 1878}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500549", "timestamp_updated": 1463032980, "recommendationid": "22922286", "timestamp_created": 1463032980}, {"review": "Trap Them Sniper Edition is a situational puzzle game.
