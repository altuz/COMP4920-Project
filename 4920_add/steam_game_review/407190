It reminded me of my all time favorite game, Ultimate Soccer Manager. That came out back in the 90's. I'm sadden to say, this is a washed up version of it. Yes, it does have the potential to be a good, if not great game! However, I think they should go back to the drawing board and work on it a little more. \n\nIt does remind me of Ultimate Soccer Manager, but there need to be more clubs and leagues associated with it. I'm hoping the game will get better as time goes on. I'm disappointed with some of the simple spelling errors you notice in the game, however it does keep you entertained for a few hours at least. After that, you loose interest. \n\nI would give this game a 2.5 out of 5 stars.

I have played a ton of manager sims (FIFA manager, Football Manager, GoallineBlitz, Blackout Rugby, Powerplay Manager, HSU (Heartland Soccer Union), coupled with dynasty modes in games like Rugby Challenge 1 and 2; EA sports NHL, FIFA, Madden,...; 2k series, PES series, ... and without question this game is superior.  \n\nThe problem with most online manager sims is that you have to wait for games sometimes hence why a non-online one should be superior.\n\nFootball manager and FIFA manager had far too many issues with gameplay (football manager was especially horrendous at this) and horrible options respectively (FIFA manager) to make their games any fun.\n\nAny dynasty mode is never indepth enough to really do a manager sim justice.  You have the league, the juniors, and that is usually about it if even that good...\n\nThat leaves this game...as superior as it is better in all regards to the stuff above (well FIFA gameplay is better then it, just the options for FIFA manager were garbage).\n\nIt is not perfect mind you...\n\nGraphics: Even 15 years ago these graphics would not be the best, so if you need amazing eye candy this is not it - FIFA manager is better in this regard\n\nMusic: a limited selection gets boring after a while (even though the tunes on their own are good), though like any game you can put songs in your game folder, apparently they have a folder they specify to the user to do this but I have yet to see how user friendly it is to find it...\n\nDepth: Germany is ridiculously in depth, every other nation is not.  All other nations have are tier 1 teams (so if you are in the lower tiers and cannot find players in Germany for hire, unless you can find nations with not so good players - (Bermuda, Somalia, St Lucia, ...)  you are going to be stuck.\n\nTutorial: they really need a good one though that said the hints they give you work, just realizing where the icons are for these hints (right on your main page but like any new game despite them being in your face, you may not realize they are important until later on in your first season as was my case)\n\nLanguage: While the game is in English there are a few things which you can tell a translator was used to put in English (and did not do a good job).  That said they do update the game so hopefully for those who would have an issue with that eventually those things will be fixed, that said, if you are fluent in English the errors are easy to see and understand what is meant in virutally all cases.\n\nManual:  Though it is ridiculously detailed, and extensive with tons of info, one glaring deficiency is what they mean by 'grade'.  I know that it judges the skill of the player in the game, but whether 1 means the best or a higher # is a question that the manual does not answer (and after 40 plus hours of playing I am still guessing that 1 is the best, yes I have read the whole manual by the way, plus did a CTRL + F search in relation to it to find stuff).\n\nStadium: Again the eye candy of FIFA Manager is better, plus FIFA manager has more stadium SEATING options (much more).  That said the revenue generation that Club Manager has (build a restaurant, build a fan shop, better security, bus line to get more fans to the games, better toilets,...) which all influence the amount of fans you get is OUTSTANDING.  Merchandise options to have shirts, bedding, stuffed animals which you can sell to fans all makes this sim MUCH better than its competitors.\n\nThe economics of the game are excellent, and overall the game does a much more realistic job at allowing you to run your team with all the options.  An extensive transfer market with a ton of players, financial constraints, plus a ton more options make this game the best by far.\n\nStill not sure about replayability since I am just starting this game (yep 61 hours is starting, but am loving it, my team is tier 3 at the moment, have played 10 seasons thus far), but assuming I get to 100 hours will do an update on this review.\n\nA few hints which you should know if you do get the game:\n-invest in at least 400 shirts from the start (you are cut off from buying more shirts as of July 15th), they are your biggest source of merchandise revenue and without this you lose a lot of additional revenue you will want for transfers\n-get sponsors (though before you do PLAN).  I find getting better players off the transfer market THEN going for the sponsor that gives you the most revenue per win the best strat for the first few seasons\n-set your individual ticket prices and SEASON ticket prices.  This garners you a ton of revenue pre-season which will allow you to get those additional transfer players you want (HINT:  ALWAYS set one section for expansion - usually one of your two cheapest - at a quota of 0 for season tickets so you can expand whenever you want)\n-NEGOTIATE those salaries and transfer prices, once it hits orange do not barter anymore on transfer prices.  With season length of contracts realize that players usually get ticked once you go to 3 seasons though some are good with 5.  I would suggest to go for 2 seasons then lower the salary (again once it goes orange, accept).  Realize that if you tick off a player and they break off negotiations they will not talk to you again for the rest of the season (unlike other sims that have a cooling off period of much less time) - the only exception to this is contract negotiations with your own players.\n\nThere are other reasons this sim rocks, plus other hints I have though off hand cannot think of them and I have written a ton already so feel free to add me and ask questions if you have more queries about this game, as I noted, it does not have the best eye-candy, and the English can be problematic at times, the depth in other nations could be improved upon, but beyond that it is without question the most in depth manager sim out there and a ton of fun.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1502382136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 9055, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198026995051", "num_games_owned": 19}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 21, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506357", "timestamp_updated": 1451872890, "recommendationid": "20277645", "timestamp_created": 1451872730}, {"review": "If you dont expect too much, this game is great, in short its a \"low budget football manager\" there is a lot that needs to be done ofc, but it is a really decent game.
