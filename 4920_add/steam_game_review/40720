It is a little more hand drawn looking than 3 whether this is a pro or a con is up to you but I personally enjoy it and it has a nice feel all around. The art is very consistent and really flows from one place to another. Everything has a nice mix of the look of a picture, an abstract world and random items in the everyday world. The only gripe I have about the art is the lack of screen shots. I really wish you could take screen shots in this game and I would really like it if they added that (don\u2019t expect them to because of the platform its running on and the fact that it\u2019s an older game). Although it is really a con I would still totally recommend the game.\n\n[b] Story [/b] The story in this game like in the others is very simple and nice. I doesn\u2019t make you think too hard and there are really no decisions to make. This might not be for some people but it makes the game wonderful to play when you just wana check out and enjoy some free time. There are 2 main objectives of the story or game and each brings you some fun times and is decorated with amazing art and sound not to mention some great puzzles. The game took me around 4 hours to complete with some help and really feels like a treat instead of a grind. \n\n[b] Sound [/b] The sound is really an excellent feature of this game. It incorporates great and odd voicing and smooth music/sounds. The environment is constantly being noisy and involves and draws you in with interesting and fun sound cues. I highly recommend playing this game with a headset and if you don\u2019t I don\u2019t think you will get the true feel of the game. \n\n[b] Puzzles [/b] The puzzles are very nice and unlike samorost 3 and have a clear answer based on the environment or plot of the story. This makes the experience much more enjoyable and you will not need a guide to finish the game if you really wana do it by your own wits and cunning :P. I used a guide that I will link in the description. Most of the puzzles are not too easy and not too hard and can take from 5 to 10 minutes depending on the use of a guide. If a guide is used then you can quickly 2 to 3 minutes. I used a guide on most of the harder puzzles and it took me roughly 4 hours to complete.\n\n[b] Feel [/b] You can tell that this is an older and homemade game. It\u2019s not to polished and is a little bit clunky at times. This is where Samorost 3 and Samorost 2 really differ. You can\u2019t free roam as much in this game. This make the world just a little less inviting but doesn\u2019t really effect the gameplay in a negative way. Sometimes you will get stuck in a puzzle and will have to complete it before you can move or back track again. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword and made it easier to complete the game in a quick run. The other edge is that it also makes it less of a joy to free roam in and just enjoying the environment. In all I would prefer the ability to free roam and be able to walk in various places instead of a semi small area. The last thing is that sometimes your lil gnome or whatever he is will not look natural going or exiting a building and seems to get caught on the walls or doors. Although this games mechanics are not as good as its successors it\u2019s still usually very clean and has a noice feel to it. \n\n[b] Characters [/b] The characters really gave this game its fantastical feel. There are a variety of distinct species and subsets of characters to interact with. Most of them have a purpose and they really give the game its amazing fun and different feel.\n\n[b] Final Takeaway [/b] This is a great game and a must have if you enjoy fun little games with amazing art and a good old calming feel. The puzzles are great for a relaxing time and generate just enough difficulty to make them feel interesting. The music and sounds are crisp and real and it doesn\u2019t feel like any other game (besides the other Amanita Design games). It\u2019s a steal for $5 USD and you can find it for $2.50 USD or under on sale most of the time. I would highly recommend this game before buying Samorost 3 because if you like this then you will also like 3.
