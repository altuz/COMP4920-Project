{"reviews": [{"review": "Even though I loved the two labyronia games, but the Legend (or murder?) of Mysteria was a terrible game in my opinion. The story line seemed cheap and did not fit into the others. There was a lot of back and forth for, in all honesty, no reason and there were things that were far more complicated and irritating than they should have been. Unlike the other two, this game did not have any moments, characters, or even enough of a story line to catch or maintain my interest. I, personally, do not recomment this game to anyone unless you want to play for hours on end and not getting anywhere OR live by a walk through and hope that it makes sense.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504329985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 227, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198120142332", "num_games_owned": 16}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1504331073, "recommendationid": "34676920", "timestamp_created": 1504331073}, {"review": "whatta mess", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1503005088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 143, "num_reviews": 43, "steamid": "76561198402521885", "num_games_owned": 201}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494724", "timestamp_updated": 1503028945, "recommendationid": "34320457", "timestamp_created": 1503028945}, {"review": "Bougt only because the trading Cards sold higher than the actual game cost\n5/10\nCuz i Got 0,5euro from it", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1500768052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 45, "num_reviews": 69, "steamid": "76561198062102374", "num_games_owned": 52}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490579", "timestamp_updated": 1500049453, "recommendationid": "33539279", "timestamp_created": 1500049453}, {"review": "RPGmaker strikes again!\n\nWhat shall we say about a game released in 2015 which isn't even widescreen?
