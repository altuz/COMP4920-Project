Not bad since i was still in the caves, hadnt made it very far.\n\n\nPlayed again, made it way farther, had hearts and other stuff, but then I paused the game for a minute to do something, unpaused and the whole thing reset my progress.  \n\nTried restarting the game and still didnt have a save file.  \n\nThis game does respect the player and their time at all.
