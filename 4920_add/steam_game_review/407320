{"reviews": [{"review": "This visual novel by COSEN, Novel Engine, Tales# and Sekai Project is a family life comedy about an orphaned single father Haru who lives with his two adopted daughters Sora and Nuri. With Yura coming over to Haru's house regularly to help in looking after his two daughters while having a motive herself to be alone and close to Haru, Haru will encounter and face a number of challenges in being a single parent over 4 days in this visual novel.\n\nAlthough there are no Steam achievements to obtain in this game, the game has an in-game achievement page that will track and show all unlocked in-game achievements that are awarded while playing through the game, making certain gameplay and dialogue choices, reaching all endings and playing through certain minigames where additional extra content in the form of additional CGs and voiceovers will be unlocked upon completing various in-game achievements.\n\nSoundtracks, CGs and overall game presentation are good after factoring in pleasant background music, voiced dialogue and chibi artwork. Recommended for those who like a short light-hearted comedy with optional minigames and when game is at discount or bundle offer as it takes less than 10 hours to reach 6 endings.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501436763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 203, "num_reviews": 91, "steamid": "76561198006413390", "num_games_owned": 2216}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565286", "timestamp_updated": 1501504326, "recommendationid": "33910582", "timestamp_created": 1501437880}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 12, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
