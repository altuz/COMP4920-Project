{"reviews": [{"review": "Incredibly cute VN that shifts the focus on romantic relationships between adults to the budding friendship between two children.\n\nStrawberry Vinegar features a 9 year old girl named Rie who is responsible, cynical and deep down very lonely. She is one day visited by Licia - a demon from Hell. Licia demands that Rie make her delicious food throughout the course of a week or she will reap her soul. Licia is here on a \"vacation\" to see what earth is like, and Rie becomes her caregiver throughout the course of a six day period. Although resisitive to having Licia around at first, Rie is unable to resist Licia's innocent, friendly and loving nature and learns that having a friend isn't so bad after all. The two girls bond through their mutual love of food and through their opposite but also complimentary personalities. \n\nThe game has great music, cute and colorful artwork and backgrounds, and features tons of photos of yummy looking food! The photos of the food and ebi-hime's descriptions made me feel really hungry. To read through all of the unique dialogue, it took me about 4 hours in total. There are a total of 5 different endings, a wide variety of gallery art, and also additional things such as: concept art, cut content that never made it into the game, and the writer's thoughts on each character. \n\nWould recommend to those who like a very tame and light hearted VN (no swearing, nudity, etc), and for those who like ebi-hime's other workings.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1502417116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 228, "num_reviews": 61, "steamid": "76561198053984243", "num_games_owned": 881}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507111", "timestamp_updated": 1501969336, "recommendationid": "34047086", "timestamp_created": 1501969286}, {"review": "Its cute. Its not the best visual novel ever. The plot is very cut and dry and doesn't really try anything new, but the artwork is really nice and the characters are all likeable. If you see on sale try it.\n\nOne thing I'd like to suggest however, is that with the heavy reliance on food (what you decide to feed Licia decides whether she likes you or not) it would have been cool if there was a list of recipes in the extras that get unlocked when you make that recipe in game. Doesn't affect the gameplay, but I thought of it while I was playing and I'm kind of sad that the dev didn't do that.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1499631639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 281, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198153877658", "num_games_owned": 65}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1499633208, "recommendationid": "33414518", "timestamp_created": 1499633208}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 44, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 47, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
