Nothing like entering with style and a loud bang, eh?

X3\n\nFrom the makers of Border Down, Under Defeat, both Senko no Ronde's, Mamoru-Kun Curse, and their latest title Kokuga. Comes G.Rev's Strania - The Stella Machina - (Seisou Kouki Strania/\u661f\u971c\u92fc\u6a5f\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30cb\u30a2), their first title on Steam.\n\nPreviously developed for XBLA and the Nesica-(X)-Live Arcade, Strania is a shoot-em-up/shmup/STG, in which you're fighting a war against both the Stranian and the Vower armies vaying conquest. Yes, there is a story on both sides if you  check the \"How-To-Play\" section after you see the mechanics of the game.\n\nGameplay wise, the mechanics feel similar to Einhander in a sense, where you can switch weapons (up to 3) for the right situations (though there can be times where you might end up in the wrong situation if you pick the wrong weapons.) There are a total of 9 different weapons you can use in the entire game to suit your preferences (you can also level them up if you pick the same weapon again, though the colors will vary by the sides which weapons you can only upgrade to Lv.2), although...\n\nScoring however, requires you to use the weapons (all 9 of them in one playthough) strategically and tactically. The game uses the JP ranking system (Kyu = Dan) to score points, use them often when destroying enemies will yield bonus points (from 10kyu to 1kyu, and then from 1Dan to 10Dan), getting all 9 weapons to 1dan or higher at the end will give you a 9Mil. point bonus if you know the game in and out. Not only that, you can use the O/D system to temporary be invulnerable for a while, and have a multiplier going from X1.1 to X2.0, use when necessary.\n\nAs it is with ports that come from the Arcade/Console versions and bringing them out to Steam, this is more or less the same as the 360 port and everything is just right with it, no issues on my end, just smooth gameplay from here on in.\n\nLastly on the +/- sides!\n\n+Same as it is on both XBLA/Nesica, good gameplay/mechanics/etc. (Includes both the base game and  Side: Vower!  Based on the 1.1 XBLA updated version.)\n+Various options you can set your experience to the PC port. Although the - only to some users as usual with PC users, there will be problems, but nothing much updates/patches could fix. And help on the game forums if necessary.\n-Unfortunately, online co-op is not in the Steam version, even though the XBLA release had it, and the co-op for that had no lag whatsoever, just smooth gameplay there too. Luckily there's Local Co-Op at least. I just hope G.Rev can find a way to add this to the Steam version if they can do it.\n\nAnd to finish it off, Strania is a great game overall, the game can be tailored to your liking either for relaxed or hardcore play. I just hope this ends up being a success somehow that G.Rev can port their back catalog onto Steam. Maybe even new titles if they can!

As far as those releases go, this was my favorite along with Eschatos (also on Steam, and something you should also buy if you haven't yet). What I appreciated the most about this game was G.Rev's decision to design it will respect to the \"Traditional\" style shooter, as opposed to the bullet hell style which has become more common in modern shump design. Not to say I don't like to play bullet hells, I just prefer the design elements of the 80's/early 90's shooters, where the focus was on less numerous but more targeted bullets, an assortment of distinct weapons to use where success in the game is determined by proper use of said weapons in different situations, environmental hazards, cinematic style stage progression, etc. Think Gradius, R-Type, Thunder Force, the various Complie shooters like MUSHA, and Einhander as examples of what this is modeled after. That type of style is right up my alley, and Strania does the job of scratching that particular itch. Add on top of that, add the catchy, shump appropriate, electro synth fusion soundtrack of Keishi Yonao, and you have a very well crafted game. \n\nThe craftsmanship extends to the fact that G.Rev took it upon themselves to make a whole extra addition to main Strania campaign with the \"Side Vover\" add on (at no extra cost in the Steam version), were you play the game from the perspective of the Stranian antagonists, the Vower. Essentially, you play the main game in reverse, starting from the Vower home colony, going through the same stages from the Strania side to get the Stranian home base. However, instead of being the recycled affair you would likely expect from something like this, the stage design, bosses, music, and progression is distinct enough to make it feel like an entirely different game. It was an example of how to do DLC the right way, by adding value to the game while keeping the main portion whole and untampered with.\n\nThose that are more observant will see the subtleties that G.Rev put in both campaigns to differentiate the Stranian and Vower sides, and give them personality without even having to rely on story composition. For example, the Stranian's mechs and infrastructure are very angular and blocky and the uniforms of the main pilots suggest a militaristic, organized culture. The Vower's mechs and equipment on the other hand, are mostly rounded and curved, and the dress of the pilots suggest a tribal, nomadic, theocratic culture. Another example is that while pilots on both sides can use each others weapon arrays (denoted by being highlighted by Blue (Strania), Red (Vower) or Purple (Netural) in game), only mechs on the Stranian side have access to enhanced versions of the Strania side's weapons (essentially activated by collecting two of the same weapon on one weapon slot), and only Vower mechs can use enhanced Vower weapons on the other end. Depending on what side you play, you'll find that the enemies will mostly attack you with their side's weapons, which you mainly get from stealing them off destroyed enemy mechs. Weapons on your side are mainly gotten by storage crates and friendly drops. It's the little things that help make this game special.\n\nIf you are a fan of the genre at all, don't make the mistake of overlooking this game, as it apparently was when it was initially released. It deserves more recognition, and is a much purchase.

The gameplay video on Steam pretty much says it all, and it plays just as good as it looks.\n\nThe most interesting thing about this game is the variety in both the environment, enemy placement and design, and the way you handle each situation with the different weapons.  This is a game that rewards experimentation and replaying with different combinations.  You can switch on the fly and keep something in reserve, so each time I make a mistake I always think \"oh yeah, I should try it like this instead\".  Very fun if you like to go in-depth with the available options.\n\nThe recharging shield is also a cool dual-purpose tool.

It's up to you; play it safe or balls to the wall.\n\nThe graphics are a good compromise between awesomeness and visibilty.  There's streams of shell casings flying out of weapons (even though they shoot lasers), sweet but brief boss intros firing flak everywhere, and of course the deeply satisfying mega explostions when you down giant bosses.
