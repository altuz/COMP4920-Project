{"reviews": [{"review": "Quick background for Individuals whom have never heard and are skeptical by the \"mixed\" reviews it is recieveing. Devilian was originally created in Korea as a Diablo clone that was its original intention and for people saying \"it looks too much like Diablo\" you're correct... it's supposed to. To finally have cleared that up Devilian is an ARPG-MMO (Action Role Playing Game - Massively Multiplayer Online), it is grindy yes... it will continue to be grindy yes... and no it won't stray away from being grindy, if you don't want something so grindy I'd recommend neopets I hear it's pretty cute. Although Devilian is no where near perfect it does damn good at its job of creating a fun and immersive user experience. The way the dungeons and quests flow seemlessly makes for a long but enjoyable leveling experience. I've played Devilian now for 300+ hours in the Alpha/BETA and now Live with a little experience playing the original version in Korea while I was on Holiday a few years back visitng a close friend!

Their game launcher is one of the most pathetically archaic and barebones launchers in existence in the 2010's. It's abysmal. I'd skip this game due to that fact alone, otherwise, feel free to read on.\n\n---\n\nI waited with bated breath for this game to release. All Trion did was localize yet another popular Eastern MMO for the Western market with a several QoL changes. I had high hopes for this game and played the beta and then the full release.\n\nThe fact is, this is a p2p masquerading as a f2p. Eastern gamers are much more accustomed to and forgiving of micro-transcactions; think of it as an extension of the arcade quarter muncher. In most cases, Eastern gamers enjoy PC games in cafe atmospheres or cubicles, pumping card time in to continue playing their character every day. They see it as a service more than anything.\n\nFor Western gamers, we pay for a product and expect a full experience. In Devilian's example, we get neither. Granted, you can start leveling for free, but to really enjoy the full breadth of the product, you'll have to pay a monthly fee. Which, though not unheard of, grants you next to nothing in this case. This isn't World of Warcraft. There isn't a huge community here. There isn't a lot of support. But most importantly...\n\nThe game isn't fun. I'm speaking as a huge ARPG fan and frankly, there are several other options I'd rather spend (read: waste) my time on. It goes without saying that Diablo 2 or 3 is better than this game, but even more modern outings fair WAY better than Devilian. Honestly, spend some time in Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, Marvel Heroes 2016 (yes, even Marvel Heroes), and you'll find a lot more to enjoy from those games.\n\nObviously, it's free.

Although the pay2win is not as crazy as it is in Trions other IPs it is still there. I payed approximately \u00a350 into the game and I was top of the leaderboards for about the first week and was also the first person to own a full set Tragedy, this was mainly due to the amount of time I put into the game and days I went without sleep. But soon the people who had played a lot less and payed a lot more surpassed me on both the leaderboards and gear (which is where i decided to quit). It is true that you can play this game without spending a penny on any microtransactions you will never be able to be competative.\n\nOkay now that that's out of the way I'll talk about some of the other Issues I have with the game and more so the Dev team. Shortly after release the Seadrift server went down for maintanence which was supposed to last for 4 hours, It lasted for almost 24 hours, and when the maintanence was finally over and players were able to log back into their server they were appaulled to find that their characters had been lost. All their hardwork, time and dedication were just completely gone. Seeing as this was a new launch we all expected their to be some issues but when this happened not once but twice in the space of 2 days that was just a joke. After people lost all their stuff they quickly rushed to get back to the end-game content and start working towards their gear all over again just to have it ripped away once more, this is totally unacceptable for a fully released game.\n\nGender locking. Don't do it game devs...\n\nAlthough those Issues are awful they're basically the only problems I had with the game apart from the lack of quests, lore and crafting the rest I really enjoyed and felt this was the kind of game I'd been looking for.\n\nLet's look at some of the Pro's shall we;\nFast paced action RPG style combat.\nBeautiful graphics and models.\nChallenging end-game content (if you're melee).\nMany different distractions to take you away from the grind.\nResetable skilltree system allowing you to change the way you play constantly.\nClaimable land for your guild to fight for.\nChallenging guild dungeons.(unless you're in Pulse guild then it's easy :p)\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the game I honestly can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't have thausands of pounds to throw away. The main player base for ARPG's like Diablo and Path of Exile are there because of the leaderboards and striving to be the best, which is impossible unless you pay in Devillian. The same goes for MMO's with the PvP content, you want to be the best well nop surprise the PvP is the same as ArcheAge where those who pay earn the rights to use your corpse as toilet paper. However what I will say is if you have 1-2 friends who are looking to just play through the story together then you may have a good time but until you get to the end-game I'm pretty sure it's impossible to die unless you take a 5 minute break against a boss.\n\nTLDR:\nTrion Worlds.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1470545257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 9185, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198059013361", "num_games_owned": 390}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "4.973445", "timestamp_updated": 1452365803, "recommendationid": "20428484", "timestamp_created": 1452365685}, {"review": "Paying for a class?

I'm getting fed up with games that promise to deliver content and expand upon it in a timely manner only to have the companies renege and disappoint entire communities. When dealing with the support for this game, it feels like an after thought;  Like they aren't taking it seriously and have no communication with one another.  The web page itself feels like a slapped together wordpress blog with a free forum board strapped to it with ductape;  It's insulting. ((I'm a web desinger/developer.  I notice that stuff.)) There isn't enough content to keep most hard core players interested.  Wide spread bans, lagging, exploits and bot issues are another huge turn off.  What the game promised through game play in the begining, it failed miserably to deliver at the end.  \n\n\n-------------------------------------\nI can't justify continuing to play.  I'm not even as geared as I could be but I honestly can't bring myself to follow through grinding out runes from AD and dust for talismans as there is no content to aim for coming out in the immediate future.  So what am I supposed to do?  Spend the next month grinding the same dungeons over and over again for gear and stats I'll replace when the new content arrives?  Am I supposed to enjoy the ever shrinking population of pvpers?  I feel like the new daily gifts are a 'please stick around' consolation prize for all the banning, lagging, exploits and bots.\n\nThe lag issues that effected the entire NA Asperon server where horrendous.  When support was contacted, despite this being a SERVER WIDE ISSUE, the players were blamed.  *sarcasm*  Of course!  Thousands of players all having lag issues --all at the same time-- must be a software issue; something in our startup.  Obvious.\n\nAnd then there was the exploit that they released with the game that they KNEW was there since alpha essentially allowing players the opportunity to screw up the leveling curve, the economy and the community when the exploiters where finally banned... after two weeks.  I know two weeks doesn't sound like an awful lot to some, but to others that first two weeks in the game is when you set your pace.  The first two weeks is when you find your companions/friends.  Those first two weeks after release, pretty damn important to someone who wants to push content.\n\nI love the community in this game; Amazing people - I've made some great friends that I really hope to cary on gaming with.  And the game play itself is amazing -- There's just not enough of it to keep hard core MMO players occupied.  Overwhelming at the beginning, but you can knock it all out with effort and time.  Maybe I chew up content too quickly, but I don't feel like there is enough.  When the new stuff comes out, will I devour it just as quickly and be bored again?

For me, it has everything i ever wanted to see in an MMORPG and more. What those things are you ask? Let me explain...\n\nLet me start off with a few negative things here: The quests are extremely dull, the classes are gender-locked and Trions system to verify you as a human are a straight up obvious money grab (tho you don\u00b4t have to do it).\n\nBut what does this game have that i missed in other MMOs? Here are a few things i find in some MMOs but never united in one:\n\n- The combat system\nFor me, one of the most important parts of a game, it is straight up awesome. It\u00b4s not as refined as Diablo, but it\u00b4s quick, action packed and even with my horrible interent: accurate (concerning the hitboxes). It makes fun and made me completely overlook the dulled down quest system.\n\n- The End-Game\nI hate a level cap. The only other MMO i really played was Perfect World back in the day, so i guess that\u00b4s the reason why i can\u00b4t stand being blocked in progression. I never thought this was possible, but Devilian combines nearly infinite leveling with the end-game system other games like World of Warcraft offer.\nThe maximum level is 52 (at the point of this review) but once you hit that, you still have to level your Devilian-Form and your proficiencies, much like the Paragon-System in Diablo 3.\nAnd yet you get an equipment score with which you may or may not enter in some of the later dungeons. Which brings me to the next point...\n\n- The Dungeons\nVery well designed layouts combined with awesome bosses make these stand out from any other game. Throughout your journey you will enter many of them, and even at the end, they stay relevant. Farming Heroic dungeons until your gear is ready to head into Hell dungeons just so you can farm that extra bit of Resistance-Essence, Setpiece of your armor, gem to level up your artifact or other materials to improve your character makes for an endgame i\u00b4ve never seen so diverse. There is a ton of stuff to improve on which means a ton of stuff to do. Way better than just to farm for one equipment piece over and over again...\n\n- PvP\nNow i don\u00b4t mean the normal PvP, i mean real PvP. Guildwars, Arenas, PvP areas. 20v20, 6v6, 3v3. I can\u00b4t believe something like this is missing in so many games. I just love going into Teamspeak with my friends and play together against other players. It\u00b4s not as well done as in Perfect World as there is no territorial system, but it\u00b4s still a lot of fun to be had.\n\nI could extend this list but those were the most important facts on why i think this game deserves some attention.

You literally just need to click a button and the character will run across the entire world to do monotonous grinding quests.\n\nNo. The game is not Pay 2 Win (P2W). This implies that you can buy everything to get everything, which isn't accurate at all. Everything in game you can purchase through gameplay and dedication. Selling G2-G3 gems is a fast, fat currency maker, which allows you to buy paid-money credits, called DEX, which then allows you to buy cash-shop items.\n- No gear is for sale. Only aesthetics.\n- A few Bonus Loot items are for sale, but you get so many bonus loot items in game that it seems far fetched to assume this holds bearing.\n\nThe game levels insanely fast. You'll be at 52 within a few days to a week, depending on your dedication. This is when the game actually begins. End-game is where everything happens. The set pieces for your final gears: Butchery and Tragedy, however they're extremely difficult to get drops for.\n\nEspecially now since they nerfed so many classes that people up and stopped playing.
