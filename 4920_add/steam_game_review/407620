{"reviews": [{"review": "Read this through.\n\n(some evidence is linked at the bottom)\n\nFirst of all, I'll start with the fact that I used to work for Blob Games Studio since late 2014 on the team and left in August 2015, and was a third party from 2 May 2016 to 28 May 2016, so I know certain things that have happened behind the scenes. I am also not naming several individuals who I'm told want to be anonymous to avoid harassment by Blob Games Studio.\n\nIt began in autumn 2014. This was when I met Felix, at the time I was working on a game of my own (which in hindsight, was not that great) but okay. He gave feedback, some nice words, and we got talking. We agreed on making one project together (just one) called Delivery Boy Tale that later became Adventure Of Sol (which the Sol 1st party is from) but soon we had bigger plans so Blob Games Studio was formed. Another member soon joined (who created the Vanessa 1st party) and things went sort of well. The Legend Of The Artifact Remastered was in development, and I was to beta test his work and help with making some of the level designs. It was there that the darker side of Felix, or FelixBlobDev or Kirbypwnage started to emerge, as I left some honest, blunt but well-intentioned criticism on the mechanics. He got snappish and passive-aggressive and it became apparent how little tolerance he has for criticism and people who think different from him. He later also helped doing some spritework for my game (The Outbreak Story, but at the time it was named differently and had a wildly different concept) but often blackmailed me if I didn't do what he wanted or say what he wanted to hear by threatening to stop working, or postpone his work, put less effort in it and prioritize his own work, all because of criticism at his work and his behavior at the time. He twisted the things I said, he didn't talk to me for days when I said something he didn't like, then to turn it around.\n\nAt that time, the big project came. Indie Game Battle. It was to bring Smash Bros. to the indie scene and was to take the step of embracing both big indies such as Shovel Knight, Shantae and Quote as well as small gems like Tess and Clive & Wrench alike, to bring indies together and make everyone happy. That was the promise. A nice story to tell everyone was all it took for me to be sold on it. I was to get Alexia, one of The Outbreak Story's protags, in it as a 1st party. He was uncooperative about it and as he kept buffing his own characters, it made me a bit suspicious. Fearing he was to make my character less and less usable, I asked him to balance the game. Make each character powerful, so no one is OP, which he to this day seems to tell to people was me asking him to make Alexia OP, which isn't the case. I wanted every character to be powerful in their own right. I was working on the stage of Retrolands together with him, doing 8-bit assets for it.\n\nAs I grew increasingly weary of Felix's emotional manipulation, it showed. Along came Omar, a new team member and after a month or so, I was more or less forced to leave the team. He then erased my name from his project but kept the assets I mentioned before for Retrolands in.\n\nTime skip to May 2016.\nI was in a DM conversation on Twitter with the guy, where we sort of made up. Then I was allowed to join their Skype Group and have Alexia be a Third Party again, and we made a deal. She was to be released alongside a Greenlight for The Outbreak Story where I would also promote Indie Game Battle as a sort of both-sides-helping-each-other thing, but development on her reimplentation was never started, even though she nearly finished, Felix and I still had the 2015 assets so it'd be far easier than any other character that had to be made from scratch. I was suspicious, and asked Felix about it. He also confirmed to have never credited me for my contributions on the Retrolands stage.\nI got closer to a member called Starturbo and a member called Bounty, both Third Parties as well (the developer of Superstar Technic and Nexum, two work-in-progress titles respectively) who also had lingering concerns but didn't state them at the time. Also, we found out that a few ex-members (a certain Rockto, and others who I am not sharing names of) were bullied out the server for criticizing IGB in a similar manner to me and Blob Games Studio had actively smeared their reputation using lies, fake accounts and wordplay. It can be said that some of them were harsh, but this is never a justification for such behavior. Also, the team had been asking people to write good reviews, upvote good ones and downvoting bad ones on Steam to keep the rating at Mostly Positive so people buy the game. Starturbo and likely (though I lack confirmation) others had their reviews censored by having to omit mentions of Rockto and other drama that would make them (rightfully) look bad in the customer's eyes.\nThe immaturity in the chat and Felix and another member (who has since left and has also been harassed and wants to stay out of it) being inconsiderate about their jokes rubbed off on us. We asked them, politely, to stop, only for us to mocked to hell.\nThis left to me and Starturbo both leaving at the end of May 2016. We were to leave them alone, as long as we were left out of it too.\n\nNot that the calm remained for long. We started a Skype Group, later Discord server called Indie Game Utopia to create a hub for starting indie developers where everyone could have fun and speak their minds. A false, slandering article defaming me, Starturbo and other people was written by the aforementioned member that was at the time being immature and is now gone. I made a Twitter post debunking the article, and Blob Games Studio started to push the narrative that we were haters (which they still push and the Important Update refers to) and tried to essentially get us gone. That failed, as I started to expose more of what I had seen.\n\nNow, at the end of 2016, things hit a boiling point. We were becoming increasingly weary of what was going on, and at the start of 2017, more Third Parties were getting removed for no good reason. Also, features that were promised (a Story Mode and an Online mode) were never created and work on a Story Mode was barely even started. All there seemed to be was a final boss and some stages.\n\nThough at the same time, more and more 1st parties were added. The developers got worse over time in their disregard for the community and all forms of feedback they got and it was clear that this wasn't going to last.\n\nAnd it didn't.\n\nCue the removal of my dear friend Ryan Silberman for an inexcusably pathetic reason. Add that to Blob Games Studio's morally bankrupt, sociopathic practices becoming more and more apparent and Felix becoming increasingly desperate to defend his spot, resorting to more insidious tactics and forms of manipulation, trying to kill Indie Game Utopia from the inside using a combination of manipulating mods, spam raids and spreading false information.\n\nNow, Bounty has also been removed and his leaving was also spun in their favor. In truth, he was ran out of the server and had no choice, he was going to get kicked, but because he technically left himself that is the narrative.\n\nNow, the project's cancelled, people ask for a refund (as they've been scammed).\n\nLying about Bounty:\nhttps://twitter.com/BasMakesGames/status/905419007586689034\nhttps://twitter.com/BasMakesGames/status/905421830491660288\n\nRetrolands assets:\nhttps://twitter.com/BasMakesGames/status/905426500668841984\n\nSteam Vote Brigading:\nhttps://twitter.com/BasMakesGames/status/905447840587100162\n\nReactions to critics:\nhttps://twitter.com/BasMakesGames/status/905433667878752257\nhttps://twitter.com/BasMakesGames/status/905430372439261188\n\nRyan's story:\nhttps://twitter.com/BasMakesGames/status/905432200769888256\n\nI saved this review as well in case it gets deleted, as Blob Games Studio censored reviews in the past.

From the clunky controls, unfinished characters and stages, recently cut content, small list of items, tons of bugs and glitches, etc. Not to mention the horrible roster with only a few recognizable characters and a whole boatload of first parties.

Do not try and give any negative feedback to them or you'll be expecting a block, a ton of backlash and a long lasting grudge against you or you could be completely ignored.

Even though our venue was originally Smash exclusive, we started appending things like Injustice 2, Skullgirls, and Rivals of Aether. Indie Game battle [i]could[/i] have been that special next game, but it didn't happen for quite a few reasons.\n\n[i]Firstly, no, [b]it's not the roster's fault.[/b][/i] Sure, maybe you have ~8 OCs that look like Tom from EddsWorld and stand taller than the rest of the cast, and maybe there are a handful of characters I can't vouch for simply because they're perma-placeholders for the characters they very clearly represent, whether that character may be another indie game or a Smash Bros inclusion. I, however, am not shy to admit that it is nothing short of satisfying to 4-stock someone as the Goat from Goat Simulator, or that Dust is probably one of\u2014 if not [i]the[/i]\u2014 most fun character I've ever picked up in a platform fighter, or that the oddball Newgrounds inclusions sparked a hidden nostalgia that made me tear up a bit.\n\nThat aside, I'm going to be brutally honest: if there is one glaring reason I can't recommend this game, it's because of the [i]controls.[/i]\n\nThe notion that this game has full controller support, as indicated by Steam, is a blatant falsehood, although I [i]could[/i] understand these things being a simple oversight. Allow me put things into perspective through anecdote.\n\nMe and my friend usually play Super Smash Flash 2, Crusade, Rivals of Aether, etc. with 2 PS4 controllers key-mapped through Xpadder to make it easy on both the controller configuration and the game's processing itself. First time booting up IGB, we wanted to do similar to the above, but there was only support for a single player using the keyboard, which meant no Xpadder. Unfortunate, but since the game had native controller recognition, we thought we could shrug it off by configuring our controllers normally, but that wouldn't work because the game recognized both of our joypads as a singular controller, since they both registered as the same type of device according to Windows. So we had to begrudginly hand the keyboard (and sometimes his dusty Xbox 360 pad in place) back and forth because the game wouldn't let two players play with the same type of controller, which I feel is such an extreme thing to miss out on when talking about a local-multiplayer fighting game. All this and the fact that you [i]absolutely can't[/i] further configure controls outside of the Unity boot-up menu, which is just a total mess trying to navigate. I could go on about controls, but I know that it's a personal grudge above all, as most people who pick up this game are probably going to gravitate towards the keyboard anyways.\n\nMoving on, the UI in this game is probably among some of the worst I've seen in a very long time. I'd be willing to bargain that if you showed any web/graphic designer your game's buttons/menu backgrounds, they would redesign them happily for free. There's no visual/audio feedback on menu selections, and some of the cursor detection feels really off-kilter. The roster layout is random, there is no better word for it. I can at least expect characters to be close to eachother if they're from the same series, but some of the unavailable/incomplete characters occupy the same slot positions that fully functioning characters do. \n\nAlthough earlier I said I had fun experiences with this roster and the gameplay in general, I still can't let go of a few things. Some characters make me think as if they were only put in because you liked the game or because people asked for them. Poncho is a guest inclusion, and an interesting one at that, but he has one of the blandest movesets I've seen in a fighting game period. Characters differ vastly in quality and playability, and I really do mean it when I say that quite a few matchups in this game are 70:30 or likely worse. On that note I saw that you've also expressed interest in an appeal to the competitive scene for this game back before it was cancelled. I'll give my thoughts, as I'm technically part of that community. Why does G-canceling exist? Why do we need to wavedash into a tilt to be able to jump cancel it, why can't we just jump cancel tilts? This is an overcomplication, one that actually hurts newcommers because it comepletely negates the need for normal non-cancelable tilts, rather than acting as an option-select as you intended. Wavedashing on the other hand is fine, but it's so hard to execute one that actually carries your momentum and I couldn't tell you why. Above all, the average character's gravity makes recovery very difficult; I've died much too easily simply fumbling to keep myself on stage.\n\nI still have to give credit where credit is due, and these are some of the things that make me stick around still. You and others put a lot of time into alternate pallete choice for characters, who all are 3D-modelled with striking resembalance to their respective characters on the most part, and even when some cases were a miss, like your first iteration of Niko, you strived to improve those characters and fit them into a game that had a level of visual consistency that surprised me, knowing that these were all from indie games with extreme variety in visual design. The stage choice, although sprinkled with a lot of hazards and random pit placement, are copious. To this day I still haven't played every stage (I'm close) but I still enjoyed more than half of them. The music composition, Visual FX, and sound design are actually pretty impressive for an indie come-up, and they look even better in the upcoming version of the game so stick to it.\n\nFinally\u2014and I'll try to keep this short since you probably haven't heard the end of this from ex-devs\u2014I just wanna put out some thoughts about your decision to cancel the game, as well as the publicly disclosed/leaked events that led up to that point. I don't know if you were doing this game as a passion project, or as an actual opportunity for either yourself or the indie scene, but just relax man. Making a platform fighter is not an easy task to accomplish, no matter what tier of development you lie on. It's a proccess that takes a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. It's no wonder that even Sakurai himself continuously injured himself throughout the proccess of making Smash 4, as he really bore down to complete that project, and with that said, even with the entire team of Sora Ltd. on his side, collaborating with Namco as well it still took a good while to push the game out the door. Making a game in this genre simply as a hobby or as a wildcard is taxing, and I wouldn't be surprised if some of the people who you contacted for character inclusion thought you were reaching way out of your scope. This game feels like it was meant to be a fun platform fighter that pays homage to the indie scene that you've been part of and inspired by, but I think that started to get nudged aside for the sake of feature creep and status.\n\nI, personally, wouldn't ask for a refund for this game, because I know I'm going to be breaking it out every now and then to remember how fun it felt, and that's all I really expect for 10 bucks earned over the summer anyways. It made itself up by far. As for people new to this game, who have no feelings attached to the characters, are on the fence about how it feels etc., I'd only really recommend it as an experimental title. Thanks for making as much as you did, and bless you and your team for what you've accomplished to date. Ambitious, yes, but even now it's still something me and my friends will play for a while. That's all that really matters to me at this point.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1506699454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_forever": 439, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198034113822", "num_games_owned": 16}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502429", "timestamp_updated": 1505270903, "recommendationid": "34912186", "timestamp_created": 1505270903}, {"review": "I bought this game knowing it had work to be done but I didnt think the game would be straight up awful but then I said hey its still in early access right well then they cancel it so in other words the game is still awful and they don't even have half the characters they said they would have so in other words if you want a fighting game thats like smash bros I recomend something like rivals of aether.
