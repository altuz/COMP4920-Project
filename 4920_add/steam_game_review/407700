a good basic detailed review as soon as my character was created i spawned in town and was greeted by another player i then decided hmm i wonder what happens when i chase him lol he fled into a unsafe territory passing tree's bushes and terrain i caught up with my \"friend\" the other player then i casted some spell i forgot the name not use to everything yet but i did 27 damage on him with my sword then i ran around saw a man on a horse slowly walking towards me i was starting to get worried oh **** im on foot i cant outrun a horse lol but then i noticed i was greeted with a hello and his username was Admin  i can surely say i already feel at home with the developer greeting me and the other players in game and helping us out i can surely say this was so far a exciting experience we've already shared ideas and such and he seems to be very friendly kinded and well mannered.This game is everything i exspected at this time for $11.69 who can beat it with a top down view style camera and a point to click style pvp and pve im enjoying myself alot.\n\n\nThe game can literally run on almost any computer and when i mean almost the only computer that i believe that would be excluded from playing this game would be from the 70's or 80's or 90's\n\nMINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOS: XP \nProcessor: 2.0 Ghz Dual-Core \nMemory: 2 GB RAM \nGraphics: 256MB \nHard Drive: 300 MB available space\n\n\n\nWarrior Class\n----------\nWarriors deal alot of damage with weapons and various weapons with different attack rates i like warriors for my first class seams easiest to play not saying any other class is harder but just saying i prefer a easier class to play in the beginning if your going with warrior go with a dagger in the beginning until you level up your strength more.Warrior combat is hack and slash type gameplay point to click and attack daggers can attack once every second unlike some other weapons just choose what feels right for you its all up to you.\n\n\nMagic Class\n---------\nMagic is similar to Ulima online and diablo which is neat theres already quite a few spells to use you just need the required mana level to cast certain ones i can already say that the pvp is going to be intense.\n\n\nDefenders Class\n--------------------------\nVery tanky you grow defense levels quicker and you can withstand more damage overal the class tank you can play any class you want and you can use any weapons you want your not limited to your class type weapons im a warrior and i was weilding a staff and torch for magic bonus mage gear seems to be good \n\nOverall all the classes seem to be fairly balanced i hope this stays like this throughout the development of this title\n\nUser controls\n\nRight mouse button-Move around\nShift-Run\nLeft mouse button-Click to attack or interact with enemys or other players\nDragable items to place in your character gear screen such as equipment rings knecklaces armours etc..\nTo pick up items simply move your mouse cursor over the selected item and click take for gold all you have to do to pick it up is simply walk over it and it will automatically be added to your inventory\n\n\nI'll update my review as i play more \n\ni rate this game as of right now 12/10\nWhat do you have to loose you can barley get a meal at any restaurant for $11.69 take the chance its worth it i have high hopes for this game the developer seems to really care about how you feel about his game.Dont hesitate to suggest any idea's or suggestions.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 Star for open world pvp with safe zones more safe zones comming \n1 Star for Top down camera/Point to click gameplay\n1 Star for mounts Mounted Combat and in game house buildings excited to see where this goes :D\n1 Star for Cosmetic Item Shop not pay to win which is cool! unique cosmetic skins comming soon\n1 Star for Spells any class can cast spells and gain any skill basically you can become a hybrid\n1 Star for character customization basic but yet still cool to look different\n1 Star for the Indie Developer being so friendly kinded and well mannered he obviously cares about his community and how to make his game better\n1 Star for reading my suggestions and actually thinking about implementing some of my ideas/suggestions\n1 Stars for crafting comming in game words from the developer woot\n2 Stars for Archery comming in game words from the developer :D!\n1 star for polymorphing ability from scrolls that drop from mobs allows you to turn into a certain type of monster depending on where you obtained your scroll.\n2 Stars for being able to tame monsters\n1 star for being able to trade others in game\n\nOh yea after 5 hours of playing i finally found myself a treasure map gonna go find the loot soon.Wish me luck :D\n\n\nOveral this game has little to no known bug's and its initial gameplay is fun and exciting you actually have to put effort into fighting there is a skill bar with various spells you can cast all classes can cast any spell depending on there magic level or gear there wearing, certain gears give better bonuses not all gear is the same\n\n5/5 stars for my first time ingame experience :D", "steam_purchase":
