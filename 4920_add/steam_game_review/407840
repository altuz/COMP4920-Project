The devs are still updating this game and are very active in the community, so you won't have to worry about it being dumped and left for dead. While there is not a ton of content in the game right now, the future plans look amazing and I am really exicted to see where this game goes.\n\nPros:\n- Sweet graphics, since it was made with Unreal Engine.\n- It runs perfectly on my desktop, which is a gaming computer but not a super strong one.\n- Three different POVs: 1st person, 3rd person, and a top-down view. I love this because I do not see a lot of games implementing this.\n- The maps are large, detailed, and almost feel like an open world. There are a lot of places to hide and snipe from.\n- Cool classes with a lot of different abilities, ranging from an assault trooper with a jetpack to a tech person with a deployable turret to a warrior wielding a blade.\n- There is a skill tree and crafting system, which is nice to see in a shooter game.\n- Lots of character customization.\n- The enemies range from dinosaurs to invented creatures to robots, allowing for a lot of variety.\n- In the future the devs plan to add a true open world with spaceships and bases, which I can't wait to see.\n- Controller support.\n\nCons:\n- Most of the character classes have to be purchased, and there are a lot of in-game purchases. Eventually this game will be free-to-play, but since we have to buy the game the inclusion of in-game purchases feels unfair.\n- The current spaceship flying and controls feel slippery and off. Same goes for the player controls sometimes, and grenades just slide all over the place.\n- The local multiplayer is very confusing and does nto seem to be working for me.\n- Not a whole lot to do in-game besides fight waves of enemies, which is fun but gets tiring.\n- Menus and controls are confusing for keyboard users.\n\nI have a lot of fun playing this game, and I look forward to playing the finished product.
