{"reviews": [{"review": "Mad Nords: Porbably an Epic Quest is a great and very funny old school RPG. The best part about this game is an unusual (and somewhat absurd) humorous plot. Graphics are a little bit grotesque to my taste, but music and sound effects are very suitable to that dawn of PC gaming style.\n\nTo cut the long story short, if you're looking for exciting cucumber-gathering-doomsday-cult-slaying adventure you may give this game a try.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1498415242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 809, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198083047472", "num_games_owned": 8}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 52, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579903", "timestamp_updated": 1498301659, "recommendationid": "32695649", "timestamp_created": 1498247428}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
