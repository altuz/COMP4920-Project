The game also has a very self aware sense of humor with plenty of references to other older games, the progression is simple enough you collect hearts to unlock gates leading to each section of the game. it'll take anyone about 30 -45 minutes to complete the entire game, and if for all the completionists out there it might take 2 runs to get every upgrade and chest. The final boss alone is worth every minute of the game, it is completely hilarious, I'm not going to spoil it but any final fantasy fan should get the reference right off the bat. all in all a super cute, highly original free to play game. play it, you cannot go wrong.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1485333414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198170478306", "num_games_owned": 894}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1485334068, "recommendationid": "29478589", "timestamp_created": 1485334068}, {"review": "Really cute and fun.
