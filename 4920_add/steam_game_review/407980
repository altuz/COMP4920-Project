{"reviews": [{"review": "This game is a direct sequel to Sakura Beach. It picks up several months after the ending of that title, and deals with the continuing issues in the relationship with one or both of the girls. It appears that the relationship hasn't developed that much (based on the ending involving first kisses). While contemplating this, Seiji encounters a new girl, Nene, who is a rich young woman, living in a mansion, but who is very interested in astronomy.\n\nThe opening choice of the game involves picking the ending you had in the first game, and at the end, you finally choose who you intend to pursue, whether Momoko, Ayumi, Nene... or all three.\n\nWhich I guess one should expect from a Sakura title...", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1491768525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 148, "num_reviews": 362, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 445}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506695", "timestamp_updated": 1491763765, "recommendationid": "31046570", "timestamp_created": 1491763765}, {"review": "Sakura Beach 2, an interesting sequel to say the least. At first I thought that a sequel was pretty stupid, because what else can be done in order for another sequel. I mean the endings from the first game made it pretty clear what the future of Seiji was going to be.\n\nThis game begins by building upon the endings that one chose from the first game, giving further detail to what has happened to Seiji, Ayumi and Momoko, and their current relationship status and issues. Which I thought is good; it builds further into their story (of each endings, obviously) and adding more detail. But I guess that isn't enough for the justification of a sequel nor will it satisfy an audience (who are probably mostly hungry desperate men) so they go a head and add another waifu into the mixture. As if it wasn't already hard choosing between two... \n\nBut overall I thought this sequel was good though - Spoiler Alert - instead of having an ending (if you choose only one of the girls) where the relationship is still a bloody mess. The endings clears things up between Seiji and his friends, which I thought was good for an ending. \n\n10/10 Would reccomend! \n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1498837112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 285, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198090304423", "num_games_owned": 80}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500087", "timestamp_updated": 1494381556, "recommendationid": "31657702", "timestamp_created": 1494381556}, {"review": "Even better then the first one\nAgain amazing story and not to much hentai like\nit conects awesome to the story of the first one\nBest game i played in this genere\n\nPS: Please do a 3. part or a story that plays before the first part,  i just love the caracters", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1499345169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 395, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198165171323", "num_games_owned": 162}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504141", "timestamp_updated": 1493469014, "recommendationid": "31438883", "timestamp_created": 1493469014}, {"review": "It's k", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1496647710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 18513, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198253367585", "num_games_owned": 104}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 5, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499038", "timestamp_updated": 1496609697, "recommendationid": "32184934", "timestamp_created": 1496609697}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 54, "review_score": 6, "total_negative": 23, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 77, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive"}, "success": 1}
