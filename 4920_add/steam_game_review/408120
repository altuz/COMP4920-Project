{"reviews": [{"review": "While I enjoyed Cibele, I wouldn't describe it as a game as much as an interactive narrative.  I think the experience of first love, or any close bond in one's formative years of internet use is fascinating.  Unfortunately, the playable game within the narrative, while visually pleasant, is tedious.  It is not time consuming, but it is an aimless yet unavoidable segment in each of the story's 3 acts, it absolutely distracts you from the narrative.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504650940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 115, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198067792309", "num_games_owned": 30}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498077", "timestamp_updated": 1504660240, "recommendationid": "34767480", "timestamp_created": 1504660240}, {"review": "Firstly, let's talk about the description and how true the game stays to it, \"Cibele is a game about love, sex, and the internet. \" Love and the internet is a strong theme in this game as this game is based on the protagonist being a girl who plays some type of MMO/RPG game (Something along the lines of WOW but simplified) who also falls inlove with a guy from her guild or group. Sex is thrown in there as some lame fanservice to attract perverts and we're awarded with an equally lame sex scene.\n\nPossibly the most deceiving of the description is this, \"Her relationship with him heats up, becoming more and more intimate with each phone call and private chat.\" Which will make you think that the game will last longer than atleast one hour (Spoiler alert, it doesn't). The game consists of THREE chat segments. None of them reach any levels of intimacy as the first call is the love interest calling the protagonist cute, hot, the best and etc. Second segment consists of them talking about meeting up, kissing/ having sex and they finally say they love eachother, Third segment is where they plan to meetup however the guy is blantantly hesitant. \n\nThe gameplay is a chore, sure it's all cutesy and pretty, however it's bland. Now, I'm not asking for the next call of duty whilst trying to listen to a socially awkward guy call a girl hot whilst she dismisses him however the delivery of the story could've been better, prehaps have the game totally focus on the relationships of the other people that the protagonists talks to instead of occasionally getting a message. \n\nAnyway, the story is pretty much spoiled three minutes in of playing as one of the many friends of the protagonist object to the love interest, calling them an ass to which the protagonist defends the love interest whilst the friend reminds them that the guy is only nice because she has a pair of tits. \n\nShort story short, guy and girl fall in love, guy has doubts saying he clearly doesn't want a \"relationship, to meet up, or to get close to anyone\" to which the protagonist forces him into doing anyway then protagonist gets used for sex and the guy leaves. (The protagonist also had like two guys interested in her at the time which seem to be more engaged and excited about meeting her or having a reunion with her but obviously they're not good enough).\n\nDon't buy this game, or buy it and refund it\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1505936358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 60, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198111419551", "num_games_owned": 102}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499588", "timestamp_updated": 1505938542, "recommendationid": "35091447", "timestamp_created": 1505938542}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 190, "review_score": 6, "total_negative": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 268, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive"}, "success": 1}
