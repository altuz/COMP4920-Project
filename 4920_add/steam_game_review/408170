Great Cyberpunk and Hacker theme.  You are hacking the networks  by making runs through a Tempest like tunnel acade game.  You can speed up, move left and right.   You have to avoid hitting things in the tunnel that you are moving through, while keeping ahead of a timer. You Need good reflexes and know left from right. When you get enough money you can upgrade yourself with different abilities, like guns and jumping.  Has 80's style visual reprentation of hacking the net. \n\nCan change the camera angle.\nGreat electronica music for soundtracks, but does not have a mute for background music.\n\ncons:\ncould use instructions.\nrename the 2 currencies in the game credibility and credits. Both are using the initials \"CR\" in parts of the game.\n\n\nfor more info:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ByP-cJf1sc\n\nhttp://www.indiedb.com/games/networm \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ylED-lEBlo \n\nhttp://indiegames.com/2015/06/networm_hacking_up_a_tempest.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfIk0x5wUds \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7CCuiDgtwo", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1485196190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 72, "num_reviews": 558, "steamid": "76561197982295752", "num_games_owned": 100}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506388", "timestamp_updated": 1449016994, "recommendationid": "19313981", "timestamp_created": 1448647359}, {"review": "Great soundtrack, easy to pickup (although I prefer fixed camera mode 3) and able to complete it in the first week. \n\nBut it still has enough replayability to make me come back and play more, especially on Endless Mode.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1446248956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 430, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198042930742", "num_games_owned": 24}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498179", "timestamp_updated": 1446249259, "recommendationid": "18779788", "timestamp_created": 1446249259}, {"review": "Great concept with beautifully simple and stylish gameplay.\n\nWhen you get into your stride making a run becomes almost hypnotic and hugely satisfying.\n\nLove it.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1446127248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198002530581", "num_games_owned": 18}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499143", "timestamp_updated": 1446113759, "recommendationid": "18740143", "timestamp_created": 1446113668}, {"review": "I am better than Chief at this game and that is all that matters to me!
