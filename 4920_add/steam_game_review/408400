{"reviews": [{"review": "It's a lot like I remember the old Might and Magic or Bard's Tale games from, uh, a long time ago. The combat is good, with some suprising combos. The story line has good pacing with just enough quests to keep you moving, but not so many that you've got a lot of loose ends. It's good for a completionist like me. The artwork is quite good, I really liked the style, though the artist has a penchant for scantily clad evil women.\n\nThere's not much dynamic about the world. You don't see creatures moving anywhere, like in Grimrock, you wander through the dungeons until a random or predetermined battle results.\n\nThe bottom line is it was well worth my time and money.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1499623661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1297, "num_reviews": 38, "steamid": "76561197972462277", "num_games_owned": 126}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1499623951, "recommendationid": "33410939", "timestamp_created": 1499623951}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 27, "review_score": 6, "total_negative": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 35, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive"}, "success": 1}
