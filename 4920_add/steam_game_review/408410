Wishlisted the moment it was announced and waited patiently. \n\nTL/DR: Fun game, fair price. Tower defense + shmup. Excellent graphics and ambience. Decent voice acting. Hilariously sub par naming of bosses ( lol ) \n\nIt is a tower defense game but less defense and more shmup imho. You can't defeat the levels with just towers alone, you must make use of the alien fighter and all of its abilities. Later game, I found myself favoring the laser and anti air, your experience may deviate/vary. \n\nI enjoyed almost every aspect of this game including the voice acting and the graphic design of the levels, enemies, terrain, bosses. The only thing I found laughable was the naming of some of the bosses, some are quite hilarious, I haven't yet decided if that is a funny quality that added to the quirkiness of the game or just a very miniscule annoyance.\n\nI also enjoyed the difficulty and learning curve (which there isn't much of, it is fairly simple to grasp). Word of advice, always always always take the time to scoop up every resource you can, it really makes a difference if you slack off in resource gathering. As I said, you can not defeat the levels with towers alone (almost can later on when you're fully upgraded but not quite) but in that same regard, you can't just use the fighter and its abilities to defeat levels either, you're going to need those towers which means you're going to need all of those resources. \n\nAgain, had a blast with this game, it was worth the wait and the fair price.

Remember the old Atari game Space Invaders?  It's basically the same type of gameplay.  Waves of enemys approach, and you shoot projectiles at them to defend  your base.  \n\nThe graphics are fun.  The maps are interactive with destructable bridges and buildings etc.  The physics look great for a small-budget game, and overall it has a nice feel.\n\nUnfortunately, it's not polished.  In the 3 hours of game play that I've accumulated, I've encountered two game-ending crashes, and at least one brick wall on the campaign progression.  The crashes are pretty self-explanitory.  I was playing the campaign mode, when suddenly the game closed itself and a debug report appeared on my screen.  While those incidents are annoying, I'm confident the developer team will eventually fix them.  The brick wall occured when I played the \"Germany\" phase of the campaign (I think it's the third level).  Each time a player starts a new phase, he/she chooses some specific tech upgrades and tower types.  For the first time, I had the option to choose a fire tower, so naturally I chose that because it seemed like it would be fun to try something new.  Unfortunately, progressing through the Germany phase requires air towers and by choosing fire, I had to disable air - which meant the phase became literally impossible.  No, it's not a \"get good noob\" type of situation, it's just simply impossible to defeat that phase if a player chooses fire towers rather than air towers.  This is a broken brick wall that should have been addressed prior to the game's release.  The point is, that the game is kind of sloppy.\n\nX-morph has a few other problems as well.  The foremost is the reliance on the space-invaders gameplay.  As a TD, you might expect that the towers you build will do the majority of bad-guy killing work. However, that's not the case.  On most stages, it feels like the towers are secondary, and the player-controlled builder kills the majority of the invaders.  It feels like the tower building is secondary to the player-controlled blasting.  Ultimately, the towers didn't really even matter because I was killing everyting with my ship anyway.  Furthermore, progression in the campaign mode is slow.  The tech is awarded at a turtle pace.  You'll be clearing 6+ mini-levels before you get a new shooting weapon or tower type.  I'm only 3 hours in, and I'm already bored.  \n\nOverall, with the gameplay relying so heavily on point-and-click spaceship shooting, I can't recommend X-morph.  Hopefully, after they fix the bugs and crashes, they developers will tweak the game to make it more of a TD and less of a shooter... but until that happens, I can't really recommend X-morph.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1505238551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 249, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561197984173791", "num_games_owned": 98}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "3", "votes_down": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479799", "timestamp_updated": 1505233549, "recommendationid": "34904312", "timestamp_created": 1505233549}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 95, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 18, "total_reviews": 100, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
