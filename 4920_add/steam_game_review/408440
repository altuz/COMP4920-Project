I almost want to ask for a refund of my 99 cents so I can forever cleanse my palette of this awful disaster of game design- if you can even call it that. There is no tutorial, not tool tips, and nothing seems remotely understandable. There are times I wanted to restart my game and hitting ESC didn't even work, so I had to end progress in task manager to close the game. The sound isn't working, and I'm not even sure if it's supposed to work or not, because there is no options menu. I tried to dive straight in, to see if I could figure it out on my own, and before I could even get a room made the workers started to complain of having no bushes to pee in. I didn't even know I was supposed to make a bathroom or kitchen for these guys because I thought the game was about making movies. I can't tell what tiles I'm placing down until the workers get done building it, and there were times I restarted the game and old tiles or supply crates were still there and I couldn't demolish or build in those spots. I had to get out of build mode by right clicking before I could click to close the little pop-ups saying they needed to pee and eat, because if I didn't, I would accidentally click and place a build square. I couldn't stop them from building something until after they got done building it, meaning I lost the money used to build in that square.\n\nI enjoyed the sepia tone colors and the strange characters when I first saw this game and hoped it would be enjoyable. I'm just glad I didn't waste a full $10 on this game...", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1491844694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 18, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198094165039", "num_games_owned": 47}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497869", "timestamp_updated": 1491845383, "recommendationid": "31063938", "timestamp_created": 1491845383}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
