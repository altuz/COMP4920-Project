{"reviews": [{"review": "Decent game. Steam should have a Neutral rating on these reviews or a 5 point system, The game it's not completly bad, but it's absolutly not innovative in any way. Still I enjoyed and hooked up for 3 days. Then uninstalled.\n\nIt s a 3DS port and its appreciated, they tweaked some little things to be able to be played on PC, you press f5 to toggle the dual screen from a 3Ds that only shows your stats and combos, could have been easily translated into a sub menu, but well the least they work making a port, the more profit. The audio is 3Ds quality, the graphics are 3DS quality and the anime character  designs is lazy, including the cutscenes that were developed by japanese animation Studio Bones, very famous with anime fans.\n\nOn the good part the characters ar e fully japanese voiced in many ways. so thats a good thing.\nThe combat system is repetitive but pretty good, you could use combos and it has a full RPG system so you could create your characters as you wish, for example a bard full of speed or a necromancer full of attack, the world it's yours to go crazy.\nAlso it features like 50 characters to play with on the freeplay, which is pretty neat. And since there are so many character leveling up and gold and exp are plentiful. Also has multiplayer. But never found who to play with.\n\nIts a nice game, there are probabily some others better, so buy this on sale. Don't pay full price, it's not worthy.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501039995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 362, "num_reviews": 59, "steamid": "76561198019112527", "num_games_owned": 1171}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499141", "timestamp_updated": 1500971056, "recommendationid": "33781972", "timestamp_created": 1500971056}, {"review": "I really wanted to like this game. The characters are quirky and likeable.\n\nThe controls are messy and unintuitive. The AI is a bad joke for all the wrong reasons. It's basically impossible to recover from a combo. There's so much of the game that's flat out luck based thanks to the AI.
