{"reviews": [{"review": "Army Gals is a great game---Battle Girls is a good game--Negligee is an O.K. game and Beauty bounce barely got a positive rating.  This game has three positives 1. it brings out that you should ask for help if you are suffering from depression, 2. That bullying in school is a problem ( does not provide a real solution-- but it is just a vn), 3. It is very short and the art was good.\nNegatives are everything else. If I detailed them all there would be nothing for you to experience in the game. If you play this game you will understand why being very short is listed as a positive. I will give just one example --going into a coma and possessing 2 girls is the most plausible part of the story.
