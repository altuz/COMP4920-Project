{"reviews": [{"review": "Yes, but it was very close to a \"no\".\n\nI like this game, but it really is the base level for what I like. It's missing too much and feels like a rushed handheld port. For instance on the infinite levels one is still held to the artificially low building cap, so rather than see how far you can take a level you have to sit there with many open unbuilt spaces as the level runs to it's artificially quick end. I also really did not like the nontower puzzle levels at all, they felt forced and more like work than a game. I wish some more thought and effort had been put into Dead Stop. It feels like a demo for a larger game.\nThat said, it is a fun game and plays very well. The towers are pretty standard but in a good familiar way. Had the pricetag been three bucks I would be happierier recomending it. \nThe look of the game is great, the art director did a fantastic job.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1461222806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1679, "num_reviews": 36, "steamid": "76561197970712242", "num_games_owned": 1086}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510573", "timestamp_updated": 1461375568, "recommendationid": "22578392", "timestamp_created": 1461375568}, {"review": "One of the worst of the genre.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1503850187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 144, "num_reviews": 37, "steamid": "76561198067556154", "num_games_owned": 2612}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1503850241, "recommendationid": "34533035", "timestamp_created": 1503850241}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
