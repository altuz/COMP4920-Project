And with a small playerbase. Is quite fun at this moment in time. Let me go into some detail.\n\n- SPACEMEN\nHumans sent from the company they work on, arrive at a \"Station\". Fixing it up, and sending crates and research samples into space. Such goals are to re-activate power, clear landing pads, and generally be a helping hand by making sure everything's in shape.  Buutt.. This game wouldn't have Unfortunate in the name, if it only had Spacemen.\n\n- THE ALLEN\nThe Allen is a creature hellbent on destroying everything the Spessmen hold dear. The power, breaking open virus canisters to infect the Spessmen. And, of course. Killing them.\n\nThe balance, currently. Seems fairly well. You need to be a cunning S.O.A.B to survive the round as either side. Each weapon does low damage against the monster, aside from explosives and flames. However, those only occur late in a round.\n\nThe entire team has to team up against the Monster, unless you stick a Hand Grenade in a microwave and lob it to the Allen. You will NOT win alone. Though, most of the time. You will do a certain amount of damage. Unless you're just absolutely mucked up.\n\nHowever, the line between friend and foe is way blurred. You can steal key-cards, push people into space ejectors. Flashbang your commrades to test if they're human. You cannot walk alone in this game, but you also cannot walk with someone untrustworthy. Most of the time, you don't know if that Electric Mucus guy is actually your best friend. Or just waiting to corner you in a meatlocker. \n\nThere's a handful of weapons, not an insane amount, but still a decent amount of guns for this game.. Besides, too many guns would be heck to balance.\n\n- Handgun\n- Assault Rifle\n- Grenades\n- Rocket Lawnchair\n- Flamethrower\n- THE SHOTGUN\n- Probably More.\n\nDon't forget about the Space Milk. You know, the one that makes you see the eldritch god N'zul Katmandu, bringer of the end times. Which then sends you somewhere.. Miight be a space ejector, or a quaint place. Like a blood-filled hallway.\n\nThis game is essentially Trouble in Terrorist Town, in space. With The Thing. And Milk.\n\nWhen you see a game that allows you to drink poisonous milk and throw grenades at your friends, it's probably a good one.\n\nNo game is meant for everyone, but this game is great if you want a game to just bro out with random strangers every weekend. This might change, but right now. Not many people play it in the weekdays. But there ARE community games hosted every saturday at 2:00 PM EST.\n\nIf you have the money, buy it and try it out on the next saturday you got. If you don't like it, refund it. However, I truly feel like it's worth a try.\n\nDO NOT BUY WITHOUT A MICROPHONE. YOU WILL GET SHOT IN THE LEGGY LEGS.\n\nRemember to shill out $50 for DUSK please - Lord Zag.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506201747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36, "playtime_forever": 339, "num_reviews": 107, "steamid": "76561197998065407", "num_games_owned": 324}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "3", "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417092", "timestamp_updated": 1505597409, "recommendationid": "35007708", "timestamp_created": 1505597409}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 56, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 12, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 68, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
