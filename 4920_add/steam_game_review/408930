{"reviews": [{"review": "This is a fantastic piece of software!  I'm not a gamer but a 3d artist and love that I can create art in just a few clicks.  I can then take these images into Photoshop and do what I want to make them my own, even though that's not needed.  What comes out of the program is really impressive.  These images would be great for people who like doing ATC cards in the crafting/scrapbooking arena too.  I wouldn't mind seeing more features added of course but what it's capable of right now is amazing IMO.  Plus I've found it's a great muse and has already sparked my imagination for doing some projects in Daz Studio.  It's a great program and I thought it was worth buying.  Although it might go over better if the Pro version of the program was free and with a few items from each pack included.  Then once people used it, they would most definitely want to buy all the packs.  Well whatever happens, I hope this will continue to be developed and supported.  :)", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1502035033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 390, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198408234684", "num_games_owned": 0}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1501463619, "recommendationid": "33917781", "timestamp_created": 1501463619}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
