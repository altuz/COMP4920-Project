{"reviews": [{"review": "Another time I kinda wish Steam had a 'meh' option.\n\nSummary of following review: The issues with the game aren't as bad as people say, but the game itself doesn't merit a positive review.\n\nI was a fan of the original One Way Heroics and would have played this pseudo-sequel earlier, but because of all the negative reviews it received at launch, I held off on buying and playing it until it only cost a dollar.\nOn the positive end, this is basically just more of the original OWH. Chunsoft expanded the list of equipment with a few new equipment types and special effects, which I'm sure will be interesting to discover, but the core gameplay remains pretty much the same as before. Sadly, that's really all I have to say as far as positives go.\nThe negatives that you've heard really aren't that bad, though. For instance, Chunsoft's version of OWH added hidden traps that players or NPCs can trigger just by moving. You can't see where the traps are located outside of the tutorial, but none of the traps I triggered were anything more than a minor annoyance, and certainly not game-ending provided you've been playing with anything resembling traditional gaming wisdom. Still, Chunsoft should have known better than to add something like this; random unfairness is just poor game design, whether it really affects the players or not. Thankfully, there is an option to make traps visible if you don't want to deal with them.\nThe infamous 'framerate issue' is also a bit overblown. Yes, the game stutters because offscreen enemies still need to move between player movements. No, it's not nauseating, it's just annoying. The wait time does increase as the number of enemies increases, and usually is between a tenth of a second and nearly a full second. Overall it hasn't been a hindrance, but it does slow down gameplay.\nPersonally, the biggest blow to this game for me was just that I felt the original had more charm. That probably depends a lot on player preference, and I admit I have an affection for simple-looking graphics, but it also carried into the way that the character portraits look and the dialogue between characters. While from a technical perspective I can see that Chunsoft's art ought to score higher than the original's, I think perhaps the original's simplicity was more in keeping with the relatively simple gameplay. Chunsoft took a system that worked well and wanted to expand on it, but really just ended up complicating it; muddying the essence of what made OWH a great game to relax with in the first place.\n\nSo if you really want more OWH content and don't mind a couple minor annoyances, this game probably wouln't be a bad choice with a price of only one dollar. But if you're trying to decide which one to get, follow the advice of the other reviewers and play the original instead. I rate this at 6.5/10.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1503294628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 258, "num_reviews": 25, "steamid": "76561198060527161", "num_games_owned": 313}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505756", "timestamp_updated": 1503345937, "recommendationid": "34388971", "timestamp_created": 1503296014}, {"review": "Thanks to Panic Fire for giving me the benefit of the doubt. \n\nMystery Chronicle: One way heroics is... Different than One Way Heroics +. While i still absolutely recommend OWH+, Mystery chronicle isnt bad either - but it has a lot of faults.\n\nIf you're an anime fan you are bound to like the characters in this game. If you simply prefer RPG combat and dont care for stories, you should take a look at One Way Heroics plus instead. It is one of the best games on steam.\n\nMystery chronicle has performance issues. It has extremely low framerate regardless of your system due to being capped to 30 fps (it is a console port).\n\nStill, if you can look past the slow framerate, it's an alright game. It doesnt provide much information at any time, so it can come across as somewhat mindless at times, but its still entertaining.\n\nPersonally, i find this game to be alright once you've played OWH+ so much you know everything about it. This is a downgrade of that game, but it is still a one way heroics game - so it's simply new content to an old game. Which is nice when that old game is really great.\n\nBeware though, you sadly have to play for quite a while before the game really \"begins\". You'll have to just endure being bored out of your mind for the first couple hours. Also, this game even more than the previous ones can be considered \"inventory management simulators\" because you will constantly have to juggle inventory items to make space for things you find.\n\nCompared to OWH+, this game gives you less vision, less information, fewer enemy types and much fewer items. It is ported from the psp vita, so it makes sense for it to have less content than previous games. On the bright side, it has more secret unlockables, and a whole lot more classes.\n\nI have reconsidered, and i now think this game can be worth it. You simply have to be patient, then eventually you'll break the \"early game barrier\" and get to the enjoyable game that lies beneath, aka the core One Way Heroics experience.\n\nIf there was a story mode for One Way Heroics, this game would be it. The music is less adventurous and more dramatic compared to the previous titles, but that does not mean it is bad.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1504472348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3031, "num_reviews": 28, "steamid": "76561198023681921", "num_games_owned": 247}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "5", "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499593", "timestamp_updated": 1503149467, "recommendationid": "33863236", "timestamp_created": 1501269400}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 78, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 114, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
