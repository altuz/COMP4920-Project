{"reviews": [{"review": "So far so good! This appears to have all of the softcore roguelike features ie; Permadeath, Upgradable Town (Improved weapons/armor, enhanced starting levels/gold for new toons, enhanced resource gain etc), and merchants to purchase new gear. Resources are gained each time a stage is cleared, allowing you to make upgrades to your town.\n\n     There are currently two classes. One a Dwarf warrior, and the second a tribal female Shamman. They play as you'd expect, standard melee and caster respectively. You gain levels quickly, with which you enhance Strength, Agility or Intelligence, and increase the power of inherent skills. The basic stats also have varying effects on the two different characters, alluding to lots of variation as new ones are released.\n     \n     The combat controls are intuitive and familiar. The AI is predictiable, melee attackers bum rush you, and casters and ranged hang back and fire away. You start with a good variety of skills, and the combat is fun from the start, and fast.\n\n     When you start, and after each stage is completed, you go to a World Map, where your next encounter will occur. You usually have a choice of varying encounters ie; standard battle, defense (which scales to your level) and/or a diplomacy option which is unique and offers rewards based upon your dialogue choices.\n\n     Obviously as this is the first day of early access, all these things will change and develop, but the first impression is a great one. I did just have my first crash, immediately prior to writing this. The screen locked up while fighting, and then crashed. But this is to be expected so early on, and I'll be heading back in shortly to level my next sacificial lamb.\n\n     P.S. The crash merely reverted my save data to the previous town visit.

This is not a rouge like. It is a rouge light or rouge like like, depending on what you prefer to call that genre.\n\nThe progression system in the game is generally speaking good but it does have a major problem. The resources needed to upgrade the structures in town are initially only given out by the keep once you have successfully completed an encounter so you\u2019d presume that it would be a good idea to upgrade the keep as soon as possible to get more resources after each encounter. The problem here is that the keeps first upgrade cost more then any other buildings last upgrade. This means that by the time you can afford to upgrade the keep you can afford to upgrade some other building that is more likely to enhance your chances of survival. Basically there is no reason to upgrade the keep unless you have nothing left to upgrade at that time and this only occurs if you have maxed out all other structures or the remaining upgrades are locked behind an encounter limit, which only the experience vault has at this time. I would suggest that the keeps upgrade cost be reduced or a different structure with a lower upgrade cost handle rewarding resources.\n\nLooking at the different kinds of encounters I\u2019d say that the hostile, defense, and friendly encounters make sense but the gamble encounter seems pointless as it is. As far as I can tell there are now benefits to doing a gamble encounter over any other that is available at the encounter level your on. The only reason to choose to do a gamble encounter is either you have no other option or you are hoping to avoid one of the other encounter options. Honestly the gamble encounter should either be removed or it should provide some kind of enhanced reward for completion, maybe you could pay renowned, money, or resources to up the difficulty and if you win get back what you paid plus some amount based on difficulty.\n\nThe weakest point of the game, the combat. If this where a mobile game I\u2019d say the combat is good, but its not and it isn\u2019t. Almost the entire game can be played with only five buttons and three of those you only use to open up menus and that\u2019s a problem when you\u2019ve made a game like this on PC. Having the abilities and items tied to the number keys isn\u2019t a problem, in-fact that\u2019s exactly how it should be. The problem comes in how you control your characters movements and attacks. Both these actions are controlled by the left click of the mouse. Attacks occur automatically as soon as the target you clicked on is in range, so the flow of combat is simply click on target wait until its dead repeat and maybe use and ability or item if you have to. This makes the core game play loop very dull and disengaging. The only times it becomes a bit more involved is when you have to kite an enemy, usually as the shaman, and even then it is just attack until the enemy gets to close then run away making it two clicks instead of one.\n\nThe combat in this game needs to be reworked. Either give the player more control over the character they are using, have them control more then one in an encounter, or make the levels more like dungeons with rooms and halls so that the player has something to explore and move around in. As it stands now the combat just kills this game.
