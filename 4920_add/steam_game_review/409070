{"reviews": [{"review": "Honestly, this game isn't bad, it's just mediocre.\n\nIf you're a retro fan, you'll get some enjoyment out of the game, but it doesn't have anything to keep you there for the long term.\n\nThe graphics are great, the music is okay, the gameplay is fun... when the controls work.\n\nSee, I had multiple instances where it wouldn't let me fire my secondary weapons while jumping or wouldn't let me climb the walls for apparently no reason.  This is troublesome since climbing the walls is necessary to win the game.\n\nThe levels also feel way too long, and the enemies are all very similar and generic looking.\n\nLike I said, it's an overall mediocre clone of games like Ninja Gaiden and Vice: Project Doom for the NES.\n\nIf you want to see a more indepth review of this game, you can check out my video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGkZzKvIrSc", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1502436731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 202, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198040808468", "num_games_owned": 1511}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509552", "timestamp_updated": 1502450722, "recommendationid": "34166465", "timestamp_created": 1502450722}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 9, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
