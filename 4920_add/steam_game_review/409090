{"reviews": [{"review": "[b]A noble man compares and estimates himself by an idea which is higher than himself; and a mean man, by one lower than himself. The one produces aspiration; the other ambition, which is the way in which a vulgar man aspires. - Marcus Aurelius[/b]\n\nWhen I decided to pop up a random hidden object game for a lazy afternoon, and unknowingly chose to go with [i]The Big Secret of a Small Town[/i], I ended up discovering a tiny masterpiece of a puzzle game accidentally. As the only game of the small Russian developer team, Flenx, this game is probably the most elaborate and notice worthy title in Buka Entertainment's catalogue.\n\nHere, we have a nameless, yet prosperous small town settled beside an industrial complex, led by a witty looking mayor. It is said that the town has a heart, hidden beneath the fair town that would power all the machines and factories which makes this little town so prosperous - all entrusted to our mayor. The mayor is loved by many; him being kind, smart and wise. Yet again, his good qualities don't prevent him being abducted in the middle of a press conference and we are there as the determined detective to find him.\n\nEven though that the gameplay contains little to nothing concerning a story, the story that we have as a baseline for events are basic, yet elegant, and the setting itself is quite marvelous. The whole Steam Punk Theme combined with Gaelic Magic presents a remarkable concept to have a gaming environment within. We are given the opportunity to watch cinematics telling the tale of this little town by clicking on old tapestries as we progress. As the environment itself, all those cinematics are hand drawn beauties taken out of a beloved story book. I should also declare that it was an interesting idea to narrate the background cinematics through the main villain\u2019s point of view. It presents a good level of immersion and story consistency.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the display is one of the strong sides of this wondrous little game. Background pictures are well elaborate, the environment design is nearly Daedalic quality. I've seen decent adventure games with worse art than this small puzzle game. The music is also worthy of mentioning, by being the selection of beautifully orchestrated original scores.\n\nAbout the gameplay... It is a successful hybrid of a HOG and a decent enough adventure game. We have HOG environment design, yet no actual HOG scenes. Items to be collected via P&C progress, are hard to notice so that might be counted as a HOG. The really shining part of the game are its puzzles though. No run-on-the mill selection that you've seen for the 100th time, no hand holding, no mediocre solution. These are decent brain teasers that would take actual thinking and even time invested. Puzzles are mostly skippable if you are more interested with the story, yet I'd recommend sparing the time to actually solve them to fully appreciate the game content.\n\nThe game has no Steam achievements, yet an achievement system within the game which is already fitting to integrate into Steam achievements. The whole experience should take 7-8 hours if you are to actually solve puzzles, 2-3 if you are a skipper. As the last word, this is a more than decent little puzzle game you may appreciate if you are bored of tedious excuses of puzzles in most HOGs.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1472212233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 510, "num_reviews": 210, "steamid": "76561198139328230", "num_games_owned": 1770}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 56, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593734", "timestamp_updated": 1472215255, "recommendationid": "25160947", "timestamp_created": 1472215255}, {"review": "Wonderful puzzle game, well actually it is a brain teaser game.  Brain teasers are puzzles that look immensely complicated but in reality have remarkably simple solutions.  Think Medusa's Knot.  Or the old logic brain teaser of how to get an object from the center of a rug without stepping on the rug.\n\nStoryline:  The Mayor of the Small Town has been kidnapped.  It is your job (as a detective) to find him and bring him back.  Simple enough.  (The opening sequence is actually narrated by the villian and the only one who speaks in the entire game.) Oh yes and while looking for the mayor and chasing after the villian, one learns the secret of the small town.\n\nGameplay: Simple point and click game focused on the brain teaser and puzzle elements.  A note about the point and click find items and inventory.  The find items in many cases are small or very small so search carefully when looking for things like buttons or puzzle pieces.  Some are found in odd places like a footprint or in the smaller puzzle boxes. (HINT: If a box opens, such as the alchemy puzzle, and remains able to be opened the player is missing something in the box.  The smaller boxes close permenantly when everything in that box is found and finished.)  The inventory exists simply to hold items long enough to collect all the pieces for the puzzle presently being worked on.  It is a collect and use in that area inventory.  There are few hold over items from area to area.  There are 8 areas total the detective traverses through each with a main puzzle to solve before the player can move on.  Once an area is completed the player can not go back and the play is limited in scope to just a few places so no map is needed.  Advice: Look closely at everything and do not ignore anything hanging.  Clues and directions are found in these places.  \n\nNow about the puzzles: They range in difficulty from easy to extremely hard (and patience testing in a case or two.)  Fortunately, there is a no penalty skip button for when the player gets frustrated or simply does not want to be bothered.  All the puzzles are logic based, the more obscure ones get dialogue with highlighted words to give the players clues about what to do, and most are actually brain teasers.  Plus if the player looks at all the little drawings and posters everywhere, these drawings are clues (One poster is even labelled CLUE) if not the actual solution to the puzzle. (The tangram puzzle comes to mind in that regard.  The solution is actually shown on a piece of paper.)  There are clues everywhere to finding the solutions to the puzzles.  Again search an area carefully for all items and all those little places that are hiding items.              \n\nPuzzles include sliders, assembly, straight logic, rotaters, and mazes? (that is all I can think of to call them - those puzzles a player needs to connect something from point A to point B).\n\nFor those who want an extra challenge (and to complete an in-game achievement or two) look for all the extra cutscenes (usually found on tapestries) and the Flenx logo, a stylized elephant.  (For some reason when the game was translated the stylized elephant logo got called a \"bishop\".  It evens sounds like an elephant when clicked on. Simply shakes head.)  \n\nAnd lastly some words about the end game.  It is a puzzle like all the others but with no skip option.  The point is to zap the villian with an electrical charge.  (He deserves it since he nearly kills the player earlier in the game.)  Now there is a trick to this puzzle or the player will be endlessly chasing the villian about.  (Many reviews state this chasing as a frustration and there are discussions about how to catch him.)  Trick spoiler: [spoiler]I will tell you, the reader/player, this since the hint button does not do more then point out the \"trick\" area without explanation.  Plus the villian can be defeated in 15 moves, so the achievement claims.  The trick is a DIAGONAL move which can only occur between the two blue squares in the bottom right corner of the floor.  This changes the rhythmn from one of simply following to one of actively pursuing.  (In other words, from being a move behind to being a move ahead.)[/spoiler]  Good luck with catching villian, remember it is still a logic puzzle.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game.  A well thought puzzle, brain teaser, logic game that makes one think but not so hard that it makes one mad or frustrated playing.  It leaves the player with a satisfied feeling and for me, after chasing that villian for far longer then I care to admit, I actually cheered when I caught him.  (Of course, that was after discovering the \"trick\".)", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1461022912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 668, "num_reviews": 119, "steamid": "76561198141404871", "num_games_owned": 596}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "5", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484085", "timestamp_updated": 1473184314, "recommendationid": "22617007", "timestamp_created": 1461525858}, {"review": "Nice afternoon-sized puzzle point&click adventure.\n\nThis game takes you on a straight story, with tough lock puzzles to solve and items to find to make the locks work in the first place, and cutscenes and bonus art that explains some of the backstory, which is sometimes surprising and very nice.\n\nYou find the items in the actual scenes, point&click style, and there are no classic hidden object scenes where you have to find items from a list, so it isn't really a hidden object game.

If you've ever enjoyed a game by Big Fish games then you will love The Big Secret of a Small Town.\n\nStory: There isn't much story and what there is I had forgotten by the end. You are a detective trying to find the mayor (I think, I honestly forgot all the story by the end). \n\nLevel Design: It does a great job of keeping the area you can explore small in order to minimize confusion and backtracking. One thing that can get annoying with adventure games is getting 45 minutes into a game and realizing you forgot an object in the first screen. Big Secret is designed to keep your frustration to a minimum.\n\nPuzzles: The puzzles cover a wide variety of styles, from slide puzzles to Tetris block puzzles.  If I recall correctly, not a single style was repeated so it never got repetitive or boring. The only puzzle I disliked was the final puzzle, which was seemingly random. The flow of the game is: You're stuck in an area. Find hidden objects, use objects on devices which leads to a puzzle that rewards you with an object that you use on a central puzzle which in turn helps you exist the area. It's a nice formula that kept me hooked to the end.\n\nOverall: I recommend The Big Secret if you like casual puzzle games.

Not really. It's a point and click puzzle game. Does it have a great story? It's...different, sure, told through cutscenes narrated by the villain. But nothing fantastic. Is it entertaining? I thought so.\n\nA lot of reviewers compared this to a \"hidden object game\" but I don't really see it that way. Sure, there are hidden objects that you have to find, but that's where the similarity ends. You don't have a list of items in a scene straight out of that show Hoarders. You're a detective looking for clues, so you pick up objects that seem to be interesting to the case, or that are necessary to the challenge at hand. There is a BIT of randomness to the stuff you pick up at times, but everything fits with solving the obstacle, not \"Find 2 chickens, 1 red ball and a tire iron.\" Then, after you find things, you can combine the items you find with whatever they go with (e.g. put the brass key into the brass lock) and there's usually some sort of mind-teaser type puzzle. (e.g. Move these colored pieces onto their matching colored pegs, or connect all these railroad tracks from the start to the finish.) These mind-teasers range from the obvious, to the \"I know what to do but executing it is hard\" to the \"How in the world do you do this?\" Fortunately, there are hints available when you're stuck on the level itself, and the possibility to skip a mind-teaser after an obligatory waiting period.\n\nThere's also different difficulties, but all this seems to change is the timeout function of the hint system, so playing on easy is no different than on hard except in the time you have to wait when you've finally given up. Unfortunately, there's only one hint given when you're stuck in an area, and it doesn't always pertain to the thing you're working on at the moment. (e.g. You want to fix the elevator, but it gives you advice on the chemistry set, which you already knew about but hadn't gotten around to doing yet, so now you have to do the chemistry puzzle and wait for your hint clock to reset so you can get that hint about the elevator.) Usually, this helps, if you have to unlock one puzzle before unlocking another one, but it's not always linear, so it's a minor annoyance.\n\nIf you're into hardcore puzzles, this might not be for you. But if you like hidden object games (keeping in mind what I already said about the comparison being iffy) or point-and-click adventures, you might want to give this a try. But it's not worth it at full price. At the $2 I paid for it, certainly.\n\nOverall: 7/10.
