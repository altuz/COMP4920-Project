I\u2019m not used to play platform games so much, but I enjoyed this little game. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m not used with this style but the controls felt weird sometimes. Especially when you need to perform certain jumps. The story is simple, the art is cute and I enjoyed the BGM. The final song was very cute too!\n\n7/10. Get it on a sale (I think that the full price is a bit expensive for such a short game) and enjoy the kittens.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501624742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 263, "num_reviews": 385, "steamid": "76561198120348301", "num_games_owned": 791}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568918", "timestamp_updated": 1502374470, "recommendationid": "34147451", "timestamp_created": 1502374470}, {"review": "Man, I love cats, I love them more than anything, and this game gives me all the cat content I need. Once you get a hang of the sometimes awkward controls, and work out how to do certain things, it's really fun and delightful.\n\nI enjoy all the lovely cats, and the soundtrack is wonderful. The piano playing mini game is especially nice, probably my favourite end-level boss along with Level 3's climbing boss. \n\nI love meeting the cats and rescuing the cats from the cages, I want to cuddle them and protect them and be a friend to all the cats in the game. I'm glad they are based off real life furry friends. I also think it's cool that the start menu grows with you as you progress in the game.\n\nThe achievements are very do-able, and the game is challenging enough to keep you interested and busy. \n\nI really hope there are more cat games from this company in the future.\n\nTL;DR\n\n+Amazing Soundtrack\n+Cute cats\n+Good difficulty level\n+Fair learning curve\n+Fun to play\n+Comfy\n\n9/10 too many dogs", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1502762739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 154, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198299345884", "num_games_owned": 114}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501625", "timestamp_updated": 1502755356, "recommendationid": "34245948", "timestamp_created": 1502755356}, {"review": "Feeling really conflicted about this one - it's an adorable little platformer, it's enjoyable, not too long etc. Yet, the controls are just terrible to the point where the game is just too frustrating to continue.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1500980832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 696, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198067159326", "num_games_owned": 36}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505929", "timestamp_updated": 1500752802, "recommendationid": "33728380", "timestamp_created": 1500752802}, {"review": "1000/10 would reccomend this game.

I love cats, so obviously this clicked with me immediately. It's fun, atmospheric, the music is lovely and I quite like the art style. Once you get the hang of it, it's also quite easy to 100% it.\nUnfortunately, as most of the reviews state, the controls are awful. I somehow completed it with double jump (rather than long jump), but it kind of ruined the entire game for me.\nI wish I could give it a neutral rating, because there are good aspects, but unless you really like cats and/or don't mind the horrible controls, this game is not worth getting (well maybe on sale).", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1500913164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 251, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198063206429", "num_games_owned": 78}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502001", "timestamp_updated": 1502621897, "recommendationid": "34211323", "timestamp_created": 1502621897}, {"review": "Short version: Cute cats, but the controls aren't that good. Crow will eat you for breakfast.\n\nLong version: Purring Quest is a short little game wherein you're trying to return to your owner. That's the story, the main meat of the game is getting through the 5 levels, freeing cats and collecting fish bones along the way. The music is lovely and the art is pretty nice to look at.\n\nIt's a nice adventure/platforming game about kitties, and it's plenty merciful with unlimited continues. But there are some sore spots.\n\n-The piano mini game abruptly comes at you at the end of level 4 and you're likely to get 5 misses before you figure out what the controls are. A quick pause before the mini game, showing the controls before it starts, would have been nice.\n-The attack box is tiny and only usable on the ground. I got hit so often because I thought I was in range of an enemy. \n-The crow boss will murder you. This is a fact.\n-The storyline about random cats being abducted doesn't matter at all.\n-The controls, man. I used the arrows keys but it was still awkward as I needed Q, Z, and Tab for other actions. Died using long jump. Had better results with double jump.\n\nDespite these flaws though, I actually had a good time. In the last level. No more toads or rats or prickly plants, just platforming with only a couple gimmicks. \n\nI kind of want to recommend this game, but...I wouldn't play it again.
