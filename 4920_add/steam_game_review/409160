{"reviews": [{"review": "[b]\u201cI like work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.\u201d \u2015 Jerome K. Jerome[/b]\n\nComing from the designer behind [i]The Stanley Parable[/i] and a young developer team, this free little game with a needlessly long name carries a similar pattern of blatant absurdity. Due to the ridiculous amount of probable effort that I'd have to put while writing the whole completion of the title each time, I'll be referring to the game simply as [i]Dr.Langeskov[/i] for the remainder of this review. Now that is settled, let me try doing this properly.\n\nFollowing the example of [i]The Stanley Parable[/i], it is somewhat hard to write a review to a game that would be better played without knowing anything about it. So, if you'd like to enjoy the full experience, I'd highly recommend to stop reading and give it a try to see it for yourself. Since it already is a freeware, you won't have anything to lose rather than 15 minutes of your time.\n\nStill here? Well then. You've asked for it. Since we've already downloaded the game, we must have intended to actually play it, right? There is one little problem though. As the game starts, we are very apologetically informed that they are unable to let us play since it is a single player game and there is already one person playing it. Apparently we have to wait for the other player to finish the game before trying it ourselves. But since the studio conditions are a bit below excellent - nope, of course there are no safety hazards! What is it you are thinking? - There is a shortage of employees in the whole place due to a recent strike. We are informed that it would all go quite swiftly if we were to help them simulate the game for the player inside. Reluctantly agreeing, we start following - or try to follow, at least - directions of the young director with a mousy voice and a British accent, who dreads that our every single action might end in a catastrophy.\n\nAs you can see, this short, 15 minute adventure is a complete parody of a developmental concept. There is no actual game here. Like that the cake was a lie, the game itself is a lie. The whole thing is a smart and somewhat enjoyable conceptual experiment that could invoke some appreciation. Certainly not a masterpiece - and not in the claim of being so anyway - and the humor isn't exceptional, but [i]Dr. Lengeskov[/i] presents you a distraction and a smirk on your face for 15 minutes: a task well done. It might be noteworthy to mention that the expected gameplay is somewhat linear contrary to [i]The Stanley Parable[/i], carrying only one possible ending. The idea is to enjoy the environment, the concept and the reactions you are having around. Very much like any joke.\n\nThroughout your playthrough, you might want to investigate the environment, since there are items around to collect for achievements. Achievements themselves are a bit buggy though. I recommend not using the steam overlay or sending the game to tray since it may block achievements from unlocking. If all else fails, verify cache and they should trigger the next time you are meeting their conditions.\n\nGo ahead. I know that you are already curious. It is not the wittiest kid on the block, but it is here and it is free with certain creative value.
