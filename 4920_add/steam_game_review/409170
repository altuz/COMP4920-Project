{"reviews": [{"review": "This game is great! It's very fun!\n\nIt's a pixel art, side-scrolling shooter in which you play an assassin.\n\nI love the artwork in this game. I like how everything is black and white except for the blood.\n\nIt really reminds me of Hotline Miami.\nBetween missions you have a chance to buy weapons and clothes/armor.\n\nAt release I noticed a couple minor bugs but the developer has already acknowledged them and says they will be fixed soon.\n\nThe price seems a tiny bit high at 5 euros, but not by much. The game feels polished.\n\nIt comes with 15 levels. I hope that more will be added later because the gameplay is quite fun.

Same with blood, there's a nice contrast a bit like Sin City but sprays are too similar. \n    [*]Gameplay is fun, you have limited ammo so need to stab people when possible. But that's it, it's fun but nothing special, people have compared it to hotline miami but I don't really see the correlation apart from the phone calls. Gameplay isn't similar apart from one hit kill on some enemies. \n[/list]\n\nI'll add more when future updates come, now for cons, and why you should wait a bit........\n\n[list]\n    [*]Bugs, I know I said at ran well but there's a few glitches, I've seen a few enemies carry on with their movement patterns despite having two bullets in their posterior lobe. That and the upgrade system is just straight up f*cked, you buy stuff and maybe it'll get added or maybe it'll just eat your hard earned cash. I've also found one where dogs don't die or slide away after killing you but for some reason you stay alive for a few seconds.\n    [*]It's pretty short so far, I've only played a bit and I'm half way through the 16 contracts, I don't know if there's more to come but I hope so, I know it was only made by three people but if workshop was integrated and levels could be created it'd be a lot more fun. \nThis also makes me think about whether this game is relevant or not when you compare it to Gunpoint, that game's got a tonne of content now and more mechanics than this. I generally had a better time with gunpoint in terms of, well everything; gameplay, graphics, story. \n    [*]It gets a bit repetitive, it's quite easy if you take the reckless approach (I guess this is how people are comparing to Hotline), and just run in, duck a couple times then stab the guy. Also levels don't really increase in difficulty consistently, I guess it makes a change but some of the earlier ones I player were harder than the later ones (not because of upgrades)\n[/list]\n\nI'd hold off a bit until devs add more stuff/fix sh*t, but give it a chance it did only come out today.\n\ntl;dr: wait", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1455228809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 49, "num_reviews": 58, "steamid": "76561198011914050", "num_games_owned": 534}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503645", "timestamp_updated": 1452017894, "recommendationid": "20325111", "timestamp_created": 1452007062}, {"review": "Pros:\n-Art is decent, yet often somewhat bland and lacking.\n-Plot is alright.\n-Simplistic design.\n\nCons:\n-Most of the music is terrible.\n-No options/settings menu.\n-Levels are laid out terribly, most look very bland and are confusing, if not frustrating to manuveur through.\n-Animations are horrible, and look very poorly done.\n-Poor transition through levels, very similar to Gunpoint, with a grading screen at the end of the levels.\n-Combat is poor, you can either stand still or squat down and shoot.
