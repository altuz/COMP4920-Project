That's all.\nMr. Fox: I understand what you're saying, and your comments are valuable, but I'm gonna ignore your advice.\n\nDon't ignore Badger's advice, Foxy.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nUHG! I don't know why I couldn't post my full review. It seems like \"fart\" is an okay word, but who knows. Here are my full thoughts, as I wish to share them with the dev and with other gamers.\n\nThe UI is not pretty, but much worse of a flaw, it is not informative. We need a *working* HUD with objectives on the screen - ALWAYS - with real time updates as we progress through them. Sometimes I had 0%, or 0/0 HUDs. Sometimes I had nothing on my screen. Sometimes I would pen the sheep and the game wouldn't end. I needed to get a bucket of \"Item +1\" that was off on the far corner of the map. How did I know this? Only because the game didn't end when I penned the sheep and I started running around. This is not good. I shouldn't have to guess what I need to do. Add a minimap or directional markers to let me know where my sheep are, my home is and maybe - or maybe not - where the predators are. Make your buttons say Play! not \"paw shape\". Buttons, HUDs, minimaps-- every UI element should be clear as to what it is telling the player. The world map - it looked okayish in the screenshots, but my map was of a view where all I could see was the dog and the \"level\" he was at. I couldn't see the next levels. I had no idea what I was doing - or should do - and then I pressed in a few places. One worked and he ran a long way off to level two. It's not a world map if I don't see the world. And all I saw was one level at a time with no context. Again. Make things clear to the player, every level, every objective, every update to the objectives and the rating they might be getting. I mean, aliens - I think - abducted one of my pigs, but I have no idea, honestly. There were coyotes there, too. I didn't see it happen. I was not told ALIENS ABDSUCTED YOUR PIGLET OH NO! Which could be something funny, as well as informative. Because of the bad UI I have no idea why I would get a \"D\" score when I got 3/5 pigs but a \"C\" score when I rescued only 1 sheep. Makes no sense and I have no visual feedback as to WHY that is the case. The in-game HUD should tell me what is going on and the scoreboard should be a recap.\n\nThere is very little AI. I mostly found myself trying to be between the sheep and the wolf. The wolves never stopped or ran away when I barked. The sheep never stopped, or ran, when I barked. But they did fart blood! Which makes no sense. I wasn't near them. Or biting them. I certainly couldn't bite wolves or make them fart blood. But sheeps fart blood when I bark and it doesn't kill them or do anything but make em fart blood. TOOT TOOT TOOT! I mean, I guess it's funny, but uh... yea. I run around between the wolves and sheep. The wolves never stop trying to get the sheep, running directly at them in a constant b-line, and only turn away when I turn towards them. But they instantly turn back to run at the sheep the moment I turn away. Barking doesn't scare them. It doesn't call the farmer. It seems pointless except for the farting sheep joke aspect. The stock could be dopey but the predators shouldn't be. And even though sheep are a little fluffy-brained, they don't stand there to get mauled by a wolf. I mean, if they run away from me - farting blood at my barks - then they should run from the wolves, too. It's just common sense. I don't know where you wanna go with this but it seems like something needs to be done to make it more realistic or more interesting, with more depth. Right now I am just mousing between A and B. An A that wants to eat B, and a B that is afraid of me, but not of A, who wants to eat him. \n\nMr. Dev: You are asking people to buy this game and it's not finished, and you don't say that. It sounds like your friend wrote a long review for you, calling you by name and adding a lot of imagined depth to the game that I am just not seeing. It sounds like he knows exactly what you want this game to be, but that seems to actually further highlight what the game isn't yet. \n\nYou need to let people who are paying money for this game know it's not finished, or they are just going to be annoyed with you, downvote your game and/or ask for a refund. You may say \"Well this game is for kids!\" but like the unfinished alpha game info-- you don't say that anywhere on your store page! And I like kid's things. I love cartoons, kid's books and kid's games. Just because a game is for children does not excuse poor UI design, poor gameplay direction, etc.\n\nI hope you make this game what you invision, because I love dogs, especially Border Collies (hint hint) and Babe. See? I love childish things, and this game has potential, but right now it's not worth as much time as I've spent playing and reviewing it.
