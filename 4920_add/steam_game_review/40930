Good atmosphere, simple puzzles to think and figure out so they aren't overwelcome, and solid soundtrack. But many of the solutions requires solid timing or else you have to setup all the pieces back from square one, becoming quite frustating for the most complex challenges. Combined with kinda unresponsive controls, you'll be wasting more time reassembling the solution rather thinking which it is.\n\nFor its solid mechanics and casual-friendly puzzles gets the thumbs up. But it urgently needs some tweaking in playability as soon enough its flaws start to show up."}]}
