{"reviews": [{"review": "Syndrome has the setting to be a good horror game. The environment is suitably creepy, although a little darker than is good for creepiness in some place. The storyline is ok for a horror game. The enemy designs all work well except for one that looks like it's in a red latex bodysuit in direct light. \n\nWhat kills the game is all the constant backtracking. You'll run into an obstacle on one level, and have to go to another level, and possibly even a second level, before returning to the original level. In conjunction with long load times - I'm on an SSD and I'm playing on my phone during these load times - it stretches out the game much, much more than it should be. The save system, familiar if one has ever played Resident Evil games, compounds the issue - if you die on the way to a save point on a new level, you get double whammy'd by first reloading your previous save, then changing levels again - which with the long load times makes it a pita. \n\nThe padding of objectives sometimes even extends to within-one-level. During the home stretch of the game, I had to insert a data core somewhere to unlock it. Get to the room, it's locked, I have to go to the tech chief's office on the opposite corner of the level to unlock it. I go there, unlock, return, slot in the data core. Now it apparently needs an additional decrypting or something at another station? Go to that station on the same level, find out the computer is locked up and I need to go BACK to the tech chief's office to do a hard reset. I do that, go back to the second decryption station, and finally get to exit the level while dodging monsters. In any other game, I would have done the first unlock step for the data core and carried on my way.\n\nThe monster designs, as I said, were good. How they were used was poorly executed. It felt like almost all the monsters were script-dependent, so you had a monster closet effect going on throughout the game, which means sometimes you stumble over the tripwire, get killed, then go through the reloading process and approach it again more gingerly. \n\nOverall, the game would have benefited vastly from consolidation. If it's not going to follow a Dead Space-esque progression where you're going through the ship but a deck at a time, remove all the busywork objectives. Between all the load times and running around, my gametime was vastly inflated, at some point I decided to just plug through just to see what the hell else design decisions they made. Also, reducing the number of monster tripwires in favor of static spawns/patrols would have made it more interesting in approaching monsters, strategic eliminations or dodges. \n\nThe enviroment, atmosphere, and storyline lay the foundations for a good budget horror title. The onerous pace of going through the game make it not worth it.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1499487336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 557, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197966815099", "num_games_owned": 229}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517499", "timestamp_updated": 1499490808, "recommendationid": "33363736", "timestamp_created": 1499490808}, {"review": "i played this game over deadspace.  the first real horror game ive played since F.E.A.R. and by far better, Fear gives you plenty to defend yourself with, this game makes you think weather or not to fight or sneak by them, there are also times ive couldent gone to sleep that night afraid id get nightmares LOL\n\nhavent even finished the game and even stuck on it atm, but im still 100% into it, i soooo recommend this game over deadspace!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1500171869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 171, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198064188232", "num_games_owned": 52}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499753", "timestamp_updated": 1500270195, "recommendationid": "33601250", "timestamp_created": 1500270195}, {"review": "\"You wake up in a desolate ship with everyone around dead or dying\"\nThe scenario is not entirely original, but the story will probably surprise you.\nThere's a really dark setting and environment that works really well.\nThe ship is the stage for the adventure, with the main character running around through all the floors unlocking new areas and finding clues about what happened.\nSearching every corner for boxes and lockers is good, there's usually ammo or batteries around.\nThe monster designs are really nice too.
