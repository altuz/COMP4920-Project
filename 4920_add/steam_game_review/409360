{"reviews": [{"review": "Decent enough action rogue-like, but not terribly difficult, and unless I'm missing something, extremely easy to beat.  I could be mistaken, as I wasn't paying much attention to the stage progression really, but there's really only 8 levels to the game, and the last level is just a final boss fight.  There are also a couple of very annoying problems with the verticle hit box for the player character, and it is possible to get stuck by one pixel on a corner of a block while you're trying to manuever away from a monster or shot, which is really annoying.  Not permenantly stuck mind you.  It really isn't fair to compare this to Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, but they are essentially the same game.  If you come into this expecting BoI:R level production values and cotent then you're going to leave disappointed, but if you want a simple game that's basically the same experience, gameplay wise as BoI:R, then it's worth the price of admission.\n\nI would honestly use this game as a cheap example of the kind of gameplay you can expect from games like Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.  As in, if you liked this game, you'll LOVE BoI:R, and so on.\n\nAll in all, not a bad game.  Decent enough.  No game breaking bugs, but without the wit or absolutely insane depth of BoI:R.

Think The Binding of Isaac with pixels and a fantasy theme. AFAIK, there's no story beyond \"KILL THE MONSTERS, LOOT THE DUNGEON\".  Start a game, youre in a random dungeon, with a random layout and random mobs and loot. Theres a seed number in the corner of the pause menu and a start option to enter a seed number, so if you find a layout you like, you can replay it.\n\nThe game itself is fast paced, lots of enemies and projectiles zipping around. Enemy types vary, and they change between level types (as you go deeper the levels change look and mobs). Art is pixel style. Nothing too spectacular. You can tell what everything is you see though, although for some reason your weapon isnt actually held by your char but arcs out in a half circle around him. Musics pretty good, and the sound effects are what you'd expect from a game like this.\n\nThe map is set up like the dungeon levels of the Legend of Zelda, each screen is a room with doors leading out. Some rooms require you to kill the mobs to proceed, some are dead ends. Some are stores where you can buy a random selection of items for gold or rarely permanent health loss.  Eventually you will find a boss room, with a giant monster that you hae to kill. It usually drops a permanent health power up. In the room with the boss is a trapdoor. Go down that and youre in the next level. Rinse, repeat. There are *plenty* of cool random items and weapons. You have a weapon slot, and an item/magic slot. You can carry only one of each, and picking up an item or weapon drops the most recently carried one. There are also bombs and keys in their own slots. Items take mana to use, the amount of which is shown by a number in the corner of the item box.\n\nControls are OK, but not great. Its easy to get hung up on dngeon objects and you get damaged on enemy collision, so its easy to accidentally bump into something since some enemies seem to have large collision boxes. Its not a game breaking issue, but I wish the controls were smoother. Controller support is fully implemented and decent, but only the keyboard is remappable (a big pet peeve of mine due to my disabled hand- I really appreciate the controller, but please make it mappable). \n\nIts simple, its fun for a run or two, runs can last anywhere from 26 seconds to hours depending on your reflexes and desire to clear every screen, and also the RNG not dumping a ton of tough mobs on the first screen you enter (why I had a 26 second run).\n\nMy one big complaint is there is no save. In an arcade/permadeath-style game like this, I dont expect to be able to save to avoid dying but a \"one-time emergency drop-out and pick it back up where you left off\" save should be implemented. Most other games have one time saves, even arcades or Roguelikes. Thats a major issue, and should really be added.\n\nThe game also seems to be lacking in permanent unlockables, so each run doesn't add to an overall sense of accomplishment. Unlockables such as new classes, better starting gear, more health on start and so forth add a lot to a permadeath game, and the fact that Faron's Fate doesn't have them kind of lowers it in my eyes.\n\nOverall, its a decent little game, but not great. $7 is an OK price, but I think $5 would be a bit more fair considering how simple the game is and the lack of emergency saves and unlockables. Its pretty fun though, one of those \"kick back, and run frantically around a dungeon slaying monsters and looting\" games.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1445206320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 71, "num_reviews": 89, "steamid": "76561198026782701", "num_games_owned": 525}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507832", "timestamp_updated": 1445153500, "recommendationid": "18542951", "timestamp_created": 1445151424}, {"review": "Needs a LOT more refinement.
