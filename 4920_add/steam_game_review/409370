{"reviews": [{"review": "I just cannot recommend this game and here's why:\n\n- Controller controls were done sloppily, meaning that the controller's deadzone is not configured properly.\n- The menu system is horrifying. If you choose to heal a party member, you can use the spell only once before being required again to rechoose it. This is just annoying. Also, there is no equipment menu screen - everything's done via the item menu, which is confusing. \n- Also, the item system. There is no way to show item info. I have yet to find out what the juice does.\n- The resolution. You CAN manually change it to whatever you like via the config in %AppData%, but why is there no option?\n- The graphics are very pixelated and poor. Maybe because it's a cheap mobile port?\n- There is no walkthrough available anywhere and the dev deleted the formerly available wiki on their website for no apparent reason. So if you're stuck, it's bad luck.\n- The world feels extremely empty. There are just a few cities with not much to do in them.\n- The story of the game is uninteresting and generic, just like the characters. Some even decide to follow you with no real motivation whatsoever.\n- The achievements are rather uninteresting.\n- There are way, WAY too many random encounters. It quickly gets to the point where you'll put the controller down because it's simply too much of a bother to keep playing.\n- There are no spells to buy (You will acquire those automatically), only weaponry and gear. Both of which you can always change but just like the items, there is no stat info available.\n- The level system is dull. You get 10 points each level-up  but one level up-point is also 1 HP, for example.\n- The overworld map is none like in Final Fantasy, but more like a level selection screen.\n- There are virtually no side quests. The only thing you can do for an achievement is to collect 1000 gold. Yay.\n\nSo there you go. Not much of an interesting game. On the bright side, this game's only 2 bucks but I still cannot recommend it.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1445693094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 313, "num_reviews": 343, "steamid": "76561197990947284", "num_games_owned": 3611}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 53, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566205", "timestamp_updated": 1444988769, "recommendationid": "18499770", "timestamp_created": 1444988769}, {"review": "I do very much love this game.  The story is good, the battle system is awesome, the music is beautiful.  I've been playing this game since 2011 and i still love playing it.  I have found two bugs in game that cause issue.\n\n1.  The Milipede in the Jungle.  WThe Final Boss.hen it attacks, it gets stuck in the flashing animation and you can't do anything until the game crashes.  This can be avoided by having a higher speed stat than the Milipede.\n\n\n2.  The Final Boss.  When you first exit a battle with a poisoned party member, you get a text box informing you of it, which is handy.  However, should that first time happen to be after you beat the final boss, in which another text box is supposed to appear, the game will freeze and you have to return to your last save.\n\n\nI VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1460544651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 15714, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198045986374", "num_games_owned": 6}, "language": "english", "developer_response": "Thanks for the bug reports.

My only issues, 1) when i try to heal from the menu screen (as opposed to in battle) I have to click Rios then go to heal then click the person I want to heal, but if I need to heal them a second consecutive time then i need to repeat the process. It should be set up so once I click Cure I can use it repeatedly as needed without having to go back to cure and use it again. 2) I don't fully understand the fairy that occasionally shows up in the menu and why does she offer to help me out a bit when my funds are low? It seems like a freebie item. That being said this game is really fun so far and I will purchase Monster RPG 3. Also, this didn't affect my decision, but it made me feel better about doing so... please read the disclaimer on Monster RPG 3 and support the creator.
