Do not expect an ultra hard precision marble platformer like in Marble Blast Ultra or similar games. The gameplay is almost relaxing and without the typical marble game frustration, though there are a few tricky parts.\n\nThere are also some differences from other marble games:\n\n- Camera movement is scripted. This generally works well since you can almost always see where you're going without having to manuever it yourself.\n- Marble moves slower and with better control than some other games (much slower than Marble Blast, better control than Marble Madness). Even going downhill the ball can slow if you stop pushing it.\n- No jumping.\n- Marble breaks if you fall from too high, and sometimes when hitting a wall too fast.\n\nBasically, if you like roll-a-ball games or Marble Madness/Super Monkey Ball clones, but wish they were less frustrating, this game is for you.\n\nHaven't tried it with VR support yet so I can't comment on that, but may update this when my Rift arrives in a month or two.\n\nFinally, was initially unable to play the game due to it crashing Steam on startup, but developers were responsive in getting it fixed. Solution was to hold left alt on launch to bring up the configuration menu, after which I've been able to start it fine.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1498007707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 442, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198027805390", "num_games_owned": 634}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "3", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517783", "timestamp_updated": 1459954107, "recommendationid": "22269882", "timestamp_created": 1459954107}, {"review": "I just can't play this game in VR.
