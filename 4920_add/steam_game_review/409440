It does not respect the resolution from the options screen. In the end, I gave up and left it as fullscreen.\n- The graphics are okay. However, what is not okay is decorative elements (such as trees) obstructing the view.\n- The game is slow-paced, because you have to wait until the apple moves in order to move again. \"Lara Croft GO\" is much better.\n- Some snakes randomly stop moving for a few turns.\n- The \"snake\" game was odd, the controls felt unresponsive.\n\nOverall, a nice idea, but an implementation that annoyed me too much.
