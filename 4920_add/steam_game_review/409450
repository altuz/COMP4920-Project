I didn't play much because the maps were confusing and I'm more into straight forward action games, I kept getting lost here and had to look around too much to find the next level so it wasn't exactly my cup of tea.\n\nIf you're remotely interested in this type of game, you should try it.

I grew up on maps like this for red and blue box D&D in the 1980's, then on games like Dungeon Master and Black Crypt, so i know i thing or two about this style of game. \n\nFoDG has the right mix going for it. I can tile dodge effectively, the monsters are levelled nicely and also are placed/grouped in the right areas for fighting or running.  As should be the case with this style you gain just enough to get you through, dumping obsolete gear as you upgrade (i'm not sure if each level has a special item, if not it should). \n\nI haven't used any bows or throwing weapons ingame yet, so not sure if they are present and the monster spells  clip the walls and score against me, maybe thats just my copy ?? not sure.  Nothing major. \n\nAll in all a solid game, i like it alot and i would buy a FoDG 2.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1507083900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 979, "playtime_forever": 1411, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197995630875", "num_games_owned": 228}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499765", "timestamp_updated": 1505878085, "recommendationid": "35076822", "timestamp_created": 1505878085}, {"review": "First of all. It's a good game. Really. \n\nI find it perfect for the ones, starting their journey with dungeon crawler genre. It offers everything that this genre consists of and adds few twists. You can customise basically everything, from difficulty level to the amount of monsters, their hp, and behavior. You can play paperlike mode or use all newschool features like minimap. And the thing that is unique in crawlers - holy trinity class system with fight style inspired from MMORPGs. Character development offers plenty of options.    \nCombat system makes this game truly unique but at the same time a little bit boring and repetive. You can treat fights like WOW raids sometimes but basically you will have to repeat the same things over and over. While it works well in MMORPGS coz you control just 1 character and all you have to do is to play your role, here you will have to play 4 at the same time. For sure its challenging (oh yes, it is) but like I said - sometimes it might be too much. Thankfully like I said, you can customize basically everything so you can have challenging fights but the enemies will appear more or less often. Its up to you to decide. And whatever you will do, EXP will remain the same (splitting). \n\nNow the part for Dungeon Crawler fans. FIrst of all Grimrock. I would put this title on the same level as 1st Legends. The amosphere is less claustrophobic and at least for me, least immersive but still its on good level. The game uses similar schemes and mechanics. While 1st Grimrock was bad coz you could abuse moving during the combat, this game wont let you do anything like it. That's a plus. You will find secrets, riddles, bosses and resource distribution. \n\nThe game is not as good as 2nd Grimrock or the best dungeon crawler ever created which is Wizardry 8 but for god sake, this genre needs more good games and this is for sure one of them. \n\nYOU HAVE TO PLAY IT if you are crawler fan.\nYOU STRONGLY SHOULD PLAY IT if you are RPG fan. \nYOU WON'T REGRET If you are looking for single player game with MMORPG flavor.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1504994400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2379, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198055091188", "num_games_owned": 92}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499765", "timestamp_updated": 1504987880, "recommendationid": "34845750", "timestamp_created": 1504987821}, {"review": "Clearly a lot of effort has gone into making this game. Lovely graphics but repetitive, boring combat.
