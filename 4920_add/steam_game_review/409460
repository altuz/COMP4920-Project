When you level up, you can spend attribute points for damage, life or magic find. \n\nEvery stage has a boss you must fight. When you finish the last boss or die during the dungeon, you can start over with better passive skills to begin with. These passive skills are unlocked when you find them as itemdrops or as achievement rewards. They can alter your gameplay a little bit every time you play.\n\nThere are no bugs from what i experienced, and i finished the game a few times already. The music and sounds are well crafted and fit to the gameplay.\n\nGraphics are nothing you buy this game for but they aren't too shabby. Unlike the performance, fps go below 60fps on my Nvidia Titan X, which is irritating.\n\nOn normal difficulty, the game is a bit easy, but it's a good difficulty to learn the mechanics. Then you can start with \"blackfaun\"-difficulty, which increases every time you finish the game.\n\nThis game by now is a great roguelike, if they add more content (like stages, loot, skills etc.), this will be a steal for the price they ask.

A limited sprint is available.  Attacks are modified by the equipment you wear.\n\nConsumables include keys, gold (to buy from shops) and candles (reveal secrets + invincibility).  \n\nAs you fight, you earn XP which you can use to increase one of three stats (roughly, health, damage and loot drop rate).\n\nPickups include temporary health in addition to the standard health and mana.  They're used instantly on contact.  Health drops have been rare enough so far for me that deciding whether to pick them up or leave them for later is a mild strategic consideration.\n\nThe only save is a save-on-exit.
