{"reviews": [{"review": "I was really enjoying this game.\n\nThen I came across a section which meant you had to move the mouse or controller up and down to get the mine cart to move.\n\nWell I perservered through the horrible mines with the moving the mouse up and down to get the carts to move, even though it didn't work 95% of the time and took forever. \n\nThen I found myself in a level which required the same mechanic but timed in order to pass the level. And yep, it didn't work 95% of the time, meaning I just sat there while my time counted down and the level reset itself.\n\nThis is now a game breaking bug for me.\n\nI know I'm not the first person to encounter this bug, but it seems the developer may not care.\n\nThere has been no response from the developer about this and no update in 6 months.\n\nShould I guess this has now been abandoned and I've just completely wasted my money?\n\nI'll be honest, I'm angry and disappointed. It's a shame, up to this point, I actually really enjoyed the game and would have given it a positive rating.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1500215053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 501, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198046349916", "num_games_owned": 283}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498574", "timestamp_updated": 1500216161, "recommendationid": "33586438", "timestamp_created": 1500216001}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 16, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
