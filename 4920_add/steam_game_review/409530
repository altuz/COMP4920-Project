{"reviews": [{"review": "So, the game itself seemed interesting, but it's broken by the fact that there is not any possibility to customize your input. Not only is there no possibility to rebind your keys, the game assumes by default that you want to use a controller if such is attached. I personally found using the controller awkward to use, and would've liked to use the keyboard and mouse instead, but alas, if you have ANY controller attached, you MUST use controller, even if the game apparently would support two payers ONLY IF you have two controllers, the keyboard+mouse is not an option.\n\nI asked if this feature would've been in progress of being fixed, but apparently the developer cares not of the forums of this game to even give a hint of a comment, thus, giving it a proper wait, I've come to the conclusion to refund this game before the refund window closes, as the controls makes the game unplayable for me.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1502605326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198012078402", "num_games_owned": 952}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503639", "timestamp_updated": 1502945263, "recommendationid": "34300019", "timestamp_created": 1502945263}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
