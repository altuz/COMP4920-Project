That is until you find yourself met by the game's sense of inertia, with the rabbit under your control being constantly turned to mince meat.\n\nThere is also a great sense of accomplishment once you beat a level, after nearly 100 deaths!

It\u2019s a relatively short game around forty levels plus the ten bonus levels. So you should be able to complete the game in a short amount of time. It has potential to be added to if the developer decides to do that. There is only one power up in this game, it\u2019s a half of an apple that you can slows down time with for a short span of time. I find this somewhat weird, since I have never associated apples with time manipulation. There is only one big very noticeable bug in this game, there\u2019s a delay between pressing the button and jumping.
