{"reviews": [{"review": "[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5axmA3qPIc] Even for alpha, this is pretty omega... [/url] \n\nShort version: DON'T buy this right now. It's got a lot of work that needs done on it before it's playable.\n\nLong version: As a concept, a top-down voxel zombie survival game with RPG elements sounds pretty cool. This game is far from being anywhere NEAR a game.\n\nGraphically, it's a decent looking game for being in alpha. That's about the only thing going for it, though.\n\nSound-wise, it's completely lackluster. The zombies are acceptably voiced, but the lack of any background music makes it a dull experience. The controls are a bit iffy, having to aim your mouse in the direction you want to go WHILE moving WASD in the same direction. It would be a hell of a lot better if W was forward, S was down, etc.\n\nGameplay is incessantly difficult. To pick up anything, you have to go to no less than two menus. This makes it extremely difficult to pick anything up if there's even one zombie on the screen. At that, you can't even use weapons at this point in development. So, unless there's some engineering things to do, you're pretty much screwed.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't buy this game. It's too early to have been released for anything but a free alpha demo. Don't be like me and blow nine-and-change on a barely functioning game. Give it a few months and revisit.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1456003277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 18, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198118850003", "num_games_owned": 82}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524196", "timestamp_updated": 1456151250, "recommendationid": "21386598", "timestamp_created": 1456151250}, {"review": "1.
