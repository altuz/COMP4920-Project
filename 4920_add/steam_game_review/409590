Right now the game's playeable but it's clear it's still in development and I'm not holding this against Oreol as I willingly bought the game in Early Access. Simply because I believe in the potential this game has.\n\nWhen starting the game you get to name yourself and the island, choose the maximum population (2.000 people!!!), how fast new people arrive, the length of the day/night cycle and how many animals per squar kilometre there are. After that you can customize your character's face, race and gender as well as pick your starting skills that will decide your future professions on the island.\n\nAfter a short time loading you awake on board a ship heading for the coastline of the gigantic island in front of you. You and about 20 other people get off and go their own way. Some set up a settlement, some become bandits, some get mauled by a bear or wolf. Such is life in The Zone.\n\nDepending on your starting skills you can be a productive part of society by providing lumber for people's houses, building structures, opening a tavern, keeping a farm, crafting items as a blacksmith or opening a shop. Or by protecting the town with your trusty sword or bow from animals or bandits. Maybe even attack other towns with people you recruit? Or start your own settlement?\n\nCurrently the game has all this to give you plenty of hours of entertainment. However... it needs work but that's to be expected as this is a tremendous undertaking for a (I think) three man team.\n\nSome of my personal observations:\n- occasional lag, could be due to the amount of activity happening. Developers, did you code in for the game to only load and render the immediate NPC's? This way you reduce a HUGE amount of lag and keep the game performing like a clock. The \"off-screen\" NPC's could be set in Unity to just not render until within 250m of the player?\n- The User Interface (UI) could use a loving hand, it's clear and structured but it looks dated and is sometimes not nice to look at. Ditch the parchment and make everything a bit smaller. The \"book\" needs to be less yellow and the text should lose the drop shadows and use a rectangle background.\n- Combat needs reworking, right now it feels like a placeholder and has no excitement.\n\nThis is not meant as something bad, but to help Kingdoms grow into a beautiful game!\n\nI wish you all good luck at Oreol! :)", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505856787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 83, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198014746407", "num_games_owned": 280}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509270", "timestamp_updated": 1505856529, "recommendationid": "35072636", "timestamp_created": 1505856529}, {"review": "Great game!

Survive by gathering berries, farming crops, and hunting animals. Watch out for wolves, bears and bandits! Chop, mine, cook, craft, tame and more!
