{"reviews": [{"review": "Nice HOS game. I don't understand why so many bad reviews. \nI found HO scenes well done, objects are wisely implemented in the scenes. In addition there are \"Pairs HOS\", where you're supposed to match items. Sometimes it's a bit twisted but it's more dynamic than classic HOS. \nPuzzles are OK, ranging from easy to medium. I found one of them to be hard. I had to use a walkthrough and I still don't get it but otherwise the rest was fun. \nThe whole game might look like a sort of cheap version of an Artifex game, but most of the ingredients are here. Maybe not as fairy and graphics might be a bit less beautiful than Artifex's but for the price it's understandable and the final render is quite good. \nThe story is more or less what's most common is this kind of game: you have to save one of your relatives and there's magic involved + strange critters, devil, and so on, all around you. \nAchievements are easy to get.\nAll in all I found this game more than acceptable with regard to the price, especially on sale.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506704081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 882, "playtime_forever": 882, "num_reviews": 23, "steamid": "76561198015324296", "num_games_owned": 465}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1506947318, "recommendationid": "35293908", "timestamp_created": 1506691256}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
