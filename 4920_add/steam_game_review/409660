{"reviews": [{"review": "AVGN Adventures 2 is AWFUL! If you praise this game you forfeit any right to criticize games ever again. As if the 1st game wasn't bad enough this sequel if worse. Keep in mind I play these games on easy and even then they're are so fucking cheap because of bad game design. You wanna know how much I hate this game? If you forced me to play Ride to Hell or this I'd choose Ride to Hell. Why is this game so bad? It suffers from everything that made the 1st AVGN Adventures bad and just decide to go even more balls to the wall with it.\n\n1. So many enemies on the screen it slows the game down.\n2. Even more death blocks that are just there to piss you off.\n3. Humor that isn't funny due to the frustration of the game.\n4. The enemy placements. In the Board James levels they're slightly easier but they're still placed about at random to be unfair and if you're on the walls and you get hit. BAM! You're dead.\n5. Nerd letters being put in places you can't get them without luck or are so hidden you question how you were supposed to know that without looking it up of just getting lucky.\n6. Virtual Insanity. I don't need to explain with this but I will. It slows down the framerate, you get headaches because of it referencing the Virtual Boy, fireballs that are impossible to avoid without jumping into instant death lasers, retractable spike walls that you have to get lucky to make it. And I can't say anything else because that's where I gave up. This is one of the worst games I've ever played. Not because of buggy or broken gameplay but because of how anger inducing it is. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\n\nEdit: The reason why I have only 8 minutes of playtime on it i because I play it in offline mode so I don't use up my internet data.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1507171583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 142, "playtime_forever": 143, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198176574819", "num_games_owned": 16}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "13", "votes_down": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477934", "timestamp_updated": 1506414531, "recommendationid": "35198443", "timestamp_created": 1506326652}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 288, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 310, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
