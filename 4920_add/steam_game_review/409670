It only provides a single stage (plus a modified version for Hard Mode, which is unlocked after completing the normal mode), but it's worth checking out nevertheless. \n\nThe platforming is nice and tight, and the movement/firing mechanics are very cool. If you're on the fence about Kero Blaster, this should give you a good idea of if you'll like it.\n\nWhat I found cool about Pink Hour is that you can complete the game, both in Normal and Hard Mode, without firing your projectile at enemies. You can actually complete it without damaging any enemies at all, including the boss. I think that shows a certain level of care and detail that was considered when making what comes down to what is essentially a demo. \n\nHighly recommend this, for people who haven't played Kero Blaster, have played Kero Blaster, or anyone ever, basically. Very cute, very fun.
