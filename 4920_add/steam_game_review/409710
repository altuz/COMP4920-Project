There is also a crash that occurs randomly again when you try to loot the teddy bear (little sister's gift) but it doesnt delete your save.. so there is that.

I will update if I encounter any game breaking glitches with the HD version. \n\nBefore starting, I will say, if you dislike scary games, me too! This game is a bit spoopy at times, but the jumpscares are minimal. Its really the dimented nature of the setting that leads to a feeling of creepiness and uneasiness. I'd say on a scary level of Finding Nemo to Saw, this game gets a round an Aliens, so lets begin. \n\nI played this game a lot in my teens when it first came out and I'm excited to play it again in HD. Playing with vita chambers turned off is almost a must, because the vita chambers make the game laughable. However, having them turned off, and the difficulty set to max, was one of my absolute favorite game play experiences as a kid, because you had to prepare for each encounter in a way you were going to survive. As such, it forces you to utilize all the tools at your disposal in creative ways to succeed, something few games ever actually accomplish. Usually in a game, you find the gun or the weapon you like best and you just go do your thing. If you do that on hard with vita chambers turned off, you're favorite weapon will be out of ammo, and you are going to die. \n\nIf you don't know anything at all about this game, the game play involves ultilizing guns that you upgrade by exploring, and a mechanic called plasmids, which is basically magic fueled by stem cells (Adam) harvest orginally from deep sea slugs! Now, though, its not found in deep sea slugs... and how you wan't to go about getting your Adam is a major part of the story telling. \n\nThere's also a hacking mechanic, that lamentably, is the weakest part of the game, as the whole get the juice to the right place with the tubes gets old after a while, but darned it if it isn't really satisfying watching an enemy retreat to a healing station only to die because you hacked it to spew poison in their face. \n\nWithout spoiling anything, this is one of the few games I've played that to me, is art. The world is thematic and well crafted, and the story Bioshock 1 has to tell not only makes a statement about gaming, but the nature of choice and morality as a conscious being. This game succeeded years ago in melding visual story telling with propoganda, ads, audio books, people talking to you via walky talkie,and cut scenes to deliver of a theme that many games fail to even come close to delivering in terms of quality today. \n\n I would say a similar game that came out recently in terms of a story worth thinking about was SOMA, humorously also set under water, however that game suffered from rather limited gameplay that this game does not. So assuming this game runes smoothy, and you haven't had it spoiled for you, holy balls is it one of the more meaningful storys you can engage in for a $20 price tag.\n\n\nEdits from the future!: AIght so I've had it crash once, but that was because I was trying to do too much at once with other applications, and I think it caused it to crash again later, but my biggest issue is I couldn't get it to stream in a way were the game is audible. I was either talking while a played the game in silence, or going deaf for my viewers. I messed with all the audio sliders and ultimately the solution was a combination of turning up my mic volume in Razer Synaps, while turning down the volume my mic was recording at with GeForce. I also changed the game itself from stereo to surround and turned it all the way to 10, which seemed to help too.\n\nNot the best as I will have to change it later for other games... but also not even a problem you don't plan to stream.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506489494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2367, "playtime_forever": 2367, "num_reviews": 23, "steamid": "76561198140394739", "num_games_owned": 30}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1506383876, "recommendationid": "35172166", "timestamp_created": 1506233656}, {"review": "it's great and i loved it, the only part that sucked was the escorting segment\nwell worth playing!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505010281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1113, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198033325091", "num_games_owned": 481}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "3", "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509876", "timestamp_updated": 1505018350, "recommendationid": "34853139", "timestamp_created": 1505018350}, {"review": "BioCrash Crashmastered", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1507007918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_forever": 496, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561198196480482", "num_games_owned": 83}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504922", "timestamp_updated": 1506695638, "recommendationid": "35298151", "timestamp_created": 1506695638}, {"review": "The remastered version, even after updates, still crashes constantly and I would recommend playing the original version of the game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504908484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 933, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198060241272", "num_games_owned": 47}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1504886313, "recommendationid": "34817549", "timestamp_created": 1504886313}, {"review": "I bought the Bioshock collection and wondered whether it was a right choice or otherwise.
