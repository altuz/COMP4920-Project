{"reviews": [{"review": "As I expected, the second game in the Bioshock franchise delivered a very similar experiance to the first game. Only this time, you were returning to Rapture as a seasoned veteren, as opposed to new player who has never seen the likes of this atmospheric game before. Which all in all is not a bad thing if you've never played Bioshock before, but if you've already played though the entire first game (like myself) then you may find this instalment lacking in creative content.\n\nThat isin't to say that Bioshock 2 dosen't bring new elements to the franchise. You play as a Big Daddy, but you still get to use plasmids, which does make combat incredibly fun. No more wrench, now you have a drill. No more pistol, now you finally have one of those Rivet guns that you could never pick up or use in the first game. However, as a big Daddy you can now accompany little sisters on their harvests for extra Atom, only to either harvest or save them by the end.\n\nBioshock 2 Remastered also comes with the Minerva's Den DLC, which I highly reccomend. It gives that Bioshock itch a good scratch by staying true to the Bioshock formula of having a mysterious plot and twist ending, but also introducing a new Big Daddy and a lovely new gun to fight it with.\n\nBioshock 2 also introduces new enimes, like Brut Splicers, Big Sisters and a couple new Big Daddies. However in the end, a few small changes are not enough to make Bioshock 2 better the then first Bioshock game. It just dosen't have the same sense of wonder and mystery that made the first game so great. Does that mean Bioshock 2 is by any means a bad game? No. That would be like saying a 8/10 game is bad just because the previouse game was a 9/10.\n\nSo do I think Bioshock 2 is better the the first Bioshock? No, I do not. Do I think you should still play it? Absolutely, It is still an engaging, enjoyable and well made FPS that is much better then so many other games on the market.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505877051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1782, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198307800474", "num_games_owned": 29}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524349", "timestamp_updated": 1506242605, "recommendationid": "35174771", "timestamp_created": 1506242605}, {"review": "Due to frequent crashes, always remember to quick-save like EVERY 5 MINUTES.

Now have to fight her again. As much as I want people to check out Bioshock, being unable to do it without a bunch of crashes would just ruin the experience and probably frustrate even the calmest person.\n\nUpdate: So I went back to the game and somehow bypassed a crash, then I had more crashes related to saving my game. I finished the level without saving and that was sorted out. On the next level I spent a lot of time exploring the levels, trying to get every possible achievement, then got to the next Big Sister fight. I died a few times, so I saved my game to try it again later. Now loading the saved game and doing anything for a few seconds crashes the game again. This happened over 10 times. I'm really close to abandoning the series for good, because while I know the original Bioshock 2 is reported to be way more stable, I don't want to start over and work for those achievements and collectibles.

She argues that capitalism is the culmination of social individualism, because the economy generates value based in a notion of exclusivity, rooted in ego. Rapture under Ryan being the culmination of capitalism, would be the culmination of egocentric society.\n \nShe argues that capitalism glorifies individual ego mirrored in a notion of success propagated by the American Dream, and that the pursuit of happiness is just a front to justify our own desires. To free humanity from poverty, suffering and inequality, one has to let go of their own ego completely.\n \nRapture itself turns into a social experiment to refine this theory, to reshape humanity into this vision of \"Utopia\". You as the failed product of a bigone age, is the only one standing against her.\n \nIt's actually amazing to see the many similarities it has with Bioshock 3. Sadly, the game is nerfed in many aspects, the campaign is the shortest of all 3 games, the original crafting system is completely scrapped, and the main lore is just so scattered in the form of monologues, that you simply can't be bothered to look for them all to form a coherent picture.\n \nSo a few poor choices in gameplay design, and a very lousy presentation of the story made Bioshock 2 the worst one in the series.

I'll make sure to go into detail about why this choice was such a challenge, but let's start with the game itself.\n\nBioshock 2 is the (obvious) successor of the widely-acclaimed Bioshock. The game was received with mixed-feelings. Despite having favorable reviews, all within the 4-5 star range, the game suffered critique from fans of the original. I've always had a working theory about this. I believe that most people who didn't experience the first prior to the second found it as an enjoyable game, whereas those that did experience the first had higher expectations and therefor felt disappointed. I fall into the second category, I do not feel that Bioshock 2 compares to the original. That being said, I don't think Bioshock 2 is horrible, I mostly feel it's \"okay\".\n\nThe environment of Rapture has changed in the near decade since our last visit, although not as much as you'd expect (some of those posters are tough, damn). Strangely, it seems that although there were multiple ends in the predecessor, Bioshock 2 seems to takes place specifically after one of those endings. Splicers have managed to maintain their dirty habit, some now having a more extreme appearance than last time. Society as a whole has remarkably held up somehow. With all that said, for me it doesn't feel like Rapture. It looks like Rapture, it has the same art-deco design, same crazy denizens, but something feels off. Honestly I feel it might have to do with level design, in Bioshock the levels are made very fluid and have a sense of claustrophobia to them. I didn't have that same feeling in Bioshock 2. If anything Rapture seemed very expansive, with massive areas and several story buildings.\n\nGameplay-wise quite a few things have changed. Players are now capable of using plasmids and weapons simultaneously, which some people might mark as an improvement but I find myself at times stumbling around my keyboard and juggling around between a spear gun and a frosty Winter Blast. Keybindings have been rearranged weirdly enough. And walking is no longer an option, you're sprinting from now on buddy. The hacking mini-game has been revised as well, you no longer tell father time to take a seat when you decide to mess with pipes! Is this an improvement? I'm not entirely sure. I never found myself during my two playthroughs really jumping around and gunning gene-junkies down while hacking something, so it didn't really change much. A bit quicker though I suppose. And they've added the gatherer function, you get to play Big Daddy and defend your little sister while she does her eight to nine and drains adam from rotting corpses while hordes of splicers come to investigate. Probably one of the more innovative additions to Bioshock 2, though it does become stale after awhile.\n\nHere's the big subject for me, story. The story in Bioshock 2 is, while I hate going back to an earlier statement, but it's simply \"okay\". Was I sucked into the plot? Not really. Did the tragic history of Delta and Eleanor tug at my heart strings? Old ticker just kept chugging. Really the only character I felt helped build my image of the world of Rapture was Sinclair, but he stands alone. Words aren't coming to me right now, the games story just didn't leave much of an impression on me. It's an  interesting tale but sadly it doesn't live up to its predecessor (Levine 4 Lyfe).\n\nNow for what you've all been waiting for. Why did I struggle to give this review that nice cyan blue thumb?\n\nThis game is a mess.\n\nI mentioned the crashing issue that's a prominent subject in my Bioshock 1 Remastered review, but in Bioshock 2 the issue is near terminal. I may have crashed for each hour of gameplay, each time without warning. Another issue with the game is the achievements. When I have to find a guide on how to do simple game related achievement then there's an issue. Some are just impossible without some digging, and trust me there are guides on the subject. During my second playthrough I had collected one hundred and twenty audiobooks and still hadn't unlocked the achievement for finding one hundred. These problems just make it so difficult to enjoy the game, especially when you crash and have to retrace almost a half hour of gameplay (please don't make Groundhogs Day the Game a thing). At one point I swore I'd give Bioshock 2 Remastered a negative review.\n\nAnd the real kicker here is that the Remastered version doesn't really offer much more than its original. While the Bioshock Remastered obtained commentary, a museum, and several puzzle games, Bioshock 2 mainly just got a slight polish. With all the bugs it just feels like a worst version of the none-remastered version. It made my playthroughs feel like a job rather than a pastime. I genuinely hate that later I just had to accept that I had to save for almost every block I ran (because you can't walk).\n\nNow onto a more jolly subject before tying this review up onto a teddy bear with a bow, some Adam, and hey I'll throw a gene-tonic in there too! Let's talk Minervas Den! Oh, I'm forgetting the Protector Trials. The Protector Trials are a way to pass time. Anyways, onto Minervas Den. If I had a genie in a lamp I'd ask him to first sound like Robin Williams and then ask for him to somehow swap Minervas Den and Bioshock 2, let Delta be DLC! Minervas Den is such a fantastic little story, while the plot is somewhat generic it at least left me with an impression. Rapture Central Computing, while borrowing some level design from Bioshock 2, is just so much more interesting. A crazy new weapon and plasmid, a new Big Daddy model that looks like it should be guarding the gates of heaven, all these great things and they all had to be confined into a DLC! Oh, and lastly, if I hadn't driven the point home yet: Sigma > Delta.\n\nSo I'm not entirely sure if I've made the right choice giving this game a thumbs up, but I still think if you're a fan of Bioshock you should experience its sequel.
