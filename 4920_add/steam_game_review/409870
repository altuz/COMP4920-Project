{"reviews": [{"review": "I think it's necessary to split the review for this game into two parts: the story part (as most people do, in fact, play games for the story) and the gameplay part. I think both of them are great, as far as japanese SRPGs go.\n\nThe story revolves around a young girl named Marona who's lost her parents and has a spirit guardian named Ash filling the role of her older brother and sort of mentor/protector. Ash is a ghost whom only Marona can see, and the only being who cares and looks out for her. Most of the people Marona encounters consider her an abomination for seeing ghosts and talking to them. She also gets incredibly brutal and unfair treatment because she's seen by everyone as an orphan girl with a freaky and dangerous power. Despite that, she never gives up. No matter how harsh the people treat her, how difficult and unfair her circumstances are, she endures them all, and when you play the game, it feels incredibly genuine and not just because Marona is \"such a nice and friendly girl!\". Her willingness to help those who are treated even less fairly than she is, those who are struggling, is genuine and heart-warming, and it's Marona's own way to cope with all the harsh treatment and loss she has to endure. It's a tale of a very selfless girl whose kindness knows no bounds, and perhaps her kindness would inspire the players in turn. \n\nThe gameplay relies heavily on grind, which is a staple for Disgaea series and its spinoffs. However, the gameplay takes its own unique turn with Marona's abilities to summon spirits, or \"phantoms\" who fight alongside her, as well as picking up stuff scattered around the stages to use as weapons, alongside the usual weapon choice like swords, spears and staffs. Even a measly rock and a random weed have an incredibly power lying dormant in them! Which is, of course, pretty awesome. Leveling up weapons also offers the player an opportunity to completely break the game because you're free to make them as overpowered as you desire. The phantoms can only be summoned for a limited number of turns, and Marona can only summon a limited amound of those from her roster, so you have to plan out many of the more difficult fights ahead (or keep replaying till you get them right). The stages also offer your units opportunity to more or less free roam, which is slightly more confusing when it comes to positioning compared to grid and more predictable and fixed positioning.\nDifficulty level expects you to grind a lot and can get pretty brutal if you don't commit enough to grind, and straight out impossible if you choose to neglect grinding altogether. If you don't enjoy grinding, this isn't the game for you.\n\nThe soundtrack is incredibly nice and has an easy-going, yet somewhat somber and melancholic feeling to it; it's never about pure carefree joy, which further enhances the general direction of the story and Marona's character. It also makes even the sloggiest of the stages and the grindiest of grinds a better experience. \nThe graphics, however... Well, the 3D part of the stages looks ok, as well as the backgrounds; unfortunately, pixel sprites are blurry and feel very out of place because of said blurriness. The PC version is pretty much an emulation of the PS2 game, which PB originally was, and it's definitely not meant to be viewed on modern HD monitors. Which is a shame, because the sprite work is really detailed and varied, but it turns out to be such a mess on the actual screen.\n\nOverall, the game is really good if you're willing to commit effort to grind. The only downside I can really point out is the blurry pixel sprites, which is a glaring shame on a game that's otherwise pretty much flawless.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1493239845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 465, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198005766747", "num_games_owned": 356}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501610", "timestamp_updated": 1499538630, "recommendationid": "33382050", "timestamp_created": 1499538316}, {"review": "Imagine if Disgaea were actually a good game with real innovative features and a functional port.
