{"reviews": [{"review": "(Please note majority of my gameplay takes place offline, which Steam does not track)\n\nA must-have for fans of tactical turn-based games.\n\nThe Storm Guard appears deceptively simple, but if you get past the one-man-studio Unity graphics, the production value is rock solid. Not that I find anything to hold against the graphical presentation. It does not have AAA polish (duh), but it is far beyond the \"least amount of work required\" some failed game attempts implement. In fact, watching your Guard members' appearance change as they slowly accumulate equipment pieces is one of the many small, but thoughtful, additions to the game, and certainly shows the love and care clearly put in this game.\n\nTo the point, though - the game is NOT a \"story-mode\" RPG. The story is pretty generic and serves no other purpose than a window dressing on the real focus of the game - the tactical combat. And boy oh boy does the Storm Guard deliver.\n\nThere are enough classes to run into (while you pick from a randomized recruit roster, the availability of specific classes is random) to give enough replayability for several runs if only to learn the strength and weaknesses of each class. Some combination (or just classes in general) are better than others, but the balance between them is mostly preserved well enough that you will can efficiently utilize most of them.\n\nThere are more combat skills than you can \"equip\" for each mission, and figuring out the best combination of them for your personal playstyle is, for me, a large part of enjoyment of the game. Sooner or later you will realize the need for counters specific against particular enemies. It speaks of the intricacy of the combat system that you WILL need to plan ahead to handle any of the enemy archetypes - and there are enough of them that a single cookie-cutter approach, without tactical planning once you hit the map, will result in a party wipe.\n\nAnother challenge comes from the more strategic layer of the game. There is a fine balance between improving your characters' skills and equipment and retaining sufficient funds to benefit from random events during missions (or just having enough food early on). Along with timed missions that expire if left unfulfilled, and a \"panic\" meter that decreases your funding if you fail to keep to your duty of protecting the imaginary kingdom, you end up with having to make constant decisions on priorities. It definitely adds to the \"Bad Things\u2122 are coming!\" feeling of the game.\n\nAs for specific mechanics, you have the full set available. You will recruit new members at the inn. You can assign those that do not go on missions to handle one of four base-specific tasks, or let them rest and recuperate. As soon as you clear appropriate early missions, you will train their skills and buy new pieces of equipment (and the ability to see the gear improve as more model elements are added is a really pleasing touch).\n\nIn the end, though, all of it is merely accessory (albeit a very important one) to the core of the game - the tactical combat. And that part is fantastic.\n\nDo yourself a favor and do not skip on this one if you enjoy tactical turn-based games. It is definitely worth the asking price.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501028306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1252, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198079797439", "num_games_owned": 272}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506308", "timestamp_updated": 1500743336, "recommendationid": "33725339", "timestamp_created": 1500743336}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 67, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 82, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
