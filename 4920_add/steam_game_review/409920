{"reviews": [{"review": "Excellent visual novel. \n\nPros:\n- Beautiful artwork\n- Decent writing\n- Interesting story and characters\n- LGBTQ inclusivity\n- Racial inclusivity\n- Good amount of choices and endings\n\nCons:\n- (Spoiler-ish) The good ending was kind of meh for me. Like, Ash (the protagonist) and Terra [spoiler]kiss at the end[/spoiler] and that seems a bit rushed. I know that there's reasons for them to feel connected in the story, but the ending felt empty because of lack of development between those two characters.\n\nI definitely recommend this to VN fans and those who enjoy fantasy/romance.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506333947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 605, "playtime_forever": 631, "num_reviews": 91, "steamid": "76561198067189801", "num_games_owned": 248}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523578", "timestamp_updated": 1506335052, "recommendationid": "35199987", "timestamp_created": 1506335052}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 111, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 120, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
