Srs. The egyptian setting, Sam plowing through hordes of monsters, in beautiful sandy landscapes with egyptian architecture on the horizon. Ofc it's not all sand but that really is the iconic scenery in this installment. Fitting soundtrack combines perfectly to set a bright mood for each level. And the new graphics only help to set atmosphere.\n\n- Horde slaughtering gameplay format. Never a lone enemy really, always hordes of enemies coming from all directions. You'll have to learn to think which position's enemies to slaughter first. And what weapons to use when, if you want to avoid pointless loss of armor and life bar.\n\n - Reworked gore system. Blood decals look great and there's a nice damaged version skin applied to slain enemies, and what else is there.\n\n- Protagonist. Very built man with overly manly hairstyle of course. Booze drinker voice. Fearless. Enthusiastic about slaying armies of monsters.\n\nCons:\n\n- There should be an option to have new gun sounds. While the fictional weapons have well aged sounds I feel, the firearms could have a bit less muffled, more sharp sounds.\n\n- Frog room in Oasis is still absolute bullshit."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505667318, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500059", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35028231", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198094551025", "num_reviews": 62, "last_played": 1506174566, "num_games_owned": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 233, "playtime_forever": 517}, "timestamp_updated": 1505667318, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Gud Gaem"}]}
