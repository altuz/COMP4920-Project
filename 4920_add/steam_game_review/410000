{"reviews": [{"review": "Hey there! I am a (actualy quite new but eager) fan of your work and came along Chalo Chalo while playing Ibb & Obb with a friend of mine. A few hours later, we were eight people sitting together and yelling curses at each other while playing your game :blueduck:\nNo but seriously, pretty cool game! You can easily turn it into a drinking game if you want, and people can join or leave the game without realy breaking the flow or tension. \nThumbs up!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1493139614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 386, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198082474919", "num_games_owned": 113}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "timestamp_updated": 1478040418, "recommendationid": "26363793", "timestamp_created": 1478040418}, {"review": "The good: I love party games.  Chalo Chalo is a great party game.  Had a blast playing it for about half an hour on a friend\u2019s machine with a group of seven people at various levels of intoxication.  The game was everything that was advertised.  Easy to pick up, everyone could get the controller app, and connect in under 5 minutes.  \n\nThe bad: We had a few issues with disconnects mid-game and players' dots would just wander off the screen.  Also, I get that the devs are probably going for some aesthetic with the pastels for each player\u2019s dot, but half the players had a hard time picking out their dot.  \n\nThe unacceptable:  One of our players was colorblind.  The player couldn't tell the difference between the fast (green) and the death (red) tiles.  Considering that around 1 in 20 people are colorblind and the game is made for 8 players, the likelihood that someone at your party is colorblind is fairly high.  It is completely unacceptable that there is no colorblind palette option. \n\nAdd a colorblind mode.  Add a mode with more distinct colors for the dots.  \n\nTL;DR: Chalo Chalo is a fun party game.  It needs a colorblind mode or you won\u2019t be able to play it at parties.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1482039248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197974757392", "num_games_owned": 78}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "5", "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504636", "timestamp_updated": 1482039258, "recommendationid": "28440404", "timestamp_created": 1482039258}, {"review": "I have met with the developers at Indiecade Europe 2016 and had a chance to try the game there. Bought the game immediately after that.\nIt is a great party game. The controls are very simple and very easy to pick up. \n\nWhen I play with my friends the goal for everyone is usually not \"to win the game\", but to \"to prevent others from winning the game\"; so it is a great example of a \"Friendship Ruining\" game.

But honestly, they're not big enough to mention - especially since the devs are already working on the issues I could find.\n\nCurrently to play the game, you must be at least 3 people (5 and above is recommended). You start the game, and plug in your controllers or you can use your smartphone by downloading the Chalo Chalo app. Just make sure you are all on the same WiFi network and you're good to go. The game and controls are very easy to get into and shouldn't take many seconds to get a hang of.
