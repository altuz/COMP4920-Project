{"reviews": [{"review": "Ok, first thing, i am a fan of the hotline miami serie so don't take too seriously this review since i might influence it\n\n12 is better than 6 is first of all a hardcore game, this means you will need a lot of practice (or perhaps just 5 minutes if you have played hotline miami and finished all chapters with A+) to familiarise with the game's controls and mechanics, for example you have to cock your gun before every shot or that a backstab is an instant kill while knifing in front of the enemy will result in your own death. \nThis is my long preamble now let's start with the real review\n\nPros:\n-Graphics: the game graphics looks like a comic, everything is in black and white, except for the blood which sticks out thanks to the white background\n-Music: the game's music tracks are really good and are settled well for every scene. However there aren't many of them\n-Difficulty: as i said this is a hardcore game, while for many it could be a bad thing, for me it's funny since i like challenges. Ah yeah, for some parts the game is trial and error and that could be a little bit annoying but this is also a feature of hard games\n-Price: the game's really cheap for what it offers, anyway I recommend you to buy it while it's on sale because of the short plot\n\nCons:\n-Plot: the plot isn't the main focus of this game so i am not surprised by its unoriginality. Moreover it's short, really short.\nIt's the first time i see a game about a mexican in a western game though (ah yeah, sometimes the main character insults some npc in spanish, so thumbs up since I have watched Narcos and I know a few of spanish insults)\n-Game: it can be repetitive in some parts, there is no change in the game mechanics and moreover you could get tired of the same weapons\n\nOne last thing: This game is going to bring you either fun or rage. (If you are the latter one, i will say one only thing:\"Git gud\")\nThis is my review, I'm sorry for my English, it's like my third language so...maybe i should git gud in studying English \n\n\n\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505920040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 649, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198180274566", "num_games_owned": 73}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509151", "timestamp_updated": 1504703269, "recommendationid": "34775205", "timestamp_created": 1504703269}, {"review": "fast paced brutal gun action, hard, amazing music, great art 9/10", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506645797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_forever": 679, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198119362252", "num_games_owned": 59}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500985", "timestamp_updated": 1505532068, "recommendationid": "34986601", "timestamp_created": 1505532068}, {"review": "Short but interesting top-down shooter.\n\nPros:\n - A lot of levels in the campaign.\n - The weapon controls are unique and you really have to think differently about them than other games.\n - You can really think out your approach before you make a move, and have stealth kills at your disposal. So there are two styles to play.\n - Enemies are on equal footing, you will die if you aren't quick to react.\n\nCons:\n - The enemies and weapons are hard to distinguish from each other and the background due to the monochrome art style and little movement.\n - The 12 is better than 6 upgrade for the revolver kills how fun the revolver is to play with for me.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1504736626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 231, "num_reviews": 30, "steamid": "76561198026408440", "num_games_owned": 386}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500985", "timestamp_updated": 1504799287, "recommendationid": "34796937", "timestamp_created": 1504799287}, {"review": "I'm ticking recommend because there's a lot I like about this game, but holy hell does it have some issues. \n\nI understand the idea of the balck and white and blood combo, but there needs to be better signposting, especially as to which direction enemies are facing. \n\nDying from off camera is highly snnoying, and I have drawn the line at the train level.\n\nWhen it's humming and you're combing shots it's very good, but a whole lot of polish needs to come before it hits a wider audience.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506151771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "playtime_forever": 233, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561197995330127", "num_games_owned": 46}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503405", "timestamp_updated": 1506151958, "recommendationid": "35146475", "timestamp_created": 1506151958}, {"review": "This is a very cool game, unfortunately too short. \nI really enjoyed the atmosphere and the story.

Music is good, but otherwise the game is rather unmemorable.\n\nNot fan of the black&white graphic style either; the story is more of a spaghetti western than classic B&W western of John Ford. But Spaghetti Westerns were very colourful, not bland like this. Due everything being B&W, the enemies are also often very hard to spot from the scenery, which will kill you countless times.\n\nFirst the game felt fun, but while each and every stage in Hotline Miami has its own characteristics and is tied to the story in some way, in this game you feel that you are playing the same stage over and over and over again. It gets really repetitive, really fast.  While contantly dying in Hotline Miami gets your adrenaline pumping and addicted you to it, here it only annoys you after a while, since never you get the same feeling of a \"reward\" as you get when completing a hard stage in HM. You just move into another identical stage and continue shooting baddies.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504785633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 339, "num_reviews": 40, "steamid": "76561198081450332", "num_games_owned": 379}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504152", "timestamp_updated": 1504612734, "recommendationid": "34754901", "timestamp_created": 1504612734}, {"review": "Game feels like Hotline Miami at about a twelth the speed and with a hundredth the intrigue.
