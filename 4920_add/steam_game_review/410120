The story is great and well done implemented with puzzles, It's a lot of readings in game. There are many books or peaces of papers to read in the game, but if you like to know more about story then just read it. They are two board games to play in game. They are not to hard to play.

I gave up in disgust in Lapland after heavily relying on one in London and found the puzzles just as obscure and irritating. \n\nOther than that, the game had a nice and I especially liked the music in Lapland, but the controls annoyed me. You use arrows to move forward and then you have to click and hold to turn in different directions. It was easy to miss inventory items. \n\nNot my cup of tea at all.
