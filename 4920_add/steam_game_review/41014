It is a game where you shoot lots and lots of dudes with big guns and is pleasantly dumb. However, there was a lot of work that went into making shooting tons of dudes pleasantly dumb, and the fact that the game keeps things tense and overwhelming but not overly difficult when shooting tons of dudes made me feel like a rockstar with a minigun. It's so action movie cheesy but so god damned awesome."}, {"votes_down": 20, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1339994505, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554775", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "3069085", "votes_up": 85, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016929639", "num_reviews": 179, "last_played": 0, "num_games_owned": 883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 0}, "timestamp_updated": 1469887828, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Edit: This does NOT come with the first encounter. If you own both games this game will import the first enounter's levels.

Anyways, same thing as the first, just a new campaign, some new enemies, new music and enviorments. Try the demo if your skeptical. Bulls charging at you, headless kamazakies, zombies throwing grenades, robot aliens shooting lasers and rockets at you, harpies dive bombing from the sky to rip you apart, what's not to love?"}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1453999123, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552801", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 7, "recommendationid": "20807490", "votes_up": 48, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042831386", "num_reviews": 442, "last_played": 1453999143, "num_games_owned": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 33}, "timestamp_updated": 1453999123, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1]Short version: 79%[/h1] \nJust like the remake of the first game, Second Encounter HD updates the graphics of the old Serious Sam expansion disk, while retaining the fast-paced combat and the great new weapons of the original. Sadly it still can\u2019t make the starting levels any more fun, but the later ones really make up for the slow start. \n \n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nWhen the remake of Serious Sam: The First Encounter was released, it wasn\u2019t surprising that a similar facelift on the Second Encounter followed.\n\nFor those new to the franchise, Second Encounter is sort of like a DLC collection for [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/41000/]First Encounter,[/url] glued together as one continuous game, where Sam has to continue his fight against Mental in the Maya Empire, Babylon, and medieval Poland. The onslaught of the aliens is even more relentless here, but Sam also got a few new toys to play with, including a chainsaw, a flamethrower, and a sniper rifle. Too bad each new world takes away the entire arsenal to start all over again.\nAll three new worlds have their own theme, where sadly the starting one is probably the weakest with its vast but often empty open terrain. We have to wait until Babylon to get the classic arenas back, only to travel underground for a great boss fight. And Poland\u2026 well, CroTeam made sure that these three levels will put anyone\u2019s skills to the test, even on the lowest difficulty. Expect to face over a thousand enemies on the last gauntlet alone\u2026\n\nThe updates follow the same approach as with the First Encounter. The focus was primarily on the graphics, even if the gameplay was rebalanced a bit (increased difficulty on the lowest settings, some enemy placement and composition tweaks\u2026). Again, these changes won\u2019t deprive any newcomer from the original TSE experience, but veterans can find some new challenge as well.\nThe old focus on multiplayer is still here too, although this time CroTeam tried to put more emphasis on co-op rather than PvP matches, and probably for the betterment of the game."}]}
