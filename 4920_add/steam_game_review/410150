{"reviews": [{"review": "Cute graphics, relaxing atmosphere. Nice polish on the interface.\nThe gameplay is simple, click on a shape to shift it a direction or remove it.\nSome of the shapes have a countdown timer, you have to keep removing those or else.\nHowever because you don't have perfect control over the direction, you have to plan.\nSometimes it seems impossible, but more than once I realized some way to clear the skulls right on time. Those little moments feel satisfying.\nHowever just as often you feel screwed that you randomly didn't get the right shapes and have no chance of clearing them in time. You could play perfectly and still lose, that kind of sucks.\nThere some hint at a story of a wierd glitchy AI trying to escape, it makes you want to keep playing.\n\nOverall it's exactly what you would expect, a shiney puzzle game.\nI bit the bullet for $7, and I'm not quite sure it's worth that much.

It is based on the mechanics of \"Tetris\" and \"Bejeweled\", but has it's very own ideas, which create a new gameplay. The levels are based on simple rules, which lead to tricky and challenging levels in the end. You get 25 normal-mode and 13 hard-mode levels.  After solving all stages you get 75 bonus task, a endless playing mode and even 2 more stages. So, there is a lot to do.\n\nAs once before I don't like the soundtrack choosen by Fallen Tree Games. Quite fast the music started to annoy me. So I turned it off and my own music on - I got an steam-achievement doing this. So FTG sees the with humor - I like this attitude.\n\nAnother minus is the bad arrangement of the screen : on the left you see gameplay infos and the level objectives and on the right the level itself - both with the same size. A bad solution in my opinion. The level should fill the middle of the screen and the status info sould be somewhere at the side.\n\nAll in all I really liked playing the game because the game-mechanics are well designed.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1469311861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1355, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198141995870", "num_games_owned": 60}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1469313468, "recommendationid": "24487998", "timestamp_created": 1469312368}, {"review": "Fun match-3 with tricky, rewarding puzzles.
