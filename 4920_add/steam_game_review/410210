{"reviews": [{"review": "Despite Ampersand's overall negative reviews (and being a fan of futuristic racing titles) I thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt and pick it up to see how it is. Unfortunately, while its visuals, ship, and sound designs aren't atrocious, its complete lack of gamepad support of any kind and its clunky keyboard controls are enough to warrant not enjoying the game very much. The game is also quite difficult -more as a result of the controls being shoddy than anything else- but to unlock the next race in a series, you need to get first place in all of the preceding events to accumulate enough points (i.e. Track 4 is unlocked after getting 9 points total, 3 in each preceding track.) \n\nWhile this is standard in other racing games as well, due to Ampersand's garbage keyboard control feedback you'll often be boosting during a race only to go crashing / bouncing off of walls clumsily toward the finish line. Whereas analog stick controller support might lead the player to be able to breeze into sharp corners, narrowly avoiding the wall and gracefully navigating the track, instead with the keyboard you're left to hope that you've let off the gas pedal (mapped to X...) just enough or have frantically pressed the left or right keys to somehow not bounce off of the wall. Whereas other racing games are rewarding when you do figure out \"how fast to go into turn 6\" Ampersand just feels like you're doomed to failure, or that the controls aren't responsive enough to do what you're intending. \n\nAmpersand has some potential, but unfortunately it is squandered via the poor controls and feels like more of a waste of time than anything else.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1505685326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 70, "num_reviews": 148, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "num_games_owned": 800}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_updated": 1505686925, "recommendationid": "35034419", "timestamp_created": 1505686925}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 72, "review_score": 4, "total_negative": 178, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 250, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative"}, "success": 1}
