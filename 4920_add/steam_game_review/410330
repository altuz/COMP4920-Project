{"reviews": [{"review": "I was really exited when I found this game and then played a few round and was highly disapointed.  Its a poor port of winter maul wars from WC3.  Why am i limted in the amount i can maze?  a max of 60 is too low and limits the creativity of mazing.  Also in regards to mazing, the spacing is not well designed as it doesnt allow you to maximize the spacing of your maze (you're forced to leave a full space for minons to walk through instead of half a space if you want a clean maze) .  Now I know I'm being picky but this style of game is nothing new and isnt better than what was  around 10 years ago.  I would expect somthing more from a game I pay 15 dollars for considering the history of tower defenses and mauls in WC3; its an established style.  I would keep an eye on this game but it needs major imprevements before its worth paying for.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1500961584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198068857311", "num_games_owned": 67}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "timestamp_updated": 1500962074, "recommendationid": "33780284", "timestamp_created": 1500962074}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
