{"reviews": [{"review": "The purpose of this review is to help you determine if HEX: Shards of Fate is a good fit for you. There are a number of quality games on Steam that receive negative reviews simply because they don\u2019t fit the head-shape, budget, and/or difficulty level of certain players. If you really want the TL:DR of this review, go and look at the number of hours played by the positive reviews compared to the number of hours played by the negative reviews. I am a 41-year-old professional with a full-time work schedule. As an avid PC gamer that can no longer keep up with the demands of traditional MMO play times, HEX has been a blessing for me. I have been absolutely enamored with the game\u2019s PvP and PvE and I have been steadily improving thanks to a very helpful community.\n \nTHE PAY MODEL\n\nIn order to make a proper determination whether or not HEX is the game for you, you should first understand what this game is and how the pay model works. HEX: Shards of Fate is a trading card game with various PvP and PvE formats. The client can be downloaded without making a purchase and some basic cards as well as all PvE formats can be played free of charge. Additional cards are purchased in packs on a per-pack basis just like real world trading card games like Magic and Pokemon. Cards can be traded among players and bought and sold on the Auction House for either of the game\u2019s currencies. There is Platinum which is purchased with real money and used to buy packs and VIP time, and Gold which is earned by participating in PvE. HEX is not intended to be a Free to Play game. It is a virtual trading, collectable card game that shares aspects of real life card games. In order to fully utilize and appreciate what HEX has to offer you should expect to invest a significant (but reasonable) amount of time and money.\n\nTHE ECONOMY\n\nCards can be bought and sold for both Platinum and Gold on the virtual Auction House. Platinum is originally purchased with real money and is used to buy packs and VIP time. Gold is earned mostly in PvE.  Gold can be used to buy auction house items, Stardust to make cards \u2018Extended Art\u2019, and to \u2018roll\u2019 on treasure chests which are obtained by buying pack and completing PvE tasks. The HEX economy very nicely allows players with varying preferences of PvP and PvE to exchange desired virtual items. The modest VIP program is free of any Pay-To-Win rewards. Also, you should be aware that there is a robust \u2018unregulated\u2019 secondary market where players can sell their collection for real world cash. It\u2019s unsanctioned by Cryptozoic and provides a way for players to receive some of their cash investment back if they decide to move on. This might seem shady at first but it\u2019s akin to going in to your local hobby shop and buying and selling cards there. I put $400 in to Hearthstone and ended up hating the game but since you can\u2019t freely trade cards, I have no way to get any of that back. \n\nPLAYER VS. EVIROMENT\n\nPvE in HEX currently features two modes of play. There\u2019s a Campaign where you can pick a champion, explore the map, and raid solo dungeons. The other mode is the Frost Ring Arena where you compete with AI controlled champions. The AI difficulty level in both modes is intentionally set at \u2018easy\u2019 to \u2018medium\u2019 in my estimation. The \u2018dumb\u2019 AI is a negative for some players that want a more challenging PvE experience. For most players however, PvE is a form of grinding and the challenge is to figure out deck and equipment designs that can farm the quickest. My favorite aspect of PvE is the Equipment system. Champions can equip certain pieces of armor and weapons that give cards in their decks powerful attributes. It\u2019s a brilliant system that allows for the design of fun, powerful decks in PvE without creating balance issues in PvP.\n\nPLAYER VS. PLAYER\n\nHEX has a number of PvP formats that appeal to a variety of players based on their tastes. There\u2019s Constructed modes that allow a player to use any PvP eligible card in their collection and there are Gauntlets and Draft mode where players use only cards that are obtained by opening packs. Constructed Mode is highly competitive and since players can use any card in their collection, you will need to make an investment to earn the cards that will allow you to be competitive. You can design budget decks that will help you advance up the ladder but you\u2019ll need to invest and collect some nice cards to be a solid competitor. For players that prefer a more \u2018level\u2019 competition there\u2019s Gauntlets and Drafts. Cards in this mode are obtained directly from packs that are opened for that tournament. The cards obtained are completely random for each player and it\u2019s up to you to design the best deck possible. After the tournament concludes, the cards obtained are added to your collection and can be used or traded as you see fit. \n\nTHE COMMUNITY AND DEVELOPERS\n\nThe community is one of the major selling features to me and is why I enjoy HEX so much. There are a number of excellent guilds <Insert Shameless Plug for Cornerstone> and well-produced guides in the form of videos and blogs. The players here are mature and helpful. Any game with PvP will attract ass-hats of course, but in the two months I\u2019ve been playing, I can count on one hand the number of rude comments that I\u2019ve encountered in chat during a match. The Twitch/Youtube community is excellent and quite often coordinates with Cryptozoic Entertainment. For instance, during the latest patch, a second, pre-patched server was set up so streamers could highlight the upcoming changes during down time. My perception is that Cryptozoic communicates with the player base often and they understand the concerns, needs, and wants of players. I like their transparency regarding their policies and I think their financial model is fair and well done.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nLike many of you I suffered a long period of MMO\u2019s that became P2W and games that were released too early. I\u2019m truly grateful that I found HEX. Cryptozoic Entertainment is a smaller developer and there\u2019s content and quality of life improvements that all of us want sooner rather than later, but at the end of the day, this is an excellent product. If you\u2019re looking for a hobby to sink your teeth in to or you\u2019re considering trying your first TCG, this is the game for you. HEX is Grade A, bonafide Trading Card Game with gorgeous artwork and easy to learn, difficult to master gameplay. I hope you give it a solid try!\n\nEdited for length conformity.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1503703508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 60699, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197989629594", "num_games_owned": 35}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523194", "timestamp_updated": 1475037594, "recommendationid": "25626277", "timestamp_created": 1474494053}, {"review": "HEX is by fantastic example of what can be achieved by a true trading card game in the digital space. The quickest way to descibe the game is Magic: The Gathering with a threshold based resource system and unique mechanics that would only be possible in a digital TCG. \n\nYou preserve everything offerred by physical CCGs such as complete open trading system and third party support and add to it a digital auction house, in-game tournament support, ladder system and a respectable single player experience (although admitiedly still shallow compared to their Kickstarter promises) which adds a somewhat viable way to enjoy the mechanics without spending any money.\n\nThat is to say, HEX's F2P avenue requires an extreme amount of luck or time if you want to construct some of the most potent PvP decks via only the PvE content. Time in grinding the PvE content until you have enough of the PvE currency to trade for sealed tournament entries and luck in that you do well enough in those sealed tournaments via wins or opening cards that sell well to pay for the next entry fee and make a profit.\n\nTo give some perspective to that a sealed tournament entry costs generally $5 and gets 2 boosters ($2 value each) with the potential to get 3 more boosters if you do well enough. Simply getting 1 win gets you an additional booster so that already would put you ahead on base value in addition to keeping the cards you open. In additon, there are multiple rare cards that sell for $1+ and some of the top end cards can go for $20+. If you get lucky enough to snag some of those and sell them on the AH or on the Trade channel you can keep yourself running tournaments for a good while.\n\nI have always been a stickler for dropping money into an online game and not having anything to show for it if I stop playing, but since HEX fully supports trading and third party sites if you ever want to cash out your account you can and depending on how much effort you want to put into selling off your collection you could even turn a profit.\n\nIn the future, HEX has promised to flush the single player experience out into a full multiplayer PvE experience with raids and dungeons for players to team up against. Not sure how far off this is and a number of Kickstarters are salty about the delay (rightly so), but as it stands now I fully recommend HEX as being the only digital TCG out there that has a comprehensive feature set, friendly community (Twitch & Reddit) and enjoyable complex strategic gameplay.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506063053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 229, "playtime_forever": 94289, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198005726069", "num_games_owned": 198}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517214", "timestamp_updated": 1487260059, "recommendationid": "29912937", "timestamp_created": 1487039549}, {"review": "I am a F2P Beta player, and have spent many hours grinding the PVE content to build my collection. I have tried a lot of different card games, and Hex is currently my favorite.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIf you know how to play MTG, you know how to play Hex. It is your standard \u201cmana\u201d driven TCG. It fully takes advantage of its digital nature, summoning cards from outside your collection, permanently modifying cards, and even completely changing cards in play. This adds a huge layer of strategy as deciding to kill a 1/1 creature by doing one damage or giving it -1/-1 matters when the card remembers its stats even in the discard pile!\n\nECONOMY / COST\nThe game has two currencies, Plat (real money) and Gold (in game money). The only time you need Plat is when entering tournaments, everything else can be bought with Gold.\n\nThe game has an auction house and the ability to trade with other players. It is a true TRADING card game as opposed to a COLLECTIBLE card game. You can turn Gold into Plat by trading with other players or selling cards in the auction house. \n\nIt is easy to grind Gold, you can challenge the AI in the Arena and get progressively larger rewards for winning (and even if you lose, you keep everything you won up to that point). You also have the campaign which continually rewards money and cards.\n\nSTABILITY / LAG\n\nFor the most part, the game is stable with reasonable performance. When a new release or event begins, the performance may suffer due to the increased load, but the developers usually handle that fairly quickly and increase the capacity. In my time playing, the performance has gotten better over all.\n\nA few deck strategies are also particularly taxing on the game, such as spider based decks which create massive amounts of creatures. This can be mildly annoying, but usually isn't game breaking. \n\n\nTOURNAMENTS\nThere are regularly occurring constructed and sealed tournaments. There are even queues which you can enter and play at your leisure over days instead of playing all at once. Entry fee is inexpensive and winning gets you packs.\n\nConstructed - This is your standard tournament. Build a deck and play to win. I avoid this as those who spend money clearly have an advantage.\n\nDraft - A fairly well designed mode though there can be a lot of waiting involved. Players draft from a common pool of cards so everyone is on equal ground. The problem is you can have players who simply take the rares for their collection.\n\nSealed - This is my favorite type of mode as everyone starts on equal footing and you keep all the cards. It is particularly fun to play in \u201cGauntlet\u201d mode as you can play your 3 to 7 games over however long you want, the pool of opponents constantly refreshes.\n\nPVE / Adventure Zones\nLast but not least is the PVE content. You choose a race and class which grants you special abilities and a starting deck. You then travel the world facing various challenges as you help your faction win a war. You can also hire mercenaries which provide you with even more options.\n\nYou can play this fairly effectively without spending any money. The opponents are interesting, and there are special PVE cards which are much too powerful or random for PVP games. This also earns you gold which can then be used to buy packs or enter into tournaments. \n\nI strongly recommend Hex!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1503552896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 19192, "num_reviews": 100, "steamid": "76561198078815095", "num_games_owned": 806}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511830", "timestamp_updated": 1486685252, "recommendationid": "29812731", "timestamp_created": 1486684512}, {"review": "Short Review:\n\nThis is a great TCG with interestingly designed cards and a unique PvE mode that is finally starting to grow into its potential.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nHex is a 'full depth' card game with a priority system that allows you to react to almost everything your opponent does with any quick card or power. There is a lot of fun and interesting card design, many of which exploit the digital nature of the game (i.e cards whose effects would be painful to nigh-on impossible to keep track of in a physical card game, but which work fine in a digital space as the client does all the book-keeping for you). A good example of this is a fun deck archetype which can implant large numbers of different types of eggs randomly in the opponents deck, which spawn spiders for you when drawn (or milled).\n\nA unique side of the game is the PvE, where you have a character who levels, with various skills to chose which have various effects on your deck, or give you various powers you can use while in battle. You build a deck for your hero, using any of the normal PvP cards and also a wide variety of PvE only cards, which are allowed to have slightly more wild effects. In addition, you can equip your hero, with each equipment improving one specific card in your deck. This allows an incredible variety of deck ideas to be explored, which is one of the most fun aspects for me. Until now this mode has been a little underdeveloped, but is now really starting to take shape with a much larger campaign and the addition of mercenaries. You can choose a party of them to accompany you on your travels and build individual decks for each (utilizing their unique powers), and use either yourself or one of your mercs to play with when trying to beat an encounter.\n\nThe client has had a few problems in the past, but is pretty solid nowadays. I'd highly recommend this game to any card game fans, but in particular those who enjoy coming up with and trying out new deck ideas as the PvE side provides so many more crazy deckbuilding possibilities.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1482894373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1063, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197990877253", "num_games_owned": 59}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501228", "timestamp_updated": 1481056506, "recommendationid": "28225479", "timestamp_created": 1481056506}, {"review": "8/8 would spend money on virtual card again", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1466726371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 676, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561198067085448", "num_games_owned": 272}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 7, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500113", "timestamp_updated": 1461717139, "recommendationid": "22654842", "timestamp_created": 1461717139}, {"review": "Hex is just brilliant TCG - if you have played Magic and you are looking for something that will be on similar complexity level, Hex is exactly the right thing.

I loved MtG, so when Wizards fell flat on their face delivering a meaningful experience there on the PC, and started throwing around litigation against the attempts by fans to make something out of that wreckage, I just sort of thought of card games as dead.\n\nI played Hearthstone, but I hate the Warcraft schlock and faux-animu oversaturated art style. With all the fancy magic particle effects gimmicks flying around, cards shaped like balls, etc., it felt like they were trying too hard to make it [i]not[/i] a card game at the expense of players who just didn't care.\n\nI played and still play Eternal. I love it, the AI is fantastic, the UI is perfect, but something feels like it's missing. There's almost [i]too much[/i] polish, I feel like I'm on rails while playing, and too many games come down to pure chance while the strategy feels as complete as it's going to get.\n\nI'll jump straight into Hex then:\nPros:[list]\n[*]Tons of cards. Plenty of room for expansion. They don't appear to be afraid of the balance question, which is a false dichotomy anyway when you can just bring in new content - something Wizards understood with MtG and yes, cashed in on. But the real draw to this is you can build strategies on woobie cards people don't use and don't expect.\n[*]Campaign mode is fun. The advantages the AI get are tough sometimes, but never impossible with the right deck. The bonuses your character can get feel like substantial bonuses without being game-breaking (well, except maybe for Ranger, hehe)\n[*]Games can last long enough to work in everything from epic stall strategies to 3-4 turn blitzes. As far as I can see, you will never have a 1-turn win. Maybe that will change as I gain access to more powerful cards.\n[*]The art is varied and impressive, and gives each faction and race a lot of character. I wouldn't say all of it is fantastic, but overall it's never distracting nor flat ugly.\n[/list]\nCons:[list]\n[*]Mandatory, [i]excruciatingly[/i] slow tutorial mission. Why? [b]WHY?[/b] HEX, for gods sake, look at the negative reviews you're getting, look at the number of hour(s) they've played, and put two and two together. If they never get past your tutorial - and really, the game explains itself as you play - maybe you should [i]remove the tutorial[/i]. Have it something people can come back to. I nearly didn't.\n[*]AI needs work. Eternal impressed here, this does not. It makes up for its faults by using interesting per-encounter abilities, but there were a few cases where I almost facepalmed at the opponent basically giving me the game by killing a troop I had in play for that purpose.\n[*]UI is slow and clunky. This was the worst part for me - turns not completing when no one has anything to do, animations playing for too long, every single match opening with that annoying 30-second coin flip. No clear way to cancel targetting or using a card, and sometimes this appears to be different per card. Providing some options to shorten these transitions and cut out some of the glitter would be nice.\n[/list]\nAll that said, Hex is probably something I'm going to be playing for as long as it's alive. It scratches the itch of MtG without the crap that Wizards tried to hoist on older PC gamers.
