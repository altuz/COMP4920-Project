{"reviews": [{"review": "Morphine had an interesting idea which was executed more than sub par. While it does at times give off a mild Donnie Darko vibe, it's mainly due to the stolen theme of an insae reappearing rabbit. The few jumscares this has aren't worth the horror title and the story outline is pretty basic at best.\n\nI am aware this is a one man project and a Turkish game, but the translation wasn't proofread and some of the English wording is cringe-worthy. Playing it in its native language, the writing is a lot better, but the general public cannot be expected to actually know how to read Turkish, so it remains a negative point.\n\nThe only redeeming feature is the actual topic of the story, yet the presentation is sadly completely unable to make it possible to receive the game seriously.\n\nEven at 3$, this is no recommendation due to cringeworthy translation, cringeworthy animations, very basic presentation and a rather short experience of 2 hours maximum for a playthrough. (Accidentally forgot the tab open over night)\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504767397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 576, "num_reviews": 753, "steamid": "76561197969749884", "num_games_owned": 1384}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "timestamp_updated": 1504767921, "recommendationid": "34789556", "timestamp_created": 1504767921}, {"review": "So, this \"game\" is absolutely awfull.\n\nBasically, the execution is so poor, and storyline and gameplay so lame that it is even painfull to go through.\nYou are following the life of a nerd, shy and insecure student rejected by everybody, including his parents.
