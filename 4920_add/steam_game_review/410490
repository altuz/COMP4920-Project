{"reviews": [{"review": "I'll keep this simple.\n\n-The game is cheap.\n-The gameplay is cheap.\n-Currently level 7, the whole time i've just held down left click and used my skills maybe 4 times in total. \n-Double clicking makes you roll/dodge which consumes a tiny bit of mana so don't spam click.\n-The quests starting out are too simple. Like most MMOs you are to kill X amount of this and return.\n-There is no open world, there might be later on? Each map/stage you click to join and offers maybe 5 minutes of simple game play till you get to the end and teleport to town or the next map.\n-After you complete the simple maps you can be prompted to buy ingame items to make yourself stronger for $4.99, I clicked buy to see what happens and it tells me \"This is not available in beta\"\n-There is ingame currency gold, crystals and gems, each you can spend real money to obtain or very slowly by playing of course.\n\nI don't expect the game to get much better.

The combat is basically managing your groups health bars with potions and drops from killing mobs along with using scrolls. I saw that because the character will auto-attack anything near you regardless of whether you press any buttons leaving very little thoght except when to use your special abilities. I attempted the multiplayer part but did not get very far and there were not many people on to play with. The single player objectives are easy, kill as much as you can to progress. \n\nThe reason I am saying no to this game is very simple. At every turn I had something in my face telling me to by items from their cash shop. \"Special item x in sale for only $4.99!\" 'Get item y now down to $2.99 today only!\" Many games have cash shops, which is fine. However this game throws it in your face every chance it gets. \n\nThe game is simply not good enoughm not entertaining enough for me to justify the full force in your face cash shop this games uses.\n\nGameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH6aFPzSFvk\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1450753800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 51, "num_reviews": 26, "steamid": "76561198101867598", "num_games_owned": 1305}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517087", "timestamp_updated": 1450783337, "recommendationid": "19840929", "timestamp_created": 1450783337}, {"review": "This game is okay so far, but it is definately feels like a Mobile port with MANY different IAP's available, so it's not a game you really want a young child to play unless they know NOT to make IAP's!  Some of the IAP's are very pricey and they're everywhere in the game!!!  I didn't see a feature to turn them off.  \n\nYou need gems and in game currency to purchase weapons, gear and anything else, but you don't need to purchase these with real money if you want to grind maps.  I haven't played long enough to see how much of a grind, but it is a grindy game.\n\nThis is a very casual game for very casual gamers.  You move around, but don't really fight.  The characters fight on their own, but you do need to dodge, use potions, scrolls and skills.  The battles are real-time and there is also a dodge feature that works well.  It's a very simple game to play and looks like it is for children, but adults can enjoy it also.\n\nThis isn't really a review.  I am just warning people that there are IAP's, because it looks like a great game for young kids.  Just be warned they can run up a bill if you don't watch them! lol \n\nI am not sure that I recommend this game.  I'm on the fence so far.  For sure it's ONLY for casual gamers and kids that know NOT to make IAP's! lol\n\nThe game runs silky smooth for me on the highest resolution and the highest graphics settings.\n\nHardware Overview: \n\nModel Name:  MacBookPro 11,5 (Mid 2015)\nProcessor Name:  Intel Core i7\nProcessor Speed:  2.8 GHz\nNumber of Processors:  1\nTotal Number of Cores:  4\nL2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB\nL3 Cache:  6 MB\nMemory:  16 GB Type:  DDR3  Speed:  1600 MHz\nVideo Card:  AMD Radeon R9 M370X, VRAM 2048 MB\n\nOperating System: OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 (64 bit OS)", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1497654916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 38, "num_reviews": 119, "steamid": "76561198073648775", "num_games_owned": 790}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496454", "timestamp_updated": 1497592871, "recommendationid": "32451490", "timestamp_created": 1497557517}, {"review": "Elements", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1460257877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1044, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198289187090", "num_games_owned": 1}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476636", "timestamp_updated": 1457806478, "recommendationid": "21795562", "timestamp_created": 1457806478}, {"review": "I feel like this game belongs on some sort of mobile platform.\nThe controls kinda suck, I'd rather double click to move, and it just makes me roll and waste mp, the game auto attacks literally everything for you, and if you try to counter it, it's just a pain in the ass and not worth.\nNeeds some control fixes, maybe a less retarded tutorial too, only part of it that's truly useful is the chest where it tells you how/where to equip stuff. \nWouldn't reccomend the game in its current state, or maybe even ever..\n\nThink about moving it to a phone platform, maybe it'll make it there.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1497744578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 17, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198045833400", "num_games_owned": 138}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1497744709, "recommendationid": "32521902", "timestamp_created": 1497744709}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 5, "total_reviews": 5, "review_score_desc": "5 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
