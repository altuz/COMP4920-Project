It's got a terribly clunky UI, the pacing is all over the place and at its heart it's basically a badly-obsolete old-school flight sim that takes for...ev...er to get anything done in.  (The tutorial mission involves doing two points of damage per laser shot against a capital ship with ~1200 or so shields; given that even skilled runs can take a full minute to pull off and you'll only get 5-10 shots per run, well, you do the math.)", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1462409754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 24, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561197977345078", "num_games_owned": 1113}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503174", "timestamp_updated": 1462410348, "recommendationid": "22803451", "timestamp_created": 1462410348}, {"review": "I applaud the reissue of old games by Retroism and Nightdive Studios, I will probably continue to buy them (but probably only on sale) because when the games originally came out I couldn't afford the $40 to $60 price tag back in 1993 and I would like a shot now at them.
