{"reviews": [{"review": "This game sucks.  You navigate through the menu and aim at enemies using your head.  If you need to move where you're sitting due to tracking issues, you end up sitting outside of your space ship, and there's no way to rest the seated position.  It specifically says it requires gamepad or keyboard and mouse, but gives instructions as if you're using the Vive controllers.  That's on top of the fact that it's just another POS wave shooter that makes everything further than 15 feet away look like a flat backdrop.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504483542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 12, "num_reviews": 37, "steamid": "76561197989285779", "num_games_owned": 80}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505662", "timestamp_updated": 1504483782, "recommendationid": "34724336", "timestamp_created": 1504483782}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 62, "review_score": 6, "total_negative": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 83, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive"}, "success": 1}
