I'm not gonna point out the details that I already did in the review in the First Encounter, you can check them out if your interested. I'm gonna point out what it adds thats good and bad.\n\nThe Good: More Weapons. We have a Chainsaw, a Flamethrower, and Sniper Rifle. In most fps games these days, segments with sniper rifles are slow, waiting for the right moment and angle to shoot 1 target. But in this game, you get your sniper, you zoom in on far away enemies and shoot them as fast as you can, and still moving, making the sniper rifle enjoyable.\n\nThe bad: The Boss is kind of weak.\n\nGood game, i'd reccomend it."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501250939, "weighted_vote_score": "0.232080", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "33856597", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198008303595", "num_reviews": 405, "last_played": 1501338878, "num_games_owned": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1627}, "timestamp_updated": 1501250939, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Though the achievement is not entirely revolutionary, it continues to be an impressive title in its own right like the symbiotic relationship between The Godfather and its second part."}]}
