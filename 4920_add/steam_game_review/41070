I once played co-op for 2 hours with a friend where 90% of the time was spent A) tring to figure out where to go; B) where each other went so we could re-join and push ahead.  We quit in frustration.\n\nI played this in Single Player mode to completion before the unfortunate split-screen co-op experience, and even then my complaint is the same.  Uninspired, boring maps that go on forever and look identical everywhere you go.  I did finish it, but even on my happiest day I would give this a 60% at best, and that's from somebody that has played and completed every game in the series on Serious difficulty."}]}
