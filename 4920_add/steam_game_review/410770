{"reviews": [{"review": "I really like this game, it's a good time management.\n\nIf you don't know the genre, it's a kind of solo RTS, where you are only building (no fighting involved).\nEverything happens on the same screen, so you can focus on the best decision, such as using your ressources for the good building.\n\nIf you know the genre, it's a resources consuming game: you have to put all your resources (stone and food) to build a big road across the screen. There is no multi click (something I didn't like at first), but the game offers you gradually more and more villagers and you will be soon 100% loaded with all the tasks.\n\nSomething rare, the story is nice. It's short (a few panels every 10 levels), but it is surprisingly effective.\n\nI got all levels on the expert rating, and I can say that the level design and the difficulty are well done. In the last levels, I had to use all the tricks I learned previously.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1445790453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1737, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198054157182", "num_games_owned": 423}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492124", "timestamp_updated": 1445803809, "recommendationid": "18684274", "timestamp_created": 1445803809}, {"review": "Fun game, not a big title and you can't compare it to other games but it does suck you in.
