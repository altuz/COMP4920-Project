{"reviews": [{"review": "Starward Rogue's truly an excellent game.\n\nYou might want to add \"- wars\" in your research while looking for gameplay on Youtube, though, else all you're getting is Star Wars : Rogue trailers.\n\nIt's a really polished gem, that wonderfully mixes up the rogue-like genre, that everybody seems to know and unconditionally love (Thanks, Isaac ?), and the niche-targetting, fantastic but unfriendly Bullet hell genre (get outta here, Isaac.)\n\nMechs are usually a turn-off for me, but there's clearly enough variety and vivid colors to make me love the artistic direction. I've got to mention the soundtrack, though. I guess it's some kind of ambient trance or something (I'm not very good with names), and even though it felt weird in the beginning, it actually fits the action quite well. Alas, there are very few tracks, which to me is the only downside of this game.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's really refined. The game has an excellent progression curve (even though you'd better get familiar with danmakus if you weren't in the first place.) There's lots of enemies, which all come with cool, inventive patterns, and the rogue-likey character customization gets pretty relevant here. No doubt the devs were shmup addicts who wanted to give the genre some fresh air by getting rid of scoring and linear progression and adding lots of new features, and the result is lovely.\n\nFinally, the bosses really are badasses, and the fights are accordingly rewarding. Getting to the end of the game is going to be tons of pain, so be prepared. Regular not-so-hardcore players should be able to get to the end of floor 5, though, and I think for 12$, Starward Rogue's definitely worth the shot. Just don't inflict that to your family and friends if you're the yeller type, of course. :)", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505725389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1390, "num_reviews": 19, "steamid": "76561198173899526", "num_games_owned": 280}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509378", "timestamp_updated": 1505718830, "recommendationid": "35040526", "timestamp_created": 1505718830}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 163, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 168, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
