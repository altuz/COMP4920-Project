{"reviews": [{"review": "Absolutely stellar game. Best I have had the pleasure to review in a while. \n\nUnlike a couple other recent releases that branded themselves as Tycoons (but were actually more structured games) Rock God Tycoon leaves the majority of choices up to you and gives you the freedom a management sim is supposed to. The goals are simple... Make it big and don't go broke trying. How you go about doing that is left up to you. It is by my definition a game worthy of the \"Tycoon\" in the title. Those of us old enough to remember Dino Park know what I'm talking about.\n\nVisuals and Sound are great, and the game itself is quite a bit of fun and very addicting. There also seems to be lots of room for growth and I expect nothing but good things given what I've seen so far. If you do what I did and put in 15 hours the first 2 days after purchase, you will notice the music start repeating, but you won't mind. Big fan of the character customization and the little things like the way they all sway in time to the soundtrack. \n\nAs for their coding/interface all I can say is wow. I know there are only two devs but this is superhuman. Easy to jump right in and start playing.... Not a single bad thing to say about the way the game runs. No gamebreaking or glaring bugs to speak of. Bit of work to do with some of the place names on the map, but it really is fine as is. (Some have generic names)\n\nGame itself? Depending on your skill level you may think it needs balancing or you may think it's right on the money. I found myself creating challenges for myself like having my first album be only 50%+ rehearsed instead of the lower amounts required by labels. It is very immersive to the point where you'll have fond memories of how hard it was to release your first LP... or how good it felt to fire that ego maniac vocalist. Plus the game cuts out the things that aren't as much fun about a rock band like waiting in line to use a copier to make flyers or expensive rights lawsuits when you lose a bandmember. \n\nOverall I whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good Tycoon game and anyone that enjoys rock/metal. I will be keeping an eye on the devs future work and shortlisting it for review... they really know how to make a game. Now I have to look at Project Explore too.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506820511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 824, "playtime_forever": 2763, "num_reviews": 45, "steamid": "76561198008948975", "num_games_owned": 179}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504607", "timestamp_updated": 1505947550, "recommendationid": "35093083", "timestamp_created": 1505946244}, {"review": "This game is about being the leader of a rock band in its rags to riches odyssey. So, as such, there\u2019s no tycoon to be found. \n\nAs a tycoon you would be supposed to, I guess, scout bands, give them record deals, improve them, send them to rehab,  manage them, deal with agents, balance studio and tour time. This game has nothing tycoon-y about it. \nYou hire/fire your bandmates, select venue locations, write songs, eventually sign record deals, gain access to bigger venues. \n\nThe Cons\n-\tGameplay is quite repetitive as you grind your way to the top\n-\tFlavour events are sparse and quite pointless\n-\tBand members\u2019 customization is limited to their appearance\n-\tTalent is meaningless, everyone can become the next Hendrix just by \u201cbusking\u201d in the streets for a couple of years\n-\tNo matter how many records you sell, your band will never get out of the bar circuit. At most you can play 1.500 capacity. Forget arenas. \n-\tBand members have no personality, they are all clones, with, at most, one or two traits and perks each, this leads to zero replay value as there is no RPG component to be found: there is absolutely no interaction between them\n-\tThere\u2019s a clear lack of focus and direction. A simulation? What\u2019s with the Guitar Hero style mini-game? Or the song composition?\n\nThe games is missing some key components that would make it more fun and more meaningful:\n-\tSome kind of interaction between band members\n-\tSome story element in your rise to fame and success \n-\tOther elements that play a key role in bands\u2019 success and failure. Label representatives, managers, agents, tour managers, critics, groupies, wives, broken vans, stolen equipment, rival bands, the list could go on for a while\n-\tLess of the grind. While it is an element of realism, it really detracts from the gameplay: you should be able to go on a tour, select a setlist a go on with that rather than booking each venue day by day and rebuild the setlist at each location.\n\n\nThe Pros\n-\tThe game has its moments and in a way it makes you want your pixel band to succeed\n-\tFrom what I understand it\u2019s the work of a team of two very responsive devs\n-\tIt\u2019s right priced\n-\tThe graphics, while minimal, are functional\n-\tThe UI is well laid out\n-\tNo bug breaking issues\n\nOverall one would ask why I recommend the game despite the fact that my list of cons is much longer than the redeem elements? Well, because of its potential. I consider it as an almost empty canvass the devs should build upon. They get the atmosphere right. They get what rock is about.\n\nI suggest them to go check 2001 Rock Manager by DreamCatcher Interactive which is now I believe free to download for some juicy ideas.\n\nOverall: 6 devil horns out 10 and I want to see more of it.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506090221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 617, "playtime_forever": 2531, "num_reviews": 45, "steamid": "76561198040669155", "num_games_owned": 115}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502538", "timestamp_updated": 1505818344, "recommendationid": "35062060", "timestamp_created": 1505818344}, {"review": "I am addicted", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506322011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 338, "playtime_forever": 385, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198156517793", "num_games_owned": 30}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500086", "timestamp_updated": 1506590413, "recommendationid": "35257950", "timestamp_created": 1506590413}, {"review": "I really like this game.
