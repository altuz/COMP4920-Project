{"reviews": [{"review": "A pretty dang good musou.\n\nProbably only really recommended for big DQ fans, though. Lots of great fanservice, some aspects of gameplay are a little lacking. Particularly mission objectives. There is less of a flow to battles than in other games.\n\nReally beautiful, though. And the combat is nice and varied between the different characters, who you can switch between at will during fights.\n\nKind of a frustrating waste of potential, in some ways.
