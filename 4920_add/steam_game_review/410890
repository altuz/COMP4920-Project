{"reviews": [{"review": "Chapter 2 kept to the high standard that chapter 1 set, if not raising the standard altogether.\n\n[b]Please note that this is the second chapter of a series, play through chapter 1 before this,[/b]\n\n[h1]What is it?[/h1]\nHigurashi when they cry is a sound novel series. The games use sound effects, images, and appropriate music to generate an atmosphere for the story. This is done much better than the last game (Yse, I know it seems almost impossible) as they have added more music that really helps to get you immersed (Cheesy though this may sound). The key characters have sprites to help you get a better idea of their appearance, and their current mood. Images tend to be scenes so you can get the idea of where the character(s) is(are).\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nLike the last chapter this game has a brilliant story, however does not directly follow up from the last chapter, it is set over the same few days where a different chain of events occur instead.\n\nThe story could be described as an emotional joyride for what kind of emotions your character feels (And that what it wants you too feel too) The character you play expresses himself in a manner of ways of goes through happiness, sorrow, hope, despair, regret, fear, feeling sympathetic towards the culprit, and what is almost love. (Though not in that order)\n\nYour character is still new to hinamizawa, however you have the knowledge of events from past chapters to take a different standpoint on events. After breaking a taboo of the village, people start to go missing, all of which had some connection to the chain of events leading up to your breaing of said taboo. Your character wants to find out what is happening, and, if possible, put a stop to it before anyone else you care about gets hurt.\n\nAs said once before the idea of this game is to put you in the character's shoes, throughout the main story you shall see what he sees, hear what he hears, know what he thinks, and (dependant on your immersion) feel what he feels.\nThe optional tips give you (The player) to learn more about the situation than your character.\n[b]NOTE: This game follows a set path, there are no choices to be made.[/b]\n\n[h1]Cost[/h1]\nFor the experiance, I'd say this game is definately worth the cost (Much like the last game.) The playtime at the time I posted this was around 16.7 hours. So in my books, chapter 2 is worth the cost as much as chapter 1 was.\n\n[h1]After Party[/h1]\nAfter you have completed the game, you unlock the \"After Party\". This is also titled as the \"All cast review session\". In it, the characters break down the 4th wall and share their opinions on the game, and their theories behind the inccidents, also discussing what the beta players thought. (A surprisingly nice way to end the game, as it somewhat doubles up as a brief recap.) It also makes some hints at preperations for the third chapter (For which I also have high expectations for.)\n\nThis game, as said above, was great. I just fell into the world they were trying to portray, even after seeing the anime, some elements of the game surprised me. (There are differences between the anime and games.)\n\nWhy are you still reading this?
