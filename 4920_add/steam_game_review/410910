You're working to arrange a water supply for your city, or rather the city your law firm is situated in, to keep it from drying out. However, this might only be done at the cost of the lives and prosperity of surrounding villages and communities. Not to mention the scorpion demons running around...\n\nThe game felt less personal and more political to me, as you suddenly have the ability to decide on the fate of a large community of people (all while either not trying to anger your bosses OR deliberately work against them). It's a big mess of groups of people with different angles and motivations working against each other, and you're caught in the middle. At times, I didn't really know which choices to pick, and which choices would land my character their preferable ending.\n\n[i]Deathless: The City's Thirst[/i] also expands on the world and the setting, but that didn't necessarily make it easier for me to follow. There is a lot of information and a lot of new terms, and I only realised afterward that the [i]Deathless[/i] games are actually part of an existing universe which is part of a book series by Max Gladstone!

Don't get me wrong--I actually really enjoyed this game. But damn. I was not prepared to make some of those choices. Would you rather save your city from a drought at the price of displacing a whole farming community or see prices sky-rocket causeing economic destruction to defend the land-rights of a small village? Even if the choice is easy at first, characters will spend the game guilting you and telling you how wrong you are. Unless you adapt a pure evil attitude, the decisions you make will not come easily. The game does well with giving situations that are not black and white, but rather have both rewards and consequences. The plot and characters are interesting; you are sometimes thrust into relationships and sometimes have them grow slowly. Your integity is constantly tested, and it seems impossible to remain humble.\n\nNow I do have a few qualms with the game-- the story doesn't always flows easy, certain situations feel disjointed and take you a while to understand because you didn't choose the opption that gave a thourough explaination. The politics of this fictional society can be outright confusing, and the game won't always spell it out--so occationally you make choices based on what you *think* is happening, simply because you don't quite understand. Despite this, I still enjoyed the story. The second problem I have is that the stat system seems rather pointless--perhaps you see more benefit with it with multiple play-throughs, but otherwise it doesn't seem to do much. \n\nAll in all, I think its fun.
