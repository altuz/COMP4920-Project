{"reviews": [{"review": "Over 20 years later and this is still one of the best games ever made. Microprose invented, refined, and with this game perfected the 4X genre.\n\nJust as no fantasy 4X game has yet to be better than Master of Magic, no space based 4X has managed to top Master of Orion 2. Not even its own sequel or the new reboot. GalCiv 1-3 are good games, but not good enough. Stellaris has that excellent Paradox style diplomacy and role playing aspects with the policies and edicts, but lacks even more than GalCiv does in the space combat.\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1496678623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1440, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198055362132", "num_games_owned": 666}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520458", "timestamp_updated": 1499740455, "recommendationid": "33446052", "timestamp_created": 1499740455}, {"review": "Still one of my favorite games.
