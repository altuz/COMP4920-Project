It takes away any stress from me.\nAlso it has a lot of gameplay details:\n- your tail can got fire;\n- shields crashes into pieces;\n- breaking and flying away weapons;\n- bombs making madness on a screen;\n- enemies praying for mercy;\n- kills couner consider beasts, machines or people\n- epic swords, fortune suprises, a lot of weapons (check my artwork, I spent a lot of time in PHOTOSHOP to show it all and I onw it all);\n- interesting plot and two endings;\n- throwing and catching bolts, bombs, weapons;\n- grat music and art.\n\nThis game is so underrated and it definitely needs a sequel. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=923613625"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1495479356, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509360", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31906063", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198100896695", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1497220083, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1320}, "timestamp_updated": 1505251330, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Hammerfight is probably the best physics based fighting game you'll ever come across.\n\nIn Hammerfight, you play as a pilot operating this strange barrel/helicopter hybrid that uses maces, hammers, swords, axes, and even guns to fight other barrel/helicopters, monsters, and machines. The story is really text heavy, so I chose to ignore it, but the gameplay is excellent. Using only your mouse, you use the movements of your mouse to pilot the machine, and you swing your weapon through the momentum of your character. This is the epitemy of \"easy to control, hard to master\", and it takes a long while to get used to the controls, but it is extremely satisfying to be able to smash a bad guy across the map and have him explode when he hits a wall. There's also these \"Song Stones\" you can augment your weapons with, which gives you an edge in battle. These song stones range from turning etherial to avoid damage to freezing enemies with your blows and shattering their weapons and armor.\n\nThis game has amazing physics, despite having few bugs, and is an absolute blast to play once you get past the difficulty curve."}]}
