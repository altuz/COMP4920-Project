{"reviews": [{"review": "The \"Sorcery!\" series (from 1 to 4) is amazing. I read the books 15 years ago and I was curious to see how they transposed it into a computer game. Well, I was greatly impressed, Inkle did many things right, much better than what Tin Man Games did with the Fighting Fantasy series (which are very straightforward ports of the books).\n\nI love the idea of turning the books partially into a board game, it makes the progression very clear, which is an advantage compared to the books and a good reason to make it a computer game.\n\nOverall it was a great experience and I'm looking forward to playing more gamebooks like this!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1476311039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1342, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198020616562", "num_games_owned": 374}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "timestamp_updated": 1505836044, "recommendationid": "35067027", "timestamp_created": 1505836044}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 109, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 126, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
