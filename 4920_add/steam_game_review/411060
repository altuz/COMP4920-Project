{"reviews": [{"review": "This might look kinda cheap, but this game is surprisingly fun and introduces you to the mechanics very well. It's similar to Farm Frenzy in a few ways, and the sound reminds me a bit of Populous 3. Overall cute, relaxing, satisfying, and worth the few quid I spent on it. If there is a downside it's mainly the aspect ratio, and I don't think the maps get any bigger as you go along. 3.5/5", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1447519508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 492, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197989054357", "num_games_owned": 323}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502841", "timestamp_updated": 1447345794, "recommendationid": "19035043", "timestamp_created": 1447345794}, {"review": "Having playing this online. I thought I would buy the full version and its a simple game to play. You have to build a roman path within a time limite to open up the next level. But also you have to do tasks such as feed your workers, gather wood to build the path and bridges as well as fulfil side tasks to fulfil the requirements of the level. The game is easy at first that is intentional to get you settled into playing the game. Then it becomes more challenging as you unlock harder levels in the game.

I suppose you are reading this review after playing Roads of Rome 1. If not, you can start by the first game, as every one of them has completely different sets of levels.\n\n[h1]Level Design[/h1]\nStairs and ropes are used to better exploit the relief of the map. Just look at the screenshots to get an idea: levels generally gives the feel that they are more complex, with far away areas harder to reach (so more rewarding in a sense).\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nSome animations have been improved. By example, the roads are now built in several steps, so it's nicer to watch.\nYes, in terms of assets, the game is very close to the first one, but the efforts put in the level design (especially the will to put more relief) show that the devs work on the game to make it look better.\n\n[h1]Resources consumption[/h1]\nThe first game was asking you to put a ton of resources in rocks on the road. On the contrary, this game asks you to sink your resources into a single \"obstacle\", one (or several) barbarians standing somewhere on the map.\nIt helps to lighten the obstacles use, by using them only when necessary. Besides, the barbarian requirements vary a lot and are designed to fit each level, so resources needed per level are better controlled.\n\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nThis second game is close to the first one, with welcomed improvements.\nIf you liked Roads of Rome 1, you should definitively buy Roads of Rome 2.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1451351797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 501, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198054157182", "num_games_owned": 423}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503370", "timestamp_updated": 1452086450, "recommendationid": "20349958", "timestamp_created": 1452086425}, {"review": "Quite a fun casual game.
