{"reviews": [{"review": "This game had a lot of potential and I believed in it. However, since its very launch, the developer keeps promising a very much needed update and he never delivers.\n\nCool as the concept may be, the game is basically unfinished, with very basic functions still lacking and a gameplay that seems just a proof of concept but doesn't really go anywhere. \n\nIf you look at the message board, you will see that for more than a year, everytime there is a sale or some other event, the developer will come back and promise that this time the update is coming for real, but then he just forgets about it. Or some times he wants us to support his new game. One time, in order to get people to finance his new kickstarter, he even told us that multiplayer was in the works and we could betatest it.\n\nI used to think that the developer had just made the mistake of overpromising, and was now desperately looking for a way of making everyone happy with the obvious limitations of a one-man team.
