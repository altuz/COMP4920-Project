This is not the same game as first. Let me elaborate:\n\n1. This is not a continuation of Oliver's story. Atleast for now it is not. Although familiar characters may appear in Cargo (and i'm most certain that they will, atleast those who stayed in the city after events of TLDD) this story is quite different, with different character cast. Different atmposhpere too.\n\n2. Mechanics of the game is different too, it is no longer visual novel with \"adventure elements\", but rather vn with action elements. At some points of the story you gain direct control of your character that must shoot/slash in order to defeat his enemies. There are also \"dungeons\" where you should solve puzzles/ deal with traps from first-person perspective. To be honest, action-direct control elements feels very clumsy for now. I wish they just keep mechanics from the first game but... oh well.\n\n3. Art style. You can see for yourself on screenshots, feels much more darker, tense, sinister (so is the game atmosphere btw) that \"light\" style of first game. I kinda like it.\n\n\nAs for game state for now:\n\nIts in EA. The store page says that 3 chapters are avalable for now, with planned weekly updates (\"Routes\" - small branches from main story that let you see the plot in different ways, \"dungeons\" - i guess that is action elements/puzzles, and continuation of main story). Developers plan to increase game price with each update so it might be a good idea to buy the game now if you are dead set on it. But only if you want to support ongoing development.\n\nIn the current state of the game there are only three very-very small chapters, like 7-10 min each, with not much of story or gameplay. It feels even less than demo-version tbh. Although i \"recommend\" the game, it is more like future recomendation, for now i would advice to buy this only if you are vivid fan of the first game and want to support development of the sequel. I'll update rewiew as more updates will be available.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1468921757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 103, "num_reviews": 44, "steamid": "76561198051658653", "num_games_owned": 892}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524437", "timestamp_updated": 1468323718, "recommendationid": "24272572", "timestamp_created": 1468322938}, {"review": "Leviathan the Cargo is a very interesting game, and takes a shift in style fairly dramatically from the Last Day of the Decade. They got in a new artist and the art is gorgeous for the characters in this. The story isn't yet finished, but I feel that Lostwood games does very interesting and morally grey characters very well. As this is an early release, you can't expect it to be just perfect yet for some parts, and you'll see a few dialogue issues that I'm sure will be resolved (nothing game breaking) - if you can look past them, then this is setting up for an intruiging plot. All that has been released so far is a build up to the rest of the story - a hook. I feel that if you've played Last Day of the Decade, you may be interested in seeing where the story goes. If you haven't then you should because it's great, and then play this as well. ^u^ If you buy it early you can get the updates for free later as well so get it while it's hot. :)", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1468176392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198179619219", "num_games_owned": 41}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508026", "timestamp_updated": 1468178924, "recommendationid": "24238593", "timestamp_created": 1468178924}, {"review": "God!
