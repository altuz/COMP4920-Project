{"reviews": [{"review": "I owned this game on disc since about the time of its release. Great game and after Nordic updated the graphics to more recent resolution it is fun to play again. Thank You Nordic Games for making another game awesome again!! Story and feel of the game keep me playing it. I especially like the middle campaign (British) cause its in the desert. Game is mostly tank based and they look good! Cut scenes and opening scenes work in windows 10. Opening scenes still dont play on windows 7, Nordic devs would love it if you would get them working too! I would recommend this game and would suggest buying the package on steam sale which you get all 3 games.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505079014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 630, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561197987324453", "num_games_owned": 70}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1500332650, "recommendationid": "33618199", "timestamp_created": 1500332650}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 12, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
