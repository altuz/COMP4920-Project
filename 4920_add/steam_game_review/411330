MoV has the same feel and graphics. There are some differences, but by and large, the gamplay feels the same. The health system is different (there are no medics, but plenty of canteens and medical kits available). \n\nFrom crouching balls deep in a swamp at night to crossing a bullet swept street in Hue, this game covers it all. You will watch your buddies die in front of you. You will burn a village (but the media makes you look bad for doing it). You will have to kill. You will look into the depths of hell and keep moving. You will die in this game, and your parents will receive a letter from your commanding officer about how you went out (while it is not instant death and back playing, there is some time in-between, but not much). You will come to love this game.\n\nAiming is clunky. You cannot move while ADS, but you can lean. This allows you to peak around cover. I saw a few complaints that bullets come from random places in the tree line. That is true, but hit the deck and you'll be ok. Find cover as well. If bullets are flying in from nowhere, there is probably an enemy hanging around that you need to kill. Kill them, and the firing will stop. Enemy do spawn out of the jungle. But shocker, the screaming yellow bastards appear from out of nowhere, just like real life. \n\nDo you job, keep your head down, and don't try to be Rambo. Work with your squad and listen to them. They may not be good shots, but they know when something might happen, and they know where to run when Charlie get's you pinned. \n\nI cannot give this game a higher reccommendation. Best of luck!

The most agrivating part of this title is just poor level design and terrible AI. Nothing says fun like having random enemy spawns and then having that same enemy insta-kill you... on easy difficulty. Your AI squadmates like to run in front of you as you're firing and do nothing besides act as a bullet sponges (even worse than in most games). Ammo is scarse on some missions and abundent on others, with no real pattern or reasoning (you can take guns from the enemy, but the drop rate is oddly skewed). While I understand and like the emphasis on trying to replicate what fighting Vietnam was there needs to be a line drawn between that and playablity. There are entire missions where the player is forced to cross large empty fields with enemies surrounding them. Clearing villages doesn't fare any better as dozens of enemies will come pour out of one shack... even after you have pushed past it and your squadmates are standing out front. I did enjoy the story telling, when I could experience it, but it was a struggle to follow after continually replaying sections. If this game is cheap and you love 00's fps games then might as well try it but at $10 it is definately not worth it.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1502256659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 195, "num_reviews": 18, "steamid": "76561198012453526", "num_games_owned": 237}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486392", "timestamp_updated": 1502257957, "recommendationid": "34118609", "timestamp_created": 1502257957}, {"review": "Aside from the fact that this game is literally unplayable because of how majorly screwed the buttons are, its a good game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1502422560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 170, "num_reviews": 34, "steamid": "76561198169296924", "num_games_owned": 106}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499168", "timestamp_updated": 1502422598, "recommendationid": "34160324", "timestamp_created": 1502422598}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 52, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 23, "num_reviews": 5, "total_reviews": 75, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
