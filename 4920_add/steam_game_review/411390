{"reviews": [{"review": "The game is a remake of Getsuei Gakuen ergO, a doujin game released at the Comiket 81 in 2011 (the doujin version is available on DL Site). This is a PC port of the Vita version. \nI played the Vita version last year. The game takes place in a loop, on the day where the protagonist transfers to the school and the day ends on the night where the protagonist gets killed. He joins the student council and fight monsters called Hazard. The game doesn't have many dialogue choices and it has multiple endings. The game has battles but no gameplay. Music is excelent, the composer is Kenji Ito (he composed most of the music of the SaGa games).\nI recommend this game but it's not that great, it's just your average visual novel that's enjoyable. Just don't get it just because Sugita wrote the game. \nThe Steam version is the best version because of the extras: it has 2 artbooks (one of them is the artbook from the Vita Limited Edition) and a novel that was released a year before the Doujin game was released. The extras are also in japanese.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1447514413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198255078918", "num_games_owned": 41}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "4", "votes_down": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 69, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603737", "timestamp_updated": 1446664964, "recommendationid": "18879219", "timestamp_created": 1446664169}, {"review": "A darker game than I'd usually play but I was with it up until the godawful twist \"true\" ending", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1477235406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3955, "num_reviews": 35, "steamid": "76561197995167271", "num_games_owned": 1097}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490279", "timestamp_updated": 1480117259, "recommendationid": "27568167", "timestamp_created": 1480117259}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
