It isn't the best in the world, but I found it to be quite fitting.\n\nThis game managed to peak my interest by the unique setting, but I also discovered the mechanics of the game seem to follow in the primitive footsteps of Early Man. Following a decent, if not a bit frustrating first hour, problems began to arise that made trying to progress past chapter three a living nightmare. Trying to interact with characters and items can require three to five clicks to either activate the conversation or to pick up the items. This is once you manage to get close enough to them. \n\nQuests have an issue of updating properly, which was fixed as soon as I returned to the main menu and returned to the save. Enemies also have a strange issue of attacking you even if they are dead. The best example comes from the Mystic Wolf (killed to acquire its' pelt) remained targetable when I tried to grab the pelt and still did damage when I moved closer to grab the pelt (which took eight clicks). Bears also have the same issue, including the Great Bear needed for a special story quest that produced a terrible audio bug upon its' death. Regardless of where I went, the high pitch growling continued for a good ten minutes before I decided to just restart again. When I went back to kill him again (it respawned following my completion of the quest which I assume is intended) and did the same thing, except it ended after a minute or two.\n\nPrior to this, I managed to get stuck behind a NPC after talking to him about making a spear for a specific reason. I talked to him in an accessible space, only to then be teleported behind him once the conversation was complete. This happened twice and thankfully didn't on the third attempt. I somehow managed to get stuck between two rocks. The rocks disappear later as the story progresses, but at the time they were positioned to block access to another area. \n\nI am going to continue attempting to press forward with this title, but as of right now the combat feels unresponsive at times, glitches really impede patience, interacting is a major pain and the main interface is awkward. \n\nThis has been a EAW PSA.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1480621537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 126, "num_reviews": 87, "steamid": "76561198000561257", "num_games_owned": 2901}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499555", "timestamp_updated": 1480623536, "recommendationid": "28126198", "timestamp_created": 1480623147}, {"review": "State of Extinction. What can I say? I had high hopes for this game. While they weren't shattered, they have reached levels as obtainable as the max flying height of penguins, (spoiler alert: penguins dont fly).\nFirst, let me just say, that I can overlook a lot of bugs/issues that come with any alpha/beta game that is released regardless of its closed/open state.\nHavins said that, be aware that, like many alphas, betas, and even final releases, State of extinction does mave many bugs/issues. Clicking issues, which this game is very dependant upon mouse clicks, less keyboard imput, definitely exist.\nThe mini-map for me is a very big issue. Its a static map, but many times, while I am heading in, what I believe to be northeasterly direction, the mini-map shows me heading somewhere completely different. I could be more forgiving of this if the directions it said were opposite of where I could see myself going, unfortunately it didnt even seem that way. There is not even an indicator on the mini-map giving you a clue as to which way the mini-map believes is north. The good news is, the landscape doesnt change, so there is an option to turn off the mini-map, which I recommend given its current awful state.\nGraphics look like they were pulled from a freeware/shareware database. Forgivable, I suppose. But given how much more advanced we have become technologically since the 90's, I expected more/better. So to me, it seems lazy to go with half-assed graphics.\nWhile I can forgive lack-luster graphics and some bugs and/or issues, For me story line needs to be not just compelling, but strong. Initially, the storyline is compelling, but as you progress, you find a lot of filler, that doesnt really seem to lead to a better story so far. \nThe dialogue is the worst for me. Every audible dialogue is, \"blah blah blah, bblah bla, blah, blah, bla\". Seriously, the audio provided is some one mumbling, and not even kind of english. It is deliberately not intended to be comprehensible. They didnt even have the decency to try to make a pretend primitive language and have voice actors do their jobs. While this may have been done to save money, it almost completely destroys any chance for immersion.\nThe written dialogue isn't a whole lot better. Its almost as if they hired a screenwritter to write how primitive people would have talked, and he looked at native american tribes, and studied that half-assed, and then wrote with that limited knowledge. Sometimes its hard to even understand what they are trying to say because of the cryptic way they try to write. I fear that this will create a lot of issues with younger players who see what potential the game does have.\nMy last issue is with the quest log. Its very frustrating to be told, \"You need to go make something. To do that, you will need to get this and that. So you leave the game for whatever reason. You come back later, dont recall what you needed to gather, so you open you questlog, and bam! It tells you you need to make this item, but not what you need to gather.  At his time, and I dont know if this is planned to be included later or not, there is no way to remove a quest and restart it. See the potential issues?\nI personally couldn't recommend anyone purchase this game at this time. \nI will come back and play this game in a year, after there have been hopefully 10-15 updates to fix many of the issues, and, again hopefully, they will have used some of the money obtained by early backers to actually improve and fix the game from its current state.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1480969145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 58, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561197965928083", "num_games_owned": 105}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501878", "timestamp_updated": 1480972691, "recommendationid": "28209778", "timestamp_created": 1480972558}, {"review": "I'M A STEGOSAURUS", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1480518319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 9, "num_reviews": 53, "steamid": "76561198116746439", "num_games_owned": 1722}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 18, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457333", "timestamp_updated": 1480627904, "recommendationid": "28127551", "timestamp_created": 1480627904}, {"review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v86_zaQcAUI", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1480484038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 61, "num_reviews": 22, "steamid": "76561198339421398", "num_games_owned": 1}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "8", "votes_down": 90, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.341007", "timestamp_updated": 1480481157, "recommendationid": "28090696", "timestamp_created": 1480481157}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
