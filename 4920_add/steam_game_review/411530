{"reviews": [{"review": "Definitely the most difficult part of Roads of Rome. In this game we face the barbarian invasion and try to rebuild roman infrastructure. To rebuild anything we have to first stamp it out. To do this we will need new resource - water from pump station.\nIn this game we have 43 levels to complete. 40 basic plus 3 bonus levels for completing every level in expert time. Besides, we can play on diffrent difficulty levels (3 or 4 - don't remember ;p). There is some new buildings to construct plus all biuldings from earlier Roads of Rome.\nSome of maps are the same like in first Roads of Rome, but only a few.\nThere is a little story in the game, but you don't buy it for plot, do you? ;p\nIf you found previous parts of Roads of Rome cool, you would feel the same here.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1465983128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 458, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198051531591", "num_games_owned": 168}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497701", "timestamp_updated": 1466196961, "recommendationid": "23620703", "timestamp_created": 1466196860}, {"review": "Just like number 1 and 2 but with the added mayhem of babarians invading causing a lot of lovely chaos for us to fix:) Now it offers 4 different dificulties.
