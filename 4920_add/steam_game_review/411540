{"reviews": [{"review": "The game feels like a dog that just had its balls cut off. None of the weapons feel like they have any power. Your machine gun is a peashooter and your grenades and missiles are like a bag of crap hitting a window (it doesnt splat btw). The enemy death animations are also very disappointing, its some small effect and then they disappear. This feels like it was just another job for the devs, no passion what so ever in the game. The game does not satisfy me in anyway. I've had farts that felt more exciting than this game. Its 'meh' at best. If its on sale (like it is now 75%) you can give it a try but its still 5 euro wasted.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1499459820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 51, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561197990326326", "num_games_owned": 46}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523247", "timestamp_updated": 1499460294, "recommendationid": "33353741", "timestamp_created": 1499460294}, {"review": "I love most times Mechs appear in videogames and it takes a special kind of game to make them seem boring, frail, or lifeless, as this game does. The view on this game is so pulled back as well that it makes even admiring their designs or machinery difficult from a mech enthusiast's standpoint either. The game itself isn't heinously bad by any means -it's functional- but a lot of the effects, enemy, and player designs just look bland. Enemies may have screen-filling mortars that populate the screen that you have to dodge, but then they arrive with all the gusto of a wet fart. The player's own attacks (including an orbital laser) have very little punch to them and are depicted via simplistic effects as well, such as the laser gun ray hitting enemies quietly before they are vaporized when you hit them enough. \n\nI bought the DLC for this game as well as the base content hoping it would expand the game beyond it's seemingly thin initial content, but even with some extra characters I find myself not bothering to go through this game anytime soon. It might be more fun co-op with a friend who is also into militaristic / mech style games, but I only was able to play solo and it gets pretty boring with the overall polish of the game leaving a lot to be desired. None of the attacks or effects have much wow factor to them and it all just feels quite generic, making it hard to recommend even to fans of mechs and robots. I would only recommend this at a significant discount, and even then go into it with low, tempered expectations.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1500092017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 35, "num_reviews": 148, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "num_games_owned": 799}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505300", "timestamp_updated": 1502171111, "recommendationid": "34096404", "timestamp_created": 1502171111}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 20, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 31, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
