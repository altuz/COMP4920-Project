{"reviews": [{"review": "Rather dull time management game with poor level design. Everything's hidden by a fog of war and has to be gradually revealed, and the amount of resources needed for building and upgrading is arbitrary and unpredictable, so it's impossible to strategize beforehand. But it's also impossible to fail. There's no time limit, just high scores and gold times, but the map doesn't show at a glance which levels you've beaten the gold times for and which you've utterly failed, so you wouldn't know which ones to replay even if you wanted to.

I got it again.  for that person that says you can't fail because tehre is no time limit they obviously didn't play it on the right play level.
