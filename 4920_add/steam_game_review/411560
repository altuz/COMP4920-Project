And that would be about the end of it, but the game is SERIOUSLY BUGGED. There's an area in the second chapter that's, at least for me, impossible to pass. Supposedly the light emitted by the player should scare away some kind of creatures, but the creatures don't react to the light fast enogh, making each attempt a near instant failure. I guess I could try and force thought it, hoping for a lucky break... but I won't. I don't like this kind of frustrating gameplay.\n\nAs such, this game is getting a definite down-vote.
