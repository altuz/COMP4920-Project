{"reviews": [{"review": "For the full $8 price tag, I can't recommend this. I got it on sale for $2 and change and if that were the normal price I might recommend it. It's only a couple hours long and not all that worthwhile for those couple hours (This is an extended version?). For fun, let's first look at how I would rate the elements of the game:\n\nMusic >>>>>>>> Aesthetic >>> Puzzles >>> Story\n\nFor a point&click adventure, I expect puzzles and/or story to be at the top of that list. The puzzles here range from extremely simple to extremely obtuse and annoying. The mirror puzzle near the end also seems to be broken for me. They give you a hint but the hint didn't apply to the puzzle so I had no way to figure it out without looking it up in the guide. Some of the puzzles are decent fun but you'll remember the annoying ones more strongly. The story is also pretty non-existant. Girl goes to sleep, has a dream and the ending doesn't build up to anything or resolve anything. The game also bugs out sometimes. When that happens it's fairly easy to press Esc, save the game and then reload but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nAs for the good parts of the game, the aesthetic is quite nice, as you can tell from the screenshots. Everything is hand-drawn and even though it's not the most artistic looking game, it has a warm feel to it. The music is the highlight, though. I wouldn't mind obtaining the OST and listening to it while working. It's pretty high quality relaxation music. The best parts of this game were just standing around listening to the BGMs.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1498923784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 311, "num_reviews": 66, "steamid": "76561198053210555", "num_games_owned": 297}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503440", "timestamp_updated": 1498930676, "recommendationid": "33093333", "timestamp_created": 1498930676}, {"review": "The Rivers of Alice was a beautiful, meditative experience. The game was quite lot about the music, but I saw that as a strength, not a weakness. Some of the puzzles were waaay out of my patience and interest and also quite frustrating, but the others like the music ones (pure epicness) made it definately worth playing. The game was a bit too short, but I think I'll play it again in the future just for the atmosphere.
