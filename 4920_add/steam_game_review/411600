{"reviews": [{"review": "Cannot recommend due to the following reasons:\n1) AI and NPC are not really up to snuff, the guys on your ship rarely ever automatically manage their needs or get their jobs done leading to you having to micro managing them. Even when you micromanage the still can have problems doing the action you directly ordered them to do so.\n\n2) Early game is brutal. You will send out a lot of ships before you get one back. Save scrumming is the only way I got one back so I could start investing and improving things to the point where I did not have to save scrum to survive.\n\n3) Game appears to be abandoned. As of writing this review game has not recieved an update in 3 months. Normally this would be acceptable, however, the dev has not been seen in the same amount of time. It appears the discussion boards go unmonitored and we have no idea what progress is being made.\n\nGame has a really interesting concept and I would love for it to get more love, however, for now I would stay away until the developer shows they are able to be more communicative.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1491805746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 600, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561197972269258", "num_games_owned": 350}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1507096199, "recommendationid": "35463969", "timestamp_created": 1507096150}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 20, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 30, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
