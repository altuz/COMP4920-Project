The music all fits nicely, too.\n\nThe game feels like it's going to end really early, but actually it doesn't. I wasn't timing how long it took me to complete, but for the price it was a decent length.\n\nThe puzzles are solid. They're all fair, but also imaginative, not just of the 'use key on lock' variety (well, except for one, which the game itself makes fun of). I got stuck for quite a while on a couple, but only once needed a hint (and, in hindsight, even that puzzle was one I should have figured out on my own).\n\nOne really nice feature is the moving camera, which follows the player character around smoothly and zooms in and out at times. By default it also wobbles around even when you're standing still, which made me queasy, but you can turn this off in the settings.\n\nI completed the game with one of the inventory items still left unused, which could mean there are multiple solutions to some puzzles, although I haven't tested this.\n\nLastly, whenever I read reviews of adventure games, I wish I knew what kind of games the reviewer liked, so that I could decide whether or not to trust his or her judgement. I have always loved the classic LucasArts adventures like Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island and Sam & Max: Hit The Road.
