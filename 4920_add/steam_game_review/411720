{"reviews": [{"review": "There're two teams: Anti-Virus and Rogue Programs.\n\nThe Anti-Virus must tag all the programs before time runs out. Each team has multiple classes to choose from, each with 4 unique abilities such as lasers, missiles, warp fields, mines, and turrets. Overall this is a visually stunning game with amazing gameplay. \n\nIt does need some balance tweaks though. And make sure you have a friend or two to play it with, because there aren't usually online games up. \n\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 9/10\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1455002690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 407, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198011144490", "num_games_owned": 161}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_updated": 1454823537, "recommendationid": "21016570", "timestamp_created": 1454823537}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
