{"reviews": [{"review": "For a $6 game it is worth the money. The levels are fun and the mechanics are interesting. The best part of the game is the multiplayer. Coming up with better designs than your friends is challenging and competitive. It is a type of multiplayer you don't see too often.\n\nPro's:\n-Cheap\n-Easy to understand gameplay\n-Sandbox\n-Possibility to build complex things\n-Graphics are simple but still very pleasent to look at\n-Multiplayer with friends is very fun\n\nCon's:\n-Less than 20 singleplayer levels\n-Somewhat annoying gui and building becomes very tedious as there are no keyboard shortcuts\n-The game doesn't explain mechanics very well even though there is a tutorial (I had to make multiple google searches for an understanding of basic game mechanics)\n\nConclusion:\nIf you have an extra $6 in your steam wallet and are interested in getting a fun sandbox building game then get it.

For what it is, it's not bad at all. All the negetive reviews have less than an hour so I wouldn't even think about listening to them.\nPros-\n-Decent price\n-Decent graphics (I really dont care about graphics, heck I think half life one looks good.)\n-Some fun and challanging single player levels like protecting a crown from getting shot off its stand, making towers that have to survive for 20 seconds without falling, making a bridge for a ball to roll acrossed (sounds boring but it gets crazy), and some other things.\n-The TNT is pretty cool\n-You can move the block up and down or left and right if you hold down the left mouse button while placing so its not limited (if it on a flat serface it goes up and down, side of something left and right)\n-The newest update added more short cuts and a reset button\n-Theres probably more but I cant remember\n\nCons-\n-Needs trangles for ramps\n-Multiplayer is empty because no one really plays.\n-Takes to long to get from the menu to a game, but there might be a reason.\n\nThats all the important stuff I could think of, Also I saw a review that says rockets that point up but they do you just press  R or go into options (people need to look at the interface more).
