{"reviews": [{"review": "Good God, do I love this game.\n\nIt's a part of my childhood. I probably spent the better part of one thousand hours wearing down my old PS2 disk years ago. I came back to it with the port here on Steam, and I can conclusively say that this is the best port I know to have been put on Steam, ever. The devs (the same studio from all the way back in 2002, though maybe not all the original staff) really put their hearts and souls into getting this classic to work on PCs. As near as I can tell, they even managed to convince the decade-and-a-half-old ORIGINAL GAME ENGINE to accept such modern amenities as adjustable graphics settings and, get this, re-bindable controls for keyboard. If that doesn't speak to the quality of both the game and the team behind it, then nothing does.\n\nOn to the game itself. The plot surrounds the eponymic character Ty, who is on a quest to save his family after they were imprisoned by the main antagonist, Boss Cass. The story makes somewhat little sense, but given the game's premise (anthropomorphic tiger collecting balls of light to save his family), I'll forgive it for that. Compare it to the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and you'll see that story generally came second or third to gameplay at the time this game came to be.\n\nThe game handles just like I remember from when I was young. It certainly isn't perfect; the camera can be mildly wonky and the jumping behavior is inconsistent at times, but Ty handles well and the biggest factor in the platforming is player skill, as it should be. One thing the game most certainly is NOT, is difficult. I 100%'d the game, at least as far as progress on the save is concerned (there's some extra stuff that doesn't count towards the total), in under 10 hours. But it was a blast the whole way through. I was brimming with so much nostalgia it gave me goosebumps at times.\n\nIf you liked the game when it was originally released, I can't recommend it more (at time of writing, it's even on sale!). If you're looking for a laid-back classic platformer, look no further. If you want to gallivant across a fictional Australia through worlds full of spirit filled with characters full of, well, character, then it doesn't get much better than this.\n\nYou don't get the single highest user satisfaction rating on Steam by making a bad game. Both the game itself and the quality of the port are absolutely outstanding, and the developers should be (and probably are) very proud of their work. Never before has the Internet laid eyes upon such a labor of love.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505965438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 768, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198072769598", "num_games_owned": 101}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512411", "timestamp_updated": 1505967653, "recommendationid": "35097235", "timestamp_created": 1505967653}, {"review": "A very decent game from the early 2000s. It's been upgraded quite a bit, and the devs have spent a lot of time making sure it runs well and looks much better than what people played so long ago. It's a very chill game. I've only played a bit on this release, but I know the game, and it is functioning at a much higher quality than before. The story is fun, the graphics are super sharp and cartoony at 4K, and the game controls well. Even the cutscenes are decent and still look good.\n\nThere really isn't much else to say. This is not a AAA game, it is not going to blow your mind, but the huge number of upgrades and the overall aesthetic here are endearing in their own way.

Normally a game doesn't physically make me nauseous, but this one did. \n\nFor starters, the game is very poorly optimized. I have a good PC that should be more that capable of running this piece of shit, but the framerate drops constantly, even on low settings.\n\nBut the thing that bothered me most was the sheer amount of annoying cutscenes, dialogue and tutorials. First of all, the game starts with a 15 minute pre-rendered cutscene that looks like garbage. Then during the game, these stupid, forgettable characters will never shut the fuck up even for a second. Literally the first level has like 15 tutorials in it. And they just pop up, you can't avoid them. Normally I'm not the kind of person to skip tutorials or cutscenes but good god, it really got out of hand and I started having to skip everything so I wouldn't puke. Of course, not doing the tutorials means I had no idea what most of the things in the game were for so it just seemed like I was picking up useless objects.\n\nBut probably the worst part about this is that they can't just say something like \"This here is a checkpoint. If you die, you restart from here.\" No. They have to have this fucking senile cockatoo go \"OY MATE ONE TIME I WAS DOWN AT THE BARBY AND THIS BLOKE CAME UP TO ME AND STARTED BLOWIN' ME MATE, BUT CRIKEY I WAS DAFT AS A WALLABY AND DIDN'T REALIZE THIS BLOKE HAD DRUGGED MY MARTINI AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW I WOKE UP IN THIS DODGEY SHACK, MATE!\" Yes, I get it, the shack is a checkpoint now shut the fuck up. They have the most long-winded lore-friendly ways to explain every tiny fucking game mechanic that's commonplace in every platformer. No, I really don't need to have a lore reason to collect five bonus blue koalas in every level. I really don't. And I sure as hell don't need you to explain it to me.\n\nYou might say that I didn't spend enough time with this game, and that the amount of tutorials and annoying bullshit cutscenes go down as the game progresses, but it doesn't matter how good a game gets if the beginning of the game makes you want to blow your brains out. You wouldn't stab an active soldering iron into your eyeball just to get an ice cream cone afterwards.\n\nI wasn't going to mention this at first, but now I'm on rant so I may as well: The visuals look like they were drawn by a fucking 12 year old on DeviantArt. I'm sorry, but you know it's true. If you told me that Ty was designed by a third grader, I would honestly believe you.\n\nMy last gripe is that the bite move makes a sound effect that makes it sound like Ty is literally biting into his lip. It's the grossest sound and it makes me want to puke.\n\nThe only positive things I can say about this game are that picking up the gems is satisfying and the music is alright. I thought about it for a while, but those are literally the only compliments I can give to this piece of trash.\n\n\nThis game is literally shovelware, and it's really no different from any of the other failed platformer mascots like Bubsy. I could probably find this game in the $1 bargain bin at WalMart. The amount of people calling this game a classic makes me lose so much faith in the gaming community. Everyone is either nostalgia blind as fuck, or have no clue about game design, or even what fun is. This is the reason so many shitty games have such high ratings. The only way a game will have a low rating on Steam is if it has a technical issue that prevents the game from running, or some popular YouTuber says it's bad so all these kids give it a bad review to try to fit in. \n\nFuck this game.\n\nEDIT: I don't get why this game coming out 15 years ago is an excuse for it to be terrible. Plenty of actual good games came out before and during that time that still hold up today. Am I supposed to give this game a good review just because \"the port is good\" (which it isn't, by the way)? If someone did an HD port of Superman 64 to Steam, and it was an amazing port would you give it a good review? No. Because Superman 64 is terrible.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1505596867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 20, "num_reviews": 16, "steamid": "76561198066228209", "num_games_owned": 254}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "10", "votes_down": 71, "votes_funny": 10, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.389598", "timestamp_updated": 1505669244, "recommendationid": "35008480", "timestamp_created": 1505599883}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1220, "review_score": 9, "total_negative": 12, "num_reviews": 13, "total_reviews": 1232, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive"}, "success": 1}
