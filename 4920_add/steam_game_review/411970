Originally played it as a young child on the Original Xbox console. I already had a soft spot for the game, and when it got re-released on steam I just had to grab it.\n\n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\nTy 2 start off shortly after where Ty 1 left off\u2026 the Reptile forces are trying to break Boss Cass free from Currawong Jail. The prison where boss Cass got locked up following the event of ty 1. Ty and his friends do their very best to keep him locked up. But their efforts are not enough. Boss Cass breaks free with the help of his lead henchwoman Fluffy\u2026\n\nFollowing their failed attempt to keep Cass locked up the heroes form Bush Rescue. This strike team will allow them to better respond to distress calls all over the outback. Boss Cass his whereabouts are known but due to diplomatic immunity the heroes cannot arrest him. This is because Cass has setup his own country called Cassopolis.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nSoon after the first mission you get dropped in to the open world, here you can do mission that become available to you. Once you've done enough mission within the outback the game will progress its story. This goes in the form of a boss battle or special mission. Just like the opening mission these are very scripted, But most importantly very fun! \n\nTy 2 is a platformer in heart. The core gameplay is solid and fun. Ty feels good to control, And jumping feels responsive and fast. Two attack types are available: his Boomerangs and a Bite Attack, he is a Tiger after all. \n\nThe boomerangs come in many types, like Fire, Ice and rope Boomerangs. You can get them in shops in town and upgrade at Sly\u2019s tree house. You use the Red Coins you collect all over the outback to pay for them. These 'Rangs make combat and platforming easier and will allow ty to reach places he couldn\u2019t reach before.\n\nOther than 'Rangs you can also buy Bunyip license. Bunyip\u2019s are mech suits used for combat, exploration or clearing a path. \n\nHaving the licenses is required to do some missions, same goes for the Boomerangs. This is a very annoying aspect of the design, because you're not always told what license or 'Rang you will need to do the mission. (Get them as soon as you can!)\n\n\n[h1]COLLECTION[/h1]\nWithin the world of Ty2 you can collect many things. Of course the currency is all over the place, but you can also get Cogs, Chromium Orbs and Bilbies. The Chromium Orbs can be used to buy maps, they will show you the location of the other items to collect, they are required to get 100%. Also one of the best things to find is a guy called goo-boo (lost) Steve.\n\n\n[h1]OTHER[/h1]\nYou might also have noticed I have not mentioned the cart racing mini game, they are scattered around the open world for you to do, luckily they are not required for the main plot to go forward because they (\u2018\u2019Suuuuuuuuuck\u2019\u2019) are very bad. I\u2019m pretty sure some people find them enjoyable but I can't get in to them. That's why I didn\u2019t include them in this review. \n\nThis review is based on the latest ''Experimental'' build of TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2 on Steam.\nVersion: Build r2675_v071\n\nIf youre a big fan of platformers like Rayman 2 and if you have a soft spot of cheesy Saturday morning cartoons Ty the Tasmanian tiger 2 will be right up your ally   \n\nTitle: TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Indie, Early Access\nDeveloper: [url=http://www.kromestudios.com/]Krome Studios[/url]\nPublisher: [url=http://www.kromestudios.com/]Krome Studios[/url]\nRelease Date: 20 Mar, 2017\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=888007235\n[i]If you spot a mistake in grammer you can let me know, ill try to fix it.[/i]\n\nCheers,", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1507049854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "playtime_forever": 1001, "num_reviews": 11, "steamid": "76561198044054289", "num_games_owned": 1514}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534543", "timestamp_updated": 1507022060, "recommendationid": "35237126", "timestamp_created": 1506496605}, {"review": "Despite the beta stage this game is in, it feels just like it did years ago when i first played it.
