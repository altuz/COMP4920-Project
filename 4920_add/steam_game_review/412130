{"reviews": [{"review": "Ages back I was looking forward to this game, before it was abandoned by the developers. Recently it was on sale so I thought \"eh\" and got it, knowing not to expect much.\n\nThe game is unfinished, unpolished and very clunky. Everything has to be micro-managed. My people die of hunger despite my best efforts. And this is WITHOUT me running into any bugs whatsoever like most reviewers have mentioned.\n\nIn the sale I got this game for a mere 69p.

It's a game about building your city, protecting it and maintaining order in it. Management is easy, immediately accustomed to it. The graphics are pixelated, well-formed. Crafting and mining resources are very boring. In the end, the game for an amateur, not much addictive.\nOverall Rating: 6.5 / 10", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1493124768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198144565895", "num_games_owned": 120}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516788", "timestamp_updated": 1493122911, "recommendationid": "31356173", "timestamp_created": 1493122911}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
