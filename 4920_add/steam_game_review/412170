{"reviews": [{"review": "City Of Chains is a dark sci-fi adventure title developed by Astronomic Games and published by New Reality Games. As Holt Allaway, you take control of a small group of escaped fugitives and attempt to lead them to their freedom. Along the ensuing adventure you will have to make many decisions, some of them with far reaching consequences, such as whether to fight or to avoid combat, to help others or to look out strictly for yourselves and finally to show mercy or to kill. Decide wisely because your choices could possibly affect everyone in the city...\"A City Of Chains\".\n\nAside from the intriguing story, the superb gameplay is also a standout feature of this fantastic Indie title. Instead of the traditional experience points you earn skill points which can then be used to learn a variety of new skills and useful passive bonuses for each character on your team. From combat and dialogue skills, to explosive and medicinal crafting, there are many abilities at your disposal to enhance the success of your group but choose wisely depending on your particular style of play. The combat is turn-based and strategic giving you time to determine and execute your teams actions then quickly switching to the adversaries turn until one side eventually emerges from battle victorious. As far as the objectives go, there are non-linear and semi-linear locations so there is usually an alternate means to and end. Also remember that choice and consequence matter in City Of Chains as your decisions will have an impact on the world and people around you. For example, in order to escape from some facility undetected do you shoot this unsuspecting guard dead or merely knock him out? And if you should chose the latter and cross paths with him again in the future will he in turn help you or try to kill you? These are some of the moral decisions that you must make throughout the gripping narrative.\n\nVisually, well City Of Chains is a RPGMaker title and we all know what those look like because they typically have a similiar visual style no matter which game it is because that's just the nature of the software. However, City Of Chains is like a RPGMaker title on steroids because it actually looks quite different from any other game in the category that I've come across on Steam. I believe the main difference, at least to me, is that this title doesn't have the \"anime\" or \"cartoony\" look of your average RPGMaker title and has opted for a more realistic visual style especially when it comes to character design. Graphically the title is absolutely fantastic and is also without a doubt the best looking RPGMaker game out there hands down. From the set pieces to the character portraits in the cutscene dialogue, everything looks terrific. With that said, the title retains a dark and dreary look color-wise probably due to the bleak nature of the narrative which fits perfectly in my opinion. Also of note, the sound quality is excellent whether it's gameplay, ambient background noises or the dystopian flavored musical score which is superb I might add. In summary, the sleek graphical style and wonderful audio really compliment the great combat and excellent narrative in this title.\n\nCity Of Chains is definitely the best RPGMaker title that I've played on Steam even going so far as to knock my previous favorite \"Skyborn\" off the throne. The dark sci-fi setting, compelling narrative, non-linear gameplay and wonderful turn-based strategic combat come together to create quite the exciting adventure. There are three difficulty modes-Casual, Hardy, Dystopia and given the number of weapons and skills to select for your team as well as the many decisions to be made throughout the story the replay value of this game is quite high. Option-wise there are Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards to collect and although the great soundtrack is not available as an extra option you can, thankfully, find the tracks in the game files so they are completely free and readily available. In just a short time I have fallen in love with this soundtrack as it is really good. In summary, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND City Of Chains to R.P.G., Strategy and Cyberpunk fans as well as anyone looking to go on a great adventure in a dystopian futurisic setting where choice actually matters in the storyline.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1502814695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 888, "num_reviews": 52, "steamid": "76561198004313984", "num_games_owned": 407}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567301", "timestamp_updated": 1503217280, "recommendationid": "34368209", "timestamp_created": 1503217280}, {"review": "It has that weird feeling of nostalgic Sci-Fi, And it's fantastic!\n\nThe story is good, and you won't see that until you go deep inside the game.\nSPOILERS ! \n[spoiler]I really loved those shocking scenes and choosing the destiny of other charachters.[/spoiler]\n\n\nWhat's more amazing in this game is the ability to change resolution and also the controller support, because somehow you'll feel lazy and wanna play with a controller while you're away from the screen, Just saying.\n\nsome other RPGMaker Games don't have those features and it kinda annoys me not to have them.

Its not hard to see why, the balance between exploration combat and dialogue is spot on. Music is half decent. Setting is readily understood by anyone. There are some custom mechanics to the standard rpg mechanics combat. On the other hand everything is somewhat underpar and amateur. The sprites, the dialogue, the overall narrative, the soulless 3D sprite protagonists that are barely introduced and join the party.
