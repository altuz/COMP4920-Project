{"reviews": [{"review": "Pros -\n- Great soundtracks.\n- Easy controls.\n- Great visuals.\n- Replayability.\n- Fun strategic challenges.\n- Hard levels which make you have to get to know how the game works in order to win (even know the game is fairly straight forward)\n- Very small learning curve, you can pretty much jump straight in and have a lot of fun.\n- Oh and the most important thing of all... CHEAP.\n\nMy cons lean mostly towards configuration and development issues, l'm sure once the game has had some more patches these can be easily fixed.\n\nCons -\n- Sometimes certain abilities wont work, eg replinishing your soliders ammo, half the time you will need to send him away from his squad/outside a bunker to heal or replenish ammo as the game has a hard time knowing what solider your're selecting when in close quaters with other units and either will use the ability on the wrong soldier or just wont do anything at all until you select the solider you want to use and send him away from other units so you can properly select him to use a ability etc.\n- Sometimes enemys will shoot your soliders through walls/rocks and your troops cant fire back.\n- General diffuculty/lack of consistency when controling large squads/individal units to move long distances across the map. (Will sometimes just unselect the units so you have to go back and move them small spaces at a time.)\n- In it's current form the game only has 3 levels as far as l know which will take you a maximum of 30 minutes to 2hrs to complete.\n\nI could go on about very minor fixable problems but l dont see the point, this game is SO much fun and 100% worth the money. Even if you can only get 1-2 hrs out of it in its current stage, (l hope developers will be adding more levels soon! :) ) it's totally worth buying to support the developers and the general replayabilty of the game.\n\nThe game is cheap cheap cheap and is one of those games you can play for an hour or two then go play your primary game like CSGO or pubg. Just one of those cheap mini games that is a tun of fun. l have a feeling a LOT more people will start hearing about this game as it gets developed because even in it's early stages l can see it has a lot of potensial.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505885036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 117, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198068567605", "num_games_owned": 67}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1503674793, "recommendationid": "34483841", "timestamp_created": 1503674793}, {"review": "Tags: Tower Defense\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\nNote: Early Access - Might be worth another look when it release\n\nTLDR: Trash. Wants to act like a freeform tower defense with relocatable towers. But comes across as a stiff and half broken RTS instead.\n\nOutstanding Issues:\n-Game does not obey conventional control schemes (e.g. no mousewheel for camera zoom, boxed selection not working) \n-Artificial Intelligence is poor. Only foes within a very specific radius will engage\n-Game quickly becomes micromanagement hell as each unit has individual health and ammo bars that need to be catered to, along with unit repositioning and compensating for lack of AI\n-Not a lot of strategy to adopt. Hard to use terrain and buildings as cover since they are mostly just boxed squares of unwalkable terrain with art placed on them, all thats left is bunching up dudes together near a bottleneck. Units dont really have experience, special abilities, dont radio or work as groups or adopt stances. Sigh.\n-Incompetent/Revisionist historical slants\n\nPros:\n+Good audio direction with the ambiant music\n+The engine itself looks somewhat tablety, but half decent for what it is, offering some real resolution support\n+The UI is not too overloaded and I feel like I could have experimented and learnt everything about it if the game was fun", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504335091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 12, "num_reviews": 1973, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 4956}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505580", "timestamp_updated": 1505084944, "recommendationid": "34677964", "timestamp_created": 1504335093}, {"review": "If your into a small 2-20 hour tactital micro mannagement without multiplayer - this then might be your thing\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1105655529\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dZg4fMBC75k\n\nThis gotten [h1]retuned[/h1]", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1502312236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 16, "num_reviews": 65, "steamid": "76561197989234658", "num_games_owned": 381}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "timestamp_updated": 1502317733, "recommendationid": "34133009", "timestamp_created": 1502312352}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
