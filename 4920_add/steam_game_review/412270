{"reviews": [{"review": "This review is from an old school 80s kid who grew up with Nintendo and Genesis games...\n\nThis game is an excellent 2d ARPG. Yes, one could describe it as a Zelda Clone, but that shouldn't be taken as a negative. \n\nYou play as a boy trying to find his father, or something like that. You gain magic spells that can be used to solve puzzles and fight monsters. Instead of weapons, you use spells to dispatch enemies. \n\nThe game plays just like a top down Zelda would: you have a overworld that you can explore and find treasture; you find items that expand your abilities and allow you to progress further into the game; there are dungeons that test your physical prowess and mental ability; and the fighting is done in real time. There's a story tacked on, but it's not very good or engrossing. \n\nI really enjoyed playing the game because the puzzles are nice brain teasers and the game is easy to pick up and play in short bursts or long sessions. Finding hidden items is never boring and there's always something new to discover. Also, you learn new spells that keeps the action fresh and entertaining. \n\nSystem wise: there are no options for resolution or graphical effects. However, I did not have any problem running the game and it looks like it was running at 1080p. The sprites are colorful and the animation, although not amazingly dynamic, looks fine and suits this type of game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1453084570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 296, "num_reviews": 64, "steamid": "76561197977080684", "num_games_owned": 1987}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537408", "timestamp_updated": 1458694233, "recommendationid": "19720639", "timestamp_created": 1450220583}, {"review": "I haven't beaten this game yet but so far it's quite good.

There may be a little too much exposition/dialogue given the tone of the story, at least at the start.\n\nIf you like Zelda, the action based combat mechanics are very similar to older Zelda games such as Link to the Past or the Gameboy titles.  There is an overworld, there are dungeons and associated puzzles to solve in order to progress. The interface, item mechanics and character abilities are all taken from Zelda.\n\nIt includes a very pleasant soundtrack. The sprite work and animations are passable (albeit simplistic).

I can only play in windowed mode, and have had to disable avast real time scanner every time in order for it to start.  \n\nFrom the perspective of a Zelda fan, this is a pleasant surprise that came out of nowhere.

In Bethem, you have a mana gauge. You can only attack with spells, so every action you can do costs mana. This mana refills slowly, at a speed depending on your currently equipped bracelet -- more powerful bracelets give faster regen. Except, once you've regenned about 10% of your MP, the speed drops dramatically anyway, and seems to drop off almost entirely once you reach 50% MP.\n\nSee those bushes? The ones everywhere? You have to waste MP to get past them. The little logs and whatnot? Waste MP. The holes? Waste MP. Exploring actively makes you more vulnerable in combat by wasting magic you could be using to defend yourself. Irritatingly, the spells which don't have combat uses (for example, the one that fills in holes) cost even MORE than your attacking spells, which serves no purpose other than to try to make you waste time or magic potions, which you can carry in limited supply. \n\nAs a result? When I find a new exploration tool, my knee-jerk reaction is not \"Oh cool! I know a bunch of places I could use this!\". It's more along the lines of \"Oh, it costs even more mana? Great. Just great.\" I cannot describe how bad that is in the context of a Zelda-like.\n\nThe dungeons also leave a lot to be desired. Here's a rundown of the first four. 1) Block Puzzles, the dungeon. Agonizingly slow block puzzles. There's literally a point where the game wants you to push a block down a long hallway with no obstacles for a treasure chest -- in other words, they went out of their way to waste your time. 2) Warp Mazes. Because we all enjoyed Sabrina's Gym in Pokemon Red, right? Trying random exits in entirely identical rooms to eventually trial and error your way to the goal with no other gameplay challenge? 3) Dark Dungeon. And by dark, I mean you can see literally your own character and the tile in front of him. You walk in without the fire magic you need to see, do half the dungeon (fighting against ranged monsters, in the dark) to get it, and then things are a little better... if you spam the fire magic every five seconds, which will make you run out of mana. There are candles to light, but hey! You can't see the candles. Hope you enjoy firing randomly into the darkness. 4) Statue land, where lighting candles will move statues that only exist in this dungeon. Oh, except for one particular statue near the end of the dungeon, which is activated by a kill room you get to at the beginning. Y'know, because consistency in game mechanics is too much to ask.\n\nOh, but don't think you've seen the last of slow block puzzles or warp mazes or can't see more than one tile in front of my face gimmick once you've gotten past their theme dungeons. They just sprinkle them in everywhere, and they remain the same horrible, unfun gimmicks as they were in the first place.\n\nLet's see, what else? The combat! The combat in this game is trash. Because you're a mage, the game has the smart idea of introducing elemental resistances and weakness. Mostly, this consists of giving all the enemies in a new area resistance to the things you've got and weaknesses to things you won't get for literal hours. Powering up your bracelet helps increase your attack power, but it's done through limited collectibles. About that third dungeon, where you can't see anything -- it's also full of fire spiders, which take eight hits to put down at the time, are hard to dodge, and do a very healthy amount of damage to you for that point in the game. And you can't see them, because it's dark. Don't forget that you're probably somewhere between 10~50% mana because you had to waste it all getting rid of bushes, and therefore will run out of mana and have to kite until you recover enough to attack.Oh, and almost every enemy is faster than you and/or can attack diagonally, which you can't.\n\nEven basic, silly things contribute to making this game a chore. You'll sometimes -- often -- find pit traps under bushes, which need a mid-game spell to fill in. In the early game, the fact that they're hidden by bushes is a form of cheap damage. But it also shows up in other ways. There are no holes not covered by bushes. Which means that you can go all the way through a maze, get to the last little row of bushes, and discover a single hidden hole blocking your way... so you have to walk back. Why was the hole not at the beginning of your path, if it's meant to gate progress? Why was it not visible? On that note, your basic spell penetrates up to two bushes at a time, so obviously they're usually placed in threes, or fives -- anything to make you waste an extra point of mana.\n\nThat's what this game is. Every single little thing is just lacking that element of consideration that would make the game fun to play, and it all adds up to an insulting, unenjoyable experience. On every screen, you'll find something and ask yourself, \"Why are they making me waste my time and mana on this? Why does this need to be here?\" The music is good, and the graphics are good, but don't let that and the nostalgia for a real Zelda game fool you. This game is a waste of time and a wasted opportunity, and my advice is to leave it well alone.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1480694869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 494, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198073722926", "num_games_owned": 357}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523400", "timestamp_updated": 1480697600, "recommendationid": "28142254", "timestamp_created": 1480697600}, {"review": "If you enjoy puzzles, have a good sense of direction and don't mind a fair bit of backtracking then you will probably enjoy this game.

It takes effort not just to find the dungeons, but sometimes subquests to gain access.  For example, the fourth dungeon first requries you to find and light three candles hidden elsewhere in the world.  While I do like taht they added some extra challenge that encourages you to take new powers and explore areas you could not reach before, there is one minor negative.  It can lead to some frustration trying to find an obscure location without any decent clues.\n\nThere are some good side-quests as well.

There's a high chance you might like it. And I really wanted to like it but I'm requesting a refund out of specific reasons. Hate to be that guy, but here's why.\n\nI'm a parent and don't have much time. And this game tries too much to waste my time.\n\nThe attack animation stops movement. Pushing boulders takes such a long time. And the first dungeon is filled with sokoban involving pushing boulders.\n\nWhat led me to quitting the game: I made it past a certain gate, past the first sokoban puzzle behind, and failed at the next puzzle (balloon). Then I realized that if I wanted to reset the balloon, I had to backtrack and do the sokoban again. Slowly pushing boulders. I don't ragequit in competitive games, but here I did. <<-- Edit: apparently there was a shortcut that I overlooked!\n\nNow I appreciate the older Zelda games even more. They were limited to (mostly) one-screen-at-a-time, which led to slick and elegant design. Sadly, this is not what I can say about this game. I guess there is fun to be had for people with more patience and time, but it's not for me.\n\nBest of luck with your next project.\n\nOne last thing: the game does establish the sense of discovery, but apparently I'm to collect eight... objects?
