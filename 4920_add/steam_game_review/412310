{"reviews": [{"review": "Labyrinth just went free to play, although it's still in Early Access, so I figured I'd leave a review for people to see whether or not it's worth their time. \nShort answer: Yes.. \nLong answer: ...Yess\n/REVIEW END -Throws smokebomb .. just kidding.\n\nQuick Review:\nIt's a tactical battle thingy. It's good. It's free. It's like pokemon, except in 3D, you control awesome heroes, and you battle against mythological monsters. So not really like pokemon but you get the idea.\n\nLabyrinth?\nYeah the name doesn't really show up in google that well, and there's no David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly, Goblin King or Bog of Eternal Stench (yet).\n\nOutline:\nYou do collect cards from pack to use in battles, which work as your passives, minions(for bosses) and abilities. It plays like a tactical battle game. Currently (in Early Access) single battles take place in a single arena based on the boss. There's no limited \"energy\" system and you can play as much as you want. The cards are balanced (some cards are better, others are situationally better) and every hero and boss is unique in some way.\n\nCurrently there are 6 heroes and 6 bosses, eventually there will be at least 2 heroes of every class type and 8+ bosses. The heroes of the same class share cards, besides a few guaranteed hero-specific cards, but you can only field one of each class. Every hero and boss gets at least one permanent passive ability, some armor, and some basic, more than decent cards to begin with.\n\nBosses each have two classes and choose their minions and actions from those classes.\nIt is a tile based game and some bosses/minions take up more tiles than others, from 1x1 (human sized) bosses all the way up to 3x3 (giant) bosses, and even 3x3 minions. The size of the bosses and minions has a subtle effect on play as well, and  in the current version the battlefield terrain can be altered, with lava or cracks, during battle. The battlefield terrain alteration mostly occurs around one of the bosses, who is a magma beast. He bleeds torrents of lava when hit, and can spew lava around him as an attack.\n\nHeroes get two basic abilitys, guard and an individual weapon, that don't consume a card and can be used for card draw or to save/use resources. The basic abilities can be upgraded with some cards, e.g. warfare heroes can equip better weapons, the mages can equip a spell book.\nThe basic hero weapons themselves have their own class which can be affected by cards. E.g. the fire mage's fire spells become swifter at focus 10, which includes her base attack.\nThe rogue engineer heroine's base attack counts as a \"ranged attack\" for perks and abilities that buff and trigger on those.\n\nBosses don't have a base attack and have a smaller hand then heroes, allowing you some control over better AI performance and making boss combos more likely. Every day there is a quest that offers a sum of gold worth around 8-10 victories, so if you can only play once a day it is still efficient. You can hold 3 quests at a time, and change them each once.\n\n\nOld Reviews:\nThere were more positive reviews from key backers, but due to a steam policy change of only allowing direct purchases to post reviews that count, some diminished.\nHopefully now that it is free to play they can be restored.\nThere was a critical bug that delayed the free to play update, and they fixed it the same day, meaning that free to play was only delayed by a single day.\n\n\nIs It Pay 2 Win Though?\nIt doesn't feel like it.\nThere's no premium only content. Everything is available to F2P, and the epic/legendary rate is quite high, although the coin rate is low (balanced by rate). You can also craft all of the obtainable cards in the game with a currency you earn from defense(your boss) battles and disenchanting duplicates. You can get an early lead on obtained cards by paying sure, but a lot of the fun comes from building up your deck and improving it.\n\nCasual matchmaking is partially based on how well you do, and of course Ranked mode is, so the tougher your deck, the tougher your opponents in general. It also means that if you're not doing well you'll likely be matched up with F2P decks in future anyway.\n\nIt's also somewhat balanced in that, all cards are effective in one way or another, and for perks/minions, they have a card cost of which you can only spend so much. In my experience, well constructed F2P decks and smart play should be able to win against decks with higher rarity/more powerful cards. It also doesn't take that long to reach max level, by rough estimate you could collect most of the current cards in a few months by doing the daily quest everyday.\n\nYou can quit at any time, or if you get disconnected from the game at any time, and you will be able to return back to the raid you were in the middle of.\n\n\nPlaytime?\nBy comparison, I have more hours on Labyrinth in a week than on:\n\tXCOM 2\n\tHitman: Absolution (100% achievements)\n\tDragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen\n\tOne Way Heroics\n\tHand of Fate\n\tCargo Commander\n\tDungeon of the Endless\n\tRisk of Rain\n\n\nDid I mention it's free to play now?\n\n\nPlease, stop reading, I don't have anything else, I beg you, I'm just a humble fisherperson.\n\n\n\nGame's discord: https://discord.gg/labyrinth\n\n\n\nControl overview (less obvious ones):\nDouble-click on a unit to see more about it.\nDouble-click on own units on timebar to see their hand, so you can plan better.\nArrow keys or both mouse buttons to move around field.\nRMB to rotate and wheel to zoom in.\nIn deck selection, RMB to study a summon from summon spell, or craft/disenchant card.\n\tGuarding is a good way to draw extra cards, since it only costs 1 tick. It's good for Faith if she draws all Heal cards and doesn't need to heal.\nMax handsize = appears to be 7, and when you reach 7, you just stop drawing cards until you use them?\nYou can scroll the sidebar history in a battle to see moves longer than the previous 8 effects.\nWhen watching a replay, use Back in bottom left to exit.\nSpacebar can be used to skip turn (use Guard usually).\n\n\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n-throws realistic smokebomb", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1504180967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 31107, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198064414264", "num_games_owned": 2162}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539966", "timestamp_updated": 1486568971, "recommendationid": "29767746", "timestamp_created": 1486495228}, {"review": "Very early access, hopefully more stuff will be added.

To complete this mission, you have but a certain amount of time. Time becomes crucial as you pierce trough the summoned hordes to defeat the stage boss. Soon you come to the conclusion that each move counts, as it costs you ticks (a portion of time) to complete an action. Each action is represented by a specific card and a deck of those cards defines a heroes moveset. \nIt is much fun to tweak a deck to gain most out of your different abilities and look for synergies between cards and even heroes. Currently in an early stage of development there isn\u2019t much to do except for raiding the three stages and defeating the bosses there. \nOverall a very promising game with lots of potential, possibly redefining the way we think about card games in the competitive sector. I personally will check out new features as they get added and am eagerly awaiting more.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1457709837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 190, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198043024667", "num_games_owned": 29}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500167", "timestamp_updated": 1457709679, "recommendationid": "21767257", "timestamp_created": 1457709679}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 42, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 10, "num_reviews": 20, "total_reviews": 52, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
