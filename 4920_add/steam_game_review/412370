The levels aren't easy, so there's a real sense of satisfaction when you completethem. However, the levels aren't easy, so there's also a real sense of SADisfaction when you fail twenty times in a row. Sorry about the pun, it's a coping mechanism.\n\nIf there's one tweak I'd suggest, it would be a second or two of celebration after completing a level, rather than abruptly being thrust into the next level with no fanfare.
