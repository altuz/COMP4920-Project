When suddenly, I see a blurry background of earth, and a disgusting noise with so much distortion it was impossible to decipher what it could possibly be, looking back now, I realize that was him gasping for air (Clever title eh?). At this point my teeth are clenched because It hurt my ears badly, but I decide to continue, when out of nowhere the menu slams straight into my eye sockets causing me to flip off my chair, Dark ambience screaming into my ears, I begged for it to stop for several moments when it finally does, had god heard my pleading and gave me mercy? No, the music just stopped for some reason and when I clicked on \"Can you survive?\" The music came back, it then took another lifetime to show a screen asking me to choose my planet, I could choose the planet moon or the planet mars. Of course, because the planet moon is my favorite planet I chose that one. Now, I'm loaded in and I'm walking around. Apparently I crashed but the 12 year old girl talking doesnt seem to care much. She mentioned low oxygen but says that I got to walk to one of the 5 \"Unknown signals\". So I walk to one of the signals, this one 2000m away, that already sounds bad and it gets worse because your astronaut walks like a crippled old man and it looks like he's limping because the camera falls almost touching the floor and bobbing the screen every footstep. I was already starting to get bored of this walking when I noticed that meteors were falling everywhere. I hadnt noticed them before because of the sandstorms and fog and the constant bleeding effect on my screen. I thought it was cool (for a second) until I noticed that they kept flying down from the sky and pin pointing my exact location and hitting me. Some would just collide into the moon at Mach 4 but just float slightly off the ground or bounce away. One of them hit me but thats not a problem because on the planet moon rocks dont stop you! You stop the rocks! After this I just went along until I reached the first signal. It was a Box with a wire going across it and a dial that goes onto a stove. The next signal was 4500m away but it took 15 mins to go 2000. After this I uninstalled the game and wrote this review, hopefully you found it helpful.\n\nIf that whole story wasnt exciting then you're in for one ride if you decide to install it (Dont).  I seriously dont Recommend this game it is bad in every way, except controls, but how could you mess up W A S D and the spacebar?\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1485834684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 13, "num_reviews": 36, "steamid": "76561198168991332", "num_games_owned": 50}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492738", "timestamp_updated": 1485836125, "recommendationid": "29598066", "timestamp_created": 1485836125}, {"review": "so funnnnnn i want to play nooooooooooo mooooorereeeeeeeeoororoeeooroorroeroeoreoroeroeroeoreoroeroeroeoreoreremre0reoroeroeoreoreoorereoroeor\nsuch a beautiful game from 2222222222222222222222222222222222 B.C.\nJust amazing so yolo give it a hate.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1460091626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 16, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561198245751340", "num_games_owned": 8}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488672", "timestamp_updated": 1485660626, "recommendationid": "29555523", "timestamp_created": 1485660431}, {"review": "Got hit by foam and deafened -10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1458342706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198272338674", "num_games_owned": 28}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1485157305, "recommendationid": "29438330", "timestamp_created": 1485157305}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "review_score": 4, "total_negative": 17, "num_reviews": 20, "total_reviews": 27, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative"}, "success": 1}
