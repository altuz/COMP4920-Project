{"reviews": [{"review": "Imagine playing an MMO where you grind for hours to get the best gear but there are no instances/raids that need it. Or imagine playing Minecraft except you have no ability to change the land around you. That's basically the problem of this game, where you develop your character to survive, but there's ultimately not much point beyond surviving. The kicker is that survival becomes pretty easy once you've played for an hour or two and unlocked about half of the beggar (starter class) skills. At that point, survival becomes tedium that prevents you from doing much else. Want to go explore/search for certain materials? The need to carry a lot of food, the long travel times, and the quickness with which food spoils makes this a hassle.\n\nAt that point, there are a ton of classes and skills to unlock, but most serve little purpose if you don't have access to a house, and it is by game design that many players wouldn't. At least a recent update changed the game to degrade housing doors unless players maintain them. Prior to that, *all* houses on any public server were already taken by players who had mostly abandoned the game, and breaking the doors down is way too much hassle with starter gear.\n\nLooking at the trailer, and examining the later classes like Outlaw/Knight/Merchant, apparently the game is heavily designed around a huge social component including PvP, but that doesn't seem to mesh well with how the rest of the game is designed. The game servers only seem to be able to hold up to 50 people, but players have complained about lag with even as few as 10 or so players. That's way too few players spread out over such a large map, and even the larger houses don't seem set up well to have groups of people in them like guilds. \n\nA lot of the negative comments here have discussed bugs, which there are many, but bugs can be fixed, while I'm not sure the fundamental problems of the game design can be. What is supposed to be encouraging players to keep logging on here day after day?", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1507163580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1377, "playtime_forever": 4016, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197970734860", "num_games_owned": 30}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525245", "timestamp_updated": 1505069490, "recommendationid": "34868795", "timestamp_created": 1505069490}, {"review": "I don't know if I'm not looking hard enough or what, but it feels like no one plays this game and I really feel it shuld be more popular than it is.

Wait for some major bug fixes.\n\nThere is a really beautiful concept to this game but execution is a huge problem and the gameplay is clunky and frustrating. I unfortunately didn't listen to my gut and bought the game after watching some good youtube reviews and \"let's plays\" from older versions (my fault) and was severely disappointed to find  how drastically different the game was.\n\nIt's impossible to forage and survive because there is almost NOTHING to forage from in the wilderness anymore, and it's impossible to stockpile and survive since all of your food goes bad at the end of the day anyways. So while crafting etc. is a nice part of gameplay as far as food production is concerned it doesn't really provide anything to the gameplay itself.\n\nThings like torches will just randomly break for no reason. You might equip the torch for the first time ever and poof. Gone. This causes a lot of frustration.\n\nThe only way I managed to play the game was live for a day, all of your food goes bad, nothing to forage, die. Start over with nothing on a beach with the skills from your previous \"life\", die of hunger/plague, start over again and try to get another skill. After trying this for a few hours and different styles of gameplay I basically threw in the towel. I am able to admit if I'm just bad at a game, but I really tried to sort this one out from every angle to no avail.\n\nI should have never bought this game. Perhaps if there are some major bug and gameplay fixes I will come back and see if this is playable but at the moment I wouldn't waste my time.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504371800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 275, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198190631821", "num_games_owned": 10}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504332", "timestamp_updated": 1506164900, "recommendationid": "35150547", "timestamp_created": 1506164900}, {"review": "A wonderful and gritty medieval game. As of writing this the game is still in Early Access, undergoing regular updates and changes. This may occasionally call for a wipe. This is justified, as the game\u2019s mechanics are not final, and exploits are being squished every now and then.\n\nRegardless of wipes, the game is already very enjoyable. It can be played both online and singleplayer on a private LAN server. There is plenty of crafting and exploration to be had. The online playerbase isn\u2019t very large, but so far I\u2019ve had little problem finding other players to play with. Though you may have to go out of your way to make contact with others.\n\nIf you are looking for a gritty, grimy, dirty medieval experience online, then this might be the game for you. The game is unforgiving though, and you may well lose your progress at the hands of a bandit or another player. But the possibilities are grand.
