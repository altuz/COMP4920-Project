I was godawful at it and couldn't complete it. Good times. Looking at it objectively, this game is nothing special, it's just another platformer with a cliche story. What i love about it is how it acknowledges what i just said and executes that idea in such a beautiful way. Gameplay is about 4-5 hours long depending on how familiar are you with this genre and if you want to 100% this game. The price is kinda justifiable, i'd say it's worth about 1 buck not 2. Overall i really like this game, it has flaws but my nostalgia about it doesn't let me see any.

In this game you play as a turtle who at first gets his shell taken from him. But then he finds out that something much bigger is at stake and from here you must travel across different types of terrain, fight 4 unique bosses, and all at the same time. DIE A LOT! I MEAN A LOT! This game will present you with many different types of traps that will trick you and treasures that will be hidden throughout the maps. As of enemies you will face anything from bullet shooting fish like creatures to really wierd sounding sea urchins. \n\nEven though this game if fairly long I kind of wish that it was a bit longer and that there was a new setting for each map instead of having the same four maps repeat eachother twice well the only difference the second time is that it is a bit harder.\n\nOverall I would give this game a 4/5 since it is a great game but I wish it was a bit longer and I also wish that the maps didn't repeat.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506808581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 222, "playtime_forever": 433, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198267788697", "num_games_owned": 55}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500250", "timestamp_updated": 1474860419, "recommendationid": "25704459", "timestamp_created": 1474860419}, {"review": "I'm not sure why the turtle wants to find his shell since it could easily afford a golden one with diamonds with all that cash it finds on the ocean ground.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1446152702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 51, "num_reviews": 343, "steamid": "76561197990947284", "num_games_owned": 3611}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 13, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500591", "timestamp_updated": 1445903358, "recommendationid": "18703653", "timestamp_created": 1445903358}, {"review": "JESUS THIS GAME SO GOOD", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1445538158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 28, "num_reviews": 17, "steamid": "76561198028319453", "num_games_owned": 253}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490455", "timestamp_updated": 1445545028, "recommendationid": "18629974", "timestamp_created": 1445545028}, {"review": "\u6bc1\u539f\u4f5c", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1503513440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198406784078", "num_games_owned": 7}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "timestamp_updated": 1503522145, "recommendationid": "34446741", "timestamp_created": 1503522145}, {"review": "This game confuses me\n\n10/10", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1478961974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198165804812", "num_games_owned": 41}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1481401301, "recommendationid": "28295974", "timestamp_created": 1481401301}, {"review": "I played this so much when I was younger!
