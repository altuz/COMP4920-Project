{"reviews": [{"review": "I've always liked tower defense games so I picked this one up when it was released. I never heard of it before and it had no ratings so it was a bit of risk. I've played it for about half an hour and it seems like its going to be a nice little time killer game. The upgrade system is decent, the story is fine (for a tower defense), and it seems like it requires a nice bit of strategy to play without being overly complicated. The UI is just a little clunky and they throw a lot if tutorial information at you right away, but that's not too big a deal.

But to be honest, this really feels more of a \"practice project\" than anything that should legitimately be on Steam for 7 bucks. \n\nThe game feels kinda sluggish and slow, and I don't find myself as comfortable with it as with most tower defense games control-wise. The graphics are a weird mix between a Flash game (mostly in the menus and interface) and something like Rayman 2 (The original PC Release), devoid of dynamism and far less appealing visually. The gameplay itself is nothing that creative or appealing. The 2D graphics are neat, however !\nI found that it was a bit of a shame that, with such a focus on the \"story\" part of the game (there's a big emphasis on the movie clips and such), there wasn't much more effort put into the actual story, character design and storytelling parts of the game, which, wether it be through the dialogue or plot, are...rather shallow. The kind you usually quickly give up on and find yourself skipping through to get to the action.\n\nAnother thing that was a big turn down was how...uninished the game felt. It crashed the three first times I tried to open it and I never managed to get the resolution and screen width to match despite my best efforts, and it doesn't run...so well anyway despite my computer handling more requiring games perfectly fine. The aforementioned \"Flash game\" menus and how it took me multiple attempts to simply rebound my keys validated the impression that I shouldn't have paid money to access this.\n\nIf this is the first (or one of) game you guys made, then...great job, it's actually good for a first try. But in my opinion, something so...low-quality (to be charitable) shouldn't be showcased on Steam for 7 bucks when you can find much, much better and more enjoyable, dynamic and functional Tower Defense games for free online on whatever flash site. What felt the most disappointing to me was that the artwork for the game looked really amazing and fun, and what I ended-up with was outdated, sluggish, and, honestly, ugly and uncreative 3D for a tasteless gameplay.\n\nYou guys have all the ingredients to make great games (kudos again to the 2D artist, since their awesome art is actually what decided me to buy the game) but this just felt like there wasn't enough effort and creativity put into it. In addition, the gorgeous artwork being anecdotical in the ACTUAL gameplay (and having \"Ew 3D\" instead) kinda felt like a scam, though I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on this not being intentional.\n\nI hope you'll find this criticism to be constructive, apologies if it happens to sound angry or salty !
