{"reviews": [{"review": "TL;DR: Atlantic Quest 2 \u2013 New Adventure is well worth a look if you like Match 3 games or are looking for a change of pace. I got so involved in the game, I forgot to track my card drops and that doesn\u2019t happen to me very often.\n\nPros:\n\u2022\tDecent story but no voice-overs\n\u2022\tCute graphics and characters\n\u2022\tCan switch back and forth between SWAP, CHAIN and GROUP modes during each level\n\u2022\tFast game play (make moves while board is in motion)\n\u2022\tLong game (I spend 18:36 getting 16 of 18 Steam Achievements)\n\u2022\tSome quickie hidden object levels that included HINT option (find x number of pieces of 1 item)\n\u2022\tOnly power-up (bomb) that can be created in-game is with 4+ starfish but it helps a LOT\n\u2022\tCan play RELAXED since timer is just for determining number of stars earned\n\u2022\tReplay map shows stars earned (FLAG levels are hidden object)\n\u2022\t18 Steam Achievements and 5 Trading Cards \n\nCons:\n\u2022\t4+ of anything other than starfish does not create any power-ups\n\u2022\tDifficulty varies per level but stars received for all levels are the same by time (3:00, 3:30, 3:30+)\n\u2022\tI much prefer SWAP mode but game lends itself mostly to CHAIN (once I discovered that, I used CHAIN almost exclusively)\n\nI really enjoyed playing this game and may go back some day to try to get the last two Steam Achievements. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I added all seven non-solitaire Steam games developed and/or published by rokaplay to my Steam Wishlist even though they don\u2019t have Steam Achievements or Trading Cards. One can always hope that they will be added.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1507033183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1118, "playtime_forever": 1118, "num_reviews": 23, "steamid": "76561198013810945", "num_games_owned": 1221}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504580", "timestamp_updated": 1507033709, "recommendationid": "35443805", "timestamp_created": 1507033540}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
