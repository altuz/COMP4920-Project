When I started to play I was like, \"Holy Crap! This is pretty fun!\" Okay, seriously though, this game is pretty fun. I only wish real life was like this. The game was short and sweet, but the other difficulty settings make this game very challenging which it then turns more into a long, drawn out process. The story is cute and the song at the end is a perfect ending to the game. I would recommend this game at it's current price.\n\nThis was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nOnce we have a 100 followers on our group there will be a game giveaway, but only the followers have a chance to win.\n\nIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.
