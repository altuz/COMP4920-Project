( Request some more unusual materials! )\n\nThe idea is to cooperate with other users online, plan out a building, or similar things.\nI assume that there will be an export, so that you could use it as a guide for standard CAD progams.\n\nI guess the online multi-useer feature is not active yet?\nIn the fine print, it says a \"subscription\" will be required for that - that should be clearly mentioned.\nhttp://archvirtual.com/immerse-creator/\n\nWe will see where it goes, you may want to wait for more features to be added.\n\nFor more game-like VR world building, try Anyland.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1492559921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 17, "num_reviews": 28, "steamid": "76561198264128255", "num_games_owned": 75}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494008", "timestamp_updated": 1492598479, "recommendationid": "31234650", "timestamp_created": 1492598479}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
