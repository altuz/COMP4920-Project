{"reviews": [{"review": "I bought this game becaus bLiNd is one of my favorite EDM artists.  I think this game can best be summed up as a Rage-Rythm-Platformer.  Imagine your right hand playing DDR and your left hand playing an action-platformer at the same time; now imagine that with rave music blasting and someone has a strobe light that is cycling colors going crazy in your face.  That is what playing Klang is like.  If you think that sounds cool (and it is) there are some things to consider first.\n\nI did beat the game on normal but this game is difficult.  Unfortunately I feel like a lot of the difficulty is artificial and comes more from the volume of audio and visual noise tripping up your brain as you're trying to multitask.  Again, it's like playing DDR but you're also having to maneuver your character around on platforms and/or constantly dodging beams that either insta-kill you or cause an obscene amount of damage.  To make matters worse, when you get a combo above a certain amount it changes the color scheme of everything on screen so by the time you readjust you're likely to be taking damage and drop the combo (ironically taking you back to the color scheme you just left as well).  A lot of the time I would die and not even realize what killed me due to the sheer amount of crap on the screen whizzing by (looking at you Angel boss).  The bosses in general are just a mess and I actually found it easier to fight them when I turned the game sound off.  That should never happen in a rythm-based game.\n\nThere were also some technical issues as well.  The cutscenes, though beautiful, would experience lag spikes even though the game itself was fine.  Platforms in levels that are programmed to fall so you don't wait on them too long would sometimes instantly fall without giving the player a chance to move but other times would give you the normal 1-2 second window to actually keep moving.  I actually soft-locked the game once by skipping a cutscene.  Luckily there was a checkpoint right at the start of the cutscene but still...\n\nDespite all this I have to give the game its due.  The soundtrack is FANTASTIC, bLiNd really outdid himself on this project and you can actually unlock the music tracks if you just want to listen to them later on.  Visually the game is beautiful with vibrant colors that really draw you into this weird rave world.  The story makes no sense but that seems intentional and I honestly didn't mind it being left open to interpretation; I kind of got a God of War feel from it honestly.  While short it should provide enough of a challenge to keep people playing for hours on end to even just finish it.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good overall as well.  Somehow Tinimations turned DDR into an action-platformer and made it work well.  The controls were pretty responsive and apart from some parts where I questioned a hitbox and the slide mechanic, it handled better than some AAA games I've played that also rely on controls being precise.  The wall jump mechanic is pretty cool as well and it enabled the game to do some pretty interesting and diverse things in the levels.  And while I did slag off on the mess of visuals a little bit ago there are levels that are much more just about hitting the \"notes\" or hitting the \"notes\" with just a little bit of platforming thrown in and these are great.\n\nI feel as though if some of the visual mess were to be toned down and some of the death beams ease up a little, this game would be a definite recommendation by me to anyone.  As it stands though, while I did enjoy it overall there are parts I never want to play again, chief among these are the bosses.  If you like EDM music and want a novel game that will challenge you and maybe make you frustrated, give it a shot.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505441543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 460, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197984533562", "num_games_owned": 109}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505852", "timestamp_updated": 1505443672, "recommendationid": "34962530", "timestamp_created": 1505443672}, {"review": "rhythm game wise, not very good", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1506201167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "playtime_forever": 21, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198011878814", "num_games_owned": 476}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484860", "timestamp_updated": 1506201205, "recommendationid": "35164036", "timestamp_created": 1506201205}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 28, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 31, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
