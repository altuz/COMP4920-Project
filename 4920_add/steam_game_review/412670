Highly Recommended\n\nReview: Multiple control schemes including Xbox360 pad detected out of the box with good default bindings and helpful on-screen diagrams. Resolution options offered by game launcher. \n\nProtag hitbox is actually just a dot which makes it a lot more manageable than what you might think from trailer video. Two different attack mode per protag with independent rechargeable attack bars to encourage you to alternate attacks and alternate from attacking to collecting rewards instead of always spamming attack buttons like most shootemups do. If you get overwhelmed you can use the bomb which will kill most everything on screen but have limited amounts of. Getting hit generates a chance of supplying you with another bomb which helps equalize difficulty.  Extra characters, items, cheat and handicap conditions are unlockable by grinding in-game coinage. Loads of ease of use options like transparency levels of protags and attack sprites. \n\nThe game seems to mostly follow a formula of letting one wave in at a time void invaders style, then spawning slow moving bullets en-masse and allowing you to carefuly maneuver around dispatching foes collecting coins as you go.\n\nSeems like there is a healthy amount of levels available, online leaderboards integration. 4 Player co-op.\n\nSound effects are very pleasant and the music is awesome. Nice use of EFB enemies, protags and setting with the same humor as tone that we have come to know and love. There are little cartoony animations for enemy deaths that are also quite well done.\n\nConclusion: Definitely one of my favorite titles in this genre", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1496272495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 661, "num_reviews": 1973, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 4956}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504095", "timestamp_updated": 1496273236, "recommendationid": "32096311", "timestamp_created": 1496272869}, {"review": "Loved the game. Loved the whole series actually.\nBeen on Kong for years before losing saves for all my games...\n\nBasically, a game with just right difficulty with\nalmost no apparent flaw besides some bullet sprites.\nIt has nice Art and BGM and is definitely worth the cost,\nbut if you're not sure you like this game,\nfree version with all stages available on webs.\n\n<Just right difficulty>\nI've 100% this game. Though, never get to play on hard (skipped).\nI'd say Heavenly is about Touhou's Normal-Hard,\nusing mouse just make it all easier.\nBullet patterns are interesting and mostly have different style from Touhou,\nprobably because the enemies are different.\nWhy compare to Touhou?\nBullet Hells these days are mostly inspired from that game.\nI can immediately see from the first Bullet Heaven that\nthis series is no different, correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n<Free version avaible on web>\nNot many people play this on steam,\nprobably since the free version is still in a web out there.\n\n<Leaderboard is so uncompetitive.>\nThe guy on top perfected the game with every handicaps,\neveryone after that probably just finish Heavenly without cheats at most.\nMe? I used both so the score multi is still >1.\nI ranked top 30. That's too high for me but\nbelieve me only not even a thousand people finish this game on steam,\ntry purposely lose on the final level and you'll get it.\n\n<BG & BGM are still nice as ever>\nLike the rest of the series,\nnice musics, relaxing even with an ominious tone,\nbackgrounds meeting the standard of how they should be,\nand you can darken it to black if they are distracting.\n(I don't though, they are nice as they are)\n\n<Story plot?>\nThis is basically Epic Battle Fantasy 4.4,\nan extra which only has stories where it can fit to the main plot.\nThose guys aren't very bright so watching them interecting\ncan be kind of fun in a way.\n\n<Amount of content>\nBesides shooting and avoiding,\nthere're upgrades, which will be maxed out so soon.\nI've bought the whole shop around the middle of my Heavenly run,\nand I skipped Hard too.\nBut the amount of stages though, 70,\n590 waves with 11 endless stages, over 700 waves,\ndefinitely more than worth the money.\n\n<Problems>\n- Bullets still shine even with disabled shine,\nthat's probably just the sprite then.\n- Score not submitted real-time, so when connection's bad it's ignored,\nfinishing the stage again win/lose seems to do it nicely.\n\n<Other opinions?>\n- Some weapons and costumes are just underpowered.\nWeapons are one thing, but I think extra costumes\nare too oriented towards bomb-using as a main strategy.\n- I expected the Eyeball achievement to mean 'all the eyeballs'.\nIt's good the way it is, because all eyeballs might be too hard.\n- An option to change pic on your sides is nice,\nbut it's not very noticable, it doesn't even saved between game sessions for me.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1494735494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1999, "num_reviews": 12, "steamid": "76561198295429564", "num_games_owned": 60}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1494677229, "recommendationid": "31722571", "timestamp_created": 1494677229}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 112, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 114, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
