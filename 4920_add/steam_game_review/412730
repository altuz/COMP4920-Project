Your name is Duc. I could hardly believe it either), who\u2019s been taunted by horrible nightmares. One late night, after another fit of bad dreaming, Duc falls under a sinister impression; his inner demons are manifesting themselves into reality, and their trying to break into his apartment. It\u2019s the player\u2019s job to escape whatever madness peruses them, and to uncover the truth behind Duc\u2019s murky history.\n\nWe\u2019ll start things off with the graphics. The quality isn\u2019t terrible, but it\u2019s pixel art at its simplest. There\u2019s nothing in the design department that\u2019ll keep you hooked, and character models and animations are very stiff and barebones. There were some moments when the game looked aesthetically pleasing, like the dancing of dust specs beneath the grimy light of a sewer lamp, but those moments were few and far between.\n\nAs for gameplay, it\u2019s what you\u2019d expect. Puzzles with some survival mechanics thrown into the mix, with a side of item collecting. Duc\u2019s movement speed is terribly slow, and walking down one long hallway to the next, only to realize that you missed something down the previous hallway is not a fun experience. Occasionally, an axe-wielding killer will appear at scripted moments, and you\u2019ll have to hide yourself inside dressers to evade him. But these scenarios can be very cheap. The killer\u2019s appearances are so random and misplaced that (unless you\u2019ve played the game before) a first-time player will have to learn from his/her mistake on the next go. This is why I highly recommend you save game as frequently as possible, lest you have to trek all the way back from your last save point.\n\nLastly, the story\u2026\n\nEh\u2026 It\u2019s a stunted mess of scatterbrained mystery pieces and untapped potential. I won\u2019t spoil anything for you, but the twist ending is so clich\u00e9 that I couldn\u2019t help but roll my eyes. The story can be uncovered by finding notes, which are hidden all over the game. But the dev must\u2019ve used Google as his main source of translation. I\u2019ve seen bad grammar before, but sheesh. A word of advice to all indie devs: If English isn\u2019t your first language, it is VITAL that you hire a professional translator, if possible. \n\nWhat makes me sad is\u2026 Days Under Custody has the heart and soul of something great, but it lives in the body of a mediocre product. Some real effort was put in, but there are so many better games you could buy for 5 bucks or less. But I\u2019m confident that this developer will make something great.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1449973874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 91, "num_reviews": 23, "steamid": "76561198076346059", "num_games_owned": 196}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501369", "timestamp_updated": 1460734447, "recommendationid": "19661518", "timestamp_created": 1449957241}, {"review": "Cool concept but not so great execution.
