{"reviews": [{"review": "Revolve plays like it states on the tin, a minimalist inertia based platformer. You control a space bike traversing ever more challenging levels from left to right (essentially only in that direction) by providing input to it's primary/jump thrusters, brake, and some sort of gravity inverter. \n\nIt's designed to be played in self contained stages that realistically take only 2 minutes to clock each. The physics behave intuitively enough to effectively time leaps over deadly red glowing exposed power conduits (that make up the only hazard I've discovered so far), and yet it's compact layout, lack of time limit and gentle vangelis-esque soundtrack keep this simple premise from being either too frustrating or straight boring.\n\nIt's not a title to immerse yourself in, and here-in lies my only complaint. The soundtrack stops jarringly after each death returns you to the begining of the stage; and I personally think it'd add something to the gameplay flow if the  low key track just strummed away regardless of your untimely demise and immediate ressurection. That's a pure stylistic observation on my part though. \n\nPros - relaxing title that tests your hand eye co-ordination in a lushly drawn 2d space world. Perfect for someone looking for down time from more grueling games, Revolve requires minimal time investment to become accomplished at and the bite sized levels mean you can put it down and pick it up whenever. \n\nCons - lack of enough time in each stage to enjoy the soundtrack, and after an hour or sos playtime im yet to discover any change in aesthetic/stage backdrop.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1487693951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 211, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561197980199478", "num_games_owned": 103}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514489", "timestamp_updated": 1487366615, "recommendationid": "29993585", "timestamp_created": 1487366108}, {"review": "Where to start.....Revolve is awesome! Beautiful colors, great sound track, levels progress with difficulty nicely, and just an overall blast. Challenging but relaxing at the same time, if that makes sense.\nMy only grip would be is the mechanic of when you need to jump and use your boost, seems like both are drained together even when you only use one.\nNow this is probably coded this way for a reason to make it more of a challenge, but its gets a little frustrating at times.\nOther than that, the game is def worth it!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506727446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_forever": 190, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198284307003", "num_games_owned": 83}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505929", "timestamp_updated": 1487260316, "recommendationid": "29965148", "timestamp_created": 1487260316}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
