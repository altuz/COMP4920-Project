All you need to do is listen for audio cues. different cues for where he will be..... however the game is glitched to no end.\n\n1. (The funny and not even a big problem glitch) You can be killed multiple times at once....how? One boogey man gets you, then another?? Are they ripping me apart or did the one not know the other one already hit me with game over....and how is he killing me exactly? he doesnt even move after he grabs me....is his breath THAT hot?\n\n2. You shine your flashlight on boogeyman with plenty of time...sometimes the game wont register your doing it....aka you need to hit him with the light 300% more than you should. \n\n3. Sometimes even when hes got the spotlight of the heavens on him HE STILL opens the vent...door...or window.... If the light doesn't work then basically this is merely just a game that you just ....die....you play it just to die.....over and over, just sit on your bed and die...that's fun right???  Just dying for hours with no defenses? Did I miss something? Is there a button you can hit to pistol whip this alien?\n\n4. Once while I was reaching for a battery as he was coming up to attack on that side of the bed,  his head went through my face/the screen....should'nt he have killed me right then and there instead of waiting?", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1499556565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 277, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561198361201187", "num_games_owned": 33}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494591", "timestamp_updated": 1501432881, "recommendationid": "33377794", "timestamp_created": 1499528445}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 150, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 178, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
