Why, I don't know. I'm sure developers will claim it's to \"minimize discomfort\" or something like that but just play in short bursts if you need a break. Anyway, all this to say that this game is short even by VR game standards. 30 minutes to beat and that's going out of your way for all of the collectibles. It doesn't feel complete: Why break the game up into levels if there's only 2 of them? Look, I wasn't expecting much for a $5 game but this hardly qualified as a game. Not even a demo.
