{"reviews": [{"review": "\"It's me. An opportunity shows itself. I can reveal to the world my greatness through a Review! ...what? An Organization trap?! ...of course they would want me to spill the beans on my plans, crafty bast ards. HOWEVER! This Hououin Kyouma will not be so easily tempted and fooled! For I KNEW it was a trap, but I have the world in the palm of my hand! Fuahahahahahahahahaha!!\"\n\nWhere do I even begin? Steins;Gate has to be one of the most captivating, tear-jerking, awe-inspiring stories of all time and the most amazing piece of media that exists today with one of the most interesting concepts of time-travel you've ever heard of. The best part? There's absolutely no plot-holes like in virtually every other time-travel story out there and everything wraps up neatly leaving you completely satisfied.\n\nSteins;Gate is a time travel sci-fi set in the real world and uses real life laws of physics; meaning that science and scientific theories are used and explained for time travel: no magic or extraterrestrials present. Steins;Gate also uses real-life phenomena and conspiracies such as the forum posts from the time-traveling John Titor in the year 2000 and the CERN conspiracy surrounding their ability to create mini black holes and integrates these into it's plot to make it work seamlessly.\n\nThe story of Steins;Gate puts you in the mind of Hououin Kyouma, a self-proclaimed 'mad scientist' who develops future gadgets in his lab with the objective of bringing chaos to the world's ruling structure and to thwart \"The Organization\" who are behind major conspiracies. In reality, Okabe Rintarou (his real name) is just a college student who rents out an apartment and hangs out with his friends and constructs \"future gadgets\" with random items they can find (ex. a toy raygun that functions as a TV remote, or a landmine repurposed as a de-humidifier). His \"Hououin Kyouma\" persona is all in his head, and his friends just roll with his chuunibyou.\n\nOne day, the lab constructs a future gadget called the \"PhoneWave (Name Subject to Change)\" that combines a microwave and a cellphone. This device's unintended side-effect allows people to send messages into the past and change the future. Around the time of this device's creation, a supposed time traveler with the pseudonym 'John Titor' appears on internet forums talking about how the organization SERN (CERN) uses time machines in 2036 to create a dystopia, and he has been sent back to warn people. This prompts Okabe to look more into SERN, and after doing so he realizes there are sick, dangerous secrets hidden behind the research organization.\n\nThe writers of Steins;Gate had obviously put lots of research, thought, and planning when creating it, and that dedication and attention to detail really makes this story so... timeless. [spoiler]Meaning: the story doesn't just suddenly start with \"one day the main character went on an adventure\" and end with \"he saved the day and this concludes his adventure\" No, Okabe's life is thought and planned out from start to finish, even though this story only covers a small window (4 weeks) of his life. Everyone else's lives were also planned out.[/spoiler] The writers even go so far as to explain (in depth) all of the scientific theories behind time travel, black holes, advanced technology, and so-on. This VN will give you a lot to think about and reflect on.\n\nThe gameplay is, well... it's a visual novel. However, Steins;Gate is different from conventional VNs, where you have many choice prompts throughout the story that branch into different paths. Instead, all gameplay comes from interactions with Okabe's phone. The 'branching paths' come from texting people back or calling a certain person when prompted to. The VN is more story oriented and focuses itself on that, while doing an excellent job of solidifying your role as Okabe Rintarou through the way you control his phone.\n\nThe music is great and immersive. Many of the game's soundtracks are remixes of Steins;Gate's central theme: Gate of Steiner, that are composed differently to set a certain mood. The music does a great job of making you anxious or ripping your heart apart.\n\nThere is an anime adaptation of Steins;Gate made, and I would highly reccomend watching Steins;Gate and then playing it through. The anime has a lot of the story cut out of it, but has more than enough to make it an amazing journey. After watching it, you'll want to come and play it because it turns a 10/10 anime into a 100/10 game. Also, it will give you extra motivation to grind your way through the first half of this game. I LOVE Steins;Gate, and even I admit this game is excruciatingly long at first. But make your way through it and mountains of gold await you.\n\nI CANNOT reccomend this game enough. Steins;Gate is completely captivating and because it holds itself to real life physics and science (apart from the whole time travel thing) it really convinces you of \"this makes a lot of sense and seems like it could've actually happened\". The characters are all lovable, and the transformation that Okabe Rintarou goes through during the course of the game is absolutely phenomenal.\n\nStop what you are doing and go watch Steins;Gate, give yourself a week or two to reflect on what you watched and let it sink in, and then come back and get all the juicy details and amazing extra story in this game.\n\n\"El.

Yes, you. The one with the vacant expression, eyes like a fish out of water, staring blankly at your dimly lit screen. You who browse this small marketplace of digital amusements to fulfill your empty life, devoid of purpose. Precisely you. Heed my words well, we have little time. Much like the fish in the sea does not know the world on land, you are unable to comprehend the existence beyond your bowl. Of course, the fish and the sea still exist nonetheless, but we'll get to that later. \n\n        For now, I shall enlighten you to something about what currently displays on your monitor, casting its shadows upon your dimly lit domicile. Do not be fooled by the esthetic art and euphonious background music, for this tale is in fact quite real. This is my memoir; My magnum opus to your ilk, documenting my struggle against the Organization, a clandestine group whose name is never truly uttered for fear that it might be overheard. \n\n        You may ask yourself why I would be so gracious, so benign that I would grant you this boon, as you will no doubt soon see I am far from benign. Don't trouble your tiny minds with such inquiry, for you'd never be able to understand my true intentions. I shall say only that this is my experiment, and you, you are my subjects. So enjoy, or tremble in fear if you may bear the curse of understanding the incomprehensible, as you embark upon this, my memories. Specifically, the story of how I created the most powerful and dangerous technology in the world, time travel. And how forces beyond even my view plotted to obtain it as I went about my daily life none the wiser and none the worse for wear. Until of course, those forces came to collect. And, remember that fate is not so forgiving as to be won in one try, but is at times so malleable that even a simple email might change its course. \n\n        But before you go off to experience my memories for yourself, a warning. The Organization I spoke of has censored this work in several ways, creating myriad issues which may impede your understanding. Be well informed though, that there is solution, a 'patch' which will repair these errors and present to you my memories in their original, uncorrupted state, created by my followers.[url=http://sonome.dareno.me/projects/sghd.html] You may find this additional patch, along with instructions on how to use it, here. [/url] \n\n        Ah, and one last thing. I shall elaborate further on my point from earlier.

Here's why Steins;Gate is so freakin' amazing.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to make it clear that this is the very original visual novel that released in 2009 for the Xbox 360 only in Japan, which then got its anime adaptation about a few years later. It was then ported to PC, PS Vita, PS3, finally Steam, and a pre-order bonus of its \"sequel\" that's only available through that on PS4.\n\nSteins;Gate hits hard, and I mean H A R D. It requires multiple saves to try and get all the endings, in-game images, and so on. This is a classic visual novel that deserves way more attention.\n\n\nI know what you're thinking: Should I play this or watch the anime? Well the anime captures at least 90% of the game, it's surprisingly perfect for an adaptation. Although if given the choice and you happen to own both or something, PLEASE PLAY THE VISUAL NOVEL. It has a superbly told story through the eyes of the main character, with many MANY heart wrenching moments that you could literally feel within the voice acting. \n\n\nFurthermore, have a tissue box ready. You're gonna spend at least a few months on this game if you're slow in-depth reader like me.

Apart from a few well known series like Danganronpa, Zero Escape, and Phoenix Wright, I can count the rest on one hand; and none of the previously mentioned are \"pure\" visual novels since they have a lot of gameplay elements mixed in to make them more engaging for a broader demographic.\n\nSeeing STEINS;GATE during a Steam sale, I was skeptical at first since the last true VN I read was marginally disappointing and soured my expectations for anything similar, but I decided to give it a chance all the same, and I can wholeheartedly say that I'm very glad that I did.\n\nThe first few chapters are a bit slow to build momentum, but the bountiful tidbits of science and the over-the-top characters kept me interested. At times, it felt like not much was going on, and the things that did happen were completely random, but in hindsight, the lengthy buildup is understandable since the story has a lot of rules to establish thanks to the time travel theme, as well as how the characters interact and relate to each other, which varies depending on the current timeline.\n\nThat being said, once I hit chapter 5...my god, did STEINS;GATE get GOOD! The story does a complete tonal shift and I quite literally could not stop myself from speed reading all the way to the very end. I just HAD to know if everyone achieved their happy ending; their perfect world. Almost all of the endings are so emotionally charged, I couldn't help but tear up each and every time. I never thought I'd care so much for these characters, and the raw emotion from just the spoken dialogue alone is so beautiful. I can't imagine STEINS;GATE working as anything other than a visual novel.\n\nIt's been a long time since I've become so invested in a story, so drawn to so many charming and lovable characters.
