{"reviews": [{"review": "A fun game to waste some time with, while it's not particularly deep or innovative, killing zombies is always one of my favorite past times.\n\nThe game has a few issues, and would probably be far better with some working controller support.  The K & M are ok for the time being though.  \n\nThe humor is kind of hit or miss, but ultimately the game is cheap and relatively fun to play.  Will be nice to see what new features or improvements the developer makes once he's able to get back to improving the game..", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1455863732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 22, "num_reviews": 111, "steamid": "76561198082995144", "num_games_owned": 9448}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516435", "timestamp_updated": 1455864096, "recommendationid": "21312418", "timestamp_created": 1455864096}, {"review": "I instantly fell in love with this game - Zelda set in an office with Zombies.\n\nThe dialogue is hilarious and the company where the story is set reminds me of my last job on a Monday morning.\nEven in Early Access there appears to be a great deal of content.

Favourite weapon is the mine. Although I just picked up some paperclips which are quite handy. Think that the spawning can be a bit annoying sometimes if you have low health and you duck round a corner or behind an obstacle only a for a zombie to spawn in front of you.\n\nThere's an awesome boss battle when you make it to the carpark... thats about as far as I've got so far..
