Where to start. How about the begining?\n\nAfter buying the game many months ago, spawning in for the first time and making the most horrid caracter possible, I find myself on a beautiful landscape. Palm trees, sand, and grass waving in the wind. Wow... I thought to myself, this game has amazing graphics.\n\n*Thump Thump... Turn around AN EVO!!!!\n\nA ricer walking to another grass patch to graze. HOLY\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665A DRIFTER THOUGH. \n\nThe rest is history, 700hrs of history on this beautiful game called Drift Street Japan\n\nPros:\nUnreal Engine 4 - Beautiful graphics with Dx12 coming SOON finally...\nIntense survival game - action packed. You Will Die!!!\ndrift cars - Nuff said\nBasically can do anything you want - given enough time and drive to do it\nExcellent development through alpha - Dev's have messed up a few times, but best alpha so far in my opinion\nMods - Turns this into a game where there is endless potential. Dev's even run contests for mods!\n\nCons:\nDifficult game to run - UE4 requires quite a beast pc to really make this game shine\nContent before Optimizations - Dev's have over and over pushed out content before polishing\nDifficult - Official servers can be troublesome if you can't play with a few people 32hrs a day. You Will Get Raided!\nFunbling around - Issues usually require YOU to fix with a workaround\nAlpha - Nuff said\n\nTo sum this up, I have racked up over 700hrs on DSJ. This review has included early game (early release) gameplay with issues with dsync, rubberbanding, and low fps. It has also included the middle of the road gameplay (halloween and Thanksgiving events) with new content every week and slowly moving to a polished game. And finally current gameplay (after Christmas and heading into March) I have been through the thick and thin with this game. Watching my entire existance on an official server getting blown up all the way to being a god, an admin for my unofficial drift server. I have a great pc being able to turn settings up and have headroom when there were performance issues. \n\nThis game really has had a very large range of ups and downs, BUT for the amount of money I spent on it ($5) this has EASILY been the most enjoyable, heart-pumping, fist-waving, and friend-making, game I HAVE EVER PLAYED and likely for many others. I have accepted the fact this was an alpha and bought a few weeks after it's release. The dev's have done a breathtaking job honestly on this game and made this probably one of the best alphas ever in steams history. They took on a racing/drifting game and blew it to another universe. For all the haters out there deciding their opinion on one aspect of the game, shouldn't have bought the damn thing in the first place.
