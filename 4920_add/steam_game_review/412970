{"reviews": [{"review": "Bought this game after I tried it elsewhere. I play it while medicated and let me tell you, the game is amazing! I especially loved first levels where it wasn't that hard yet. I like the visuals and all the star explosions feel amazing. Music does get repetetive somewhat, but I don't think anything can be done about that.\n\nTo the devs: I would like to ask you to add a dlc with levels that are fun to play rather than hard or fast to execute. I don't really play this game to be competetive in the scoreboard. I play it to relax and listen to awesome music. These are not complaints, I love the game, keep up guys! <thumbs up>", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501601617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 143, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198116427374", "num_games_owned": 51}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504945", "timestamp_updated": 1481629518, "recommendationid": "28341835", "timestamp_created": 1481629518}, {"review": "a kinect game for pc this is really written for a kinect on xbox one i do not see this as a pc game it sucks as a pc game save your money unless you like dorky kinect games you play with a mouse", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1451193086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 20, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561197976045691", "num_games_owned": 77}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478702", "timestamp_updated": 1452462318, "recommendationid": "20457454", "timestamp_created": 1452462318}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
