Now what used to be fine is for free and that is really awesome. It reminds me of the old NES Tengen games, from a period when games weren't that pretentious and were made focused on what really matters, which is having fun. Play it solo or along with friends, this is an underrated gem."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499745550, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496173", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33447255", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027451695", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1460427833, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 36770}, "timestamp_updated": 1499745550, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game. Many hours of play. A shame about requiring Java. I have a new computer, and I discovered Altitude requires Java to run because Java was not installed on the new computer. I will not play Altitute again until Java is not required, as I am not installing Java on my computer."}]}
