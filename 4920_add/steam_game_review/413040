{"reviews": [{"review": "For my first impression of the game, I would say this is a very casual game.  I am one to rage quite often but this was pretty fun to play. It is a classic hack and slash game which you embark on this adventure to save your friends! Below are my pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\n- Fun, good way to pass time\n- Easy, does not induce great amounts of rage\n- It makes me look like I a gaming lord\n- Didn't encounter any bugs. Gameplay was smooth\n- Classic hack and slash\n- Great pricing point\n\nCons:\n- May be a little too easy\n- Little challenge was saw \n- Controls seem to only be for controller\n- Combat can be a bit mindless. More button mashing that combos\n\n\nGameplay if you fancy it:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpPLTwyo6Dw", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1490165862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 110, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198201609369", "num_games_owned": 18}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502950", "timestamp_updated": 1489734147, "recommendationid": "30564373", "timestamp_created": 1489734147}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
