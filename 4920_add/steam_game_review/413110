As other reviews are saying, if you like the look of the game and want to support the developers -- buy it. I can tell that this is going to be a good game, but right now there isn't that much to do and what is there isn't polished.\n\nHowever, the 3 hours I've played at the time of writing this review have been fun (although I spent at least half of that time exploring one single tile of the map that was supposed to have a dungeon in it until I eventually gave up...those tiles are BIG). The world generation system (gods) and the variety of classes are the best things about it at this stage, and there's plenty more planned. Everything the developers say they'll implement between now and final realase sounds awesome.\n\nI guess the main negative for me is that you've got no direction when you start the game up -- and even though exploring allows you to discover towns, dungeons and events on the map, the map tiles cover such a wide area it's difficult to find the point of interest. But hey, maybe that's just my bad navigation skills.\n\nIt's also worth noting that I haven't tried this in multiplayer yet, but I reckon it'll be a lot more fun with friends even in its current state and I'm especially looking forward to playing on big servers when the cap is raised to 200.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1480993246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 402, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198052159257", "num_games_owned": 369}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507309", "timestamp_updated": 1478551383, "recommendationid": "26479424", "timestamp_created": 1478551383}, {"review": "I was not part of Alpha 3, which was the test given to backers before the game released on Early Access.

This is for players who wish to help in the development process by finding and reporting bugs.  Many of the unique features in Hero's Song have not been added into the game yet.  However the developers at Pixelmage Games have been pumping out updates frequently.  At this stage the game may not live up to your high expectations, but don't despair.  Heros Song has a lot of potential and will soon shape up to be a great game (especially once they release the bard class :D).", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1479567521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1481, "num_reviews": 7, "steamid": "76561198128432805", "num_games_owned": 34}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504032", "timestamp_updated": 1478553240, "recommendationid": "26479818", "timestamp_created": 1478553240}, {"review": "Development has ceased.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1481378051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197981620841", "num_games_owned": 770}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506204", "timestamp_updated": 1482879202, "recommendationid": "28730019", "timestamp_created": 1482879202}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 47, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 38, "num_reviews": 20, "total_reviews": 85, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
