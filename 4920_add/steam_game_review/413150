It is very similar to Harvest Moon or rune factory, though there are a few things that I noticed were different in terms of how I enjoy playing it. At a certain point in Harvest Moon, you're pretty much time gated into spending more time on grinding your farm to wait for specific seasons to get items to further progress the story of the game. This led to me selling my livestock and sleeping through whole seasons. Stardew Valley really encourages you to progress, spend time with villagers. The mine area doesn't feel like an after thought or just another spot to get resources to sell. The sound track is memorable and relaxing as well (I find myself humming the spring song on a regular basis). From what they've said about multiplayer, it's supposed to be really in depth (other players will be able to do anything the main character can, though the main character must make critical decisions). This game is a labor of love, and it really shows. 100% recommend it! :3", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505591363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 21083, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198048901901", "num_games_owned": 66}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521561", "timestamp_updated": 1504655277, "recommendationid": "34766548", "timestamp_created": 1504655277}, {"review": "an amazing farming game that makes you want to play more and more. this is the game that i always wanted!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1507100495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4034, "playtime_forever": 5101, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198364256112", "num_games_owned": 72}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526349", "timestamp_updated": 1505881271, "recommendationid": "35077372", "timestamp_created": 1505881271}, {"review": "Just one more day and ill go to sleep.\n\n(27 hours later)\n\nJust one more day and ill go to sleep.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1507064360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3139, "playtime_forever": 4338, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198085212745", "num_games_owned": 62}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 6, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515086", "timestamp_updated": 1506813294, "recommendationid": "35357240", "timestamp_created": 1506813294}, {"review": "great combat more immerisive then skyrim", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1499928077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3887, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198072469165", "num_games_owned": 81}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_updated": 1505191666, "recommendationid": "34895089", "timestamp_created": 1505191666}, {"review": "This game is so good, really addictive\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506734046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1382, "playtime_forever": 8316, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198146018059", "num_games_owned": 42}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_updated": 1505733632, "recommendationid": "35043342", "timestamp_created": 1505733632}, {"review": "Games like these never intrested me i started playing games in 2009 but I grew up anti games but when i turned 19 and around then i got bored and then tryed a game out...long story short here i am and\nI almost didnt get this game but all my friends kept saying its amazing game so i put it on my wishlist as a bookmark and after almost a year i desided to buy it cause i was bored yet again...=P\n\nOMG! \nim so glad i did who new id be so into this game the graphics(me thinking its a silly korny game) oh was i so wrong...\nThis game may have silly graphics until you relise its not silly graphics its cute graphics =)\n\nThis game so cute and adorable and amazing!\n\nI'm so shocked...cause this game so addictive its so much fun so much to do so much you want to do and next thing u know you bin up all night and you still want to do more but you need sleep and then you relise you and your ingame character are suffering from the same dilemma.=P\n\nIf you are debating buying this game then...=(\nI just want to say i did too for a long time but you will regret it when or if u end buying it and playing it and  then you will wish u bought it sooner=P\nIf your a sims 3 fan like me then this game is for you like it is for me.\nDon't make my mistake!
