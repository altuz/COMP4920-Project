{"reviews": [{"review": "Metal Assault is a fun take on Metal slug only different, it features multiple weapons and skills for 4 unique characters.\n\nFor people playing the game for the first time its a fun way to pass the time and not take it seriously and just enjoy the mayhem unfolding right in your eyes, use abilities and unlocking more powerful weapons along the way.\n\nBut for anyone who played it prior to Aeria shutting down the game I would sadly not recommend it right now as it was not like it used to be. Features and weapons are already unlockable unlike the past where you need to level them up, but besides that nothing much else, some vendor weapons from the previous game were not even implemented. Story itself seems unfinished and sometimes lags and crashes your game along the way. People abusing private matches to gain rare drops and items as opposed to the random drops, and the feature \"Paying\" better weapons was not changed even back then. \nDont get me wrong i love the game ive played it since Aeria published it and had a blast but some features are just lacking, they listen to complaints but releases weapons packs and payable features as opposed to bug fixes, security check up and a major update.\n\nPro's:\n+Nastalgic gameplay for previous players\n+Enjoyable matches\n+Fun characters\n+Weapons and clothes can be unlocked early\n\nCon's:\n-Some bugs are not fixed\n-Story seems unfinished\n-A huge disadvantage for new players as they would sometimes be paired againts players with more equipement and armour.\n-Features such as payable weapons and clothes that enhances the players damage/armour and speed is already a \"Pay to Win\" scenario.\n-Lag for majority of players\n-No dedicated server for different regions\n\nOverall for new players its a good game to give it a try, but for a player who played the game in the past I would sadly not recommend it right now without any major update in the game, until then i wouldnt recommend it.\n\nJust throwing my two cents here, besides its up to you to see it for yourself.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1482794609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 8223, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198012430026", "num_games_owned": 76}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501016", "timestamp_updated": 1487052915, "recommendationid": "29915082", "timestamp_created": 1487052915}, {"review": "in self is a good a game realy but no one is playing this anymore i doubt this game game gona keep a live for too long", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1486666870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 35, "num_reviews": 48, "steamid": "76561198062520500", "num_games_owned": 369}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1486676344, "recommendationid": "29810726", "timestamp_created": 1486676344}, {"review": "Top gostei muito do game", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1482892285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 62, "num_reviews": 62, "steamid": "76561198267968546", "num_games_owned": 241}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1485631384, "recommendationid": "29548389", "timestamp_created": 1485631384}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
