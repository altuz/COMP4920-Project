{"reviews": [{"review": "To prepare for the Western release of Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony, I have spent the last week (82 hours!) playing both Dangaronpa 1 and 2 back to back, there is also the spin-off Ultra Despair Girls, which I aim to get round to at some point. A friend insisted that I play the games, so when I saw the bundle on the Steam summer sale, I figured why not?\n\nNow, I am quite fond of visual novels but I did not expect the games to be so long. But is it oh so worth it, the Danganronpa games are among some of the best visual novels that I have ever played. Danganronpa is not your usual fare of just talking to people and making different choices/using different items to affect and potentially change the branching storyline(s).\n\nThere is no branching storyline in these games, it is always the same result: the same people are murdered, the same people are the murderers and the executions are the same. Considering the length of these games though, thats a good thing.\n\nSomewhat akin to the Persona games, you can hang out with your friends and bond with them, learning more of their backstory and gaining abilities from them, sadly there is no proper romance option, even if characters flirt with you. Its easy enough to bond with them, wait until you have free time, then track them down, occasionally answer a question from them and then give an item they like. Don't go expecting to max everyone's bonds in one run though, its impossible and thats what the post-game School mode is for.\n\nEach classmate has their own unique personality and backstory that is fleshed out more with each conversation. Some are sad, some mysterious, and some are humorous, these changing how you view them. Sakura for example initially comes off as intimidating due to her size and how ripped she is, but as you get to know her she turns out to be a gentle soul who only wants the best for everyone.\n\nThe premise of Danganronpa is as follows: you play Makoto Naegi, a simple and average student who was chosen at random in a lottery for a place at Hope's Peak Academy, a school for the elite of the elite. Home to students who are the \"ultimates\" in their particular field, Makoto is known as the Ultimate Lucky Student and is thus looked on down initially by his fellow students.\n\nMakoto meets up with the 14 other students that round out the cast, such as the Ultimate Martial Artist, Sakura Ogami, Leon Kowata, the Ultimate Baseball Star, and Chihiro Fujisaki, the Ultimate Programmer. However, shortly after meeting them, everything goes to hell, the school is sealed in, you are told to go to the gym and there.... you meet Monokuma, the villain of the game. Did I mention that he happens to be a robot bear?\n\nFrom here, the core of the game is set out. Monokuma sets up a motive to get the students killing each other, which they then have to investigate and deduce the correct killer through debate and clues, but if they get it wrong then he executes all of them instead. But Monokuma doesn't want a straight up bloodbath where just one person murders a bunch of people, he has rules in place to make things more interesting, at least for him. The killer (s) can only kill a max of two students, accomplices will not \"graduate\" if the killer is not identified, these are just some of the rules he has in place, adding more as the game progresses.\n\nClass trials are divided into a variety of mini-games. For the most part you will be using \"truth bullets\" which are made from the clues you gathered during the investigation phase, and are used to shoot down others statements to prove them wrong and advance the trial. You can also absorb statements for a new truth bullet unique to that particular debate.\n\nAt certain points you will have to battle someone in a rhythm based section where you have to time a button press to the beat to shoot their statements down to the point that they agree with you. Later trials up the difficulty by throwing in white lines, which cover up statements and can be shot down for bonus time, but are removed on the lower difficulty.\n\nUpon voting for the killer, and assuming you were correct, you are treated to a cutscene in which Monokuma executes them, gloriously themed to match the killer's talent.\n\nAfter each class trial and the subsequent execution of the blackened (what the killer is referred to in this), another floor of the school is unlocked for you to explore and find clues about the whole situation.  I liked this way of unlocking the map as it rewarded you for successfully beating a class trial by giving you more lore and items to unlock.\n\nMusically, Danganronpa is brilliant, Monokuma's theme in particular is great. The voice acting is excellent too, with the option to have Japanese audio with English subtitles if thats what you prefer.\n\nDanganronpa was initially released for the PSP way back in 2010 and got a PC release last year. Which means that the graphics obviously aren't cutting edge but it does the job. What really shines in Danganronpa though is the writing.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1504914980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2214, "num_reviews": 38, "steamid": "76561198055631052", "num_games_owned": 891}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522232", "timestamp_updated": 1505415855, "recommendationid": "34955235", "timestamp_created": 1505415855}, {"review": "[h1] Introduction [/h1]\nI originally played the PSP version of this game in 2013 (around the time the anime series aired) patched with a fan translation. The gameplay between each version is obviously the same, but this version includes both English and Japanese voice acting as well as a localized script for the game rather than a more direct translation often used in fan translations. It's been a long time since I've played the fan translation so I'm not sure how the two versions compare to each other, however I don't think the localization present in this version of the game is bad at all.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThere are two game types in this game \u2015 the standard mode and \"School\" mode (which plays like a regular life-sim and is unlocked by completing the main game). The standard mode follows the events known in game as the \"Killing School Life,\" where 15 \"Ultimate\" students are trapped within their school and forced into a killing game where the only way to escape the school is to commit murder without being caught. This is the story mode of the game, so besides the basic plot summary, I don't want to go into too much detail about the events of the game because it is best to be discovered by playing; what I can go into detail about is how the game is played. The game consists of three phases:\n[olist]\n   [*]Daily Life \u2015 this phase plays mostly like a Visual Novel. You can (and will have to) explore the school. During free time you can interact with the other characters and grow closer to them to gain special abilities that give you bonuses in other parts of the game. During this phase fixed story events can happen instead of free time.\n   [*]Deadly Life \u2015 the game enters this phase after a murder occurs. It consists of an investigation into the murder. It's up to you to find clues and talk to the other characters for their own accounts (both clues and testimonies are known as \"Truth Bullets\") to use during the next phase of the game.\n   [*]Class Trial \u2015 this is the action-oriented phase of the game. There are multiple minigames that take place during Class Trials that involve you needing to use the right Truth Bullets to advance the trial and find out who the murderer is. \n[/olist]\n\n[h1] Class Trial Minigames [/h1]\n[olist]\n   [*]\"Nonstop Debates\" the goal is to shoot down weaknesses and contradictions in the statements made by other characters with the correct Truth Bullet; if you use the wrong one, your influence gauge (health) is reduced. These get more and more complex as the game progresses.\n   [*]\"Hangman's Gambit\" requires you to fill in the missing letters of a word in order to reveal the correct piece of evidence. Shooting the wrong letter will also reduce your influence gauge.\n   [*]\"Bullet Time Battles\" are one-on-one debates between you and another character where you need to point out the flaw in their argument. You do this by shooting down their objections through a rythmn game where right-clicking locks on to a statement, and left clicking shoots it. Shooting down their statements reduces their influence gauge, while letting their statements reach you will reduce yours. These also get more complex as the game progresses.\n   [*]The final minigame type is the \"Closing Argument.\" In this the goal is to piece together the sequence of events in a comic book style, filling in the blank panels with the correct event. If you put the wrong event in a blank panel, your influence gauge goes down.\n[/olist]\nThere are three different difficulty settings for the game and the difficulty for action and logic are set independent from each other (much like the seperate combat difficulty and puzzle difficulty settings in the Silent Hill games) so you can change them to suit what's most fun for you.\n\n[h1] Sound [/h1]\nLike I said earlier I orignally played this game using a fan translation, so I was already used to the Japanese voice acting for the game. The Japanese voice acting is great and I would certainly recommend playing with that just from a purist's perspecive. When I replayed the game after buying it on Steam, I decided to play the game with English voice acting so that I could compare the two. For the most part, the English voice actors do a good job in playing their parts and I thought the voices fit the characters well. \n\nMy only complaint is in the voice acting for Naegi and Monokuma. Something about Bryce Papenbrook's voice just bothers me. I feel bad, but I have yet to find a role he has played where I liked his voice. Brian Beacock as Monokuma doesn't feel right to me either. It's entirely subjective so maybe it won't be as off putting to someone else, but the biggest deal killer for me was his Monokuma laugh. I know it's an increadibly petty thing to dismiss an entire performance for, but Beacock's just does not come close to Nobuyo \u014cyama's.\n\nThe music in the game is fantastic, and Masafumi Takada did a really good job composing music to fit the various moods of the game. I don't really have much to say other than I just really like the music in this game.\n\n[h1] Visuals [/h1]\nThe character art for the game has a very obvious Anime art style, however the game is presented with a sort-of cardboard cutout aesthetic. It gives the game a bit of interesting visual flair, however there is no escaping the fact that this type of aesthetic gives the game a somewhat flat look at times. This wouldn't be a problem (and most of the time it isn't), however sometimes certain objects can overlap when you rotate the camera and can make it difficult to spot or click on (though this problem is extremely easy to solve as all you have to do rotate the camera again). \n\nThe dedication to the cardboard cutout look is stuck with throughout the whole game, with objects and characters falling into place when you enter a room. This can get very tedious, as you have to watch this everytime you enter a room. In cases where one room is only accessable from another room, you need to watch this 3 times \u2015 when you enter the first room, when you enter the room you want to go to, and when you enter the first room for a second time in order to return to the school hallways. This can be avoided by fast traveling with the map screen, but you can only fast travel to specified locations.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nDanganronpa is a great game. The music is great, and the gameplay is solid. Both the English and Japanese voice acting are solid for the most part, and the visuals are enjoyable enough. The story develops at a somewhat slow pace but the overall mystery kept me interested until the end. Some characters are more developed that others, resulting in some characters being two-dimensional and are only there to fill in typical anime-archtypes. The game is hurt by repetitive and tedious aspects, such as daily morning/nighttime announcements, loads of flashbacks, the room transitions mentioned above, etc., but overall it doesn't keep me from enjoying or recommending this game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506049649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_forever": 2047, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561197983052389", "num_games_owned": 532}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516114", "timestamp_updated": 1504674656, "recommendationid": "34766651", "timestamp_created": 1504655807}, {"review": "Well, hello there. Before we go any further i want to say that this is not a normal Review. It is a story. A story on how i became a hypocritical monster... And it contains spoilers for Chapter 1.\n\n[h1]And so it begins:[/h1]\n\nI've been someone who just straight up hated Anime and everything that has anything to do with it. I've been laughing about friends who've been liking that and was disgusted just seeing Japanese Animations. Then i played a game named \"NieR: Automata\" And i really liked it. I was able to talk myself out of the truth being like \"This is not Anime...I'm only playing this one Japanese Game.\"\n\nCouple Months later....Summer Sale. And there it was. Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. It wasnt just any innocent Japanese or slight Anime game. It was that kind who seemed to be the worst of the worst: Visual Novels. But it seemed interesting. I bought it. I waited until it was night, made myself comfortable and turned on this game. And well, i didn't fucking like it at all...\n\nBut i kept going for the first few hours to check if it would get better. That one Character, Sayaka Maizono was one of the Reasons i hated it at the beginning. She was so cute and being like \"AW I WANNA BE YOUR PERSONAL ASSISTANT\" i was about to puke on my desk. But then it happened....\n\nOur Protagonist Makoto Naegi checks his shower, and he sees Maizono with a Knife in the Stomache laying there. That made me interested. And then finding out why and how she got killed, actually made me sad. At the end of Chapter 1 i was completely enchanted.\n\n[h1]The End:[/h1]\n\nThis game changed me, and i am very happy i found this.\nMakoto is a piece of sh*t tho.\nHagakure is the real hero, i'm sure of it.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505584572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1863, "num_reviews": 37, "steamid": "76561198168804685", "num_games_owned": 419}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 4, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510656", "timestamp_updated": 1505546157, "recommendationid": "34989816", "timestamp_created": 1505546120}, {"review": "Danganronpa is a murder mystery game with a great setting, great characters (mostly), and great twist and story.

It can lead to heartbreaks.\n\n* I often hear others say the trials are long and last hours, but I was able to complete [b]most[/b] of them within 30mins-1hour.\nI beat the game in 33 hours.\n\n* The soundtrack is great, it doesn't fail to help get immsersed in the experience.\n\n* When there is voice acting, which is mainly during the trials, it isn't bad. It isn't great either, but its not bad at all.\n\n[u]The Negatives[/u]\nThere aren't that many negatives to the game.\n\n* As I mentioned earlier, some of the characters are pretty annoying. During the trials you'll just want them to stop talking since they're not adding anything, but they're obviously there to add some humor, it just didn't work for me personally.\n\n[spoiler]Only 3 characters, including yourself, really even DO anything in the trials, while everyone else either makes humorous comments, calls accusations, just ask questions, or just repeat what there is an understanding of. From time to time one of the other characters may say something interesting, but it isn't common.[/spoiler]\n\n* During the game you will be given [b]Free Time[/b] which is when you can initially build friendships with fellow students.\nThis is basically useless. It doesn't really add much to the story, except maybe learning some of that characters background, which itself is not really much as you only learn very small aspects about them that you really wont care much about.\nIt wont really effect the story, it wont add anything to trials, there is no actual \"relationship\" that is built, no dialogue is added to the story, no connection is made between your character and them.\nYou get perks, which you wont even really need. That's it.\nThere is nothing that happens between you and the other characters that is based off your friendship level. No extra dialague that will be added throughout gameplay, nothing. Its not even like you do any activities together. \n\nYou literally only get perks and a very very small backstory that will make hardly any difference as to how you see the character.\nYou are given an option to hang out with them, or not. If you choose to hangout with them, it will say \"you grew closer to each other\", and that is it. Then eventually you're given a perk, and that is it. They get a star next to their name in your book, and that ends that. No bond is actually built, there is no relationship or dating, there is no added dialague throughout the game...\n\nWith some, you may have an interesting conversation once you do max out your friendship, but its a one time deal, and as I keep saying it makes no difference to what happens later in the game. No reference is ever made to your friendship with that character.\n\nAs you may tell, this is probably the biggest problem in the game, which should actually say a lot on how good the game actually is, seeing as this problem isn't ACTUALLY that big of a deal. :)\n\n\n* This game had a really bad habit of pretending to give you an option in a situation, when there was no actual option at all.\n\nEx: \nGame: Do you want [milk] or [eggs]?\nMe: I choose [milk]\nGame: Oops! Sorry there is no [milk]!\nGame: So do you want [milk] or [eggs]?\nMe: ................\n(This isn't in the game, this is just an example I made up to show what the game does)\n\n* There were a few unanswered questions. Danganronpa fans may say \"They're answered in the sequals\", but they aren't story based questions, but more logical questions that are left unanswered.\n[spoiler]How were the execution machines even built?[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]Why was there a control room built in the first place?[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]Why was the court room built in the first place?[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]How did Monokuma manage to achieve the motives?[/spoiler]\n\nI could be picky, and add some small negatives that don't effect the atmosphere at all, like being able to run around in first person and not look staight up or staight down, but as I said that is just being picky and doesn't effect the atmosphere or story at all.\n\n[h1]Rating[/h1]\nThis is a game you'll have to play for yourself. For most, I think, it takes [b]days[/b] to beat because they don't grind it, but I grinded the game and it took me 33hrs to beat.\n\nThere is a bonus, uncanon, \"school mode\" that you can play that is about building replicas of the bearbot (lol) and building friendships with the other students that you may not have during the story mode, however like I said no actual relationship is built.
