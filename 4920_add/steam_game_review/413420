However, the murderous Monokuma returns to host yet another killing game. This time, the stakes are that you're only allowed off the island if you murder a classmate and get away with it. The execution of this plot is done extremely well.\n\nThe game is broken up into 3 different gameplay styles. These are known as Daily Life, Deadly Life, and the Class Trial. Daily Life and Deadly Life are the same as the first game, giving you time to bond with your classmates and exploring the island and giving you time to investigate the murder of your classmates respectively.\n\nThe Class Trial is broken up in the same way as well, with there being novel sections that show revelations in the plot and in the murder case, and numerous mini games that lead into these novel sections. The minigames, however, are very different from the first game. The only minigames that retained its format from the first game are Bullet Time Battle (renamed to Panic Talk Action) Nonstop Debate. (Improved) Hangmans Gambit has been altered from a point and click spelling game into a matching puzzle game where you actually have to think about what you're doing. Rebuttal Showdown and Logic Dive are the new minigames introduced in Danganronpa 2. Rebuttal Showdown is a lot like nonstop debate, but instead of sitting through a series of statements from numerous different people, you slice through statements made by a single person with the WASD keys, and then you use Truth Blades to cut through contradictions within their arguments. Logic Dive is the other new minigame and is played as a runner style game where you jump over pits, and dodge blockades while answering questions to get further in the case.\n\nTL;DR\nStory: 9.5/10 No obvious plotholes, but some minor pacing issues\nGameplay: 9/10 Gameplay is extremely fun for almost the entire game, but it has its dull moments.\nMusic: 9.5/10 Soundtrack is superb\nOverall Rating: 9.5/10", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505438778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2281, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198077786565", "num_games_owned": 157}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1505688090, "recommendationid": "35034667", "timestamp_created": 1505688090}, {"review": "Purchased this to temporarily quench my thirst for Danganronpa content while waiting for V3, and did not regret the decision.\n\nWhile I had long before watched an LP and knew exactly what would happen and who'd die during each chapter (including my ultimate DR favorite) I managed to enjoy every single minute of it and played through the game in a couple of days.
