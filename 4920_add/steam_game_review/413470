{"reviews": [{"review": "The cardinal has a mission for you: stop the terror by the hand of an inquisitor in a remote village in Spain. Many innocents people died and it's time for you to understand why he's so interested in an old woman, Miguela. But nothing is easy in that cold town, where the sun never shows itself and where old feuds are strong in the heart of those who fell to hate.\n\nIf you played Where Angels Cry, you take back the role of the monk investigating his own brothers (well, in the church, not his own family) that seemed to have lost themselves to whatever vicious feeling they're currently having. However, now, the story is way more elaborated than the first game and is more polished. However, the ending isn't really satisfying. It cuts abruptly and you can only speculate. Even the bonus chapter isn't explaining it, it's more a prequel and an explanation of how the things came to be.\n\nNow, the game is more oriented towards an hidden object setting, as you have scenes of them, that are easy and interesting. Even if Where Angels Cry is standard in this field (find items, use them and solve puzzles), it's more satisfying than in the previous game. Puzzles are easy and well explained. However, there is a major problem: you're often lost at what to do. Even in Casual, with the map showing the actions you need to do, you're asking yourself what you're missing. I got stuck in Ramon's house because the area that I needed wasn't clear. It's just a little disappointment given the great improvement of the game.\n\nAnd the game improved also in terms of graphics: they're better: the characters seem more alive than in the first game, despite being in a winter decorum, the backgrounds are quite cheerful and colorful, in other words, it seems less outdated. The soundtrack also improved and was way more fitting into the story. However, better graphics don't mean that you can put everything in an hidden object game. I was under the impression sometimes that items were not medieval at all, despite the game being in the 13th century.\n\nWhere Angels Cry: Tears of the Fallen is a very good surprise, especially if you played the first game. Everything improved greatly, even if there are still some little problems. However, I've been more \"active\" in this opus than the first one. The price is perhaps a little high, even if it's a collector's edition, however, it's still a worthy purchase. If you played Where Angels Cry, I urge you to try Tears of the Fallen, so that you don't stay on your impression of the first game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1460197447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 225, "num_reviews": 352, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "num_games_owned": 2214}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522116", "timestamp_updated": 1459521936, "recommendationid": "22179158", "timestamp_created": 1459521917}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
