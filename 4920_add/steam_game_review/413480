{"reviews": [{"review": "Ok where do i begin.....I have never personally wrote a review on anything i think in my life but this game and its developers plust staff deserve my worship and praise....To start off, when i bought the game i bought it because i had a friend who played it on xbox one...It looked so addicting and amazing so i decided i had to have it for my self.. >XD......I bought the game and downloaded it...Started it up, and it did not work!!!! I tried and tried to fix the issue my self. The issue was that i am using a 32 inch Flat screen emerson tv for a moniter so its a little squirly at times with new games to get the resolution correct to play the games....well this was one of the games....I tried and tried and finally got the resolution correct and got the game to show up on my screen...BUT then the image wasnt alligned with the acually \"button\" behind the image...so when i went to click on play i had to acually move my mouse to the bottom of the screen...I emailed the staff and devs furiously....Quickly within a few hours they responed and wanted to know what my issue was...I explained and took screen shots and emailed them back...well within a day they had a solution to my problem, or atleast thought we did....It didnt work...well i emailed them back letting them know it didnt work...another couple of hours and they emailed be pack letting me know the devs would get to gether and discuss how to fix my issue and it might take a day or two, and to send them some info from my files on the game crash....so i emailed them the files and some more screenshots and details of the issue...I will admitt it took a few days to get a response out of them but when they responed they updated me on the progress of the devs on fixing my issue...well after almost a week they had a solution again...they had in an email attach a fix for my game which would bassicly reset my game and have it set to the right resolution settings for me personally. i was estatic, thinking i was specialy getting a fix just for me from the devs hehe...i downloaded the fix, my game updated and i tried to load it...YES IT WORKED, or so i thought....it reset my game back to normal so it would work correctlly, but it didnt fix the resolution so i was back to square one again witrh the orginal issue....i emailed the devs letting them know and they responed quickly stateing to give them some time and they would come up with a solution again...well almost a week went by and i emailed to check the progress, they emailed me back letting me know they were still working on the fix...almost another week went by and i emailed to check again...well i waited a day or two and one of the publishers in charge over the devs personally emailed me and said that in a coup,e days they would release a full update on the game to fix the problem for me and anyone else who might have this again...and in about 3 days, i went to get on steam and the game had an update...i let it update...then i clicked play and..........IT WORKED FOR REAL THIS TIME!!!!!! I can now play the full game, no resolution issues, no screen mishaps, nothing...its perfectly running order now...I played it for 4 hours straight after i emailed the devs thanking them of course....then after 4 hours of play i hit a bug...the game went black and i had to restart my computer...i emailed the devs letting them know about the new issue...within 2 days i had another update form steam on the game...i downloaded...and now i play :) IT WORKS PERFECTLY NOW.

The game offers up a neat package of cartoony gore-filled visuals, amusing sound design and simple dark humour delivered through an increasingly complex series of puzzle rooms. You are expected to use your creativity to strategically place tools and traps to guide your unwitting Splatt victims to their untimely demise.\n\nIn my short time with the game, the variety and level design steadily opened itself up to more fun and nuanced ways to attain the objectives in mind, and in this aspect the game is a success from what I have seen. The core mechanics are solid and this makes the gameplay fun for those with an interest in this type of creative messing around. There are many issues which can make this frustrating though, and this game is held back by some of its detractions, most of which are technical in nature.\n\nThe first problem I noticed was the messy menu system, which was awkward and dated, not to mention strangely unoptimized as I experienced frequent stutters and frame drops while navigating on my system which is far in excess of the recommended specs for this game (this was not noticed in normal gameplay.) The customisation and options are rather limited and sparse, but do the job on a basic level. The tutorial levels were also sparse and basic, and left a lot to be desired; a person new to this type of game might not find very much use in them. I found myself struggling with janky camera controls at times, making setting up my traps become moderately frustrating when I wanted to repeat levels to achieve maximum score. To mention score, the addition of online leaderboards was a nice touch but where this game misses the mark massively is the lack of any player made workshop content, a level editor would be a great boost to this titles longevity and replayability. \n\nFundamentally this is a game that is going to work for a specific kind of player who enjoys crude humour and screwing around in sandboxy puzzle environments. If you're not that type of guy, there are other games on the market for the money which will introduce you to the genre more effectively. If you're just looking for something new which offers up a few hours of casual, albeit limited fun, then this game is worth a buy.\n\ntl;dr 6/10 maybe buy it if you're into puzzlers.\n\n\n\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1487511550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 70, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561197989822283", "num_games_owned": 110}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": true, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1487515336, "recommendationid": "30036507", "timestamp_created": 1487515336}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "review_score": 6, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 11, "total_reviews": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive"}, "success": 1}
