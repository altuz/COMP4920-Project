{"reviews": [{"review": "I'll try and set aside my own feelings about alphas and version 0.01s being released as Early Access titles (in short, they shouldn't be) and do what the developers have asked: provide some helpful feedback based on my experience with the game.\n> Most of the NPCs do not walk or follow any sort of path restricted by the usual laws of physics. Lisa floats across the ground like the Woman in Black diving in for the kill and Craig flees into the side of a train once he finishes his conversation with you.\n> The character voices are set at a volume somewhere between 'miniaturized children from Honey I Shrunk The Kids screaming for help' and 'housefly's dying breath'.\n> You press '2' to activate the flashlight. Not '1'. Also, seeing as you can't take them with you, it may be helpful to refrain from clustering every battery in the game within about twenty feet of each other at the start location.\n> There are four epilepsy medication bottles to collect. Not three.\n> After growing bored with my attempts to locate train parts for Craig in exchange for a spare tyre, the game randomly dropped the tyre on my head from out of thin air and instructed me to return to my car. I obeyed and the game froze. Did I win?\n\nOther than these technical errors, I feel that for a game revolving around an international cabal, you diminish the epic scope of the setting by sending the player on fetch quests for medicine, hidden train parts and spare tyres. I admittedly have no idea what you have planned in regards to the next chapter or, indeed, any that might follow it but I am wary of Craig's refusal to give me my tyre and can foresee myself doing his ironing and cleaning his toilets for the remainder of the game while he continues to make excuses.\n\nBehold this madness.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elfBo3xP6ps", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1448283700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 37, "num_reviews": 115, "steamid": "76561198169311898", "num_games_owned": 1798}, "language": "english", "developer_response": "Great review, we really appreciate the detailed bug reports! We've just released a hotfix (v0.1a) to address most of the issues you mentioned. As you've said We're still very much in alpha and there's plenty more to come.
