Quick aciton sort of chaotic fast pace but not really distracting. Rocket fist bounce off wall at angles and then pick them up and throw them again sort of like porcunipine  but faster.

Frequently you throw a ball and it just runs through the enemy. This, by itself, is a game breaker. Besides, having the ball at your side may be cute, but this makes the game confusing, as you move to one direction, but shoot to another.\n\nIt would be interesting:\n- to have different buttons for dash and throwing the ball, as sometimes you're too close to the enemy and want to back off before shooting.\n- if when you get a multiple kill, something is shown, like \"double kill\", \"triple kill\", etc\n\nI found an \"undocummented feature\" (also known as bug) where the level you go to isn't nescessarily the level you're going to play.
