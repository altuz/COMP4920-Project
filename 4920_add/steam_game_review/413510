{"reviews": [{"review": " Early Alpha Review, ok so this game has really good potential < and yes this word is used so much when it comes to early access games and is a word i rarely use. but hell i will use it for once.. and please no judging -_-.... The Extinction is great mix of action,stratagy, space, and arcade. with some roguelike rpg elements, that blends in a great 2.5D environment. i conquered the first planet and it took a couple trys but i didnt give up, i found out from the combat that guns really do hurt and going head on is not the way to go and what i mean by that is because there can be so many ships to deal with that flying foward them and shooting wont necessarily work... why you ask its because going against like ten ships while they consistenly shoot at a fairly fast rate, and would kill you fast if dodging isn't your strong suit, and the fact when you shoot and they shoot head on just destroys those bullets when they clash.. so head on is horrible. so i found a way with a game controller all you need to do is fly backwards. it makes dodging around them very easy and very easy to take down, its weird yes but thats my opinion. any ways its a good start with a couple side missions you can do and a three planets that you can conquer from easy to hard, with the ability to build resource machines that can give you more iron and fuel. and when you conquer a planet you can do it again to play more, rank more and get more resources, and to get use to the game mechanics of course.. so do i rrecommend... of course there's not alot here to show just yet but when you play it, you get the feel that the developer is on to something great... and for 2.99 you honestly can't go wrong. their is a few hiccups here and there, but its a good start, and it is alpha.\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1462912748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 123, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198024732931", "num_games_owned": 463}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514471", "timestamp_updated": 1446506518, "recommendationid": "18847698", "timestamp_created": 1446506518}, {"review": "Nicely done 2D space shoote, great soundtrack, playable and pretty fun, very good explosions.

This game seems awesome. It has great potential for an Early access game and the modes that already exist are amazing. It is a good twist on a RPG minigame like binding of isaac and Risk of rain BUT for what it is it is extremely unoptimized, CSGO runs far better and looks far better and the video setting are very minimilistic. They include Resoloution which doesnt even support all monitors and Motion blur which doesnt even worked. I disabled it several times and it procedded to re-enable itself when i started playing. If you have a decent PC and are looking for a unpolished game (Not saying that in a rude way most Early Access games are unpolished, hence the name early access) then go for it im sure it would be a great experience if you can run it at its full capacity. Although there are a few problems what is an early access game with out problems, The Extinction is defineatly worth picking up for its price.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1467637819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198122418510", "num_games_owned": 42}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "6", "votes_down": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497011", "timestamp_updated": 1467723152, "recommendationid": "24080168", "timestamp_created": 1467638178}, {"review": "It looks better than it is.
