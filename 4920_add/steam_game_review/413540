{"reviews": [{"review": "The game is a puzzle game in its nature. You play as Sleet, after a few puzzles you meet up with another robot Ai Floe. So far the story has been great, dialog is fun and keeps at least myself interested in more of the character's interactions. \n\nPuzzles consist of a lot of smaller things, exploring is a big part of each puzzle area in fact.\n\nPuzzles can range from having X buttons pressed, to Less than X press, or More than X pressed. To finding Y object to put within a machine. Some puzzles are small math tests where you do things like use weights that are between 100 xxx 1000. They use this in other places, even with fire, and electricity.\n\nAs you progress you get deployables. These are miniture devices you can toss out about 12 or so before they start imploding. These range from saw blades, lasers that rotate, fires, tesla probe. To things with A. to B. icons (haven't used everything yet.)\n\nAlong side normal puzzles you have (actually forgot the name) combat rooms. These have puzzles in them, but to get access to them you have to kill enemy bots and gain money to open more of the stage. \n\nThe third type of puzzle room I have witnessed is a sort of escort mission, you have a timer, and a device that moves while near it. You have to figure the whole thing out while staying close to the device to keep it moving.\n\nOver all, movement is very fun and insanely fluid. Decent enough settings. Even a 00:00 - 24:00 day light system you get to play with in the settings, want it pitch black set it to midnight. Want a bright day? Set it too noon.\n\nLike I said in my short review. Only major complaint so far is that while it has controller support you can not invert the Y axis at all. (yet, dev already comment saying it would be in the next patch or so)\n\nMy experience so far, well worth 40 bucks and I just scratched the surface.\n\nAnother thing I forgot to note here. EVERY stage has a way point race on it.

It is a very polished game. I had a few problems that the Devs were quick to fix so I could get back to playing. The puzzles are not overly hard, but satisfying when solving them as a part of a bigger puzzle within each puzzle level. There is a good amount of content that I think justifies the $40 price tag since it also includes a future DLC to further extend the gameplay.

The game doesn't have enough content nor does it feel quite polished enough for what it wants but the devs are active and constantly updating so that could change in the future.\n\nAs a puzzle game, this game is... not too hard, really. The puzzles get bigger more than they get trickier, though the later puzzle levels (8 and on) can certainly provide a decent mental workout. But there's definitely a decent bit of variety, up to continuing to introduce elements even in the last levels of the game. And it does feel like every type of puzzle the game presents is developed about as far as it can be, though there are certainly a few that overstay their welcome. There's a nice feeling of progression throughout though, each level is an interconnected hub of smaller puzzles and picking apart one piece unlocks two more, the real joy is finding the ways all the separate pieces interact with each other to get the secret pickups, honestly. \n\nThe combat is... a bit weak honestly, since it's all indirect. You throw deployables that do the fighting for you, at least until you unlock the bonus weapon waaayyy near the end of the game that is. There are really only two or three weapons worth using out of the eight available. And the enemies tend to be an annoyance more than a threat. Death is pretty cheap, either just sending you back to a checkpoint with no penalty or dropping all your collected items in the wave rush and payload levels but allowing you to pick up half of them again, and if you're playing it smart you don't keep a large stash anyways. The wave rush levels in particular feel just a bit unnecessary since the combat is never a strong point, but there's few of them and technically you can finish them all in seconds if you want to. The payload levels are a nice change of pace, there's a time limit but not a very strict one and it's easy to extend it as well. I dig this level style a lot more than the wave rush levels. And I do admire that there's diversity in level types, showing off different aspects of the game. The optional race things that appear in every level are another nice little bonus though there's no incentive to beat the best time and trying to do so tends to be the only real source of frustration in the game.\n\nWhere the game really works best is in its movement, which is kept consistently fast allowing you to travel large distances with little hassle. And there's even little quirks of the game engine you're expected to discover and exploit a few times. Movement in this game just feels fun, though if you had to be really precise with it I'm sure it'd wear off, but it's distinctly different for a puzzle game. The other aspect of the game that's particularly memorable is the dialogue between the two main characters, which I enjoyed a lot more than I expected to honestly. There's an air of mystery to the overarching plot that plays well into the conversations, a lot of \"AI not understanding humans\" bits that develop into some serious snark towards humanity by the end and plenty of genuinely funny quips. And there's just, so many dialogues too, I haven't even found them all yet I'm sure, even with how much I have found. There's also some nice little easter eggs tucked away that you can get near the end, they're pretty fun to hunt for and decently clever.\n\nThe game also looks pretty solid visually though the game's aesthetic is a bit limited, it kind of wears off after a number of hours playing. And the soundtrack is nice for what it is but definitely a bit restricted, since it's the same set of songs playing on loop for the entirety of the game. You'll probably have them all memorized by the time you beat the game. I eventually just turned the music off and used my own music to stop from going insane.\n\nIt's definitely a pretty good game but I wouldn't say it's a great one. Regardless I definitely enjoyed playing it and I would recommend it... on sale.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1477803873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1353, "num_reviews": 417, "steamid": "76561198076721797", "num_games_owned": 670}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_updated": 1477807951, "recommendationid": "26308271", "timestamp_created": 1477807951}, {"review": "Not as good as spacewar, but still a pretty good title\nNo online MP tho |:", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1456852513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198003443638", "num_games_owned": 308}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454068", "timestamp_updated": 1456852557, "recommendationid": "21568358", "timestamp_created": 1456852557}, {"review": "Love this game, it's very unique.
