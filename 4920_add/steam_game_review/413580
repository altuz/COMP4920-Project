The leaderboards gives a pretty fun incentive to try to replay levels over again to try to figure out a faster way to solve a puzzle, and getting a higher rank can start to feel like another aspect of the puzzle itself.\n\nI can see this game becoming more difficult in the later stages, but right now it's always given off the vibe of being hard but fair, as opposed to games that are punishingly unfair. The mechanics also seem pretty well thought out so far in my opinion, so I don't think there would be any frustration there.\n\nAlso the two characters are pretty cute and their voice actors throughout the small cutscenes every time you enter a new world or so are pretty good. Seems like a really polished little game of sorts that I guess if you love tough puzzlers you'd like as well. Hope this game gains at least a small amount of success because I feel it deserves it.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1453869250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 665, "num_reviews": 34, "steamid": "76561198155726313", "num_games_owned": 616}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508076", "timestamp_updated": 1450393135, "recommendationid": "19754369", "timestamp_created": 1450393135}, {"review": "The short: You control two characters in a well-made puzzle-platformer that expects you to be VERY proficient at controlling them by the end. [b]Recommended if you enjoy tough puzzles that also require precise execution to complete[/b] and you like the anime aesthetic; otherwise, you probably ought to pass. [b]Controller recommended[/b], unless you're fine with breaking whatever key you bind Synchro to.\n\n*Note: I played the game before it was released on steam, hence the low playtime.\n\nThe long: Reverse x Reverse (RxR) is a puzzle-platformer with the core gameplay mechanic of simultaneously managing two characters, each with their own unique ability (one can dash, and the other can double jump). The first few stages provide a gentle introduction to the game while the player gets used to controlling the pair. These intro stages are followed by a steady stream of new gameplay mechanics, which are accompanied by an initially reasonable difficulty ramp... but the last world is a monster on its own, so be prepared to endure a lot of frustration.\n\nAdditionally, there are several puzzles that will require you to think, react, and execute rather quickly and precisely, especially if you choose to pursue high scores for each stage, so keep that in mind when considering a purchase.\n\nMost importantly, in my opinion, RxR passes all of the checks for a good puzzle-platformer: good stage/puzzle design, tight controls, steady introduction of new mechanics (and combinations of old)... combined with good artwork, music, spritework, and voicework, this was genuinely one of my favorite games of 2015.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1454220589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 627, "num_reviews": 3, "steamid": "76561198026092375", "num_games_owned": 247}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500288", "timestamp_updated": 1450676665, "recommendationid": "19818396", "timestamp_created": 1450676365}, {"review": "This game is awesome!!
