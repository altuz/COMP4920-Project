{"reviews": [{"review": "Intresting game. It is obviously a cheap and buggy game, however it has potential... I love Doctor Who, and - my guess is - the concept came from there. BUT the game itself is very very and utterly empty. Dont make a mistake, i am liking this game, i recommend it, but also i recommend the game serious overthinking... :\\ i hope the creators reading theese lines... \n\nHere what is bugs me: \n- Your character cannot jump, not even over a tin can. that is annoying...\n- if you shut down a corridor, dont do it with object what i can leap over with half leg... it is just stupid \n- You cannot cut loose from the \"statues\" they always know where are you. It should be fixed, and my third problem is connected with this,,,\n- It need more advanced AI. Ai that can operate on his own, looking for you if not seeing you ect... they should not know where are you all the time, give the opportunity to the player to fear, and make them hide, make tactics... make possibble to confuse enemies... it is not fun just to outrun enemies, and being fast... it is not scary, it is annoying\n- Make some places to hide.(Like closet doors or wardrobes or whatever make possibble to the player to fear)\n- it need more detailed places. This game is currently empty. It just a bunch of random objects and repeated rooms.\n- The statues not look statues at all...\n- Horrible VERY horrible animation. At least use a reference like a motion capture from somewhere even from a video or something\n- Also, if i dont light the monsters they are still frozen in the dark if i look at them, but they should attack if you cannot see them\n- This blinking bulls*it... So, it is a good idea, but please make faster the blinking... the fastest human organ is the eyelid, now.. in this concept i am with a narcoleptic sloth character...  Please make the blinking faster, but limit something, for example the torchlight, make a need to get batteries, but for exchange; make the blinking faster... (Check on amnesia game, there it was working well :D)\n- Death animations... We need death animations.\n- Whats with the reaper?!\n- Just an idea: Random generated levels... :P\n- Low polygon nightmare... you seriously needs to work on the design, becouse it make my feelings into the early 2000- years...", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1500412539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 32, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198059033811", "num_games_owned": 61}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "timestamp_updated": 1500413582, "recommendationid": "33638745", "timestamp_created": 1500413582}, {"review": "So bad game", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1500590242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198095098478", "num_games_owned": 16}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481776", "timestamp_updated": 1500590260, "recommendationid": "33683240", "timestamp_created": 1500590260}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 32, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 47, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
