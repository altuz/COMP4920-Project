{"reviews": [{"review": "I hardly ever write negative reviews on games but when i do i feel they have some sort of issue that needs adressing that prevents enjoyment of the game. In this games case its a lack of content. Im not saying dont buy the game im just saying at this time i wouldnt recommend it. I wish they had a score system instead of a recommend or not recommend because the game is not bad at all, Its just that in most other 2d digging type games ive played theres more to discover. While this one has stuff it doesnt really feel like very much at all and youll spend most of your time just grinding and looking for materials to upgrade to the next pickaxe etc and beyond that theres not really much other than the occasional conversation between the miner and the other guy he works for. That should tell you how invested i became in the story because i dont even know the guys name lol. I just really feel there needs to be more of a sense of discovery and things to find and it would up the value of this game 10 fold. For me thats one of the enjoyable things about these kind of games the sense of exploration and discovery. I think what im touching on is the pacing of the game is too slow and needs to be upped some. \n\nWhile this might be a good game for some im getting kind of bored of it already. So i cant in good conscience recommend it at this time.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1451514235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 525, "num_reviews": 43, "steamid": "76561198017056908", "num_games_owned": 1608}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533002", "timestamp_updated": 1451406095, "recommendationid": "20073042", "timestamp_created": 1451406095}, {"review": "All I have to say is... its about time :) I played this through on android and loved it and asked ages ago about the PC version.
