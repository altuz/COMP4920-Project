{"reviews": [{"review": "I was tempted to say that this game is far more enjoyable than it has any right to be, but fuck it:  It's actually quite genuinely CLEVER, so any kudos I'm inclined to give it is fully deserved.  Simple, yes...deceptively so...but definitely clever.  How, you ask?  Well, in...SIMPLE ways, really!  Such as the fact that your visibility declines as the game progresses, meaning that the formerly easy task of clicking on all encroaching beasties becomes significantly harder, especially if you have to keep frantically turning on lights just to keep said visibility up!  So, yes, it's basically a \"time management\" game with a very simple interface, and in that sense may well appeal to the Five Nights at Freddy's crowd (without being a completely blatant rip-off of said franchise, such as, hmmm, let's see...123 Slaughter Me Street, anyone?)!  Add to all this an extremely charming art style, fabulously spooky sound and - what's this - highly competent voice acting?  In an indie \"horror\" game?!  TELL ME IT AIN'T SO!!\n\n   And okay, so the main story mode doesn't appear to be that long - though I for one am yet to beat it - but there's a couple of mini-modes on the side to give it all a bit of longevity.  So on sale, at least, it's certainly a bit hard to argue with the more-than-adequate bang-for-your-buck...unless you're one of those tiresome fucks who complains about spending a measly few bucks on a game to find it doesn't last for twenty-seven-plus hours.  (Seriously, you people really are tiresome, and should find something more worthwhile to concern yourselves with...maybe turn on the TV news for five minutes some time...THAT oughtta scare the living shit out of you!  I know it gives ME fuckin' nightmares...)\n\n   Oh, and for all you \"clicker game\" people:  This is a bit like that, only it requires some degree of thought and skill.  Just in case you still want that experience of clicking the mouse a thousand times a minute, but with a bit of added strategy and, er, CHALLENGE involved...just as an added bonus on the side, y'know...\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1446210780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 115, "num_reviews": 429, "steamid": "76561198048974498", "num_games_owned": 1513}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540296", "timestamp_updated": 1449944781, "recommendationid": "18742049", "timestamp_created": 1446124416}, {"review": "Needs work...
