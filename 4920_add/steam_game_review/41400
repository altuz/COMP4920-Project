But is it a game you will want to race through ? In Doom Rails you can pick from a few diffrent racers and the stories pretty simple. You are trapped in a mad scientist lab and you have to race through 5 diffrent tracks to win youre freedom. The story is okay for this kinda game but the most important thing is the gameplay. So how is it ? It has to be one of the worst car combat games ever to be created. The Enviroments are pretty similar and are boring. Even though you can change the track in always feels the same so it gets stale quickly. The games you trying to complete goals which are timed while other racers try to kill you. The game cheats horribly. So let me explain. There are weapons that you need to kill enemies that are laid on the track. When you hit a buttont to get them you always miss them. When you pick them up is decided by dumb luck. Enemies constantly spawn on you so its hard to kill anyone or get an item. Overall Doom Rails is a pathetic excuse for a car combat game and not to mention it has DRM that states you can play the game only on 5 machines. Doom Rails is boring and a poorly done game if you want to pick it up wait for a huge discount. I give Doom Rails a 4/10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1427671946, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508153", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "15117891", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198050162710", "num_reviews": 104, "last_played": 1421802276, "num_games_owned": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 44}, "timestamp_updated": 1427671946, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I wouldn't reccomend that you buy this game"}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1388058496, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505481", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8297017", "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197970314726", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1505035265, "num_games_owned": 1694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 807}, "timestamp_updated": 1388058496, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game will NOT work on windows 8 no compatability changes will help it wont work its a bit of a rip off they dont let you know this in the game description or maybe they could throw up a warning when you buy the thing ..... i coulda spent my money on a different game one that would at least work...... my review is for win 8 users only i dont know if the game is worth it as it wont freakin work on win 8"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1374037331, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506701", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "7120001", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198087180801", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1374012143, "num_games_owned": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 631}, "timestamp_updated": 1374037331, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you are running Win 8 and are interested in this game, check the forums to see if a fix has been found as at the moment it doesn't work."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1473899435, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508665", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "25503777", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197995275372", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1390885516, "num_games_owned": 1221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 13}, "timestamp_updated": 1473899435, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Out of complete nowhere, several months after playing, I suddenly got a series of AV warnings claiming that the .exe is a Trojan.
