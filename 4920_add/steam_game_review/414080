When I go to update it it says that it is locked? How can it be locked? I'm really confused by this, also when I play the game, nothing happens. I get no tutorial pop up and my townspeople don't move. They do a walking animation but go nowhere. My Avatar is nowhere to be seen either, I choos the nature god and the Dryad for my champion. I would really like to know why I can't play otherwise I just wasted $10.00.....Any help from anyone would be greatly appreciated.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506710313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 705, "playtime_forever": 1017, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198067462139", "num_games_owned": 11}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "3", "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497230", "timestamp_updated": 1505806164, "recommendationid": "35059621", "timestamp_created": 1505806164}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 29, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 49, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
