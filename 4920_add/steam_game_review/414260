{"reviews": [{"review": "This game is an enigma. It has some nice aspects to it, mostly that it allows you to experience a watershed moment in naval warfare. Yet it is very limited and certainly not worth the 19.99 dollars that I read was the original price. Lucky for me I paid a trifle for it.\n\nBasically the game is a battle simulator for up to eight warships on both sides and those are limited to two columns. This feature is at the heart of the game and the most developed. However for any experienced naval gamer the lure of options that the game seems to provide does not pay off.  Most do not seem to work. And to top it: the AI is pretty stupid.\n\nThese sea battles are tied together by a strategic part of the game. This involves you in conquering ports and blocking or breaking blockades, depending on the side you pick.\nThe ai gets a big advantage: it goes second after you assigned your forces on a map that shows all commitments. In that way it is sure to get drop on you. \n\nThe game is buggy. At some point I was unable to create infantry for totally unknown reason. Luckily quitting the game and reloading solved that. But not so nice was a crash after winning an important sea battle. I had to redo it. More issues cropped up. Be sure to save often.\n\n\nThe stragic game is pretty locked down and historically totally unrealistic. The CSN gets about 2/3 of the USN production, which is nonsense given the strategic advantage of the USN. But this game has to give the Confederates at least a sporting chance and does so by limiting the federal production, giving the confederates an ironclad way before the federals get one and the limiting the federals by the slow production of ironclads. Making a monitor cost about 16 turns in a 48 turns game and you need to get enough money to get it which means about 20 turns from the start you get to your first one. The USN has to hold out against CSN ironclads for like 12 turns. Yeah, Hampton Roads will never occur in this game.\n\nSome ships are totally pointless, like the steam frigate. Immensily expensive(1 million dollars) and with a massive production time, by the time you can field it, the war is almost over.\n\nGame in practice is fought out with a handful of monitors and infantry. Once you know the drill you know the game. Limited, buggy and too expensive: a thumbs down.\n\n\n", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1500634726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 754, "num_reviews": 26, "steamid": "76561198068398360", "num_games_owned": 143}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495544", "timestamp_updated": 1501172724, "recommendationid": "33836214", "timestamp_created": 1501172724}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "review_score": 5, "total_negative": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 17, "review_score_desc": "Mixed"}, "success": 1}
