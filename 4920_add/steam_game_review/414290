{"reviews": [{"review": "This game seems like a fun little game on the surface. A platformer rogue-like with cool items, bosses and rooms. It is kind of that, but when you dig past the surface what you find is an unpolished, unbalanced and content-starved game that's not going to get any updates. If you are looking for an intricate rogue-like that you can spend dozens of hours on, you won't find it. But if you're looking to throw a few bucks at a couple hours of fun, then go ahead.\n\nIt is unpolished, because the presentation is just a bit off. Missing explanations here or there, a weird looking monster or trap, a visual style that could with a little polish become charming. It's not the biggest problem, but it's definitely there.\nIt's unbalanced, because the numbers just don't line up. And it kinda feels like with about an hour in an excel spreadsheet it all could've been fixed. The gold you get is never enough to buy anything significant, you get around 500 gold in a full playthrough and most weapons cost 4-700.  Also some classes are just way better than others. The knight's shield makes the game a cake-walk since you can just block all the damage. All of it. Completed the game on my first run with him.\nIt's content-starved, because after playing through the 9 floors the game has I realised that there is not much more to it. I've seen all the enemy types, all the bosses, all the traps and treasures. There was no point in playing it anymore.\n\nSo basically if you expect to get lots out of this game look elsewhere.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1494947904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 186, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198032248636", "num_games_owned": 90}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498489", "timestamp_updated": 1492421423, "recommendationid": "31195585", "timestamp_created": 1492421423}, {"review": "I can't recommend this game unless you find it for less than a dollar.\n\nit's pretty low-effort and formulaic. not that it's necessarily bad, it's just weak in all areas. the music is a boring loop. sound is ok, and graphics are fine.\n\nboss design is lame. most of the bosses have deadzones where you can't get hit unless you actively try to. you'll end up killing yourself more out of impatience/not paying attention than out of actual challenge.\n\nI don't understand the \"princess\" part in the title, since the game focuses on saving the king. once you do save him, you're presented with a black screen with \"AGAIN?\" printed in the center. your controls still control your character in an empty arena, but you're not able to continue past it so your options are to kill yourself (forfeiting the achievement) or alt-f4 (forfeiting the achievement). maybe there's some other way to skip this screen but nothing on my 360 remote works.\n\nI'm happy that I found this for like 30 cents instead of paying $5 or whatever the normal price is. save your money.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1494615704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 196, "num_reviews": 10, "steamid": "76561197990094462", "num_games_owned": 428}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493985", "timestamp_updated": 1494616536, "recommendationid": "31708291", "timestamp_created": 1494616536}, {"review": "Controls can't be rebound.
