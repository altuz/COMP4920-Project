It feels passionate, and I like what the narrative is trying to do, especially in an area that's been glorified in video games with the likes of GTA, Saints Row, etc.\n\nBut I just don't think I can get past the technical side of this. It's just a pain. The game suffers from severe lack of polish. It's pretty unpleasant to look at. The voice acting feels detatched and soulless. In the time I played, the dialogue felt like it was on a broken record. Conversations felt forced and not natural. And I don't know if anyone else experienced this, but my game had TERRIBLE FPS. My PC runs most games very well even on max settings, but it does tend to overheat at times, so maybe this is only on my end, but it was SUCH a slog to get through with the FPS.\n\nI want to give it more of a chance, I want to get further into it to give you a better and deeper review, but I just don't think I can.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1486762125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 38, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198054124109", "num_games_owned": 349}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "14", "votes_down": 45, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 221, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666779", "timestamp_updated": 1486763179, "recommendationid": "29833156", "timestamp_created": 1486763179}, {"review": "I respect the subject this game conveys and the social issues the game developer is trying to present. However, I simply can't get over the technical issues and the gameplay itself.\n\nI can usually go with low fps & simple graphics, but this game constantly glitches while the characters are having interactions with one another. In addition, the interactions are too plain, containing mostly conversations and implications, with little real action and witnessing.\n\nFurthermore, some scenes just don't make sense at all. For example, you're eating pasta-you set up the table-you put forks and knifes and spoons and cups for everyone on the table-nobody uses any of the utencils listed except the fork. When there's a whole plate of pasta, your friend takes one bite of it using the fork once and then tells you he gtg and then leaves.\n\nThe conversations and early character interactions are simply too extraneous. You go to school for three whole days without anything happening.\n\nDespite all, the game's intention is absolutely respectable and the idea conveyed in the game is worth being developed. I suggest the game developer fix the technical issues and put more details into the graphics and character interations, as well as increase the game pace a little bit.\n\nAs a person living close to Chicago, I really hope that this game can be improved and if that happens I am willing to completely change my review on this game.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1486860206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 76, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198218463491", "num_games_owned": 204}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 81, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607183", "timestamp_updated": 1486869098, "recommendationid": "29861467", "timestamp_created": 1486861315}, {"review": "Its a good game that brings awareness to gang violence especially in Chicago.

First of all, I'd suggest you avoid watching Let's Plays and such if you're like me and skip around the video to try to get some idea of what the feeling is like. Parts that looked really long and laborious to me were actually pretty easy once I let myself sink in to the dialogue.\n\nWe Are Chicago is a game which seems to be trying to be like Life Is Strange, but without the supernatural elements and instead with a focus on urban slice-of-life in a high-risk area. It's low production values yes, but as long as your computer doesn't have issues with Unity games (mine used to), you should have consistently maxed-out FPS on a modern gaming rig and that helps with immersion.\n\nYou're thrown into the life of a high school student, trying to make it to college and take care of his family at the same time, balancing loyalty to his friends with self-preservation and wisdom. While the game can be heavy-handed and extremely preachy at times about the crises that at-risk youths face, as a life simulator it does greatly and felt a lot like Indigo Prophecy to me, with pauses to immerse into your house, do menial tasks like setting the dinner table, and generally breathe life into the game's world by connecting to it. If you focus on those parts, I think you'll be fine.\n\nChicago is a colorful palette of many of the world's best and worst things, and I feel that this story represents the feeling of being there well. As someone who is a foreigner to American culture but who has visited Chicago many times, I relished the opportunity to be able to understand what it would be like to actually grow up there instead of where I did. It's obvious from the start of the game that some people will be dying while others live, but the story isn't so heavy-handed as to make me absolutely sure what's going to happen. I wouldn't call it a page-turner, but I am curious what's going to happen to who, and I do think it's worth the moderate price if you understand that it's a grassroots community effort and needs more tolerance for flaws than you might be used to.\n\nBasically, give it a try if you're annoyed at the lack of Black protagonists in games, Black themes, or just generally have wanted to try a slice-of-life game that doesn't devolve into science fiction or fantasy 5 minutes in. :)", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1486734924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 93, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198278889834", "num_games_owned": 140}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 38, "votes_funny": 2, "votes_up": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531138", "timestamp_updated": 1486770000, "recommendationid": "29834962", "timestamp_created": 1486770000}, {"review": "This was an emotionally jarring story that had me captivated from start to finish.
