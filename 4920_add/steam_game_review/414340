It was full of darkness and pain, yet the atmosphere was stunning and simply gorgeous, addictive even.\nThen Senua. There's something about her and her facial expressions... [b]mesmerizing[/b] (speaking from a point as a screenshot taker/lover/admirer).\nThere were some moments when I didn't understand her or maybe it was Senua that didn't understand me. Nonetheless we both overcame every obstacle that got in our way.\nEventually her story came to a close and I was left with questions, unforgetable experience and, of course, a truly fitting ending song.\n\n\n[h1]Overall a great game with amazing textures, models and visual effects as well as outstanding sound effects that built the game's atmosphere to perfection, and a very well delivered story. \n\nWorth every cent of it's price.\nThe Developers have done a great job.

If you want a hack&slash action game, you will be disappointed [/h1]\n\n[b]Technical[/b]\n\n1) The game looks extremely beautiful. Certain sets are breathtakingly detailed and scream perfection. It looks like a high budget AAA game.\n2) High quality textures with the highly detailed environment helps you immerse in this game world. Its almost photorealistic at times.\n3) Graphics settings are decent with plenty of options to optimize your performance. But sometimes in a cutsence the frame rate drops to 20 for a moment creating stutter.(Happened multiple times on first playthrough) \n4) The game has puzzles in it to unlock/open door to proceed to the next door. A couple of times the door refused to open even after solving the puzzle. Even after rebooting the game this bug was constant. I had to move around and constantly hit the action key for the action to get triggered. As far as I know you have to be in a particular spot to open door. It somewhat annoyed me and should be patched as soon as possible.\n\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\n1. It is a masterpiece. period. \n2. No other game can immerse you and can put you in the shoes of the character, the way this game did. \n3. You feel and sense emotions and can relate to Senua. You never feel like a viewer or a 3rd person looking down. YOU ARE IN THE STORY YOU ARE PART OF IT. \n4. This is the best game I have ever played when it comes to story telling. It has certain hack and slash elements to it, but to its core its a storytelling game.\n5. Spoilers(basic ones no endgame spoilers though)\n[spoiler]Senua is a Celtic warrior suffering through psychosis. Which means she hears voices in her head, haulisunates etc. Her lover was killed by the Vikings so called Northmen. She has taken upon herself to go to hell and fight the god hela too Bring back her lover. Throughout the story we are met with multiple characters who tell you about the Northmen and Their gods or the backstory of Senua. Even the freaking collectables have Nordic mythology which is fun to listen to.[/spoiler]\n6. Voice acting is one of the best if not the best.\n7. All in all its one of the best experiences I ever had.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n1. Gameplay is fairly basic. Senua sees symbols in the world. So there's a lot of puzzle solving in it. \n2. puzzles are not very hard but they sure make you think for a bit.(its more like finding and not solving)\n3. There is a fairly basic combat system, which is somewhat lackluster, but then again its not a Fighting game. \n4. The control feels perfect and responsive. There is not much variety of attacks. As the story progresses you see different  \n     types of enemies but your attacks remain the same. \n5. I would say this part of the game was weak compared to its story.\n\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n1. The graphics are amazing, the story is one of the best ones with top notch voice acting. \n2. Puzzles are good\n3. combat system while not the best works decently with the game.\n4.

The combat is very restrictive and at times, a bit dull. There is cinematic value, but there isn't much gameplay value. \n\nThere are tons of puzzles throughout the game. Every new area you reach will have a puzzle, but they are all similar in their own way. You look at runes, and you match them with the environment, and you unlock more of the story. And then you move on and repeat it over and over. Again, this is GREAT for some people, but it becomes too repetitive and boring for my style of gameplay. If you like puzzles and a rich story, you'll probably like this game a lot.

There is nothing left behind, nothing to return to, nothing that could make you turn back. The skull of your beloved, cautiously rolled into a linen cloth, is dangling from your belt, while you evenly plunge the paddle into the green water.\n\nThe surrounding silence of the swamp remains unnoticed by Senua. She's never alone. From start to end of Hellblade the voices accompany her, accompany you. They won't stop. Constantly gnawing in your head, the voices are the most unique and dominant feature in 'Hellblade - Senua's Sacrifice'. They help you to understand what to do and their comments continuously reveal aspects of Senua's past, which will gradually give you the possibility to understand her history.\n\nThere is a reason for the games recommendation to play it with headphones. I did and the experience was extreme. While it's a blast at the beginning, I felt the urge to rip the headphones from my ears towards the end of the game.\nAs a portrayal of a harrowing live with psychosis the voices undoubtedly succeed. Hellblade uses Senua\u2019s sickness as a route into an excellent story about her inner struggle, love and loss. \n\nThe game does not take you by the hand. There's no tutorial, no hud, no objective, no map. Even fighting is not explained but thankfully it's very intuitive. As Senua, it is up to you to reveal your own story, as you wander deeper and deeper into hells circles and if you wish to get the most out of this game, you better don't read too many reviews or view videos of 'Hellblade - Senua's Sacrifice'.\n\nHellblade unfolds like a beautiful, dark, tense visual novel. The game tells a story of confusion, sadness, fear and loss and it's punctuated by moments of beauty and strength that leaves a lasting impression.\nCombat is extremely intense and gripping. To me, the fights are among the highlights of this game, although they are unbalanced in terms of difficulty and only side events on Senua's journey.\n\nThis game is something that just doesn't come around every day. And as unique as the story is, are the puzzles. You have to find Norse symbols in your environment and are guided by strange light effects that first made me believe the graphics were bugged. In fact they are not. It's a very smart form of puzzle that's very unique.\n\nHellblade shows a masterclass of atmosphere, story telling, fighting and puzzles. It all wonderfully comes together to form one extremely unique gaming experience as never seen before.\nThe true achievement of this game is it creates something exceptional new. Not everybody will like this game, but for sure the developers created a very special game that deserves respect for it's innovations.\n\nPros:\n- incredibly strong atmosphere\n- very good, but not outstanding graphics\n- extremely intense fights, fighting looks and feels fantastic although the attack and defend options are limited\n- very good sound effects, rain, thunder, birds, wind, rustling leaves, burning fire, waves, horns in the distance, waves, all this adds a lot to the atmosphere\n- the voices make this game special and they are not only an expression of schizophrenia but also help players understand what to do\n- fantastic puzzles with a very unique new idea\n- strong, disturbing light and graphic effects that the developers are not afraid to accelerate to an extreme level\n- everything feels extremely vibrant\n- mainly no music, only sound effects, which strongly adds to the gripping atmosphere\n- good music in the few moments it's played\n- possibly best ever interpretation of hell in a video game. I'm sure Dante would approve.\n- very emotional end (although I didn't fully understand it)\n- photo mode lets you stop the game, move the camera and take photos with different filters (I took more than 1000 screenshots)\n- very intense aspects of horror\n\nNeutral:\n- graphics are softened and grained without the option to disable the graining. I did not mind, but some players might.\n- extremely disturbing story, especially towards the end of the game\n\nCons:\n- frame-rate drops at the beginning of the game\n- repetitive gameplay\n- no map, although it's a linear game I got lost a couple of times walking in the wrong direction\n- unbalanced boss fights, some where laughable easy while other seemed almost impossible to beat", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506456910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 149, "playtime_forever": 1237, "num_reviews": 89, "steamid": "76561197983740996", "num_games_owned": 418}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1504765870, "recommendationid": "34770823", "timestamp_created": 1504681586}, {"review": "Amazing. one of few listings on steam that can be described as an Experience rather than just a Game", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505906243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 312, "num_reviews": 6, "steamid": "76561198108380099", "num_games_owned": 42}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "timestamp_updated": 1504841832, "recommendationid": "34807218", "timestamp_created": 1504841832}, {"review": "What a game!

It is more than a game: it's an experience not to be missed. Some reviewers have called Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice a work of art (aren't most games?) but it's more than that. It's proof that indie developers can produce AAA titles, an almost perfect game that results from the perfection of a pure, creative vision. Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is a great work of art.

It is for those who can enjoy games for their story and atmosphere instead of for mechanics like loot and experience bars. Hellblade's character progression is not mechanical, it has a character development that is relatable and feels real. It is very empathetic thanks to the voices that play in \"your head\" and they play a major role in understanding what psychosis is. It is also implemented in a very clever way to guide you through the experience, sometimes reacting to your actions, other times helping you, and most of the times confusing you.\n\nThere is no notion or expression of a player character, in a sense it is you living through the experience. The immersion is increased with almost nonexistent UI. I love games with mechanics that are fitting with the game's theme and story, but this one offers something much deeper. People say in pro-con lists that this is kind of a walking simulator with no progression, tedious puzzles, very few collectibles, and that the permadeath is a bluff. These are all intentional to represent the state and to strengthen the connection with Senua, who is delusional and all is within her mind only. Yes, it is most of the times not fun in the literal way, but it is not always fun that makes a game a good game.\n\nApart from the excellent representation of this mental disorder, I'm also fascinated by the technology behind this game (the beautiful graphics, her lifelike face and animations), its Norse mythology setting, the sound design and acting.\n\nIt's not just a game, it is a memorable experience I wish to have more of.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1503792365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 953, "num_reviews": 33, "steamid": "76561198028042878", "num_games_owned": 744}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1504632087, "recommendationid": "34760943", "timestamp_created": 1504632087}, {"review": "Hellblade is a new experience, to say the least. Whereas most games of this nature take the easy way out by filling the experience of \"maybe magic, maybe mundane\" storylines with ambiguity, this game instead decides to focus on the danger that Senua's own mind poses and, as a result, creates a far more immersive, detailed, and overall chilling psychological experience that few developers have the mind or patience to create.\n\nThe combat is fun and engaging, the controls handle quite nicely, and the game overall offers a unique premise that, despite its relatively short runtime of 6-10 hours, makes it an enjoyable game through and through.\n\nPerhaps the general enemies could have been slightly more varied, but the boss fights were all amazing and challenging, feeling truly unique to one another. That said, if you are looking for a combat-heavy, hack and slash, non-stop melee fest, be aware that this game focuses more on obstacles, puzzles, and stories.\n\nI'd give it a strong 9/10.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1507004328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "playtime_forever": 743, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198042284396", "num_games_owned": 69}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1504642008, "recommendationid": "34763602", "timestamp_created": 1504641574}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3724, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 289, "num_reviews": 20, "total_reviews": 4013, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
