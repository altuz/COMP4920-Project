{"reviews": [{"review": "It's essentially Puyo Puyo, a game with an already fun and simple formula, and adds a cute art style, a quite decent soundtrack, and a couple of twists to the gameplay that makes it faster-paced, more strategic, and more fun.

If you're a fan of those kinds of puzzle games, love playing 1v1 against a friend, or want a small arcade-style puzzle game to kill a few minutes with, this game is a great choice!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505153653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 355, "num_reviews": 8, "steamid": "76561198071865132", "num_games_owned": 173}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505300", "timestamp_updated": 1504835258, "recommendationid": "34806079", "timestamp_created": 1504835258}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
