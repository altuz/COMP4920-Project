{"reviews": [{"review": "This game is a great addition to the local multiplayer sit on the couch and spend hours screaming with your friends as you destroy eachother. I enjoy the likes of Towerfall and this holds up for quick and insane multiplayer (they don't have a single player mode yet so I can't compare that). I've booted this game up at work or at friend's houses where no one else has played it and within a couple matches everyone is super into it and having a blast.\n\nThe creators have a discord channel and are super responsive to the feedback and are constantly tweaking and finessing, even have played a few successful online rounds which wasn't available at the start. \n\nGreat game and only going to get better! I'm pumped to see where it goes from here!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505187996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 283, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198041557921", "num_games_owned": 115}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_updated": 1506400718, "recommendationid": "35215722", "timestamp_created": 1506400718}, {"review": "justt get it now you will fall in love", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506762315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 523, "playtime_forever": 523, "num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198196143903", "num_games_owned": 21}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497715", "timestamp_updated": 1506251212, "recommendationid": "35177774", "timestamp_created": 1506251212}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 12, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
