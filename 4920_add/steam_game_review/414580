Then there's pointless movie sequences which are falsely advertised in the screenshots and video to look like in-game graphics, which are also by the way not skippable. The storyline is boring, pointless and interrupts the little gameplay the game actually has.\n\nAs for gameplay, you begin with a SMUP with more mechanics that are less obvious than a standard Bullet Hell game. Each time I played it, I discovered a new button or mechanic for a level that takes about 30 seconds to complete.\n\nOnce you beat it, you are put straight into the most boring and confusing tree game. I have no understanding for the ratios on the right, what the lightning is or coming from, when the fruit will spawn if i must avoid the fire sprites or what they were. Before you have even discovered the mechanics, you're into the next level.\n\nAnd before you know it you're back into the same SMUP Bullet Hell game again with an even easier boss than the first one because the Graze mechanic is too easy to use....\n\nThen you get back to the tree level and angrily will quit the game. You try to give the game another go later on, but when you see the fxcking 10 second intro and refund the game.\n\nThe bongo-man can eat my @ss.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1456277869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 17, "num_reviews": 25, "steamid": "76561197992183200", "num_games_owned": 496}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 9, "votes_funny": 11, "votes_up": 50, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554207", "timestamp_updated": 1505442940, "recommendationid": "21417106", "timestamp_created": 1456279730}, {"review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka9EgkAxvOQ\n\nUnlike most of Steam, I actually enjoyed the first Uriel's Chasm. It was a nice mixture of game styles with a very avant-garde approach to tying them all together, and the drug-addled/fever dream christian themes and blasphemy had me asking \"what the fuck\" on more than one occassion. So when Uriel's Chasm 2 was announced, I was excited to play it. \n\nThe above footage was recorded while I had a cold (hence the bad volume levels, I forgot to check them before hand due to how loopy I was from the meds) and wound up lost to time until I found it the other day. I played it again once more after that, and the feelings are about the same. As a bullet hell, it still works out in a Titan Quest sort of way. Just one boss fight after another with the theme of fruit. It's a bit confusing there as they cause pain in the bullet hell sequence, but then in the strategy segment to stop the trees from burning they are required to advance, making them beneficial.\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been able to complete the game, so I'm not really sure how or if a lot of these elements play into each other, but from what I experienced it all just seemed to be random things thrown together in more of a religious overtone. Part of the reason for this is both a lack of skill on my part, as well as a lack of anything to really keep me going. Unlike the first, this is just the same two games back-to-back. There is another in the trailer but I haven't seen it played, nor did I reach them. \n\nThe lack of a continue screen is also a shame. If you die, you go straight to the beginning. No contrinues, no second chances. Your hit counter also doesn't seem to change other than you get one when you start a new boss battle (I think, that's what it seemed from when I played). There's also small Sega CD style compressed video of what looks like an abandoned parking garage that seems to have little to do with the game itself other than aesthetic. Rail Slave Games (the developer) continues to play these games off like a bad rom hack of a lost game, and things such as the Pac-Man fruit play into it as well. Sadly, it isn't necessary, nor does it really help anything.\n\nWhere the first entry had enough \"what the fuck\" moments level after level to keep the player invested to see what's coming next, this one just doesn't. And that's the fatal flaw in its design. This is ripe to set up a drug addled fantasy world of spiritual context, but the development team just don't take advantage of it. Hopefully their next entry (which I saw was something actually called 'Fever Dreams') will play into the strengths it is named after.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1447459173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 34, "num_reviews": 109, "steamid": "76561198025037510", "num_games_owned": 3256}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": true, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505479", "timestamp_updated": 1477252473, "recommendationid": "26188593", "timestamp_created": 1477252473}, {"review": "sequel to dat strange game.. its awesome *____*\nmenu is working fine with arrows and \"z\" key, noobs.\nsometimes i have such states of mind when i want and i will play this game.\nty Dylan for making such games, they're beautyfully strange and mindfull + blending with hardcore and past century design\np.s.: separate thanks for Sisters of the Amniotic Lens - dat is MASTERPIECE!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1479391160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 46, "num_reviews": 9, "steamid": "76561198037602021", "num_games_owned": 309}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 10, "votes_funny": 3, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482325", "timestamp_updated": 1466937096, "recommendationid": "23822964", "timestamp_created": 1466937096}, {"review": "a gonzo christian bullet-hell shmup. i can't promise you will like it, but i can promise it is the strangest thing you will ever buy on steam, and that it is a hell of a thing.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1471569336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 110, "num_reviews": 344, "steamid": "76561198015075204", "num_games_owned": 1363}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 53, "votes_funny": 19, "votes_up": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506230", "timestamp_updated": 1447486151, "recommendationid": "19066214", "timestamp_created": 1447486151}, {"review": "this makes me feel all kinds of warmfuzzyweird pseudonostalgic feelings and while it's difficult it's probably the most *accessible* RSG release thus far.\n\nThe music's pretty good, too. \u2665", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1457819723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 186, "num_reviews": 14, "steamid": "76561197970466208", "num_games_owned": 1349}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "3", "votes_down": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476767", "timestamp_updated": 1447804987, "recommendationid": "19137349", "timestamp_created": 1447804987}, {"review": "I WANT TO RIP MY SKIN OFF JARBOE I'M SORRY\n\nWAKE ME UP INSIDE \n(CANT WAKE UP)\nSAVE MEEEEE", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1447711317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 14, "num_reviews": 5, "steamid": "76561198042172518", "num_games_owned": 364}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 41, "votes_funny": 21, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462260", "timestamp_updated": 1447711514, "recommendationid": "19120469", "timestamp_created": 1447711514}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0, "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 7, "total_reviews": 7, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews"}, "success": 1}
