{"reviews": [{"review": "*sigh* I had high hopes for this one, but it felt ridiculously rushed. The translation was awful, the voice-acting was DREADFUL, the puzzles were often Moon-Logic levels of obtuse, and the Hidden Object puzzles were marred by the translation problems coupled with the fact that MAKING EVERYTHING THE SAME SHADE OF BEIGE RENDERS THEM VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AT POINTS. There's also a tendency to throw in tedious puzzles which make no sense in context and really just there to pad the game. Oh, and they had a great opportunity to take things in a different direction but instead went with the cheesiest, most-cliched ending possible. They might as well have named the villain Sir Evil McObvious Von Badguyington. :/ Hard pass on this one.
