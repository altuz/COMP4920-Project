An unfortunate by-product of this design is trial-and-error - and there is A LOT of it. A frustratingly large amount of it in certain spots. The game is full of scripted events and NPC encounters that are literally unavoidable, even with maximum usage of the game's stealth mechanics.\n\nOn the more positive end, Outlast 2 is legitimately scary - much more so than the original. The player character has hallucinations of being in his childhood Catholic school after hours, and these hallucinations get more intense and frequent as time goes on; they are easily the scariest parts of the game. And the chase-sequences, while causing the trial-and-error issue discussed earlier, provide the game's most fun and exhilerating moments.\n\nPlaying Outlast 2 feels like being in a fast-paced horror flick. The story can only progress in ONE way and you will die repeatedly until you figure out specifically what the devs wanted you to do. Don't get me wrong - it's a decent game, but it cetainly isn't for everyone.\n\nPros:\n+Actually scary.\n+Solid visuals and sound design.\n+Interesting setting.\n+Almost everything about the school sections is good.\n+Had the potential for an interesting story, but...(see cons)\n\nCons:\n-Excessive trial-and-error.\n-Scripted AI can make the game feel unfair.\n-The story really needed more exposition.

Yeah, it makes you dread moving around and doing things in fear of what might transpire and what might see you.  It'll undoubtedly shock you and make you jump.\n\n+ Intruiging story: The story is interesting.  I'd describe it as being a cross between Outlast 1 and a Silent Hill game.  I'm a huge fan of Silent Hill so that's a good thing.  It leaves a lot to the imagination which some people might dislike but I enjoy stories like that.\n\nCons: \n\n- Scary for cheap reasons: Jump scares.  So many jump scares in this game.  If jump scares aren't your thing, this game isn't for you.\n\n- Gameplay: I honestly really dislike the game play of Outlast 2.  The original Amnesia was all about if you saw the monster before he saw you, you stayed hidden until he left the area.  If he saw you, you broke line of sight and found a dark corner to hide in, or a cabinet or something to hide in until it left.  If you shook it off your trail long enough, it'd leave.  Outlast 1 took that idea but made it a lot more stressful by making it harder to hide from enemies because they're just much quicker on spotting you and chasing you.\n\nAlien Isolation was interesting in that the Alien was *mostly* controlled by AI, though it was frustratingly b.s. at times to the point you want to tear your hair out.  Aside from those b.s. moments though, the Alien was a fun opponent.  When I originally finished it, the frustrating parts really overshadowed the fun parts, but on later reflection it was like 85% fun, 15% stupid frustrating.\n\nThat brings us to Outlast 2.  Ugh on the stealth and ugh on the AI.  You see the problem was I just played 2 games with stealth options: Zelda Breath of the Wild and Dishonored 2.  Those had fun stealth elements.  Enemies did their own thing, and if you crouched and walked slowly and stayed out of sight, they just don't see you.  \n\nThe way stealth worked in this game was frustrating.  Crouching in tall weeds didn't do much to increase your stealth.  Running full bore didn't ruin your stealth like it does in Zelda and Dishonored (and pretty much all stealth games). In Outast enemies that don't technically see you LOVE to just happen to walk your direction.  And then you have enemies are also scripted to hangout right by the areas you need to go for maximum \"fear\" effect.\n\nWhat does this mean?  It means several extremely frustrating parts where you have no idea where you're supposed to go but you're supposed to figure it out while an enemy is chasing you.  You pretty much need to know where to go and what sequence of actions to do or you die.  Now sometimes this isn't bad because they make it pretty obvious where to go.  But sometimes it's not obvious which means those of us who are a bit directionally challenged might have to play a part over and over to try to discover the exact sequence of events you have to do.\n\nHeck there was this one sequence where a monster appears on top of the stairs.  Chases you.  I tried hiding but it ALWAYS found me.  I looked up a guide and the guide says \"hide in a stall for a few seconds but before it comes run out and past where he used to be\".  If you try that and you hide in the stall too long, he'll come straight for you and you die.  If you exit and run that direction, he's in that path.  I died enough times that somehow when it reset after a death it put me past the enemy.  \n\nIf this doesn't bother you and you like horror games, then you SHOULD definitely get this game.  It's interesting and effective for jump scares.   If you're like me and don't like poor stealth mechanics and frustrating sequences, this game might not be for you.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504682446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 555, "num_reviews": 27, "steamid": "76561197971252326", "num_games_owned": 88}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505824", "timestamp_updated": 1504685097, "recommendationid": "34749261", "timestamp_created": 1504583723}, {"review": "It's not nearly as good as the first one, which i loved.\n\nOutlast 2's graphics are reallly good, i stopped sometimes just to look at game, how beautyful it was...but!...

I've been playing games for years and I really enjoy them, but I found this game practically unplayable without consulting a walkthrough about 90% of the time. \n\nHere's what happens: After a plane crash, your character has to locate his wife who has been kidnapped by a wacko religious cult who believe she is pregnant with the Antichrist. You have no weapons and don't even have a flashlight as you make your way through a world where it's alway dark. All you have is your video camera, which you can use as a source of light, as long as you have batteries for it, which are scattered all over the place. You're being hunted constantly by just about everyone else in the area and they are running around with axes, knives, spears, pitchforks and whatever else they could use to kill you, because they believe that you are the one who impregnated your wife with the Antichrist. \n\nMy problem with the game is this: Good games make it fairly clear to you where you need to go and what you need to do as you go through the game. That's what makes the game fun and keeps you moving forward in it. This game, though, apparently assumes you somehow already know all this. It's rarely clear what it is you're supposed to be doing most of the time, and while you're running around trying to figure that out your batteries are running down, so you often wind up with no more batteries and therefore no more light to see anything. I won't even mention the incredible amount of gore in the game, with women and chldren being tortured and killed everywhere you go. To be clear, I love a good FPS and have no qualms about shooting, stabbing or hacking to death any character that's trying to kill me. In this game, though, the people being killed and tortured are innocent victims, and the pileup of the death and blood and tortured bodies really gets to you after a while. \n\nHaving said all this, I'm sure there are some gamers who will read all this and laugh, because they didn't have any of the difficulty that I had with the game. That's fine. I'll just say that this game is definitely not for everyone and it is definitely not for me.
