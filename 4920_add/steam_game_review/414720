I love this game as it so reminds me of the original ELITE game released on the BBC B Micro back in the 80's.  I love the way it lets you play the game the way you want to play it rather than; \"These are the mission objectives now follow our linear route and complete it in the fastest time possible!\"\n\nThe music is just right for this game, so to is the way the vastness of space is presented to the naked eye and I suppose it is a loose reference to the game Tachyon Fringe.  One thing I will state is that unless you are playing this beautiful game on a 4K 24\" monitor you are most likely to miss out on the beautifull rendering of the spacial graphics.\n\n### For the Developers ###\n\nI sincerely hope that you have given serious thought to a follow up of this wonderful game and it is also so nice not to be force confronted by PvP.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506808643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 885, "playtime_forever": 885, "num_reviews": 15, "steamid": "76561198326224345", "num_games_owned": 56}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_updated": 1506347305, "recommendationid": "35203134", "timestamp_created": 1506347305}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 185, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 221, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
