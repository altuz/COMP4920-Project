I was riding first class on said \"hype train.\" \n\nMy mistake!\n\nRAID: WWII was a game I was very excited for, and very let down by. The idea was good! \"Become the allied force's secret, \"Off the books\" black ops, causing mayhem and destruction behind enemy lines, all the while stealing and pocketing Nazi gold!\" Sounds fun, right? Wrong. The game is a complete reskin of PAYDAY 2, (A much better game.) Theres almost no new ideas, and not a whole lot of content. The gunplay itself is rough, with the hitboxes being even worse. The graphics are AMAZING-LY BAD for a 2017 release, and its just simply: Not fun. If you're a fan of WWII, you wont find anything really WWII-ish about this game. Sure, it LOOKS like its from the 1940s, but it doesent feel like it. If you like this game, I really do envy you. I wish I could like it. But the fact of the matter is I don't. I have requested a refund, and do ever so hope I receive my money back. Hopefully this game will improve much later on in its life, but as it stands now? This game is mediocre at best. Worth-A-Buy?

After some help from the discussion group on steam I got it going after about a good 45 minutes of fiddling, but oh boy was this a mistake, I have not regretted getting a game to start as much as this in a long time.\n\nNow then, the obvious thing. The graphics looks like they are 15 years out of date, and that is just not any good, the camera angle is locked straight in the middle of the chest, so much in fact that if you play with a buddy and go real close in for a look at him you can actually see the underside of his chin above you.\n\nThe Ai seems to be really dumb, running in a straight line in formation seems to be their favorite thing to do.\n\nWhen me and a friend started a mission we were put straight in the line of fire without as much as an introduction, there was random sacred relics, coin collections and jeweled bibles just laying around on a scaffolding for no reason, its fine we thought.\nCrates of ammo, medical supplies and grenades littered the place and almost all of them was locked. Luckily there is a very dull lockpicking mechanism in the game that makes picking the lock feel like a chore from the very beginning.\n\nSo me and my friend we were fighting off these nazis and thought to ourself this simple question: Is this any fun at all?\nNo was the obvious answer.\n\nSo, I would not reccomend this game to anyone unless you have the power to time travel back to 2003 where the game would fit right in. This game feels that old.\n\nThat being said, I still loved john cleese in the little I saw of him. That man is a genious.

I really do. But I can't ignore all the problems this game has. It's bad. Don't buy it.\n\nRAID: World War II has been built up as the spiritual successor to PAYDAY 2. On paper, this is a tall order. PAYDAY 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. I've unwittingly sunk hundreds of dollars and thousands of hours into it over the years. PAYDAY 2, as well as PAYDAY: The Heist, are the primary reasons I love co-op focused games to this day. When RAID was announced, I was almost certain it couldn't hold a candle to PAYDAY 2. But I bought it anyway. I strongly believe that co-op focused games as a genre are dying. Many games have co-op as a vestigial part thrown in last-minute. However, if co-op focused games prove to be profitable, we'll see more of them. So I bought RAID.\n\nSimply saying this game is bad doesn't do it justice, but there's so much wrong that it's much quicker to just say you shouldn't buy this. Mechanically speaking, it's solid enough. Granted, it plays very close to PAYDAY: The Heist, but RAID feels different at its core. Shooting, moving, aiming, completing objectives, joining lobbies, or anything else feels simply awkward. PAYDAY feels modern, quick, snappy, and impactful. RAID is none of those things. Practically everything in this game doesn't work and has been done better in other games.\n\nThere's really only one thing I can recommend about this game, and that's the FMV clips. RAID proudly flaunts that actor John Cleese stars in it. While Cleese [i]is[/i] an absolute gem, he's not used nearly as much as he could have been. He gives you minor briefings before each new mission, and a small motivational speech before the tutorial. Cleese is fun, but short lived. However, the other FMV clips are amazing. I mean it. Even if you look them up online, you need to see them. After you complete a mission, you're treated to a short clip of someone dressed up as Hitler completely overreacting to what you did. I cannot describe how hilarious each of the clips are. There are plenty so that you almost always get a different clip every time. Every single clip make me laugh. They have to be seen to be believed.\n\nHilarious FMV aside, there's nothing to RAID. Each and every gameplay mechanic has been done so much better in PAYDAY 2.

I dont think i got shot once and i just watched.\nUnresponsive to inputs, for some reason no matter what sensitivity you play at your mouse is going to barely move. Takes at least three seconds before the game realises you have pressed the space bar.\nLike a dumbed down ripoff of Payday.

There's a ton of improvements here and there (being able to equip your melee, much more engaging and well, skill-based lockpicking, enemies that aren't quite as braindead as the ones in PD2 etc), if play this game expecting something along the lines of a AAA take on payday 2 set in WW2, you'll be disappointed.\n\nThat being said, the game is essentially like payday 2 but it plays differently in a few ways (IMO more-so on the lines of PDTH, can be good/bad), as a whole if you enjoy payday 2 and/or payday the heist, you will enjoy this game a lot. Gunplay feels akin to payday 2's gunplay rather than PDTH (which IMO is a good thing - PDTH's gunplay felt.... light? more-so weightless), all in all I recommend this game to anyone that has in the past played PD2/PDTH or anyone who knows what to expect. You have to remember, this is a studio that has literally existed for like 2 years and whilst yes, they work closely with overkill, it doesn't necessarily mean they 'are' overkill. They're a small studio and this is their first ever game made as that studio, you can't expect AAA-tier graphics or, anything else AAA-tier really.\n\nRegardless, a few negatives to take into mind.\n\nEnemy skins are quite lacking, not in the literal manner of how they look but there's not all that many enemy skins, and since they're all unmasked it's a little weird seeing the same face countless times in one single raid.\n\nOptimization. This is something I knew would be an issue since well, Diesel engine (before someone points out something like 'lol diesel engine in 2017', again, they're a new studio and this is their first game as that studio. Making a game on a new engine would be virtually suicide), all in all it's 'okay', better than I expected honestly but it needs work without a doubt.\n\nWeapons. I feel like there needs to be more of them and IMO there needs to be more upgrades. Some weapons have very few upgrades and as a whole it makes it feel linear, the selection of weapons on launch is pretty good but I feel it could do with for instance a couple more bolt-action rifles, a couple more weapons akin to the M1 Garand etc, just more variety. Another thing, some weapon sounds are very dull, they just don't sound 'beefy' enough though I figure this'll be something that'll change at some point since quite a lot of people seem to share the same opinion.\n\nAside from that, there's a ton of positives compared to payday 2, the fact weapons and skills and even weapon unlocks are class-bound makes it like what I imagine overkill intended payday 2 to be like (rather than everyone running meta, using effectively the same builds), weapon unlocks are based per-class (e.g. assault unlocks rifles faster, recon(?) unlocks bolt-action snipers faster etc) which I thought was a nifty little change. Furthermore the things I mentioned prior, how you equip grenades instead of just throwing them (allowing quick spamming of grenades, avoiding the 'oh shit' moment when you accidentally throw a nade in stealth etc) and lockpicking is IMO one of the best changes. PD2's lockpicking was just so bland, no matter how good you were you quite literally couldn't make lockpicking any faster, it takes something that was incredibly bland and made it well, engaging. Levels visually IMO look much nicer than PD2's maps but this may just be bias speaking since I've spent a fuckload of time looking at the same maps.\n\nTL;DR: It's like PD2 and PDTH had a child that veered off in it's own path with a lot of changes here and there that make it better than both games in different aspecs.
