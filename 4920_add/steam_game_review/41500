It has a much more simplistic approach than something like Path of Exile (another arpg I would recommend), so it's a lot easier to hit the ground running in this game and just enjoy it. You have 3 classes to choose from when naming your character, depending on what sort of playstyle you prefer. There are stat points that you gain as you level up (generally these should go towards your main damage stat and/or whatever requirements you need to wear your upgrades). You also get skill points, which are fewer in number, to level up different attacks, spells, and passive abilities on your passive tree. Once you figure out what you want your character to do, it's a simple thing to allocate points. \n\nThe artstyle is very much cartoonish; however it does not detract from the gameplay (unless you're the sort of person who gets hung up on that sort of thing). There are four difficulties to match your level of experience with arpg type games, so feel free to pick this up even if you're an inexperienced player. There is also plenty to do after you've beaten the final boss: like completing achievements, crafting endgame gear, and grinding higher level monsters.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun, single-player arpg experience, give this game a shot."}]}
