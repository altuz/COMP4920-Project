This system is the CORRECT way to make a FPS system with Unity. Highly recommended. I come from a development background of many years experience. These tutorials are excellent for no experience AND those of us with many years of game development experience. I rarely post reviews, but feel it is warranted because the quality of these tutorials and the system has blown me away.\n\nFurthermore, it's worth far more than the asking price. As others have mentioned, there are other guides that cost much more and don't deliver. The professionalism behind GTGD S3 makes it stand out. If GTGD S3 had a marketing department, it would easily be selling hundreds/thousands a month. \n\nHaving direct access to the original scripts has allowed me to save heaps of time with the debugging process. This alone is worth the cost, because even an hour of my time is far more expensive than the price of this package.  The videos are available for free on Youtube, so the real value is having access to the scripts for ease of debugging.\n\nI could go on, but for brevity will keep it brief. \n\nIf you want to learn how to make a stable, reliable, and efficient FPS system with Unity, this is a MUST-have.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506617876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "playtime_forever": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198379531254", "num_games_owned": 8}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1506620276, "recommendationid": "35267094", "timestamp_created": 1506620276}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 32, "review_score": 7, "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 32, "review_score_desc": "Positive"}, "success": 1}
