Very much like battle royale (2000), or the condemned (2007).\nYou travel around the island, fight other survivors and solve puzzles. You have a watch like arm-computer thing that counts down the other survivor's who will kill eachother as well, adding a bit of realism to it. but after it goes down to a certain ammount it will stop, and you will get a prompt that says enemies will spawn continuously because they haven't finished making the end part of the game yet. \n\nIt's not a complete game, but it's fun for what it is. And I do hope the dev's will get back to it at some point.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501793407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 266, "num_reviews": 21, "steamid": "76561198019923479", "num_games_owned": 227}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "2", "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503680", "timestamp_updated": 1501606071, "recommendationid": "33952822", "timestamp_created": 1501606071}, {"review": "My PC can't play this game, WTF?!..
