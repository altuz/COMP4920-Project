{"reviews": [{"review": "While not without some flaws, KByte has several of the elements that make a game that is pretty much its cousin, Life of Pixel, a good addition to any platformer fan's collection. You get sets of stages that more or less simulate different eras of gaming, and they present enough mechanical variety to keep challenges fresh.\n\nAfter finishing the levels with KByte, you get to try them again with GByte, which controls in a VVVVVV-ish manner by alternating gravity. I find it particularly commendable that the level designs work pretty well in this alternate mode, presenting their own challenges without really changing the layout.\n\nThe game controls pretty well, and most of the time they provide the tightness needed.There are problems here and there, though. Sometimes the characters may get slightly stuck, which maybe is part of a broader theme, which is that collision can feel strange at times. It feels like it's neither per-pixel nor per-object, floating on some middle ground which can be hard to judge.\n\nStill, it's fun an worthy of being played. Took me 9 hours to get to the number one spot in the rankings (as of May 2017), so maybe you want to try to give the leaderboards a go as well? :)", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1494976537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 522, "num_reviews": 20, "steamid": "76561198034831097", "num_games_owned": 400}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504705", "timestamp_updated": 1495871954, "recommendationid": "31991039", "timestamp_created": 1495871954}, {"review": "Actually pretty good, some well made levels here that are pretty chill.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1501024261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 152, "num_reviews": 46, "steamid": "76561198143519060", "num_games_owned": 234}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497557", "timestamp_updated": 1498199207, "recommendationid": "32667674", "timestamp_created": 1498199207}, {"review": "This is a game I completed to 100% (though I didn't get the 100% achievement owing to a bug, thanks devs) as well as being one that fits it's decription to a tee;  It is without question a game that is a platformer, that replicates different eras in games, as well as providing screen filters and suitable soundtrack.\n\nSo why I am not recommending it? Because it is dull as FUCK to play! Astonishingly so! Uninspired level designs coupled with the fact that yes, each area 'looks' like a different -bit era of gaming... but it doesn't FEEL any different! The physics don't change, nor the movements, nor anything. So it's skin template only. Oh, the soundtrack? So downright dreary and it doesn't change all that much either?\n\nIt's not the worst game I've ever played on here but it's definitely up there with the most boring.
