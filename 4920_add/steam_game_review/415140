I think I never got so much concentrated creative power per invested dollar from any other program.\n\nI managed to produce this in my first day and I can assure you that uses like 1% of the potential of the program. Like with any other tool of worth, you have also to put your own imagination into the \"How to use this feature\". So i don't promise you that you will be a pro PD Howler artist after 10 days. but every hour you put into learning PD Howler will be awarded with new ways to express your art.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=691560746\n\nAlso ... do you hate programs without documentation ? Me too. Many promising programs out there die fast due to lack of documentation. But not this one. The creators have a solid performance record over years of dedicated creation of videos.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/pdhowler/videos\n\nOk I worked some more with PD Howler. I saw many bad reviews. What is true, is that you really need to put time in this program. But I don't remember the devs claimed it is easy to use. If you have experience with Photoshop and 3rd party tools you will agree that the brushes of PD Howler alone, are possibly worth the 70 dollars. And the program has much more to offer.\n\nAlso I don't see why everyone always thinks that every program has to be a total jack-of-all-trades. While I understand that not all can afford a Photoshop, there is the free Gimp. To produce good art is not something you do in 2 days. You have to put time into your applications.\n\nI think this tool is a MUST in the program portfolio of a pro. However, be prepared to put months until you really master it. But then be fair ... how much time did you have to put with Photoshop and Gimp ? Especially Gimp is a bit like PD Howler, very unusual approaches. But can you live without Gimp ? Me not, I need it next to Photoshop. Same with PD Howler, I am now working with it since a week seriously, and already I can't miss it anymore in my toolset. \n\nHere my latest work after a week with PD Howler:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=692785160\n\nAddendum 1st December 2016: I wanted to mention that I still use Howler and am still happy with all its options.

There is a lot to offer here and you will spend hours just experimenting with  different animated transforms and filters on offer for the price it offers unlimited potential.\n\nThe cons are unfortunately the interface. Some things feel familar I suspect it is similar to deluxepaint on the amiga but I can't really remember. The menus are not layed out in very a logical manner so if you come from most visual effects packages the interface will fight you at every step in the beginning. I realize they had to cut out a lot of text to fit so much into one interface. Tooltip bubbles would be very handy and I still havn't quite grasped keyframing filter effects if that is possible. \n\nYou will eventually get the hang of the interface and it's well worth getting comfortable with it because the power at your disposal in this program is amazing I am still discovering new things. \n\nWorth every penny!", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1489480456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 93, "num_reviews": 32, "steamid": "76561198055572010", "num_games_owned": 226}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505524", "timestamp_updated": 1486538987, "recommendationid": "26335696", "timestamp_created": 1477919332}, {"review": "PD Howler 10 is amazing.

Your desktop icon will be replaced with the paint brush instead of the Howler dog and should now work.\n\nAs for the software itself PD Artist is a great assest as part of a pipeline. I believe those with more of an intellect geared for engineering will be able to use it standalone however some of the most basic manipulation principles, common in digital art applications, are hidden or applied in an obscure manner.\n\nDespite not being user-friendly for intermediates I can still highly recommend owning a copy as a tool to resort to when your works need much more fine-tuning or customized brushes.
