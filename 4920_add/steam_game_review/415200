I had around 60 hrs of Ups (and Downs) with it. Building up your Car, Team, Buildings, Drivers etc. can be a blast. Graphics are okay, the Sounddesign is very good.\nWhen you come from lets say a Football-Manager and are looking for a different Discipline, then you are golden with this Game. The Managementpart is superb!\n\nBut i come from the SimRacingside. If you think you can transfer your knowledge of Racing to this Game, be ready to be frustrated. Numberwise all the Things happening on Track might make Sense. But from a Drivers Point of View it feels like pure Luck or Misfortune (emphasis on \"feels\"!).\n\nThe thing that kills it for me is the Driver-communication.\nExample: Safetycar comes out; i needed Fuel and the Tires were worn so i Pitstopped. In the exact Moment the Driver is leaving the Pit he (or she) always -repeat- aaalwaaays tells me that the Safetycar is out (eeehm - thank you) and asks if he (or she) should take a Pitstop... while leaving the Pit with fresh Tires and a full Tank...\n\nAnother example is Weatherstrategy: again i need Fuel and Tires, go to the Pits and look at the Weatherforecast. I see that in the next Round it will start to Rain and it wont stop for at least for a couple of Rounds. So obviously (from the SimRacer-perspective) i choose Intermediates (or the Wet-Tires).\nBack on Track the Driver always complains about the wrong Tires. Yes they are wrong - but only for 0,5 Laps. \nDriving these Tires for half a lap in not optimal condtions slows you down much more in most of the cases then taking an additional Pitstop.\nAs i said: the Numbers calculated in background might make a mathematical Sense. But this is not how its working in Real- or Sim-Life. An unecessary Pitstop would cost waaay more Time.\n\nTLDR: If you are a Mangerplayer and like Motorsports - buy it. If you are a SimRacer looking for a different Racingexperience - stay away. I am a Sim Racer so i cant recommend it - sadly.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1504991312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3989, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198017427361", "num_games_owned": 77}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526229", "timestamp_updated": 1504998965, "recommendationid": "34848883", "timestamp_created": 1504998965}, {"review": "I really want to love Motorsport Manager. With mods, it's fun. However, it focuses almost solely on race management rather than team management. Sure, you can expand your base, but the staff you hire is limited to the drivers, a chief designer and two race engineers - and no matter how good your staff is, you absolutely and categorically cannot make a big step forward from one year to another in outright pace, because your best parts get carried over from the previous season, and the chassis don't seem to matter.\n\nAs is befitting of a niche game anno 2017, it does come with a bunch of features that remind you of freemium games, such as the design process for next year's car. Instead of having the chief designer do his thing with a set budget and whatever manpower you can hand spare him, you choose suppliers of parts, which then affect the chassis performance. Going for the best engines and expect your car to have more power than the previous season? No way. Engines only affect fuel efficiency and chassis improvability - the ability to improve your car with new parts the upcoming season. The only thing missing here really is microtransactions to further increase the base stat.\n\nWith Sega publishing it, I was kind of hoping for some Sports Interactive knowhow to somehow be funneled into the process - like Football Manager and Eastside Hockey Manager - games where you can spend tens of hours fiddling with your staff and tactics, and then spend tens more going through statistics for the last 10 seasons just because it's fun. Motorsport Manager lacks all of that. It's extremely superficial, and basically only does the racing simulation part well. Even this leaves you dumbfounded at times when the opposition deploys all of its battery power, which somehow magically results in a laptime 3-4 seconds quicker than anything else out there at the time.\n\nWhen it comes to team and asset management, it's severely outdone by the 1999 Microprose management game Grand Prix World - a game where an engine has ten parameters, not *one* overall stat - and you negotiate deals with fuel suppliers, said engine suppliers and tyre suppliers (because that was back in the days of good tyres in F1). Sponsorship deals were difficult to come by, they didn't come to you, like they do in Motorsport Manager. Hell, you even managed hospitality for the sponsors at each race in GPW. It's even got a modding scene releasing new season packs every now and then. And pay drivers. As if Marcus Ericsson would get paid to drive anywhere in real life (he does in Motorsport Manager.)\n\nIn conclusion - it's not a game I'd recommend, since it's lacking the depth not only of SI management games, but it can't even hold a candle to Grand Prix World which is due to celebrate its 20th anniversary in the near future. Motorsport Manager isn't bad, it's just not that great - personally I'd like the proportion of team to race management to be inverse.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1507143798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2620, "playtime_forever": 15023, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197990528919", "num_games_owned": 26}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521064", "timestamp_updated": 1505089491, "recommendationid": "34873845", "timestamp_created": 1505089491}, {"review": "First of all - this is a great game with \"just one more race\" syndrome. Absolutely worth recommending. \n\nI never was a motorsports fan, I watched F1 only when Kubica was in it and I never tought about tactical side of this sport. On the other hand, I am great fan of strategy/tactical/management/tycoon games and I WAS a hardcore Football Manager fan (to the point when SI lost a sense of balance between complexity and gameplay ca. 2012). But this game can easily introduce a newcomer (which I consider myself) to the basics of this sport which are behind the most exciting - racing part.\n\nThe races are the main part and of course most satisfying.

Not a game for those who want to jump in an kick ass fairly soon - you need to play the long strategy game. It took me 6 seasons after starting a new team, before I won both driver and constructor championship.\n[u]Positive[/u]\n[list]\n [*]Feels authentic. I believe that I'm really running a racing team.\n [*]Not too steap of a learning curve. In your first season, you might feel like you're doing something wrong because you come last in every race. You're not - you need to play the long game. That being said, pay attention to which parts matter most (engine and gearbox for Europe) across all the races, and improve those consistently.\n [*]7 seasons in, and I'm not entirely bored. Just got promoted to Asia cup, where I'm at the  bottom of the field have to work my way up again. An expected challenge!\n[*]For the most part the UI is cleanly laid out and uncluttered\n[*]Being unethical is possible - bribes, parts that risk being outside of regulation, obtaining part designs from other teams are also choices you can make. And you do get caught from time to time.\n[/list]\n[u]Negative[/u]\n[list]\n [*]Idiot drivers. You just get plain sick of their in-race chatter and dumb requests. \"Do we have enough fuel to get to the end of the race?\" after 5 laps. Of course you don't, the fuel tank isn't big enough to fuel the whole race. \"I'm not on the right tyres!\" That's because the weather is about to change. \"I need fresh tyres\". Not on the 2nd last lap you don't.\n [*]Slow transitions. Going into races, and coming out of races there are a lot of slow screen transitions. Do I really need to watch every number pop one by one on the driver stat improvement screen? I really don't know what devs think when they make these kind of choices.\n [*]Lack of key information in key places. All the info you need is available, just not on the screen you actually need it. The car parts that are most important for each track are shown when you go to the track, but not on the actual setup screen! Similarly, when choosing tyres you can't actually see your driver's smoothness rating. This gets really annoying really fast.\n [*]Useless green bars to 'guide' your setup. I don't know if these are supposed to be based on a mechanic's ability but they're pretty much garbage - several times the perfect setup is on the edge or past the edge of these, when you would expect to be somewhere in the middle.\n [*]Contract Negotiation - This is perhaps my biggest complaint, because it's the most \"unbelievable\" part of the game in my opinion. The issue is that there's no mechanic to negotiate contracts in advance for the next season. You can only negotiate and hire *now*. Which means you either need to fire the person in that current position, and pay their early terminination fee and pay to buy out the contract of the person you are hiring, or wait until after the last race. So you delay to save money and reputation, and then there's a big rush to get it done before season start, because the AI snaps up people really fast. You have to go through several days, sometimes weeks of negotiating with a prospect, before you hire them, but the AI apparently does not (or know the exact offer to get an acceptance first time). If you don't renew someone's contract in time, they leave and head to the unemployment line, instead of staying on a rolling contract at the same terms. Just give us a way to overlap contracts, yeah? Let contracts run out at the end of the season, and let us negotiate in advance for contracts that will start next season.\n [*]Pit stops - once you decide what changes and how much fuel etc. you can't change it, even if the car is still half a lap away. So many times I made a mistake, and wished I could go back and change it. Until the driver turns into the pit lane, we should be able to change our minds...\n [*]I'm at a bit of loss as to how the driver/mechanic relationships work. I can't seem to figure out what the pattern is with these going up or down after each race.\n[*]Setup loading and saving. The screen for this sucks. You have a long list of every setup for every driver for every track. You can't even sort the list. A filter to restrict the list to just those for the current race would go a looonnng way to improve this.\n[*]Tyre life - so sure, your milage will vary, but it took me some time to figure out that the expected number of laps for each tyre (in the tooltip) is if you run the tyre down to 0%. You never do that. At 25% left, lap times start to massively drop off and once you get down below 15% it's undrivable. So when calculating fuel loads and expected pit stops I have to mentally calculate the listed number multiplied by 0.75 to get actual laps that can be done on the tyre.\n[*]Refueling - The number of laps of fuel remaining, \"excess\" and \"low fuel\" indicators are useless, because they are based on some mid-range fuel burn strategy and not the current engine setting. If you have enough fuel that you will be 1/2 lap from empty by race end, you will still see the excess fuel message. Estimates at pit stops seem inaccurate too, so I always go one lap over than the recommended because in my first season I ran out too many times...\n[*]The rule voting is more of a distraction than of any real strategic value - most of the time you don't have nearly enough information to make an informed decision, and the changes in rules mean that getting promoted from one tier to another (or demoted) means you suddenly end up in a very different motorsport with staff that have skills that don't necessarily match what you need. The biggest of these is spec vs. developed parts. These votes seem to come up a lot and drastically change your direction - part development is the most important decision you have.\n[*]Speed setting - During practice, qualifying and race there are 3 speed settings. The game always resets to 1 at the start of session. 1 is really slow. The cars don't look like they are even racing, but rather going for a Sunday drive. 3 looks faster than real time, but is still too slow. I can't count the number of times I've drifted off waiting for 10 laps to go by and then missed a pit stop. Since the driver radio chatter is mostly useless, you ignore it. A faster speed would be great. Drivers telling you about being short of fuel 2 laps before (instead of randomly) would be helpful. Remembering your last speed setting would be really, really great.\n[*]Put money aside for next season - this is completely dumb, and must only be for the truly poor at math. Really, it's not hard to calculate how much money you can still spend so you end the season with 10m. Besides, you get prize money before you need to pay for your next season chassis etc. anyway. I always put this on the lowest amount and manage my own finances just fine...\n[/list]", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506900441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1421, "playtime_forever": 9754, "num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561198030816033", "num_games_owned": 53}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503180", "timestamp_updated": 1506909794, "recommendationid": "35216402", "timestamp_created": 1506404838}, {"review": "Good simulation of a racing team, nice graphics and very motivating.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1505545107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1515, "num_reviews": 1, "steamid": "76561198051296016", "num_games_owned": 69}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_updated": 1505545740, "recommendationid": "34989706", "timestamp_created": 1505545740}, {"review": "I want to like Motorsport Manager. I really do. The level of control over the car, the contract negotiation, the driver perks, the short and long term decisions are great.\n\nIt's biggest downside is how tedious and drawn out the races are.
