The second stage is the only one that has an ability, every other evo is the same as the first with a different picture (there is one other where you can hold the button down and it kinda sucks closeby things toward you a bit, it doesn't count), you don't even get to play as any of the more interesting creatures that you see.\nThe sharks B-Line right for you as soon as they spawn anywhere on the \"Map\", even on your face, insta-gibbing you and they don't stop spawning, ever.\nEventually you evo into a shark and the sharks still go after you.\nThen...... when you have eaten everything as a shark (since you have cheated with god mode) and you evo, what glorious thing will the ultimate creature evolve into?..... the starting creature.... and you loop from the start over again.... F you game.\n\n\"But its good for only $0.99\"\nNo, I played a very similer game that was actualy fun and fair, in 2003, for free as a flash game. here - http://www.xgenstudios.com/game.php?keyword=fishyclassic (High volume warning)", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "author": {"last_played": 1502889264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 63, "num_reviews": 46, "steamid": "76561197979969103", "num_games_owned": 234}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": 0, "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503476", "timestamp_updated": 1502891522, "recommendationid": "34276228", "timestamp_created": 1502890194}], "query_summary": {"total_positive": 55, "review_score": 8, "total_negative": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 66, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive"}, "success": 1}
