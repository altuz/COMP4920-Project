(ex: 4/5, 6/3). you simply NEED to go this way.\n\nanyways, this game is NOT as good as HS, but it has potential. give it a try, at least for the single player campaign.

As having no experience with other games of the genre, I can't really compare, but I can say that it was easy to pick up and learn initally, a fun challenge from a beginner perspective, and I can already see the depths to which I will have to hone my skills IOT actually \"git gud\".

For newbies, I would suggest you check out the communities web sites and read all you can about the game. Also check out the videos provided by the community and check youtube for videos about the game.
