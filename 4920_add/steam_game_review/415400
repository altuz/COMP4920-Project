It runs fine, and it's essentially exactly what you'd expect.\n\n[b]Progress Disclosure:[/b] I finished the first two dozen boards, which is the first three levels. I reviewed it so early because there were no other reviews; its window of new release exposure was closing, and it didn't deserve to miss sales on account of consumer uncertainty.\n\n[b]Observations:[/b] The \"tutorial\" consisted solely of a box of text; it was still sufficient, even having heard and read nothing about the game except the store description before playing.\n\nThe difficulty is fine so far; the first 6 boards averaged under 2 minutes each, and the next 18 took a bit over 4 minutes each.\n\nThe presentation is simple and functional. The art style is essentially all displayed in the marketing screenshots accurately.\n\nThe achievements look to be quite doable, so this game would probably be good for 100%ers. All of them are for simple completion; none can be missed, are timed, or even require perfect input.\n\nThere are no hidden in-game purchases.\n\n[b]Accessibility:[/b] The game never has time pressure. The interface requires enough precision to hit boxes of the size in the marketing screenshots without hitting the adjacent ones; it does not require dragging. The interface is fully mouse-driven. (It may support touch screens, but I don't have one.) There are no vital sounds. There is no dialogue written or spoken.\n\nLocked tiles are distinguished from unlocked tiles purely by color; that mechanic is optional, though helpful for remembering which numbers you're confident in. Some tiles are locked in the marketing screenshots, so you can check before purchasing if there's an issue for you.\n\nAs a non-expert, I see no other problems.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1484892392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 181, "num_reviews": 13, "steamid": "76561197978416407", "num_games_owned": 2111}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "5", "votes_down": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "votes_up": 52, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590463", "timestamp_updated": 1447988110, "recommendationid": "19138142", "timestamp_created": 1447809846}, {"review": "THE PUZZLE:\nCross Set is, as advertised, a game of logical elimination similar to sudoku. Each square has a list of candidate numbers from which you can pick, and the objective is to force each row and each column to contain exactly one of each number.\n\nUnlike sudoku, this puzzle format allows for more interesting thinking right from the beginning, because Cross Set does not necessarily need any of the squares to be fixed (though they can be). This shaves off some of the early \"fill in the obvious\" steps common to many sudoku puzzles. Unfortunately, limiting the choices by square appears to make the later \"finish filling stuff in\" phase come earlier. I find the puzzle format fresh enough to hold my interest.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE:\nThe software is very basic. Window size (and Windowed/Fullscreen) are options before the game boots, but there is no volume slider (only a mute button). Oddly, the fixed puzzle squares do not begin locked, even though all of the advertising shows them as locked. Hopefully this is some kind of oversight, as manually locking them just wastes about 10-15 seconds per puzzle.\n\nOVERALL: \nIt's an interesting new puzzle format with 64 puzzles included for $3.

Basically it presents a square grid of boxes, each containing a set of digits. Your task is to choose a single digit for each box so that no digit is repeated on a given column or row. Just like in a [i]Sudoku[/i].\n\nUnlike in [i]Sudoku[/i], the grid size is variable up to 9x9 and it is not divided into separately managed squares. Instead, the puzzle is constrained by the digits allowed in each box.\n\nMany of the same techniques as in [i]Sudoku[/i] work in [i]Cross Set[/i]. You can (almost) always systematically go through the whole grid to find the solution or at least lock in a couple of digits.\n\nDifficulty goes from simple (early levels) to challenging and time consuming (later levels) to nigh impossible (optional bonus levels). There are seven main sets (each with eight puzzles), one ultimate set with just one puzzle (set number 8) and two bonus sets each with eight puzzles.\n\nCuriously the difficulty is jumpy in each set because of the varying size of the grid. A set of eight puzzles always begins with a small grid but the puzzles get bigger until the halfway point of the set (puzzle number 5) where they start small again. I found it convenient to play through four puzzles of increasing size in a row and then take a break after the last, more difficult one.\n\n[h1]No drawing on the screen, kids![/h1]\n\nInterface looks clear and works splendidly. Left-clicking on a box will switch through the chosen digits and right-clicking will lock a digit to its place (or alternatively unlock it). Only three things I would have liked as improvements:\n\nFirst, I would have liked a way to mark a box with a different colour for testing a certain digit (e.g. to find a contradiction elsewhere). Second, sometimes a digit eliminates another in the grid and I would have liked a way to mark these numbers as eliminated so I wouldn't accidentally choose them. This would also aid in finding correct digits.\n\nThe worst oversight is the lack of saving feature within a puzzle. One can get around it by screenshotting before quitting but it's still cumbersome compared to proper save files. Good thing that all but the most challenging puzzles are short and can be done in half an hour at most.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nCompleting all the main puzzles (and therefore 100% achievements) was a task of almost 10 hours for me. Some of the puzzles were very challenging but none were unfair.\n\nI also tried a couple of the bonus levels. Admittedly they are meant to offer extra challenge after beating the rest of the game. However, for these puzzles the simple systematic approach doesn't lend many freebies and one would probably need a lot of the so-called advanced techniques to solve them.\n\nRegrettably I finally gave up after beating just a couple of the plus puzzles and none of the double-plus superhuman problems. They will probably always remain there mocking me and my inferior intellect.\n\nThe present price (3 \u20ac here) would be good even for half the content. I'd recommend [i]Cross Set[/i] especially for fans of casual puzzle games or alternatively as a light snack to play between more hardcore games.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1457910173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 613, "num_reviews": 135, "steamid": "76561198001046455", "num_games_owned": 7088}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508569", "timestamp_updated": 1458145724, "recommendationid": "21870939", "timestamp_created": 1458142530}, {"review": "It's a nice minimalistic puzzle game that basically revolves around the same concept that you see a lot in sudokus.\nSo that's positive, especially if you like these short puzzlers like I do.\n\nHowever , there are a couple issues: \n-There is no real difficulty increase/introduction of new mechanics as the game progresses, the only increase of difficulty is in grid size/possible number sets so you have to search longer to find your numbers, so you come into the game, do the tutorial, and the only thing that's left is 64 levels that take increasingly long to solve.\n\n-There is currently a bug with the steam overlay, that makes the game whitescreen , whenever a steam popup shows up, which is everytime you get an achievement or a friend comes online(and you get an achievement for every four levels you complete, very boring achievement choice imo).
