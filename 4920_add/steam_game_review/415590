Reminds me a lot of L4D & L4D2, and is one reason I like it. Very good ideas, my only real complaint is the AI and the low player base. Not many people playing this atm leaves you to play with the AI teammates who literally bullocks it all up for you by standing in doorways holding open your barricades, standing in front of your downed body and not picking you up or a downed teammate. Hope the AI gets better as the kinks get worked out, but all in all I really enjoy and recommend this to any Left 4 Dead fans. \n\nONLY Other things I feel need tweaked before leaving EA:\n1. SFX - A lot of SFX are either off their mark (reloading certain weapons sfx not starting when it should) or some sfx are just not there, or low quality (but it is EA so kinda expected) Being a professional Sound Designer/Audio Engineer these are minor issues but ones that pick at me every time they occur.\n\n2. BIGGEST tweak I see needed is the Melee combat, very clunky and not fluid, most of my melees tend to not even make contact when in any other game someone would of just lost a head. Hoping to see that get worked out so I can stop using Dual pistols. \n\n3. Not sure if it is part of the game, but many times i put up barricades, I will go to another area and come back to say 1 or 2 of them gone, jut disappeared with no one attacking them to brake them. So my once secured hold out room now is useless.\n\nThose 3 minor things aside, this game even in current state is ready to play and very fun. Hope more people pick this up so I can stop playing with lame AI that get me killed too often.", "steam_purchase": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "author": {"last_played": 1506185051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "playtime_forever": 634, "num_reviews": 23, "steamid": "76561198025301039", "num_games_owned": 99}, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "comment_count": "1", "votes_down": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505379", "timestamp_updated": 1502819463, "recommendationid": "34260589", "timestamp_created": 1502819463}, {"review": "Very good game.

Im a big LFD2 fan and yes this is a clone of it. Is that a bad thing? No. The look and the feel of the game is solid and the game plays well enough. It is rough in some areas but it is early access. I havent tryed multi player yet so I can't comment on that. I mainly play a game like this solo just for fun and I have to say while the AI bots are stupid there not as bad as Vermintide's AI bots and yes that is a bit diffrent from LFD2 and Earthfall. Playing Vermintide solo is alot harder than this. At the 15 price tag it's not bad.\n\n I don't think this will be the next LFD2. But I do hope this gets finished and dose well.
